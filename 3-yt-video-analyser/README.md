## YouTube Video Analyser

This section provides a prelimary experiments that we conducted on our COVID-19 dataset. We performed topic modeling using [topicGPT](https://github.com/chtmp223/topicGPT) combined with LLM summarization.

### Python Scripts:

- **`legacy`**: 
  - Contains some experiments of using BERTopic for topic modeling.
<!--   
- **`transcriber_real_.py`**: 
  - Pipeline for downloading audio and running ASR + SD on the full COVID-19 dataset.
  
- **`WER.ipynb`**: 
  - Jupyter notebook for evaluating the Word Error Rate (WER) of the ASR outputs.
  
- **`WDER.ipynb`**: 
  - Jupyter notebook for evaluating the Word Diarization Error Rate (WDER) of the SD outputs.

### Data Files:

- **`testtopdata`**: 
  - Ground truth dataset containing 28 manually annotated transcripts, reviewed by two independent annotators.
  
- **`Whisper-Nemo`**: 
  - Results from running `whisper-nemo-lib` on the 28 ground truth videos.

- **`Whisper-Pyannote`**: 
  - Results from running `whisper-pyannote-lib` on the same 28 ground truth videos.

- **`result_audio_files_BEFORE_COVID_large-v3`**: 
  - Transcription results using `whisper-nemo-lib` on the pre-COVID-19 dataset.

- **`result_audio_files_AFTER_COVID_large-v3`**: 
  - Transcription results using `whisper-nemo-lib` on the post-COVID-19 dataset. -->
