So it is five minutes to seven in the morning.  I don't know why I'm awake so early.  Well, I mean, I have an idea, but I'm just not happy about it.  I couldn't really get to sleep last night.  I was up later than usual.  And I think it's because today is a writing day, but it's also special.  writing day.  I think I'm just a bit nervous and excited and I got to sleep really late and I also woken up really early.  Like I woke up like before six and then I couldn't get back to sleep.  So I've just been listening to a bit of The Adventure Zone in bed and now it's time to actually start getting ready and stuff because I am heading out to meet Kirsty for writing day at 10.30.  So I need to get breakfast and get ready.  Happy vlog day.  I can see all the days, all the coming nights Big words and real thoughts, there's the part that screams your name.  Okay, um... So I just had a quick task to do for the Story Magic Academy there.  I had an Academy deadline that was pretty tough, which I actually had a project to do for it, and I finished that yesterday.  The deadline was yesterday.  So this is my first day of freedom post-deadline.  And... Yeah, I'm dressed and things but I woke up like really hungry and my appetite is just kind of gone.  Or it was gone.  And I just really didn't fancy eating any of the things that I have in my fridge right now.  It's about, what time is it?  Not even eight o'clock yet.  That's crazy.  Yeah, it's five minutes to eight.  And I am up and dressed and I've done my makeup.  It's crazy.  I mean, I guess I could just go in early and get some breakfast before I meet Kirsty.  What do?  What do?  What do?  So we're going to a coffee shop that I've not been to before, which is actually a roastery.  I actually used to work with... both of the guys that run that place.  I've never been there and it's a little bit out of the way and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to eat anything there because gluten.  So my safest option is to be well fed by the time I get there.  So gonna have to eat something.  Maybe I'll just have Weetabix.  Why am I so cranky now?  Am I just hungry?  I am cranky.  Mmm, my eggs are ready, my toast is unready.  Okay.  We're back on.  Okay, don't do it again, don't do it again!  I nearly just burned my toast twice in a row.  That's my alarm just going off right now.  That's how early I woke up.  It's going to sound a little bit batshit, but it's very exciting as well.  I've quit writing North at the end.  I've just decided, like some cosplayers say, I've just done with it.  And so today is day one on my new novel.  It doesn't sound batshit at all.  I never would have suggested to you that you do that, but I do think it's the right choice.  I am a bit sad that I do really like a lot of the characters and stuff.  I did that.  The first novel I ever wrote, I couldn't re-write it from scratch three times because I couldn't let it go.  like the core of it wasn't working but you kept trying to put stuff in it.  Yeah and like I actually made a ton of progress like with like I figured out what wasn't working and stuff.  but then I was like faced with like actually having to redo it all and I was just like this isn't worth it because I think it would still be a good book at the end of it but it's not worth it when my heart isn't in it anymore.  I think you've moved past it.  Yeah exactly I'm a totally different person.  yeah it's.  it reflects my interests and what I cared about like yeah.  you know, almost six years ago, which is crazy.  So yeah, today's day one, new novel.  So exciting.  Yeah, what about you?  That's amazing.  Oh, what's new?  What's a new novel?  Or do you like to not really talk about it until you've done it?  I did this whole decision-making process of, like, writing on the pros and cons, and finally came to this decision, and within an hour of doing that, I was like, cool, I know that I'm doing a novel next, and I know that it's going to be probably this thing.  She was saying, like, what does your novel notebook look like?  And I'm like, so this is mine for this novel that I finished.  Well, full-time teacher.  Right.  Yeah.  That took up a lot of time.  Yeah.  I'm like psychological model.  so I'm like.  I think it does work but I think it's because you think it works.  it's like being passed down to her or it's something that's in her family or that she has.  even it doesn't come naturally to her but she's taken a long time to learn how to do it.  yeah I think I want to.  I think I want to avoid the heritage thing because I feel like that's like almost a cliche at this point, Rhaise.  Yeah.  And I do just want it to be like, it's a craft like anything else.  I suppose the main question is like, what are people doing with it?  Yeah, I need to establish like, what can you do with it?  Yeah.  And what can you not do with it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Good evening.  I have just arrived home.  I went to a place called Dumpling Monkey for dinner for a treat but also because I don't really have much food in the house at the moment and I forgot to take a clip or anything or to take out my camera at all.  I was so focused on like just food now.  But yeah, so I'm home, uh, had a pretty good day with Kirsty.  Um, I started a brand new novel today.  Um, so I got my story seed put together and I chose, I kind of crafted my theme for this story and I identified the central conflict.  I made a start on some of the world building mechanics, cause it is going to be a fantasy story.  So there's going to be some magic and stuff.  So I'm pretty happy with that progress.  I could have gotten into the plot embryo today if I'd remember to bring a fricking pencil, which I did not.  But I think theme and conflict, so internal and external quadrants and a little bit of world building is pretty damn good.  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to continuing to work on this.  I'm pretty dang tired now, given how early I woke up and My period is on the way.  I'm just feeling a bit worn out and I'm really looking forward to just getting into my pyjamas and just having a super chill evening.  I have been watching and rewatching Supergirl, Gilmore Girls, Elementary, so I'll pick something nice and I'll just have Really nice, cozy evening.  But it's been a pretty good day and I'm really excited about this story.  And I can't wait to just like bash out a plot embryo for it.  And, you know, throw together a couple of world building mechanics and just like dive into drafting in probably the space of a few days since I had this idea for this story, which is really exciting.

It's not really a part of the main story, in that if you skipped this episode, you would probably still understand what's going on over the course of the season.  Sure, there's some stuff in the beginning you would miss about why the group had to split up, but that could easily just be incorporated into the beginning of the next episode.  Most of this episode isn't strictly necessary, but it's still really good, and I want to talk about why that is.  Because in storytelling, generally, you want everything to, in some way, advance the main plot.  It makes a story feel really well put together when everything is driving in the same direction.  Too many side stories going on can cause the story to lose its focus, but TV shows, given a set number of episodes per season, often have filler episodes to help them fill out the season.  Too many of these can make a show frustrating to watch, cause you feel like they're never getting around to the actual plot.  But in limited quantities, they can be a fun little break away from the main story, and in some cases, they can reveal things about a character that you never otherwise would have learned.  If it's not advancing the main plot, it can at least provide a new insight into why a character is the way that they are.  And that's what Katara's revenge storyline does.  Up until this point, we know that her mom died when she was young, but we don't know a whole lot of details about it.  So this episode gives us a look into her backstory, and that can help us to understand her actions better, which leads to a more satisfying show overall, because we know more about and care more about every character.  While the main story might be about Aang stopping the Fire Lord, the motivations and desires of the other central characters, like Katara, Sokka, and Zuko, are just as important to making the show feel substantial and well-rounded.  What this show could've done, though, was make Katara's search for her mother's killer an entirely separate thing from the main storyline.  That would've been the easy route.  It doesn't require connecting any pieces to the larger story.  But the episode doesn't do that.  Instead, the catalyst for Katara wanting to find her mom is her distrust of Zuko, which is absolutely a part of the main storyline.  From the start, Zuko was obviously Katara's enemy, as he went on his crusade to capture the Avatar and restore his honor.  But at the end of Book 2, Katara slowly began to trust him.  She thought that he had changed.  She thought that he would help them.  But when it came down to it, he betrayed them, allowing Azula to strike Aang with lightning, nearly killing him, and preventing him from getting into the Avatar state.  After that traumatic betrayal, Katara developed a strong dislike for Zuko, even after he had a change of heart and tried to come back and apologize to Aang, Katara, and Sokka.  It took a while for Aang and Sokka to trust Zuko, but eventually they got there.  Aang is kind of the master of forgiveness, and Sokka wasn't there in person for Zuko's betrayal.  But for Katara, because of the time she spent with Zuko before being betrayed, she couldn't bring herself to forgive him.  She had already started to trust him once, and he destroyed that trust.  It makes sense that she would be wary to trust him again, but it's also a barrier to accomplishing the protagonist's main goal of defeating the Fire Lord, because she has to work with Zuko to help Aang prepare for his big battle.  So the show needs to address that in some way, leading perfectly into the Southern Raiders episode.  There's already history behind Katara and Zuko going into this episode, which connects it further to the overall plot.  But when Katara snaps at Zuko and says he should bring her mother back from the dead, it's clear that her anger isn't only about his betrayal.  Her anger is about what the Fire Nation has done, and she still connects Zuko to the Fire Nation because he used to be on their side.  So Zuko, wanting to be a part of the group, decides to fix things by helping Katara get some sort of resolution there, hoping to prove that he is no longer on the Fire Nation's side.  Of course, it's not that easy.  When Katara learns that she could find the person who kills her mother, you can see something change in her.  Normally an upbeat, relatively peaceful character, she's suddenly serious and out for blood.  We get our first look at a Katara filled to the brim with anger and hate.  So angry, in fact, that we see her bloodbend.  The last time she bloodbent, she cried about it, hating the fact that she even learned how to do it.  For her to bloodbend now, in this episode, means that she's really reached a level of anger that we've never seen before.  We see a side of Katara that hasn't been present through most of the series, which gives her another dimension as a character, makes her feel more real.  Of course, the real moral dilemma of the episode is, should she kill the person who killed her mother?  Is it better to get revenge or to forgive?  In that regard, the show has an interesting answer.  that's kind of somewhere in the middle.  She can't bring herself to kill her mother's murderer, but she comes awfully close and has him begging for his life.  She doesn't fully explain her choice aside from saying that she can't do it, but it seems like the fact that he's not a threat anymore plays a role.  He's just chillin' in some tiny village in the mountains.  He's a horrific person, but he's not fighting back, not currently hurting people.  He's just a pathetic person, and she can't bring herself to kill someone like that.  And while that's an interesting moral dilemma and the climax of the episode, it's kind of a blip on the radar when it comes to the overall storyline.  What's more important in that regard is how it affects her view of Zuko.  Zuko supported her through the entire hunt for her mother's killer, and that did seem to mean something in the end.  Katara couldn't bring herself to forgive the murderer, but when thinking about forgiveness, she found it in her heart to forgive Zuko, because she knows that it's the right thing to do going forward.  This is a really important moment for repairing their relationship, because how else could Katara forgive Zuko after such an awful betrayal?  It would have to be through him taking high-stakes actions to help her, and from her having to sit and contemplate who deserves forgiveness.  This episode ticked both of those boxes.  Now they're able to work together to help train Aang and further the main storyline.  Not only that, but Zuko actually connects the whole thing back to Aang's journey.  Right at the end, Aang says that violence is never the answer, and Zuko poses a very reasonable question.  What are you gonna do when you face my father?  Aang is going to have to make a similar decision to Katara, except that instead of a helpless old man, it will be a tyrannical dictator who's trying to take over the world.  That's someone who needs to be stopped, but with Aang so staunchly in the forgiveness over violence camp, it's unclear how he'll actually be able to do that.  And his concern over this is examined through further episodes up until his actual battle with Ozai.  In this way, the Southern Raiders episode has big implications for the main storyline, while being its own self-contained story.  It shows us a new side of Katara that further fleshes out her character, gives us new information about her backstory, like the fact that her mother sacrificed herself to save Katara by pretending to be the last waterbender, it allows her to make peace with Zuko, and it foreshadows what Aang is going to face in later episodes.  It's as integrated into the overall storyline as a side story could be, and that's what makes it so strong.  If you wanted to cut down the season, you could take it out, have her forgive Zuko slowly over a couple of episodes, and get on with the main story.  But then you'd be missing out on a large part of who Katara is.  So this episode might not directly be driving forward the main plot, but it's an important story nonetheless.  In contrast to this would be something like Episode 9 of Book 3, Nightmares and Daydreams.  In this episode, Aang worries about how he's going to defeat the Fire Lord while Zuko gets a taste of life back in the Fire Kingdom.  It's a very important episode for Zuko's character, but almost everything Aang does could be cut without hurting the overall story.  Because even though Aang is the main character, worrying about how to defeat the main protagonist, this episode doesn't really teach us anything new about his character or change their situation at all.  Before this, he was going to try and defeat the Fire Lord, even though he doesn't know how.  And after this, he's going to try and defeat the Fire Lord, even though he doesn't know how.  He ends up in the same place without revealing anything new about his character or backstory.  We already knew he was worried about this, and him having dreams about his worries probably didn't need to take up a full episode.  That's not to say the episode is bad.  Every show is going to have stronger or weaker episodes.  But in comparison to the Southern Raiders episode, Nightmares and Daydreams seems a lot more like filler, despite its closeness to the main plot.  Because things that drive the story don't just have to be about Aang and the Fire Lord, as long as they can give us enough new information or move the overall story forward in some kind of significant way.  If Aang's worry had been because of something that happened to him in the past that we didn't know about, it could have made the episode more impactful.  or if he had discovered some method to defeat the Fire Lord that he didn't have in the beginning.  Because it doesn't do that, it feels a lot more like filler.  But Katara's revenge storyline gives us new information, deepens relationships between main characters, and puts Aang on a better path to defeating the Fire Lord, since his firebending teacher and waterbending teacher now get along.  All of this is just to say that even though I love this whole series, I think that Katara's Revenge storyline is one of the strongest side stories out of all three books, and I think it sets a good example for what makes a side story feel solid and meaningful.

So first off, my health.  In July and August I started experiencing a lot of gastrointestinal health issues.  I was in a lot of pain and I was having a lot of problems.  so I took two and a half weeks off and I focused on my health.  I changed my whole diet around and I started exercising more and I changed a lot about my lifestyle.  And I'm happy to say that I've pretty much got all of the symptoms of that in remission.  There have been two times since mid-August where I felt those symptoms come back a little bit, but generally speaking, I've done a lot better there.  That was like one of the first health problems I've ever really had in my life.  It was really scary and I wasn't sure what would happen, but I'm really happy to say that I'm feeling a lot better.  But if that wasn't a crisis enough, A month after that, Oregon ended up catching on fire, right?  So I'm sure you all heard about some of the wildfires.  Well, the air here was so bad.  It felt like I was breathing glass.  It would irritate me.  It was hard to shower because I had to take a mask off.  I mean, I was living in my house like using a KN95 mask and I had multiple air purifiers going and I vacuum sealed my windows, but it still wasn't enough.  So I ended up evacuating my home and I ended up staying in a hotel for a few days.  So I had to miss lessons and I wasn't able to edit or get any videos done during that time.  So it's been a really frustrating last two months, but I feel like I'm finally starting to get back to a normal pace where things are starting to happen on my end.  Now, through all of that though, I have some exciting things that I've been working on.  So first off, I have an apprentice.  There is now another teacher at Trans Voice Lessons that I'm working with and training and collaborating with.  Their name is Nick.  They are an agender individual who is highly capable of doing a good feminine voice.  a good masculine voice, good singing voice, and very experienced across the board with singing in particular.  I've been working with them and collaborating and training them in speech alteration, and we are going to be working together moving forward in the future.  One of the most exciting things that we are working on is a 12 week long intensive voice feminization class.  So this will be just like an online class like that you'd have in college or something.  And we will have 12 90 minute sessions and we will go over everything from top to bottom.  Both me and Nick will be teaching those lessons and we'll be playing off each other, splitting up into breakout groups and working with people individually throughout that process.  So I think it'll be a really great opportunity and it's a way that we can start to reach more people and create more availability while bringing the cost down and continuing to provide the best possible education in voice alteration.  Solutions like a group class or a course or a webinar are things that trans voice lessons is going to be moving more towards in the future.  We have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people waiting to work with us.  And unfortunately there is just very little availability.  So to try and increase the availability, this class will allow us to take on a lot more students.  The addition of a new teacher will allow us to take on a lot more students at a lower cost.  And we will be working towards webinars, which will be like open population themed long sessions, two to three hour long, maybe once every two months or so.  So we're going to be trying to increase our availability in a lot of different ways to meet the demand of everybody who needs voice lessons.  I put out my call for apprenticeship almost a year ago and I got tons of amazing submissions and I'm incredibly thankful to everybody who submitted their applications.  I'm extremely excited because I feel like I found the perfect person.  We communicate very clearly, we work together really well, they have helped inspire me and I've helped inspire them and our values are very in line with what we are trying to do.  Along with all of this new stuff coming from Trans Voice Lessons, I have a lot of exciting videos planned for the future.  It was very difficult for me to stay on top of video production in the last month, simply because of the wildfires plus my illness setting me back about four weeks worth of my work, okay?  So I'm finally starting to get caught up, which is why I'm making this video.  I'm really looking forward to get back to making YouTube content.  I have one really awesome video that's on my editing desk right now that I'm finishing up, and I have two more scripts that I've already made for new videos.  Additionally, I will likely do a live stream towards the end of this month, maybe on Halloween, so be there for that if you'd like to join.  And if all of that wasn't cool enough already, I'm really excited to give all of you a glossary.  I get a lot of comments on my YouTube video about people not understanding the terminology that I'm using or what I'm saying, and so here is a glossary to help with that.  This is a document that I've been working on for a while, Now, eventually, I would like to make this a multimedia glossary where there's audio files and there are pictures for most of the entries.  But unfortunately, I sort of fell off and I started focusing on other things.  So this is the current state that it's in.  It's like 17 pages.  There's a lot of lessons there for you to gain.  So please enjoy that and have that on me.  So thank you all.  So in summary, one, my health is doing a lot better.  Two, I definitely don't recommend to people to breathe toxic wildfire smoke for too long.  Three, I now have a new instructor and educator working with me.  Four, I'm gonna be hosting a voice class, several voice classes, starting in late December or early January.  Five, I'm gonna be creating webinars and other group lesson environments.  And six, now you all have a glossary of terms.  So thank you all so much for the support.  I will never be able to thank you enough.  So that's all for this video.  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please leave them down below.

So this is just a super quick little announcement, I suppose.  You may have noticed in my last couple of videos, I think, I have mentioned that I'm working on a workshop that I'm going to be running soon.  It's called the Story Toolkit Workshop and it's all about organising your writing.  In the last few years, I suppose, but really having come into its own in the last year, I have been working with a specific organisational system for how I go about my writing.  I definitely haven't always had a system, and so I've done the thing where you have a whole ring binder full of loose sheets of paper and a million post-it notes.  and you have no idea where anything is like disorganised notes on your phone with story ideas that you just never find again and never actually make it into the story because you can't find them again.  I've done that and I'm done with it.  so this story toolkit is the alternative.  it's what I've found that really works for me.  it is a system of four tools including writing bullet journal With some changes from the last few videos that I did a few years ago, um, which showed me doing writing bullet journals.  Was that, was that the end of a sentence?  Did I finish what I was saying there?  Who knows?  Yes.  So it consists of these four tools that keep me on track.  One of which is the writing bullet journal.  Um, and I am running a workshop.  Teaching you guys what they are and how I use them and how you might want to use them.  So that's all I'm here to say is that, um, you can register for that workshop.  Now it's going to be a live workshop hosted on zoom.  So we're all going to be on the meeting together.  Um, and I'll be presenting and, uh, teaching you guys, uh, all the workshop stuff.  And then we're going to have a space for questions and stuff as well.  Um, so there are at the moment, there are three different times that you can choose from.  Um, so if you head over to the registration page, you can pick a time that works for you.  Yeah, that's about it really.  Um, the story toolkit system is really just designed to help you get from the stage of having ideas to the stage of having written those ideas.  As quickly and easy and easily as possible, because if you don't have a system in place that works for you, um, or you're not really sure what you're doing, it's very easy to get stuck at different stages during that process.  There are a few things that I've learned, which have really, really helped me, um, and are really speeding up my writing process.  So.  I think I've rambled enough.  I think I've covered everything.  This workshop is going to be happening.  Uh, I was going to say next month, but it is now July.  So it's this month.  Um, and you can sign up for it now and I hope to see you there.  And I think it's going to be a real good time.

It's not a joke.  I'm a legit snack.  Like many of you, probably, I spent my time watching the Good Place finale just weeping, bawling my eyes out like there was no tomorrow.  It was so powerful and emotional, but most of all, it was satisfying.  It managed to tug on each and every one of my heartstrings, and then it just ended.  While wiping away my tears, I felt calm in a way that I haven't after watching other shows.  That was really the end, these characters' stories were really over.  It made sense.  But why did this show, this comedy show, nonetheless, make me feel so much?  And why was it uniquely satisfying when it ended?  That's what I want to talk about today.  Step one, get a plan.  Step two, do the plan.  Yeah, yeah, this is working.  First off, I think a key driver in the success of the Good Place finale is the fact that it was planned to be the ending.  Far too many shows are dragged on for season after season, trying to be squeezed for every ounce of content that they can produce, even when they've long since left behind their emotional core.  If The Good Place had to run for ten seasons instead of four, the finale might not have the same impact.  Those extra six seasons would have to be filled with something, and that would likely involve killing off characters, or reinventing them, or bringing in new characters who the audience cares less about, all of which would lessen the emotional impact the finale could have.  Plus, the audience could just lose interest by that point, tired of a show that has abandoned its original premise.  But because it only had four seasons, The Good Place was able to propose a concept, work with it, and end it in a fitting way.  They didn't have to find some wild excuse to drag it out for more seasons, they just got to tell the story as it was meant to be.  In a similar vein, because they knew the show was ending after season four, they could give it an ending that it deserved.  When shows are canceled before they even know that they're canceled happy endings, they can't have a fitting ending because they're trying to set up the next season that they thought they had.  Since The Good Place knew ahead of time that it would be ending, the writers could give all of the characters the send-off that they deserved.  The key is in knowing when the core of your story has run its course, and then being able to have the time to wrap it up properly.  The Good Place thankfully nailed both of these things.  Another reason the Good Place finale was so weirdly satisfying might seem counterintuitive, but it's because there was no longer any external conflict.  For the first three seasons and most of the fourth season, the Good Place had external conflicts driving the characters.  Whether it was Eleanor trying to hide the fact that she didn't belong in the Good Place, or everyone trying to save humanity from being rebooted, there was always something or someone to be fighting against.  On one hand, I would love to get some spiders in those buttholes.  On the other hand, there would be billions of buttholes going completely unspidered.  But in the finale, the central conflict is gone.  The protagonists have won.  They're in the good place.  Humanity has been saved.  And their new system for getting people into the good place is running smoothly.  And so the finale is all about internal conflict.  Instead of the finale being the climax of the series, it's the falling action and the resolution that comes after the climax.  On a show that's normally about 20 minutes long per episode, it's a nearly hour-long reflection on what happens after the end of the external conflict.  It poses the question, we did it, now what?  And that's what makes it all the more powerful.  When you've spent so long in short, snappy episodes fighting against a visible enemy, a longer episode that slows down and has the main characters reflect on themselves has a lot more meaning.  In a different show, that could have the potential to be boring, but the Good Place finale is definitely not.  And that's partially because they still squeeze plenty of jokes and laughs into the last episode.  Shut up.  I'm confident now.  But a lot of it is because of the next point, which is, every main character gets nuanced emotional resolution.  We've been with Tahani, Jason, Chidi, and Eleanor for a few seasons now, and as an audience we've become attached to them as we've seen them grow and change and bond.  They've all had conflicts with people in their lives or things about themselves that they've wanted to change, and a large part of getting to the finale was about them changing and coming to terms with those things.  So now that they're here, in the real good place, the finale is about wrapping up everything that they've gone through.  Tahani meets with her parents and her sister and has the happy relationship with them that she has always wanted.  Chidi becomes decisive and learns from the best philosophers and has a fulfilling relationship with Eleanor and his family.  Jason does all of the fun stuff he has always dreamed of while working on his relationship with his dad.  And Eleanor helps Michael realize his dream of becoming a human.  It's the payoff that we've been waiting for since this group of friends got together.  The show takes its time and allows us to spend a few minutes with each of the characters, figuring out what it is that they need before they can pass on.  It even grapples with the idea of what happens to those that we leave behind, when Chidi is ready to move on before Eleanor.  heartbreaking in some ways and heartwarming in others.  We can understand that people would get bored after an infinity of being happy and doing everything that they could possibly want, but we still don't want to say goodbye, and we certainly don't want the characters to have to say goodbye to each other.  So the ending is bittersweet, but it offers a level of emotional resolution that other shows don't by having the characters hash out these things between each other, wrapping up every last loose end before they say their goodbyes.  Not to mention that while they're saying goodbye to each other and working through their emotions about saying goodbye, we're also saying goodbye to them.  It's rare in a show for you to get to say goodbye to the characters, because most of the time they don't know when they're going to die.  But with the premise of a portal that you walk through when your time in the afterlife is over, we have time to say goodbye to the characters that we love.  So when Eleanor begs Chidi to stay, you get it.  You want Chidi to stay, too.  This journey is about the characters saying goodbye, but it's also about the viewer saying goodbye, and that draws you into the story and keeps you emotionally invested in a way that other shows might not.  I hate to see you walk through the final door at the edge of existence, but I love to watch you leave.  This whole premise of characters choosing when they want to move on from the afterlife is something that is unique to the plot of The Good Place and wouldn't work in most other shows, which is the fourth reason the finale works so well.  In The Good Place finale, we get a cosmic happily ever after with these characters.  that wraps up the story in a way that would be much more difficult for a story told only with living characters in the real world.  In any regular TV series, the main characters likely end up with some sort of happy ending, Even if it's not a typical they-got-married-and-rode-off-into-the-sunset type thing, they probably reach some sort of resolution with their conflict and move on to a more calm existence.  But they still have lives after that.  There's still the potential for things to happen and change in the future.  even if the story doesn't hint at that.  Another series could follow them when they're all grown up, or follow their kids, or something along those lines.  There's normally some semblance of hope that those characters or that story could come back.  But the Good Place finale is next level in its finale.  Eleanor, Chidi, and Jason have ceased to exist.  Not even just died, but completely stopped existing.  Tahani is working as an architect, Michael is a human, and Janet will continue existing forever because she's not a human.  But for all intents and purposes, the story is over.  We can assume that one day Tahani and Michael will also step through the portal and stop existing.  Janet, as we're told, experiences the past and the present as the same.  So for her, she still gets to be with her friends, even when they're not around anymore.  And that's really as final as it can get.  There's no coming back from passing on after the good place.  no one's getting resurrected, nobody has any children, this story is done.  And I think that's one factor in why it feels so satisfying, because you know it really is over.  It's all of that together that I think made the Good Place finale so satisfying.  It ended at the right time, it turned the conflict internal, it gave everyone emotional resolution that allowed us to say goodbye to them, and it gave them a cosmic sort of happily ever after.  It's a unique combination of great storytelling techniques that are handcrafted to pull all kinds of emotions out of the viewer.  I'm still reeling from it all this time later, and if you've made it this far in the video, I'm sure you are too.  So thank you to the folks behind The Good Place for such a satisfying ending.  And now, I think the only way I can end this video is with some wise words from Michael.  Take it sleazy.  Thanks so much for watching, everyone.

All right, goblins?  I'm just trying to think of a new catchphrase for you.  Hey, everyone.  All right, goblins.  All right, goblins.  That's the fucking great stuff.  So, number one on my list of worst things about living together is... Because you try to film a video and your girlfriend just suggests that you say alright goblins to everyone.  How was I to know you were filming a video?  Because I said I'm going to film a video and then I sat down here in front of the camera.  What if someone steals it before I film my next video?  It's too bad.  You have to make your next video very quickly.  That's fair.  All the biggest YouTubers are watching this and gonna steal All Right Goblins.  Real intro.  Hey everyone, I'm Riley.  Today I'm gonna be talking about some of the best and worst parts of living together with my beautiful girlfriend who's off screen.  Say hello, Fiona.  All Right Goblins.  She's busy with work.  so she can't be in my video, but I'm still gonna bother her because we're in a studio apartment and there's always so far away from her I could get, so you're in this video whether you like it or not.  Woo!  So I've made a list of some of the best and worst parts of living together, um, sapphic edition, women who like women edition, queer edition, I don't know, something like that.  So like half of this video is gonna be really cheesy, gross, mushy stuff, and the other half is just gonna be me roasting Fiona, so... But before we hop into that, I want to tell you about this video's sponsor, the Dollar Shave Club.  So this is the Ultimate Shave Starter Set that they sent me.  And inside it basically has everything that you could need for shaving.  You've got this handle, which is really great and sturdy and heavy.  And this starter set comes with two of the razors and the restock box ships with four of them.  But they've got really high quality blades and they feel super good against your skin.  but genuinely like i love these razors so much um i have a bunch of them with us.  we're in vietnam right now traveling and they're the only razors that i've brought.  they're the only ones that i've used.  they're super great like they just feel so good against your skin and i just love them a lot.  but i also use them and they're really good.  yeah she uses them because she steals all of mine.  you could at least when you're done rinse them off and get the hair out of them.  Yeah, that's pretty gross of me, won't lie.  Yeah?  I use them regularly, and I suck at cleaning them, and they're still really good, and I still go back to them.  That's fair.

Okay, so I am going to start off with one of the worst things just because I'm currently sitting in it right now, which is that there is hair everywhere.  There's so much hair because we both have long hair and we have like a white tile kind of floor.  And it's just every day.  there's like piles and piles of hair on the ground.  And I'm currently like sat in it.  And if I move anywhere, there's like 500 hairs hanging from everything.  honestly gross.  it's pretty gross.  i don't know why you're with that now.  anyone who watches like a minute of the video is gonna know.  i think it's relatable.  anyone who has long hair has to know how much it like sheds as much as you.  i do shed an impressive amount like most of the hair i think is mine yes But it's definitely compounded by the fact that it's both of us.  There's a lot of hair.  So if you have long hair and your partner also has long hair and you try living together, you're going to be constantly picking up clumps of hair from the ground and sweeping it.  It's only happening here because it's all tiled.  Yeah in our last place we had like darker floors and parts that were like carpeted or had rugs or whatever and we did not clean it as much.  and now I'm kind of grossed out thinking about how much hair was just there that we didn't see.  Because here it's just so visible because it's like light tiles and stuff.  I'm okay without grossness.  okay but one of the the best things.  this is really cheesy but it's so nice to just wake up and have some cuddles every morning like you don't you?  you know?  it's just.  it's right there.  you wake up you get a little cuddle it's great.  yeah the cuddle is right there you just you wake up you're all sleepy you just.  it's so nice like you.  don't get that when we're long distance because we were long distance for a couple years and it was just lots of no cuddles.  It was really cute.  It was really cute.  It's really nice.  It's a good thing.  Okay, so one of the best things is also kind of a drag at Fiona.  Well, because for you, you have someone who does the dishes and the laundry and hangs up your towel.  I imagine it's really nice.  It's like... have your laundry get done and you can just kind of take a shower and throw your towel wherever and it just gets hung up and dries nice and perfectly.  if you're living with someone who cleans up all of your stuff.  that's the best part is it not?  is it not nice?  This is a nice one and a drag.  That's just a drag.  It's a nice one for you.  It's the best part of, is it not the best part of living together?  She knows I'm right.  If you're broke and you're in a studio apartment, you just don't really have a private space.  We're always up in each other's business.  You're super well off and you have like a five bedroom apartment and you can just go hide somewhere else and like have your own area.  That's cool.  but we're mostly in studio apartments as we're traveling.  And it's just, it's tough to not have your own space.  Like if one of you is listening to something, the other one's listening to it too.  Like if you want to have a phone call, the other person's there for it.  You're just always kind of involved in each other's stuff.  No more secrets.  No more secret life for you.  Yep, because we both had really involved secret lives before this.  One of the best things is you always have someone to play Mario Kart with, or, I don't know, whatever other game people play in their lives, but for us, it's always Mario Kart.  It's just, I don't know, if you're feeling tired at the end of the day, if you just want to have a little thing to do, you get to play Mario Kart at the end of the day, and it's really nice.  I like it.  That's, like, that code word set me up.  I want to play Kart now.  Now you want to play Mario Kart.  I'm like, how long does this video get to take?  We can play after my video, if you want.  No.  No?  So long.  it is really nice to like like.  i like playing games on my own but there's something different with like being able to just sit down with my girlfriend at the end of the day and play a little mario kart and like chat about our days but also have fun playing a game.  it's really nice.  oh one of the worst things but i think this is us specific is that i want the temperature inside to be like hot all the time and fiona always wants it to be super cold and i like it to be quiet and she likes it to be really loud like she's always playing a tv show or music or something and so we just have very conflicting ideas of what our space should be.  We always say that I want a loud ice cave and you want a silent sauna.  A silent sauna.  It would be nice.  Yeah.  So we have to kind of, we've like made arrangements about like when someone has to wear headphones and like we'll have one area of the room like colder and one warmer if we can.  Like if there's like an air conditioning or a fan or whatever.  Or I can just put a goddamn jumper on.  I don't like to wear a million jumpers at my own home.  It's like 95 degrees out and I have to wear like a sweater and sweatpants in my own home.  One of the best parts is that you get to get pets together and start a little family.  And we haven't done that yet, but we plan to get so many cats and dogs and I'm so excited.  We're gonna have so many adorable animals.  That's such a perk of living together that we haven't got to have yet, but I'm really excited for when we do.  One of the worst parts of living together for me, you're fine here, is that I get to wake up to Fiona's first 500 alarms every morning because she sets alarms like every 10 minutes for like an hour and then does not wake up for any of them.  So I wake up for all of them and then I get Fiona's attention.  I'm like babe your alarms are going off and she's like turn it off for me.  and just goes back to sleep and so for like hours.  sometimes I just keep waking up or I wake up at the first one and I can't go back to sleep.  you're fine you're snoozing through all this.  if your partner sets a million alarms and you're the only one who wakes up for it I'm sorry.  that's that's the worst part of living together.  yeah no rebuttal.  yeah no rebuttal.  this is very cheesy but one of the things i really like is having calm uneventful moments together because when we were long distance and we were together it was like we had to be doing stuff all the time because it was like you only have a week or two with this person.  but now i just really like.  i like when i don't know nothing's happening like we're just together and like eating breakfast together or just both chilling on our phones on the couch like it's just sweet like we just get to be together and like nothing's really happening but we're together.  i like it.  Thank you.  Okay, I've run out of worst parts, so another best part is that you always have someone to scratch your back or give you a massage when you need it.  True.  Yeah, that's some good shit.  I do, I'm gonna make the most of that.  Yeah, it's just, you need, you need, it's not the same to scratch your own back, and you can't really give yourself a massage, so it's a really nice perk of having someone around.  Okay, I've got a couple more best points, though.  This one is pretty specific to us, but it's really nice to have someone to, like, travel the world with.  I wouldn't be traveling through this many countries on my own for so long because I think I would get lonely, but because I have Fiona, I'm able to go to all these cool places and do a bunch of cool stuff.  yeah pretty dope.  and last one at night when we're not playing mario kart i have someone to watch shows with and like react to them and stuff.  because when i watch shows on my own it's not as entertaining for me to yell at the tv by myself but when fiona's there and i get to yell at the tv and get her reaction back and we get to talk about it it's really fun like we've been watching sherlock lately because i never saw it as it came out and it's really fun to talk about it and like i don't know just disgusting to re-watch shows with you because your reactions just You're so into it.  You always record my reactions and you don't need to.  I have amazing tips for you to put in the video.  No.  Literally, like, you cannot handle any kind of awkwardness.  Ah, there's so many awkward things.  Like, the show we were watching the other day, anytime a show has, like, people sitting around eating a meal and it's just silent and you just hear the clicking of their fork and knife and stuff, it's so awkward.  It's always like, oh, everyone here, there's such a tension in the room and they don't know what to talk about.  And it's, oh, why do they ever have scenes like that in shows?  They just shouldn't.  I think that's everything.  That's all the best and worst parts of living together that I could think of, although I'm sure there's like a million more that I just didn't think of.  Thanks for partially being in my video, Phi.  You're welcome.  In the comments, let me know if you live with your partner, what are some of the best and worst parts of living together?

I imagine this video is a bit of a surprise to some people who don't follow the channel on either Facebook, Twitter or Patreon.  Then again, maybe not since I've been gone for the past several weeks.  Which is really what I wanted to talk about.  Where I've been and why there's been no new content.  So, here it goes.  On Tuesday the 24th of March, my family lost a beloved member to COVID-19.  My great-aunt Nell had been admitted to hospital on Sunday the 22nd with the virus and double pneumonia.  I was actually on a call with my mum finding out about her hospitalisation on the 24th when she received a message from my aunt, who lives in the Netherlands.  Neither of us seemed to want to end the call so she could check it as we had a good idea of what it meant.  One of my cousins was there with Nell in the hospital at the end to ensure she didn't die alone.  Apparently she looked up, smiled at him, and closed her eyes.  My aunt assured us that her passing was as peaceful as the doctors could make it.  Of course, this has put my cousin at risk of the virus, so there's that to worry about now.  Thing is, it didn't just end there.  My great-aunt lived with her brother.  It was just the two of them alone in the family farmhouse, meaning that his chances of catching it at some point aren't particularly great.  What's worse is that due to a straining social infrastructure, my aunt and her family are having to look after my grandmother, meaning they can't visit him to help him through the grieving period as it'd mean they couldn't help her.  There was a bittersweet resolution to this in the fact that one of Nell's friends has also started coming down with the virus, meaning that she can be there for my great uncle during this time.  Thankfully I have Adita with me and my brother was down at the time visiting my mum so nobody else was isolated from family.  But it's still been really hard on all of us.  Nell was the closest a person could come to being pure of heart.  She really couldn't say no to people and as a little kid that allowed me to get into all sorts of trouble.  One time when visiting family in the Netherlands my mum had dropped me off with her so she could do some shopping.  Later she came back to discover me in a muddy pit in a rather jovial Nell since Nell hadn't been able to refuse me buckets of water.  Thankfully my mum saw the humour in the situation and immediately stuck my then toddler self in the shower and it's one of the memories we still have.  She also loved baking, especially waffles.  I don't mean a dozen or so.  I mean, whenever she knew we were visiting, she'd make several batches and send us home with a literal bucketload.  So many we'd actually have to freeze them just to have them over a longer period of time.  It was a really big thing for my mum, who of course lived in the UK with none of her family outside of me and my brother.  It was just that little taste of home cooking we all enjoyed.  And I'm glad that the year before her passing, just shy of a week in fact, all of us, including Adita, travelled to the Netherlands and were able to see her.  Now there's more.  that's happened since I sat down and initially wrote this, and it's not good news.  None of it is good news.  But it's stuff we as a family are not quite ready to come out about at this time.  I've shared with you what my family in general has agreed to share publicly on the matter, so please, no questions on the matter.  I know I share a lot of stuff I've been through personally, but please respect privacy of my family in this regard at this point.  Thing is, as hard as this is to say, this isn't the only thing that hit me hard that day.  That morning I had a session scheduled with my therapist, the one who's been helping me tackle my PTSD.  And as some of you know, I've been working on a video relating to autism, which has been an experience.  Autism is something that many of the people I know have told me I should get tested for, but I never have.  I always focused on it as, well, it was one person pointing out one thing, that doesn't mean anything.  But when I found myself 7 for 7 for the Common Traits of Autism on the Autism Self Advocacy Network's page, I started to consider things a little more seriously.  I talked to Maddy from The Last Nerve, formerly Objectively Subjective or The Goddess Eye Womb.  They sent me a couple of clinical tests and I scored within the range for potential autism.  So I decided I might as well schedule a session with my therapist, asking if they had knowledge of the subject, and we could use the session to discuss it.  They said yes to both.  I was expecting to go in, discuss the veracity of the tests I'd done, discuss some of the symptoms, and reach a plan as to how to advance from there.  That did not happen.  Instead, my therapist spent the first half of the session lecturing me on a lot of stuff I already knew and didn't see the relevance of to argue why they wouldn't do that.  They said a lot of stuff I still need to talk to them about, because honestly, I wish they'd just told me up front that they'd rather concentrate on my PTSD when I booked the appointment.  I felt like I'd been baited and switched, and that left me feeling worse coming out than going in.  After talking to both Maddie and Levi about the whole thing, began to write up my thoughts to discuss them with my therapist.  But then the news from the Netherlands reached us here and that just took over everything at that point.  It denied me the immediate ability to try and respond and resolve things.  I feel very much lost at sea in this regard.  On one hand, I felt like my questions had been completely ignored.  On the other hand, I didn't want to push the matter, as I feel like that'd be me trying to secure a diagnosis when that's not what I was after.  I'd have been fine if we'd just gone through things and they'd concluded I'm not autistic.  but what they'd instead just left me very confused about my whole position.  Here I am writing a detailed article on autism, it turns out I might be autistic, and that has an impact on how I write and interact with others.  I mean, I made a post on the 2nd of April since it was Autism Speaks' main fundraising day, just listing many of the issues I'd come across.  It was not meant as a comprehensive guide, but rather a heads-up for my viewers.  It had sucked for them to donate to Autism Speaks, only for me to come out and tell them that it was a mistake thereafter.  Well, turns out the autism community likes the post.  A lot.  And they ran with it, sharing it more than 7,000 times and giving it 10,000 likes, which is great!  I'm really proud and honoured that you like my post and it fills me with a lot of hope for the video.  But here's the thing, with that came the debates, the discourse, and I'm just sitting there having my feed blow up with everything including people asking questions of me, questions that I don't know if I really have the right to weigh in on.  As I told Levi in one of our calls to keep each other company and later work on the script, I felt like Schrodinger's autist.  I'm both autistic and not until I can find a therapist willing to discuss the topic, which is a rather lighthearted way of describing just how adrift I really feel.  So you can hopefully imagine how starting with that in the morning and then losing a loved one in the evening could just overwhelm someone.  I will be trying to resolve things with my therapist on that, but right now I wake up feeling physically drained.  like the blood is pouring from my arms and legs.  It's possible that there was a degree of miscommunication, and had I more time to think about what had been said before the news of our loss had made it here, I'd have noticed something and seen things in a different light.  But whether that was the case or not, that doesn't change how everything just came together in the situation and how it's impacting me in the now.  So yeah, that's why everything shut down for a little while.  I just needed to get some of that off my chest, as well as update those of you who don't follow the channel on social media.  Part of me tries to face things with humour, specifically the fact that every time I tell myself I can take a rest, that things are done, life just throws the next thing at me.  But honestly, it's just pretty difficult right now.  The video on autism is recorded now and it is coming out, but I don't even know if I'm going to have it done in time for Autism Acceptance Month.  I mean, I planned to have this thing done and out for the beginning of the month and it just\u2026 everything just totally knocked me\u2026 it just\u2026 yeah.  I'm not in a particularly great place right now, is what I'm saying.  I don't feel like I'm achieving anything and that's just frustrating me and making me go harder on myself and it's just this vicious cycle going round and round.  But, um, yeah.  I am working on things and I just wanted to give you that update and let you know where I am both physically and emotionally.  So I guess I'll see you around.","channel.id":"clxmi0qha03srcdvizorbrtrp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCmFJ77PwU4PD4Im3s9kiWCg","channel.name":"EssenceOfThought","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVV4yEm1r9yCEmYRauRYtlLJb2PJpsoF5-bjlsbMA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, I'm Peter, also known as Ephel.

I just have to bring him home. He's in my heart and he's, he's our kid.  Like he is our kid.  But when you meet your child, Your child is a totally different child.  I imagined Huxley to be this like shy, sweet, I don't know how to explain it, but I just imagined this like shy little guy who just wants to be held and cuddled.  And that is the furthest thing from the truth.  He couldn't get any cuter if he tried.  Like seriously, look at this face.  Do you like my glasses?  Do you wanna wear them?  Hey Timmy, let me try. Oh wow.  No, he said no, no, no. No more.  Come on, let's go.  You're not going to throw a fit when you don't get your way.  Are you done fitting?  Are you done?  Are you all done?  Huxley has had multiple meltdowns.  We're not having a good day today.  We never tell you guys the truth.  And that's why you don't see Huxley that much.  Are you done?  We are going to be doing a stem cell for Hux.  It is missing part of his brain.  We're hoping to do a stem cell treatment on Hux, which is very pricey, but hoping to get a treatment done on him that could help regrow some of that brain material. You know, with international adoption, sometimes there's unknowns and things that are not transparent on files and things like that.  And once Huxley came home, there was a lot more special needs that we weren't aware of. I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit in his medical needs.  He needed more. We haven't made this video yet.  It's because we've been trying to protect his privacy, his rights, and also just try to not mess up his future that was laid out in front of us.  We're trying our best to make sure we don't impact that at all. So there's been this story going around about this blogger who re-homed her autistic child that she adopted from China.  Some of you guys know that I am adopted and I have a lot of feelings and thoughts about this.  So I wanted to kind of come to you guys and have a conversation with you guys and sort of put my voice out there into the ether.  So to bring you guys up to speed, there is this blogger named Micah Stauffer and she is a mommy blogger and she really became popular when she was making videos about her international adoption.  She adopted a child from China and I believe she has about 37 videos or had about 37 videos about this particular child.  She became really, really well known for these particular types of videos about this particular child.  And recently she made a video with her husband where she talked about rehoming him because he has autism.  There were a lot of unexpected things that came from his having autism.  In the video, she basically infers that there were some things that happened between Huxley and her biological children that made her feel like they needed to rehome him.  It is not particularly uncommon that a family will adopt a child and they will find out that that child is not a fit.  That does happen, right?  It doesn't usually happen after three years.  Now, listen, you guys know me.  I like to sort of look at both sides.  I say that things are not usually In my view, black and white, they're usually undulating sort of shades of gray.  But this was one of those cases where the more I looked into it, the more upset it made me, the more it pissed me off and the more it made me want to talk about this issue that I have in general with these YouTube family channels and also just the culture that comes from this.  So the time of me filming this video, let me see how many subscribers Micah Staffer has.  She has 713,000 subscribers.  Let me look at her views.  She usually gets about 80,000 views per video.  Let me see about her videos about Huxley if they're still there.  So she has several videos about Huxley and they're clearly one of her more popular videos on her channel.  Most of these videos have over 200,000 views.  Some of them have, you know, probably at the very least 40,000 views.  And, you know, I'm just going to say I've had a pretty good month on YouTube and I know what comes from getting these views.  And I know that she's been able to make quite a bit of money.  She's also done a lot of sponsorship deals, which I also know makes her quite a bit of money, especially since she works with larger corporations.  And so long story short, her... Adopting this child was a big cash grab for her.  For me, looking at this, this was clear cut her adopting a child for the aesthetic, adopting a child for the views, adopting a child so that she could get clout.  And I find it disgusting.  I find it to be absolutely disgusting.  Now, this is gonna be the little portion of the video where I talk about this, because this is what really upsets me.  I've been on YouTube since I was 15 years old.  And I'm very thankful that when I had my little 15 year old YouTube videos up, I was not popular.  YouTube was not what it is now.  Most of those videos are not well-known videos where I would have to live with them for the rest of my life.  My issue in general with people who bring their children onto YouTube is that those children without even, you know, before they even have an ability to really think for themselves or advocate for themselves or decide what they particularly want are now characters on YouTube.  Let me tell you, there's a lot of my life that is permanently affected by the fact that I have a YouTube channel.  There's a lot of things I can't quite do because I have a YouTube channel.  And, you know, I've taken that.  I've accepted that.  I've embraced that.  That is what it is.  I love my job.  But I have such an issue with people who bring their children onto YouTube without fully thinking through what the repercussions could be for that child long term.  This kid was adopted so that she could have a vibe on her YouTube channel.  And not only that, it was documented.  And now this kid who's only four years old is the focus of this new story.  And that kid's going to grow up and have all of these complicated feelings about that.  I was adopted by a family who ultimately didn't want me because of things that I was born with and I didn't choose them.  I didn't choose this family.  I didn't decide this is who I want to be with.  They adopted me.  They put me in front of a camera, right?  They decided that they wanted to do these things and then they decided that I wasn't worthy.  Now here's the thing.  I think a lot of people looking at this story could say, you know what?  It's not totally unreasonable for her to rehome a child who is difficult.  But here's the thing, you know, if you're going to adopt a child, you need to be, you need to be in a position where you are ready for anything because that's what being a parent is.  So I'm adopted.  I don't really necessarily get along very well with my family for a lot of reasons, which we won't get into in this video.  But there's one thing I know for a fact, as hard as our relationship has been, I still for a fact know that my adopted parents would never want to stop being my parents.  My little brother and I are both adopted.  His mother had a lot of complications when she was pregnant with him.  He's had developmental issues for his entire life.  He still lives with my parents because of this.  I watched my parents take my little brother to therapist upon therapist upon therapist, doctor's office, doctor's office, doctor's office, and they never quit.  They never quit on him because they made, when they saw that little kid in the foster home, They made a decision that they were going to be his forever parents.  They made the decision that we're never going to give up on this kid, regardless of how hard it may be.  My parents don't have a ton of money.  They never quit on my little brother.  These people regularly in their videos, because I've watched quite a few of them at this point, flaunt their wealth.  There's one video that people are talking about where, you know, she's, she's wearing this thousand dollar watch while asking her followers to help give money so that they could raise money for Huxley.  Oh, side note too.  This is, this is, this is the, this is the cream on the cake.  After she rehomed him, we're now finding out that she went and took a, did a trip to Bali.  Basically what I'm saying is that these people have money.  Money.  They have the money.  They just don't want to do it.  They've got the resources, but they don't want to give them to Huxley.  A lot of kids who get rehomed are rehomed because when really looking at it, either it's not a fit or there aren't enough resources.  They didn't really estimate the resources correctly.  They have resources.  One of the things that she talked about was Huxley would get out of the bed at night.  They could hire somebody to sit there with the child at night and sleep in the same room.  If they wanted to find a person to come in and take care of the kid, to watch the kid, to sit with the kid, to make sure that they get the kid's homework done, even to sit with the kid, they have that money.  They just don't wanna do it.  I want people to stop Having and adopting children if they're not ready for those kids to be completely different than them, to have thoughts and ideas that are completely different from them, to maybe not totally be the picture perfect child that they want them to be.  I need y'all to stop doing that.  Because what you're doing is you're setting the foundation for years of trauma and abandonment issues.  Shit that no one wants to experience.  Nobody wants to experience feeling like because of who you are and how you were brought into this world, you're not worthy of love.  And we can sit here and say, no, it was this, no, it was this, and maybe there's a point there, but that's how the kid's gonna feel.  You know, this YouTube shit, look, I love it, I love it, but we've seen a couple of times now how these parents will exploit their children for views and for money.  And I haven't spoken really transparently about this, but I've been a YouTuber for all of my adult life and There is an underbelly of the way that we're using the Internet now.  that makes me deeply, deeply uncomfortable.  I don't think people totally have processed how unhealthy some of this is, how unhealthy it is for children to be published on the Internet, especially with what people do with images of children on the internet.  It sickens me.  The fact that someone would adopt somebody for money, that someone would use them for sponsorships, solicit donations from their followers that they do not need and that they know they don't need.  It is this otherworldly bleak bullshit that I have, even I have a hard time processing.  I have a hard time processing it because it's so dark.  It's so dark.  We're using children to make money.  And while we're doing that, we're putting out and projecting images that damage these children, that put them in positions that they don't need to be.  We're in the beginning of all this, right?  Give it 10 years.  Give it 10 years.  these kids are going to come out and say how much this messed with them and it will be too late.  People will look at people like Mike, Mike and staffer and say, well, I want my kids to be on, on YouTube too.  Part of why this me off too is.  I know that part of it is she spent all of this time building up this kid she was adopting from China and then when she adopted the kid, Well, the kid wasn't willing to tap dance on camera, wasn't willing to be cute the way that she wanted on camera, wasn't willing to fit into the aesthetic the way that she wanted on camera because he has autism and he's an actual person, not a doll, not an actor.  Now I know that some people look at their families these days as businesses, but that's not the way you should ever look at your family.  You should look at your family as the people you take care of, the people you want to bring up, the people who you would go to the end of the earth for.  And the fact that you weren't willing to do that, Micah, the fact that you were willing to quit on your child like that.  and repulses me.  I'm so thankful that I had adopted parents who said, we're going to love our child.  It's not always been easy.  And I've got a long list of issues with my parents, but they're my parents.  And I know that they would personally feel, they would personally feel like a piece of their heart, a piece of their soul is missing.  If I were to ever call someone else, my parents, I think she's a little too happy to talk about Huxley's new mommy.  You know, I only saw one tear fall from her face during the whole, the whole video.  I know that deep down inside, I mean not even deep down inside, They feel relief for not having this kid around anymore.  And that's some sick shit to me.  That's some sick shit.  Putting your kid back into the foster system after three years.  Again, kids get rehomed.  That is a thing that does happen.  Sometimes a family is not a fit.  That's not something you usually establish after three years.  After three years of integrating your biological children into this child's life, Treating them like your kid breaks my heart.  It really breaks my heart.  I think I said what I want to say.  I'm sure I haven't said everything correctly.  I'm sure I was crass in this video, but this shit really got under my skin.  This shit really got under my skin.  Being adopted is so confusing and can be so frustrating and so alienating.  And to very publicly have someone, you know, make all this money and solicit all these donations because of you.  And then to give you up because you were too complicated.  You can't flaunt your wealth and then act like, you know, it would have been too much for you to get somebody to help.  Because there's nothing wrong with being a parent and acknowledging that you need help.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Please stop adopting children when you're not ready to take care of them regardless of how they turn out.  Please stop.  You are really helping no one by doing that.  So anyway, I will talk to you guys next time.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0oqh02kncdvicaxc7qeq","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxFWzKZa74SyAqpJyVlG5Ew","channel.name":"Kat Blaque","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJWT7XDNz1Vl0sA7fBPrC4jkoFJO34GYvdMQlqX0Vg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker is discussing a YouTube blogger, Micah Stauffer, who adopted a child from China with autism and later rehomed him after three years.

It happened over the course of about five and a half years and I've got all of it well documented with audio files.  So we're going to start from about five years ago and we're going to listen forward to now.  now a bit of backstory about me.  um i started playing music in 2004. i got super into music.  around like 2006.  2008 i was studying a lot of music composition and sound design and i started getting into music theory.  at that time acoustics was like absolutely fascinating and riveting to me so i was focusing a lot of my attention on music and acoustics.  i ended up entering university and studying music composition in 2010.  I graduated in 2015 and that is when I began my transition and I started changing my voice.  All right, so the first one that we're going to listen to is from March 25th, 2015.  This is completely my dead voice.  There is no alteration to this.  I hadn't even begun practicing voice.  I wasn't even out yet.  I wasn't even out to myself.  So let's go ahead and take a listen to that. Greetings and welcome to my favorite sound of the day with me.  Today we have my own trumpet playing with valve tremolos and lots of delay and reverb.  With valve tremolo. I can't even do that anymore.  Oh, that's so gross.  I can't believe I ever sounded like that.  Listen to that.  That's like so... I have another one here.  Listen. Today we have my Yamaha acoustic guitar bowed with a bass bow.  The guitar is tuned to an open D minor 7 add 6 tuning or DAD FBC. That to me is absolutely crazy.  I can, if I try to sound like that now, uh, the guitar is tuned in D-E.  I can't even come anywhere near that amount of vocal fold mass.  I don't know how I ever did that to begin with. Today we have my Yamaha acoustic guitar bowed with a bass bow.  The guitar itself is tuned to an open D minor 7 add 6 tuning or D-A-D-F-B-C. That's about as masculine as I could really ever sound.  So there's my starting place, okay?  Two months after that, I came out and that finally gave me the environment to start practicing my voice more realistically.  So this is my first attempt at a feminine voice, okay?  So this is from May 25th, 2015 and this was about a week after I originally came out.  So let's take a listen. I've been playing a lot of Stella by Starlight lately.  I've been practicing vocal stuff really high, like all the way up to D5 up to G6.  That's not that high.  I'm just going to read a little.  Philip Glass, American composer, studied at Peabody Conservatory.  Vocal stuff like... Okay, right away, I'm doing this thing.  This is a thing a lot of beginners do.  They hear that the voice needs to be thinner, and so what they try and do is they over-abduct.  They don't quite make enough vocal fold contact.  And then as they're over-abducting, they actually bring their false folds in.  So you end up with this kind of like... You end up with that kind of sound.  So I was doing that my first attempt. High, like all the way up to D5 at the age of 8. At the age of eight.  There's so much false focus restriction.  There's like so little closure.  Oh my God.  And the resonance is like not even moved.  The first clips that we listened to were two months before that.  This was my real first attempt.  Now this next voice is from July 30th, 2015. Classical thinkers employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry.  Poetry. Once again, way too much abduction.  I'm barely abducting the vocal folds at all.  Too little contact.  Now this one, my pitch went up a lot, right?  So we can see I started bringing pitch into the equation, but I still didn't quite find the right way to do thinness with my voice.  I still sounded a little too airy, a little too grainy. namely the existing fragments of aristotle's poetics. poetics and my r1 is super low quality of poetry.  that's like a classic low r1 trying to sound thin sound the quality of poetry.  if i change the r1 the qua the quality of poetry right.  so it's a lot different if i fix it.  so very interesting stuff there you know.  listening back to these recordings i really do think a lot of the beginners watching my videos can learn a lot from these.  these are common beginner mistakes that i made and everybody makes.  we want to make sure that we have good closure with our vocal folds.  we want to make sure that we don't have false full constriction and we want to make sure that our resonance is up okay.  Now, around this time, July 30th, 2015, I was getting ready to start touring a lot with my band.  We were about to go on the road for three months that winter, so we started practicing, my band picked up, and we started doing a lot of that stuff.

She's a 12 year old blind girl with incredible earthbending skill who makes the show more lively and fun with every episode she's in, all while beating up countless villains.  But on top of that, she also plays a huge role in saving the world, so much so that I think Ozai may have won the war if it hadn't been for Toph.  So in this video, I'm going to explain why that is.  This is how Toph's earthbending saved the world.  Toph is Aang's earthbending teacher, and so without her, Aang wouldn't know any earthbending.  Everything that Aang knows how to do in regards to earthbending was taught to him by Toph, and it was a very difficult process.  In the world of Avatar, air and earth are kind of opposites.  Air is the element of freedom, of spirituality, of evasiveness, of letting go of earthly attachments.  Whereas earthbending is literally about being grounded, being persistent, being strong, and facing your problems head on.  Airbenders are taught to avoid conflict, to use their abilities to dodge attacks and keep their distance from their opponent.  Earthbenders, on the other hand, are taught to stand their ground and fight their opponent directly.  Learning earthbending meant that Aang had to completely change his way of thinking and his way of approaching conflict.  That's not an easy thing to do, meaning that from the get-go, Toph had an incredibly hard job.  And she didn't have anyone to help her, not like how Katara had Master Pakku or Zuko had the dragons.  So Toph was the youngest of Aang's bending teachers, didn't have any help, and had to teach Aang the element that was the most difficult for him to learn.  I mean, Aang did have that mental block when it came to firebending in books two and three, but in the first book, Before He Hurt Katara, Aang had no problem producing fire.  He was full of passion and drive, the things that fuel firebending.  Earthbending, on the other hand, was just antithetical to everything he was taught growing up.  Toph didn't just have to get him to move past one mental block to access the ability he already had, she basically had to completely rewire his brain to think about approaching problems in a different way, which is no small task.  Despite all of that, Toph put in the work and succeeded in teaching Aang to become a very skilled earthbender.  I'd even say that because Aang had such a difficult time learning earthbending, it's likely that without Toph, Aang never would have learned that element at all, because who else could have possibly gotten him to change his way of thinking so drastically?  So, with all of that in mind, I want to talk about rock armor.  This is one of the earthbending moves that Aang learned from Toph.  In the episode Bitter Work in Season 2, Toph makes an armor suit out of rocks and leaves an eyehole despite the fact that she's blind.  I've heard that the art book for The Last Airbender explains this, and the real reason is apparently just that it was a mistake by the animators and it wasn't caught in time, but I like to believe that Toph did it intentionally because she was trying to teach Aang about the rock armor, and he would need an eyehole if he were to try it for himself.  And, in fact, he does later do this when facing off against Azula in the Crystal Catacombs beneath Ba Sing Se.  Not that it helps very much.  Azula kinda knocks him right out of it pretty quickly, but the rock armor does make a return in a couple different forms in Book 3 when Aang's facing off against Ozai, and in that fight it is a lot more important.  That's because Aang's battle against Ozai basically determines the fate of the world.  If Aang wins, the war is over, but if Aang loses, Ozai will wipe out the entire Earth Kingdom.  And in this fight to save the world, Aang's earthbending skill is by far the most useful.  When Ozai blasts him with fire from close range, Aang quickly makes a layer of rock armor to protect himself from the flames.  This time, he doesn't make the eyehole, which was definitely a smart move that prevented his face from getting burned to a crisp.  But if he hadn't known how to make the rock armor at that moment, Ozai would've annihilated him, or at the very least, severely burned him.  even if he had managed to put up a little air shield at the last second.  Ozai was just way too close to him, and we've seen that there's limits to how much fire he can deflect with airbending.  The even more important form of the rock armor, though, comes soon after that, when Aang retreats into an earth ball armor shield thing, a skill which he must have learned from Toph, and this part is crucial because it doesn't only protect Aang, it also allows him to unlock the avatar state when Ozai breaks the rock armor ball and hits Aang's back against a protruding rock.  I'm still a little unclear on how or why exactly this unlocks the Avatar state.  Like, his chakras were locked, right?  Because he was shot with lightning when in the Avatar state?  If your chakras are locked through injury, can you just unlock chakras with a sharp hit to the site of the injury?  Why did no one tell him that earlier?  And didn't he have to let go of Katara to activate the Avatar state, but now he can be in the Avatar state and be with Katara?  How?  Why?  I love this show, but I'm still pretty confused about that.  plot thing.  But anyway, that rock hitting his back is crucial for Aang.  It allows him to unlock the Avatar State, which allows him to turn the tide of the battle against Ozai.  Without the Avatar State, let's be real, Aang probably would've been killed by Ozai.  He was on the defensive the entire time before that.  Things were not looking up for him.  And Aang was only able to unlock the Avatar state because he put himself in that earth ball.  I can't think of a way he could have used another element to do that.  The closest I could think of would be if he protected himself with an air bubble, which he kind of does for a split second right at the end after Ozai has blasted away his rock ball, but the impression I got from this scene was that the rock behind him only started to erode, revealing the little back pointy bit, because Ozai was blasting it with fire for so long.  Like, the whole thing is that Ozai kind of doomed himself by causing the thing that unlocked Aang's avatar state and ultimately led to Aang being able to defeat him.  So for Aang, being in the Earth Ball allowed him to take the hit for long enough that the wall could be eroded, exposing the part that hit him in the back.  If he had just made an air bubble shield and then been blasted back into the rock, he would've just hit a flat rock wall since the fire hadn't destroyed large chunks of the wall yet, since it seems like his air bubble can't hold up for very long against that level of fire.  Maybe I'm interpreting that scene wrong, but that's at least what it seemed like to me.  Which would mean that without earthbending and without Toph's very skilled instruction, Aang would never have been able to access the Avatar state.  From then on out in the fight, Aang is in the Avatar state, so he's able to bend all four elements masterfully thanks to his past lives.  So there's no real influence here from Toph.  But when he refuses to kill Ozai, that's when another key part of Toph's teachings come into play.  The first part of this is that Ozai tries to attack Aang from behind, which he senses by using the same earthbending ability that Toph uses to see.  We even see the black and white earthbending sensing animation that we've only seen Toph use before.  As far as we know, Toph was the only earthbender in the world at the time who had this skill.  So she must have taught it to Aang, and then it saved his life.  If Aang didn't know earthbending or had learned earthbending from literally anyone else, he probably would have died here.  Who knows, maybe if he hadn't learned that skill, he wouldn't have turned his back on Ozai in the first place.  But at least with how the scene plays out here, Toph's earthbending instruction really saved Aang's life.  And that's not even the only time Toph's earthbending saved Aang.  Earlier in Book 2, Toph very literally saved Aang's life single-handedly by holding up an entire massive underground library while it was sinking with Aang still inside of it.  And then he got mad at her when Appa was kidnapped at the same time that she was saving his life, even though she did everything she could!  And I understand his frustration, but I don't remember him ever apologizing to her for that, which is pretty messed up.  But anyways, that's a bit of a tangent, let's get back to the fight with Ozai.  So after Aang senses Ozai's attack, he uses earthbending to subdue Ozai in a way that would not be possible with any of the other elements.  With his arms pinned out to the sides like this, he's unable to effectively fight off Aang, which allows Aang to do the little forehead touchy thing that takes away Ozai's bending.  If Aang didn't have that earthbending, arm pinning move, I'm doubtful he would have been able to get close enough to Ozai to be able to take his bending away.  Because fire and air certainly don't pin down arms very well, and if there was conveniently water nearby , and Aang had frozen Ozai's hands to his sides, Ozai probably could've just melted through them.  So not only did the earthbending that Aang learned from Toph allow him to unlock the Avatar state and save his life, It also gave him the opportunity to be able to take Ozai's bending away.  Without that earthbending, he probably would've been back on the defensive again, running away from Ozai, unable to get close enough to do the forehead energybending thing.  So without Toph's instruction, or with instruction from someone else, Aang might have lost against Ozai.  He might not have unlocked the Avatar state, or avoided Ozai's attack, or been able to take his bending away.  might not have even been able to learn earthbending from anyone else, since it was so difficult for him to learn in the first place, and it was only through Toph's unique teaching style that he was able to master it.  Without Toph's earthbending skill or her skill at teaching earthbending, Aang very well could have lost against Ozai, which would have allowed Ozai to continue his war, to continue burning down the Earth Kingdom.  And on top of all of that, while Aang is fighting Ozai, Toph is busy dismantling the entire fleet of Fire Nation airships using metalbending, a type of bending that she invented.  Sokka and Suki definitely do their part as well, and they're great, but without Toph, they wouldn't have even been able to get on the ship in the first place.  And even if they somehow had managed to get on the ship, they definitely wouldn't have been able to take out all of these firebenders by themselves.  I mean, just look at how Toph wipes the floor with these firebenders who are super powered up by Sozin's comet.  They don't have any idea how to react against her metalbending, and she takes them all out in seconds.  It's incredible.  And then she just straight up bends the rudder of the one ship so that it destroys a bunch of others.  That's just so cool.  Toph's skill in taking down these airships is amazing and probably saved a ton of lives, since the airships were on their way to torch a bunch of Earth Kingdom villages and cities.  So not only did Toph teach Aang the earthbending he needed to save the world, but she also used her earthbending and metalbending to save countless lives while Aang was doing the big fight.  Toph undoubtedly played a massive role in saving the world, even if she wasn't the one directly fighting Ozai.  So that is how Toph's earthbending saved the world, and why Toph is one of the best characters in the series.

So that means it's time to move on to chapter two, which is the role of fear on your journey.  So yeah, let us begin that one.  Embarking on the journey to discover your gender identity might be one of the most important challenges you undertake during your lifetime.  Understanding why it is so challenging can help it become more manageable, simpler, and less overwhelming.  Fear.  Why does it have to be there?  We all hide.  In other words, repress, as we psychotherapy types like to call it, essential parts of ourselves that we might have been taught to be ashamed and or afraid of.  Our unconscious takes care of repressing these aspects for us, and it is actually really good at it.  That's because our unconscious thinks its main job is to keep us from harm.  When we were children, our unconscious helped us push down anything we believed to be too shameful or wrong about who we really were.  We did this by tossing these thoughts, feelings and memories into a heavily padlocked trunk that resides in our psyche.  We then threw it into the deepest ocean we could find.  We thought if we got rid of the trunk and everything in it, then somehow our lives would become easier and everyone would like and accept us.  Here's the thing.  The ocean that you threw that trunk into is your unconscious.  This means the trunk and all of its contents have been with you all along.  You may or may not remember creating this trunk of secrets.  You may have begun the process of filling the trunk at a young age, or you may have been older.  You might have just a few things in it, or it could be completely stuffed.  Regardless of your story, it's very likely there's at least something in that trunk that needs to be looked at.  It could be causing you anything from confusion and uncertainty to paralyzing fear and distress.  The presence of fear means you're getting closer to discovering something about yourself.  This is because we oftentimes fear the unknown, and it is unknown as to what you will dig out of your trunk of secrets.  Calling out your fears.  The trunk of secrets you will uncover through the use of this guidebook are the ones having to do with your gender identity.  This doesn't mean other trunk secrets won't come spilling out during the process, but it's less overwhelming to focus on one at a time.  In stage two reflection, you're going to look at when you first began to feel conflicted about your gender identity, what happened to you, what happened as you became more aware of this, and why you ended up having to put those thoughts and feelings into that trunk.  For right now, let's reach into that trunk and nudge that secret just a little bit.  Get out your pen and paper.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Embarking on the journey to discover your gender identity can be a challenging and overwhelming experience.

So did I. Okay, do you want to just run through the song again? One, two, three, four.  Chloe?  Oi, Chloe? Oh, hi, Chloe. Hi, Penny. How are you?  Just fine, thank you. How was the book club without me? We missed you, as we would, of course.  And how was your conference? Oh, the teacher's conference was really good, actually, yeah. Oh, I'm so glad to hear it. Good to see you.  Bye-bye.  As I said on the radio this morning, you know, it's like, to me, and I think just about everybody else, it's completely obvious when these so-called trans women come and pretend to be women, and it's always so incredibly obvious to me anyway.  What do you think?  Yes, yes, yes, I completely agree.  I mean, it's the two really critical points for me.  One, you can always tell when a man is pretending to be a woman.  Second, they just will never, ever experience what we experience in terms of male violence and discrimination.  That's what holds us apart.  Good.  Okay.  Well, see you later at the meeting, sweetheart.  Bye-bye.  Oh, hey, how are you this morning? I just overheard your conversation on the phone and it made me very uncomfortable. I'm so unhappy to hear that.  What was going on? Well, it was the way you talked about trans women.  You can't just generalise like that. Well, sorry dear, but I mean, is this an area of your expertise?  Is this something you know a lot about? What can't you tell?  I thought you could always tell. My goodness.  It's just become clear.  Now I can see that you have been lying to me all this time. Do you think I just mention it to every single person I meet that I'm trans? Well, maybe you should.  I mean, I'm not just any person.  I'm not just any person.  Remember this.  I thought we were good friends. Oh, so we're no longer friends because I told you I'm trans. I let you into my home.  I let you into my life.  For God's sake, I even fed your cat when you were away. And what has that got to do with it? Well, you've quite obviously, what you've done is you've deceived me into thinking that you were a real woman. What, do I look like a robot?  I'm obviously a real woman. You were not born a woman.  And so you'll never really know what it is to be one. Really, Penny? Yes.  Really?  Because bottom line, real women don't need to pretend.  to be women at all. Oh, and in what way am I pretending? You just don't know what it's like to be a woman.  Not really. All right, Penny.  So tell me, what makes a real woman? Well, for starters, it's about fertility.  It's the body itself.  A real woman bleeds every month. Not all cis women are fertile, nor do they menstruate.  Does that make them any less women? Well, women are oppressed and sexualized by men because of, fundamentally because of their natural bodies. I was just telling you yesterday how I was groped at that school fundraiser. Yes, but you wouldn't even know what it's like to birth children.  You can't birth children.  This is an essence of being a woman. Neither will you, Penny.  You haven't any children. I don't think that you're fit to work with children in the way that you do.  It's taking in your delusions and your frankly mental illness into the school. The 80s called and they want their homophobic logic back. I'm very much thinking now of reporting you for all this deceit because it's just not right. You have turned into the worst neighbor that I have ever had. I think you'd better find yourself a new cat sitter.  One, two, three, four.  Then it came to you and me, this is how we're meant to be.  Then it came to you and me, this is how we're meant to be. That's good.  Not to freak anyone out, but there's someone staring at us over there and they have been the entire time. That's my neighbour Penny. Hmm, I sense tension. I thought you two were friends. Look, Carl, you can't just use your key to get in anymore.  I don't want to have to change the locks. Come on, Chloe, it was a surprise.  I got you your favourite wine. No, I stopped drinking and we broke up three months ago. Come on, come on.  Do you know what?  You should be fucking grateful.  I ever wanted you, you cat. I want you to leave. You're fucking nothing without me, you useless bitch.  What is it?  Have you seen someone else?  Is it that blue-haired puff in your band? Carl, you need to leave now.  You're scaring me. You're fucking good. You just scared the cat, Carl. And where's my cat?  I want my cat back. Not your fucking cat. I paid for everything for that cat.  You can't fucking talk to me like that.  Who do you think you are?  You're fucking drunk.  I'm not drunk. Wait, Carl. I've only had 12.  I'll teach you to not disrespect me like that. I thought I heard Chloe telling you to leave. Who the hell are you?  And how did you get in here? I'm Penny.  I'm Chloe's neighbour.  More than that, I'm Chloe's friend. Well, this doesn't concern you, you old hag. You have ten seconds to get off her turf or I call the police. Fucking ridiculous. I want my key back. Chloe. No. Come on, stop.  You don't need to do that.  It's just a domestic... No. ...key, Carl. Chloe, come on. You heard her.  The key. Fuck you. Thanks.  Didn't have to do that.  You're very welcome.  Here, let me get that off your face. I just couldn't stand by and watch another wo- Woman?  That is what I was gonna say. Didn't think you saw me as a woman. I think we're very different. I agree.  I think we're very different women. Right now, I really don't know what to think. Oh, hi, Chloe.  Oh, hi, Penny.  This is Lawrence, my partner. Oh, Lawrence, I've heard a lot about you.  Really nice to meet you.  Good, hi. Great to meet you.  Just be a bit careful because I've just had my top surgery, so a bit tender right now. Top... Oh.  Oh.

Our first time together.  Lots of people do think that me and Fox... Do they?  They think we're an item?  Yeah, well, people did.  Do you remember, like, weren't we on about some fan fiction? Oh, yeah, we stumbled on some fan fiction. No, I don't think we actually did.  I think just we liked the idea.  Anyway, so this video, it's about sexuality and being trans.  Your sexuality is who you're attracted to, so whether that's females or males or non-binary people or just people.  Being trans is all about the gender you are, not feeling the gender you were assigned at birth. It's like gender first and then sexuality, so you work out who you fancy based on who you are. I've always been attracted to female identified people.  But before I transitioned, I never, I used to freak out at being called like a lesbian.  In fact, one of my best mates, she was gay, but she wouldn't tell me for years because she thought I was homophobic.  Because when people used to say to me that I was a lesbian, I'd be like, no, I'm not.  I was only a kid, like 15, 16.  But it was just that the term lesbian felt so wrong to fit with me.  Yeah.  Because obviously in my head, I was a straight lesbian.  male. Is that how you define Nell? Yes.  So yeah, I see myself as a straight male. So I define as transmasculine.  My sexuality is based on that fact. So what would your sexuality be called? Um, so... That's a video by itself. I would definitely call myself pansexual because who I'm attracted to isn't based on people's genitals or whether they're masculine or feminine.  I'm just into people.  it's like bisexual but it encompasses more than the binary in my opinion.  but actually the definition of bisexual has changed to encompass being pansexual. so what is the difference then?  i guess is it just that pansexual just hits the point home harder?  it basically enforces the the point that you are not attracted to people based on their gender in any way.  that's right.  it's more about the person yeah and just that it's a body of a. I'm just a body.  A soul.  I'm attracted to the soul and the heart.  To be honest, it is silly how we all get caught up in labels.  Yeah, completely.  Because... There's so many restrictions that go with that.  Let's do away with labels.  That's the future.  In the past, even though I didn't feel fully comfortable, I was connected to the idea of being a lesbian or gay.  Although I always felt like a bit of an alien and a bit of a weird outsider within those spaces.  I denied myself being attracted to masculine people because I just was not confident with my own masculinity and I wasn't ready to embrace that.  So I just kind of avoided that whole thing altogether. I used to.  i think seek out like really feminine people to make myself feel more masculine right to contrast exactly.  but now that i am really comfortable in myself as a guy like i i don't seek out that super femininity in somebody i actually like.  i'm attracted to girls that are perhaps a bit of a tomboy you know shorter her like just people that are a bit different not afraid to be dead alternative dead alternative girls. yeah yeah um My partner, who is non-binary femme, when we're seen out together, we look like a heterosexual couple.  And that kind of bugs me because it's like people don't know our history and don't know where we come from.  If I see queer people when we're out, I kind of want to be like, you know, hey, hey, you know, I'm one of you.  But I'm worried sometimes that actually I'm not read as queer or as different.  And that makes me feel sad because my i quite like the fact that i have this unique different history and i quite enjoy being an outsider as well. in real contrast to you i've always been quite like outspoken about the fact that i am straight and that my partners are straight and it's not to be like oh you know i'm straight.  but i just really like to make that point of the fact that you know like we always say like trans men are men.  i love that somebody that is purely only attracted to male people you know have that ability to not see me as any different from any other male.  i think that's like. that's totally valid.  yeah when i came out to my parents as trans my mom the first thing she said was fox um you know who's gonna love you?  and i was just like oh my god mom like.  i know it's horrible it's a horrible question but like i said to my mom i said well i've got to love myself first and then it's about you know, about finding someone who also loves me. But that's something that holds a lot of people back from transitioning, I think, because one of the reasons I didn't transition sooner, I always said to my friends, is because I'm worried I'll never find anyone that finds me attractive or finds love.  And then I reached a point where I was like, well, I've just got to put myself first. Same for me.  It was like a do or die situation.  But yeah, I think that that is a huge warrior.  I was with various partners and mentioned, you know, about being trans for quite a few years and nothing against my partners at all.  But, you know, they'd always say things like, well, you're so pretty as you are or, you know. Pretty fucks. But you know, they just couldn't imagine me being otherwise.  Someone even said to me, you know, the great thing about you is that you kind of like walk the line of gender and that you're so androgynous, like.  that's your selling point.  So why would you want to change that and become a, you know, a big old butch? Yeah.  Guy. Manly man.  Yeah, manly man. Like you.  Pink tie. Camp hand.  But yeah, it's so nice to realise that actually there's so many different ways to be masculine or be a man.  People are attracted to masculine or feminine.  They're not particularly attracted to genitals, I don't think.  It's more about... No, it's not about that, is it?  How do we sum up this really long?  If any of you have got any tales to tell or any opinions, comment below. Yeah, if your sexuality has changed based on your transition, we'd love to hear about it.

Collaborating with my friend and fellow creative Fox Fisher, we shot the pre-op video on the evening before my top surgery. Looking back, the choreography was stiff and my mind was ultra-focused. Only 4 months later we shot the same video, here I see myself opening up with more expressive, fluid movement as I was finally comfortable with myself. I wanted to show how good it feels to grow into yourself, recognising yourself as a work in progress. I hope Fox and I can inspire others by showing this vulnerability.\u201d\n\nAll music owned by Rowyn Judd.\n\nMy Genderation is an ongoing film project focusing on trans lives and trans experiences.

First of all, I'm really sorry that I haven't made a video in a while.  I know some of you have been concerned about me and why haven't I made a video?  So honestly, because of the whole COVID-19 pandemic thing, I've been, I guess I'll say I've been laying low, but I've been thinking a lot about you and trying to think about what it is that would make the most sense for me to use this channel for.  during this time.  So I came up with my idea finally, but I'll share that in a minute.  I just thought I'd give you a little bit of a personal update, nothing monumental, just generally speaking.  First of all, I'm healthy and wonderful to report that everybody in my family and my loved ones are all healthy as well, which is great.  And here in Colorado, things have started to reopen as they have in many places.  But I've been socially distancing still and doing that kind of thing.  Both of my parents are older and have health conditions that put them at greater risk.  And because I do spend socially distant time with them, I still am taking as many precautions as I can to keep them safe.  So that includes also in terms of the counseling clients that I see, I'm only seeing clients online through video sessions.  And it's been going pretty well.  My clients have been very flexible and patient with the process.  And I'm not sure, this will probably go on for quite some time for how long it is that I'll still be using video sessions with them.  I haven't been doing very many trainings or workshops or anything like that.  That's something that was a big part of my business and certainly a passion of mine when it comes to training other therapists and business when it comes to trans and non-binary inclusivity and awareness.  And so I have not been quite sure how to approach those types of trainings.  Everything at this point has to still be online.  So I'm getting used to using Zoom and trying to feel out how that feels so different than presenting in person.  So that's been a journey.  And also trying to figure out in terms of the material I'm teaching, there's a lot that's different because we're not doing as much in-person interaction.  that changes some of the things I've been teaching and just not knowing going forward what is going to be the same and what is going to be different.  However, I really do miss teaching and doing these types of trainings and workshops.  I wouldn't be surprised if sometime this summer I start doing that more.  Okay, so here's the idea I had as to what to do with my YouTube channel.  I have been thinking a lot about my book lately, which I happen to have here at you and your gender identity a guide to discovery and the book has been out now for I believe well there's.  there was the original version that came out that I put out in 2016. this one came out in 2017 and I was thinking maybe it was time I needed to do a revision of it and I've been looking through the book and for the most part it doesn't need a lot of updating.  I mean sure there's going to be a few things with language and whatnot that should be updated but I don't think it's time for me to write a revision of this book until we know better.  How is life going to look different after the pandemic?  And I think it's going to be too early to write something in terms of revising the book because we don't know what things are going to look like, how they're going to be different.  So what I decided I should do instead is is I'm going to read to you from my book and I'm going to be going through each chapter and then I'll put a video up.  I'm not exactly sure how that's going to go.  Like I might only read part of a chapter sometimes.  I might get through a whole chapter other times.  I will probably be sitting sometimes here in my office.  Sometimes I'll be at home.  Sometimes it'll be daytime.  Sometimes it'll be nighttime because I just want to really make sure I get this out there to you.  Sometimes I'll be drinking coffee, sometimes I won't.  But what I thought would be really cool about that is that it gives you a chance to be able to, I've had a lot of people ask me if there's an audiobook and my publisher had chosen not to have an audiobook version of it.  So this kind of is a way for you to have an audiobook version of it.  But I just want you to know it's going to be, it might be messy sometimes.  I will probably mess up while I'm reading it.  I'm going to stop myself in the middle of the sentence and I'm going to maybe share some reflection with you about my own journey or maybe some added thoughts that I might have in addition to whatever I wrote.  Or I might say, oh, that really sounds outdated.  I should probably change that for the next edition.  So that's my plan.  That's what I'm going to do is start reading to you from you and your gender identity, a guide to discovery.  And that'll be starting up in the very next video that you see here.  So Thank you for your concern.  Again, I'm sorry I haven't been in touch on this channel, but you can always check out my Instagram, which is under Dara Hoffman Fox, if you are worried about me.  And then you can see that I am alive and still doing stuff, even if it's just me posting pictures of my foster cat or coffee or things like that.  At least you'll know I'm still around.  So I look forward to doing this.  And if you have any thoughts about this idea I have, please put them in the comments and let me know what you think.  And I will be talking to you again soon.  Thank you.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, I'm back after a while.

So, yeah, we're just going to have a chill time as I set up my journal for the month.  My journal setup is nothing fancy.  You will know that if you watched my last bullet journal video.  I basically stick to the original Ryder Carroll bullet journal method and add some little flourishes here and there.  So it's not going to be anything too complicated, but I thought we could... Yeah, just do it together and have a bit of a chat.  So the first part of my monthly planning process is setting up my mental inventory, which is kind of like a pensive or a brain dump for the stuff that needs to get migrated from last month, but also just whatever is in my head at the moment.  So I start by setting that up.  so that I've got it ready and then I'm going to start sifting through my pages from the previous month, which is August.  And I'll just go through all of that and look for any open tasks, migrate them over onto the mental inventory.  I also use that third column to make note of the big events that happened that month so that I can use that for my review when I get to that point.  It's funny, like, I have not been doing much witchy stuff at all for a while now.  maybe the past few weeks or months, it's just not something I've been really going to.  And I was kind of like reminded of that when, uh, I was talking about some things with my therapist and he was like, have you thought about doing some witchcraft in and around, you know, this particular thing we were talking about?  And I was like, no, because I haven't been doing any really.  Um, It's funny that like the second that we got into September and then I was thinking about setting up my journal and also just now, this is like the first month of autumn.  It's like the second like summer was over in my head, something just clicked into place and I was like, oh, I want to get back into everything again.  which isn't really much of a surprise.","channel.id":"clxmi0r7004awcdvi35jusdms","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCXjda70KpggxCpmrLpxdHuw","channel.name":"Rachael Stephen","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/np6OxA__VgCJbk5OIlCijDSyBJv5-JmLOOcSZaTlE69txJqSDb4AyF2v4d3P8KgdD5IVi3i7=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, welcome to my September bullet journal setup video.

We're good, we are good to go!  Hello everybody, welcome back to the channel!  It has not been too long since we've had a book-related video on the channel, but it has been some time since I did a book-related video.  For a while, I didn't really see myself making creative book-related content.  I was reading, and I was enjoying the things that I was reading, and there were some things that I, you know, occasionally had the idea of talking about in a video.  It just never really happened.  That is until Sarah did a video where she talked about her favorite romance novels and she encouraged me to do the same thing and I thought about it for a long time and now here I am.  You know, here's the thing.  I don't like to be told what to do and a lot of the time if Sarah's like, you should do this, I will not do it.  I can be really petty and I don't mean to be sometimes, but sometimes I do.  This was just one of those times where I was like, you know what?  No, I've read a lot of really good books by a lot of really talented women and they all deserve to be talked about.  Let's just not ignore them maybe?  So today I've got six romance novels and I'm using that term just a little loosely because one of them is technically YA and not actually in like the romance section of a bookstore, but I think it fits into the like YA romance genre.  So I'm I'm counting it in this group because I think it's worthwhile to talk about.  We actually have talked about it on the channel before, but you know what?  I've got things to say!  So the first book that I want to talk about is Brazen and the Beast by Sarah McClain.  This is the second Bare Knuckle Bastards book.  This one is my favorite one so far.  I absolutely adore the first one, which is Wicked and the Wallflower.  Side note, if you're looking for a kind of loosely based on Hades and Persephone historical romance, Wicked and the Wallflower is your go-to.  You can ask pretty much any author that has read Wicked and the Wallflower and they will recommend it for the same reason.  However, Brazen and the Beast, as suggested by the title, is loosely based on Beauty and the Beast, which is only one of the reasons that it's my favorite one so far.  in the series.  Another huge one is the main character, Hattie Sedley, Lady Henrietta Sedley.  She's a plus-size woman and she wants to be a businesswoman and she's just so competent at everything that she does, which sometimes could be a flaw in the book and I don't think that's the case here.  Brazen and the Beast is about Henrietta Sedley basically forcing her own coming-of-age story.  She's well beyond the marrying age of her time and she decides one night on her birthday that she is going to a brothel and she is going to get her life started and the next day she's going to convince her father to let her take over the family business and instead she finds a tied-up man in her care and, as politely as she possibly can, asks him to evacuate so she can, you know, get on with her plans for the night.  It turns out that this man is the brother of the main romantic lead in Wicked and the Wallflower.  His name is Wit, but he goes, his street name is Beast.  Wit is very well known for not talking.  Hattie, on the other hand, is very well known for talking a lot.  However, Wit being the lead in a historical romance, yeah, he's, you know, kind of roguish and runs an illegal business with his family.  So essentially what that means is that Hattie and Wit end up being business rivals until they get sexy.  I don't want to give too much away about this book, but I do absolutely love this.  Hattie gets everything she deserves.  I mean, it's a romance novel, don't they all?  That's why we read romance novels!  So far, although I love Felicity and Devon from the first book, Hattie and Wit are my favorite couple.  I just really Highly recommend.  Fix Her Up by Tessa Bailey is genuinely one of my favorite books.  I've read this book twice.  I barely ever reread books that aren't Pride and Prejudice, and I've read this book twice!  I put it down so I'm not flinging it around, but Fix Her Up is about Georgie Castle and Travis Ford.  Georgie Castle is the youngest Castle sibling.  She, you know, has a kind of a legacy to live up to in their small New York town.  Georgie is not only a virgin, which she doesn't really seem to care about, it's just a fact.  She's also a birthday party clown as a living and she wants to be taken seriously as a person regardless of what she does for a living.  Travis Ford is a former pro baseball player.  He had a really bad injury and now he can't play professionally anymore.  He's also Georgie's brother's best friend because of course he is.  Travis is given an opportunity to audition for a sportscasting job on a very wholesome and family-friendly sports channel.  The only roadblock to that is that he has a really bad reputation of sleeping around and using women for pleasure, essentially.  Just, you know, all around being like a mad boy athlete, I suppose, if that's the trope we're gonna go with.  Travis Ford is a lot more than that, and Georgie Castle knows it because she's known him for over 10 years.  So Georgie and Travis agree to fake date because they basically want the same thing.  They want to be taken seriously in a light that most people that they know don't see them in.  The catch is that Georgie is already head over heels in love with Travis.  She just doesn't really want to admit it to herself.  She is terrified of actually falling in love with him because she doesn't think that he will return those feelings.  And he's kind of terrified of feeling any emotion at all until they start fake dating.  I keep using the air quotes because they're really into each other.  The whole book, their chemistry is unreal.  Georgie is really the reason that I keep coming back to this book, but Travis's transformation from unemotive, very understandingly depressed person into somebody that believes that he's worthy of the people around him?  is magical!  The biggest complaint that I have with this book is that The Eleventh Hour Breakup doesn't read well.  It doesn't ring true.  It feels very much like Tessa Bailey knows what her genre is and has to, like, force certain things to happen because it's a romance novel.  It's all because of Georgie's older brother Steven, who I hate!  He is the worst!  I hate Steven so much!  But that just goes to show you that you can absolutely detest a character in a book and still love the book.  Steven is just the worst, and I live with it.  The next book I listened to the audiobook of, and it's Pride and Prejudice and Other Flavors by Sonali Dev.  Let me tell you.  So from the title, you can probably tell that it's a Pride and Prejudice adaptation, and I have to say, I think it's one of the most inventive Pride and Prejudice adaptations to date.  There are many different ways that you can tell the story of Pride and Prejudice and many different ways that you can interpret those characters and I think Sonali Dev has done the most creative work so far and I am currently writing my own version of Pride and Prejudice.  thing about it is that you can't really place one Pride and Prejudice character with one specific Pride and Prejudice and Other Flavors character except for Wickham.  Wickham is a woman.  Wickham is a white woman with dreads, so that tells you exactly what you need to know.  Trisha Rajah is a doctor.  She has a huge family like the Bennetts.  She has a very complicated relationship with a lot of her siblings, specifically one who is running for political office.  She's also the only surgeon that is willing to and capable of performing a very specific eye surgery on a patient of hers who happens to be, I guess, the stand-in for Georgiana Darcy, because her older brother is DJ, his name is actually Darcy.  But he has a lot of Lizzie's qualities in his personality and in the fact that he comes from a poorer family than Trisha does.  kind of difficult to suss out which one is supposed to be Lizzie and which one is supposed to be Darcy, and I liked that about it.  I liked that Sonali Dev wasn't afraid to take characteristics of both of them and assign them to each character of hers, which I don't think any other adaptation of Pride and Prejudice has ever done that, and I just liked it.  It was refreshing.  I guess it's pretty important to note that DJ is British-Nigerian, I believe, and Trisha's family is from India.  I just also just really loved the story.  So like I said, Trisha is preparing to do an operation on DJ's younger sister, who's an artist.  However, if she performs the surgery, DJ's sister becomes blind and can't do art anymore unless, you know, she adapts and learns how to do other forms of art.  So there's a lot of back and forth between DJ and his younger sister and DJ and Trisha.  DJ is also a chef, so he does a lot of work for her family throughout the book.  Trisha loves to eat!  It's amazing!  And just like the family dynamics work a lot with the Pride and Prejudice adaptation, it's a really good book.  I screamed about a million times because there were just things that I recognized from the original that were used in such a new and unique way that honestly made me feel really jealous because again, I'm trying to write a Pride and Prejudice adaptation and I don't think mine is gonna be anywhere near this level.  So if you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice adaptations or if you're just looking for a more diverse read, Pride and Prejudice and Other Flavors is probably a really good book for you.  To get into the book that we've already discussed on this channel and the one that is technically a YA book and not in the romance section, I love Geekerella.  Is anybody surprised?  The name gives it away.  It's Cinderella, but it's modern and it revolves around a sci-fi convention.  That's pretty much it.  you gotta know.  It's told in two perspectives, so you've got Danielle, or Elle, who is our Cinderella character, and Darian, who is our Prince character.  Darian is an actor, he's well known for being on a soap opera, but he's just been cast in a reboot of Starfield, which, to put it lightly, is a Star Trek, Star Wars kind of mishmash that also exists in the universe with Star Trek and Star Wars.  He's been cast as Prince Carmendor, the lead of the entire movie.  He's really nervous because he's a big nerd for Starfield, and the rest of the internet doesn't want him to play Carmendor.  They don't think that he'll be a good Carmendor because they only see him as a soap opera actor, which is really unfair.  I feel it's especially unfair because Darian very much cares about Starfield, and nobody seems to believe that.  Except for Danielle, and that's really only over text.  When she doesn't know that she's talking to Darian, she thinks that Darian is a bad choice for Carmendor.  She just thinks she's talking to another fan of Starfield over text, And she really, really likes him.  And he really, really likes her.  It's been a while since I read it, but I think they plan to meet up at the convention.  Lots of stuff from, like, Cinderella ensues.  There's a dog.  There's a lesbian that drives a vegan pumpkin food truck.  I genuinely cried over the end of Geekerella.  It is heart-wrenching.  So good.  So good.  There's also a second book.  It's The Princess and the Fangirl.  That one was a little bit slower to get into.  However, there's a Carrie Fisher stand-in in that one that made me cry.  Oh, did she make me cry.  Ashley Poston is coming for my emotions every time.  There's a Beauty and the Beast one coming out soon.  I'm not prepared.  If you're a fan of Cinderella or if you're a fan of stories that take place at conventions, Geekerella's for you.  The next one that I read was also an audiobook.  It's called The Plus One by Sarah Archer.  It's a very weird romance book.  I saw it when I used to work in a bookstore and I picked it up once and was like, this seems bizarre.  And then I just found it on my library app.  The Plus One is about this woman, Kelly, who has a lot of social anxiety and she doesn't really like to go on dates.  Like, you know, she doesn't want to be a serial dater and she's also devoted to her job.  Kelly's younger sister is getting married, and in true romance and fanfic fashion, her mother is pestering her about why she's still single, why she won't go on any dates, and why she doesn't have a date to the wedding.  So, Kelly, a robotics engineer, decides to use her work for her own gain and literally makes herself a robot boyfriend.  His name is Ethan.  His brain is connected to the internet.  He apparently learns and like can feel things or he's like programmed to think that he feels things, the lines drawn between what Ethan can do for himself and what Kelly has to give Ethan the ability to do, they're very blurred.  Given that Ethan is not a real human being, I am not sure that we can apply the same standards to their relationship that we would if Ethan was.  a real human being.  Throughout the book, Ethan really seems to want to be with Kelly, but again, Kelly actually kind of deals with this conflict of, is that really Ethan's personality, or is that something that I've programmed into Ethan without recognizing it?  Ethan is very nice.  He really seems to care about her, and he's very personable with her family and friends, pretty much all because Kelly made him that way.  Kelly learns, eventually, that she created Ethan.  Everything that she and Ethan had came from her own mind and her own hands and her own hard work.  So... none of it was really real.  By the end of the book, she recognizes that the things that she was doing with Ethan, the reason that she even had Ethan in the first place, it wasn't real, and it wasn't real human connection, and it wasn't going to be able to last forever the way that she wanted it to, and she had to deal with that.  It's just a very weird book if you're into that kind of stuff.  Give it a try.  I don't think it's a bad book.  I just think it's very weird.  And to close the video out, here is one of my absolute favorite books in the entire world, possibly till the end of time.  It's Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston.  I would just like to take this moment to thank Taylor Simons, our friend.  We've talked about her book.  She's been on the channel before.  She recommended this book to me.  In fact, she yelled at me to read it.  So I did.  I haven't looked back since.  Red, White, and Royal Blue is about the son of the first female president of the United States of America and the youngest Prince of Wales.  Alex and Henry are my boys.  I absolutely adore them.  What can I say about this?  It's so long, so much happens, but it's so beautiful and worth it and I love it.  So Henry and Alex both think that the other one hates the other and it's just not really true.  They just kind of annoy one another whenever they have to be in the same room.  into a lot of trouble at Henry's brother's wedding.  And both of their PR teams and security teams are like, hey, You're gonna have to be his friend now to make this look like just a ha-ha funny coincidence kind of thing.  And they get locked in a closet together, because of course they do.  Welcome to romance.  And they find out that they both really like Star Wars, and that's kind of where their true friendship blossoms with Star Wars.  There's so much that happens in that book, and I don't want to spoil any of it other than what I may have already spoiled, but I don't think I've given away too much.  There's like two characters in that entire book that I wouldn't absolutely die for, I can't say too much because I really genuinely want people to read that book.  If you're worried about Henry being the Prince of Wales and like imperialism or stuff, that's dealt with.  Oh, is that dealt with?  I think I'm gonna stop yelling about this book because A it's after 10 o'clock at night, my parents are both asleep, and B I think I've said everything that I need to say about it to possibly sell it to somebody because it is just... That good.  Please, please consider reading it.  Please, for the love of God, please consider reading Red, White, and Royal Blue.  If you've read any of these books, please let me know in the comments below.  If you have any other good romance recommendations, let me know as well.  I'm always up for new recommendations, now that I have sufficiently yelled over six books in the middle of the night.  Thank you so much for watching this video.

Also give it a thumbs up for algorithm stuff, and just in case you actually really like it, you know, let people know.

You know, actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I picked some of my favorite books, regardless of genre.  They're all basically from the same genre, but I've picked some of my favorite books, period.","channel.id":"clxmi0rat04ddcdvirb8sizkf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCtilV9LOwqBXw_xMQTk0JZA","channel.name":"The Princess and the Scrivener","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU1VX7kdvHkZuasrBhRHr5_O6BHGwcn3650cdFxbg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, welcome back to the channel.

I'm sorry, somebody is... mowing their lawn at midnight.  If y'all have been following me for the last two days, you know that I saw Birds of Prey.  I think it's pretty clear by the thing that I drew on my face, not very well mind you, that I like this movie a lot.  That's the short version of it.  The long version is that for an hour and 49 minutes, I sat in complete awe of the Artistry, that's the only word that I have for it.  And then I left the theater walking taller, almost crying because I was just that emotional about it.  This movie was made for and by women, and I suspect at least one queer woman was in the crew somewhere.  As per usual with our movie reviews, I'm going to do a non-spoiler half of the video and a spoiler half of the video.  make the disclaimer right now that my non-spoiler half of the video is going to bring up some themes from the movie, but not how those themes play out in the movie.  So they're things that I think can enrich a first viewing of Birds of Prey without spoiling it entirely, and then I will dive deeper into those things in the spoiler part of the video.  Does that sound fair?  I think it sounds pretty fair as somebody that genuinely doesn't care about spoilers.  I'm trying to be thoughtful and sensitive to the people that do care about spoilers, while also enhancing an experience of a film that I genuinely love.  I do not use that word when it comes to movies lightly, but I love Birds of Prey.  So if you're not aware of what Birds of Prey is, what is the full title?  The new title that was given to the movie after its release is Harley Quinn Birds of Prey, but that's not what's on the title card in the movie.  The original title of the movie is Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn, and I think that is way more apt than Harley Quinn Birds of Prey.  short and spoiler-free synopsis of this movie is that it is kind of a follow-up to Suicide Squad from 2016, but also very much not a follow-up to Suicide Squad, and it involves Harley Quinn breaking up with the Joker.  I don't think that's a spoiler.  It's pretty much straight up in the title and in the trailers, so you know that going into the movie already.  And something big happens, there's a big crime thing happening, and she has to team up with some other DC characters that I do not know pretty much anything about.  My knowledge extends through this movie and that's kind of it.  I'm a Marvel girl.  Leave me alone.  And now that you know what it's about, let's move into my non-spoiler part of the video.  To get real for just a second, there should be a trigger warning and is in this video for sexual assault.  It is a thing that is in the movie.  I wouldn't say that it happens often in the movie, but it does happen both verbally and physically.  However, I think the movie has something to say about it rather than just having it there for like grimdark stuff, you know, like some other action movies have done.  There's a contextual reason for it, and it isn't just to show that it's happening in the real world or whatever, it's there to say something.  There are so many women of color in the cast, and as far as I know, in the crew.  I mean, Cathy Yan is the one that directed this movie, and I don't actually know if Christina Hodson, the writer, is a woman of color, but she mentioned in an interview that her nieces and nephews are all mixed race, and that's a direct quote.  I couldn't find anything where she talks about it specifically, But she is the sole credited writer on this movie and I just get the feeling that, like, it's possible, okay?  And then of course in the cast you have Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Ella J. Bosco, and those are just the women of color in the main cast, like characters with names.  They're also three of the five main characters of the movie.  which I think is really important.  And yes, I am aware that those characters are not all women of color in the comics, and guess how much I care about that?  I mentioned Christina Hodson already.  She also wrote the screenplay for Bumblebee, which I still haven't seen even though I really should.  That's not what we're here to talk about.  I just all of a sudden know about Christina Hodson and have a deep respect for her after seeing this movie.  Holy shit, everyone is hot.  Like, there's only one person in the movie that I was surprised by his portrayal of his character and I did not find him attractive.  And of course, I thought everybody in the cast was also talented.  I just happened to like their faces and their characters and... Hoo boy, am I gay!  To be a little bit more serious, I don't think that there's a single actor in this movie that doesn't completely embody the character that they're playing.  Ewan McGregor plays a character named Roman Sionis, and Roman's fashion sense is very, like, 80s Miami Vice.  It just, it worked for me.  I don't know what it was.  He had a style, and he knew what it was, and he went for it, and... That's all the credit that I'll give Roma Sionis.  I think by now we all know about Harley's sandwich.  It's not really like a spoiler.  It really has nothing to do with the rest of the plot of the movie.  It's just a moment of joy and a moment of sadness and then another moment of joy later on.  That's kind of how you know that this movie was made for and by women, is that Harley had her sandwich moment.  Very small thing.  I love Bruce the hyena.  And my last non-spoiler little thing might possibly count as a spoiler for some people that are exceptionally sensitive to spoilers.  If you don't want to know anything else about this movie, stop watching, go see the movie, come back and watch the rest of this video later.  Go do what you gotta do.  But my last little non-spoiler thing is actually one of the big themes of the movie, but it's something that I have been stewing on now that I've seen it twice in two days, and it's that this movie is inherently about survivors.  It's about people and what they're willing to do, how far they're willing to go to survive in Gotham.  I think Every single one of the main characters has a survival story and I will talk more in depth about that in my spoiler section of the video.  I just think it really probably might enhance a viewing for the first time of this movie, going in and knowing that all of these characters are just trying to make it one day at a time.  Beware, spoilers are coming.  Spoilers are ahead.  If you've seen the movie, stick with me.  If you haven't and want the spoilers, stick with me.  If you have not seen the movie, don't want spoilers, click away right now.  Come back later.  So we're good, right?  Everybody that's here still wants the spoilers or has seen the movie.  Yeah?  Okay.  Let's get right back into the survival story thing because that has been fascinating me for two days, okay?  You got Harley, who throughout the movie is trying to prove not only to herself but everybody in Gotham, it seems, that she is more than the Joker's girlfriend.  Her, like, group of friends that never show up again at the beginning of the movie say that some people just aren't meant to stand on their own.  It's what she's actively working against the entire movie.  It is really the driving force behind Harley's character growth.  Roman even says, you know, you can't stand on your own, Quinn, you're not the type.  But it's also Pretty telling that he says that after she's already teamed up with the other main characters of the movie.  She is looking for emancipation, but she's willing to work with a team of people that are worthy of her time.  I just think that there are so many parts of the survival story that, like, globally, women can identify with.  Her animation at the beginning of the movie shows her in the jester outfit from the comics, specifically when she's saying that she lost all sense of herself as she dove headfirst into her relationship with the Joker.  And then this movie does everything that it possibly can to undo that kind of mentality, that kind of devotion to another person who could not care less about you.  I'm just saying, I'm real proud of Harley Quinn.  This isn't really like a survival thing, but I also really liked the kind of dichotomy in her costumes, not necessarily just from Suicide Squad, but again, they show her in the Jester costume in the animated opening sequence, and then throughout the rest of the movie, she wears nothing but glitter and bright neon colors and that weird fringe jacket that I absolutely adore, and those sequin pants.  The star outfit from the bar.  This is one of those moments where I can't tell if I want to be Harley Quinn or date Harley Quinn, which is an option because she's also canonically bisexual.  It's also in the animated opening sequence.  Renee Montoya is the character that Rosie Perez plays.  She's a detective with the Gotham City Police Department.  She's been overlooked at work for not only being a woman, but being a Latinx woman.  She's constantly being belittled by the men that she works with, regardless of the fact that she has a good track record.  They just... wipe her under the rug because she's a Latinx woman.  And then she kind of flips him off at the end of the movie, which was with Kesha's woman in the background.  Dinah Lance sings at Roman Sionis' bar and she absolutely hates Roman.  It is so obvious how much she hates Roman.  But she can't not do the job that she's been given because she has nothing else.  She has no other way to make money.  Roman is her only source of income, essentially.  So as much as she hates him, she is surviving.  I will also talk about Roman and his power trips, but one of the ones that makes me the most uncomfortable is It involves Dinah.  It's the scene in his bar where he makes the woman Erica stand up on the table just because she was laughing, and he thinks she was laughing at him when she wasn't.  And it gets very uncomfortable.  And Dinah tries to leave.  And he doesn't let her.  And he tells her, you soothe me, little bird.  Like, it's supposed to be some kind of commendation from the gods.  It's one of the hardest scenes in the movie to watch, I think.  Cassandra Cain is between 14 and 16, I think, in this movie, and she's played by Ella J. Bosco.  Her survival story involves being a pickpocket.  She has no power over her foster parents or in her foster situation whatsoever.  She has no power over her own life.  The implication of being a foster child also to an audience that does not get to see into the family other than hearing the foster parents yell kind of reads as she has absolutely no power over her entire life.  The only way that she knows how to control what is happening around her is to steal from people and It also ends up being like a monetary thing because she does live in a poor area of Gotham, but it's got that connotation of this is the only way that she has any sort of control over her own life.  And Helena, aka Huntress, aka the hottest person to maybe have ever lived, thanks Mary Elizabeth Winstead, she's been surviving 15 years on nothing but revenge and a toy car, apparently.  15 years before this movie takes place, Sionis pays goons to take out Helena's entire family, and her family's super rich, and they have this diamond with all kinds of codes to their bank accounts, and they kill everybody in her family except for her.  She gets taken off to another family of mercenaries, and is trained for 15 years in the art of killing, and truly feels that she'll never be able to rest until her family is avenged.  Harley, a psychiatrist, tells her, Psychologically speaking, vengeance rarely brings the catharsis we hope for.  And suddenly, she's got a new team.  She's not alone anymore in this world.  I also think to some extent that Roman is just surviving.  He's a ridiculously wealthy and powerful man, and he goes on these terrible, terrifying, rage-driven power trips.  But... They say at least once or twice throughout the movie that he acts the way that he does because his father was never proud of him and he's, you know, attempting to be better than his father, but Harley calls him out on using that as an excuse to just wanting pride out of his father.  that doesn't care.  And that in no way excuses him for the things that he does.  But I do think it's still worth mentioning and seeing how that theme plays throughout every one of these characters.  So now that I've gotten through that long lecture of a discussion, this is how you retcon a character and make it mean something.  Out of the few interviews that I read with Christina Hodson, she in no way makes it sound like she was trying to undo the things that were done in Suicide Squad.  That doesn't mean that I... don't see those things happening.  I mean, the very basis of this movie is that Harley is no longer with the Joker.  She is on her own, she has to protect herself, she inexplicably has to protect a 16-year-old kid now too, but she's really, like, Harley is still number one because of the abuse that the Joker put her through.  It's not very loudly said throughout the movie, but it is pretty explicit.  as long as you know about the character, and I think there aren't many people, especially like comic book movie fans, that don't know about Harley Quinn.  The more that I talk about this movie, the more I like it.  God damn it!  Not only is Harley Quinn canonically queer within the universe of this movie, but so is Renee Montoya.  The assistant DA of Gotham City is played by Ali Wong.  Now that character is Renee Montoya's ex.  This is a smaller, less global thing for me, but it really struck me the second time that I watched this movie.  The scene where Harley goes into Gotham PD to get Cass, she's blowing up all kinds of canisters of colorful smoke and glitter, and she shoots off one blue and one pink smoke bomb thing, and they merge together, and then she faces off with, like, one of the last police officers in front of a cloud that makes up the bi flag.  It just made me feel seen, okay?  Okay.  Holy shit, everybody in this movie is hot except for Chris Messina, which is a first.  Before I saw it, I kept seeing, like, you know, the pictures of him with the blonde hair, and it was really, like, seeing Chris Messina with the blonde hair, which, like, never has- it's never happened before.  That got to me, but then I saw the movie and I was like, no, no, he's creepy.  However, Margot is Harley.  Just from the things that I've seen on the internet between, you know, clips from the show and screen caps and clips from the comics and stuff, Margot makes the same facial expressions that Harley does.  Margot looks like Harley Quinn and it is almost uncanny except that she is just so good at being this character.  Who gave her the right?  Also, I just have to shout out Derby Queen Harleen Quinzel.  Here's another moment where I can't tell if I want to be Harley Quinn or date Harley Quinn.  And I would be remiss if I let this video go without mentioning once again how hot Mary Elizabeth Winstead is, even when she is screaming about how she uses a crossbow and not a bow and arrow because she's not 12 years old.  Wow.  Why did that work for me?  It just did.  I mentioned this earlier, that the movie is kind of gritty, but in a digestible way.  It's not gritty just for the sake of being R-rated, essentially.  It's gritty and the characters are dirty and messy and flawed.  Here's exactly what I wrote.  The members of the Birds of Prey team are all likeable, which makes their victory so satisfying.  The violence is abundant, yeah, and it's not my favorite part of the movie, but it's... not any more or less violent than any Batman movie, except for maybe Lego Batman.  It's definitely easier to sit through than Suicide Squad was.  I think it's safe to say I kind of like this movie a lot.  I've even used the word love to describe how I feel about it, which is a big Deal, okay?  This is just like a random thing that I noticed, but there's a lot of hand iconography.  Like, Roman wears these gloves that are really interesting and draw your eye to them.  More than one character in the movie wears multiple rings and they're all shiny, so they're all drawing your attention to their hands.  There's a lot of hand iconography in Roman's bar.  Like, set decoration at the booby trap at the end.  There's the, like, weird bendable hands.  I don't know what to make of all of this hand stuff.  but there's a lot going on with hands in this movie.  Take that as you will, I suppose.  The last thing that I definitely liked, but really doesn't have to do with the movie, it's really about the soundtrack.  The soundtrack!  Oh!  Recently I've been listening to a lot of audiobooks in my car because I've been working out of my car, but the last couple of days, the last two days, I have not been able to listen to audiobooks because I've just been replaying the soundtrack.  I have two things that I guess are kind of cons.  One kind of very specific thing is when Victor and the goons catch Harley, Roman and Victor are coming down into the room behind her, and you can hear Roman say, I don't care what it takes, I want my diamond back.  It just really wasn't subtle at all, and I know that it was set up so that Harley would overhear that, but they came from upstairs where they had already talked about the diamond being missing.  So then coming downstairs to say it right behind Harley I really only had the one.  I really only had the one con.  Honestly, if there were other flaws in this movie, I would have written them down if they were big enough, but the smaller flaws I was willing to overlook because I just loved the movie that much.  This movie really, really emotionally touched me, felt me, recognized me.  It was so good.  It was so good that I saw it twice in two days.  I don't know if I've ever done that for another movie ever.  That is all that I have written down about Birds of Prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley Quinn.  Go see it.  Go see it again if you've already seen it.  Just enjoy yourself.  Let yourself have this fun.  If you have seen it, please let me know in the comments what your favorite part of Harley Quinn Birds of Prey was.  I guess we're gonna go with the new title.

Is that grammatically correct?  Who cares?  Um, I did see Suicide Squad, unfortunately, but she was not the worst part of that movie.  In fact, I think Margot Robbie was the best part of that movie.  I love Pride and Prejudice from 2005.  I love Beauty and the Beast, and I love Birds of Prey.  Is there a pattern there?  I think there might be a pattern there.","channel.id":"clxmi0rat04ddcdvirb8sizkf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCtilV9LOwqBXw_xMQTk0JZA","channel.name":"The Princess and the Scrivener","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU1VX7kdvHkZuasrBhRHr5_O6BHGwcn3650cdFxbg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I'm going to talk about Birds of Prey, the movie that I just saw twice in two days.

{"id":"clxmm7h78l8svo6z1o53yrdjp","yt_video_id":"BW8X2nXexQs","title":"The Single MOST Powerful Element of Voice Feminization: Meta Resonance | Exercises & Lecture","description":"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/transvoicelessons\nfor lesson inquiries: transvoicelessons@gmail.com\nThis video explains the most important element of voice feminization and why it is so important. In the video there are 4 primary exercises from my vault to help you learn control over this resonance. \n\nEvery container around you, produces a tone when tapped. This is called a \"natural frequency\". Your throat (pharynx) has it's own natural frequency based on how large it is. We call this frequency, R1. It strongly determines the sex perception of an individuals voice.\n\nWhen exposed to testosterone, the vocal tract expands, causing this natural frequency to shift lower. By learning control the shape and size of the vocal tract, we can control R1, thereby giving us the ability to reverse the primary effect hormones had on the vocal tract.\n\nWhile there are other resonances and other elements responsible for voice feminization, by far the most significant and important difference is R1. Several things can control R1: oropharyngeal closure, larynx height, tongue positioning, epilaryngeal modifications, different jaw positions, and much more. The key is to not get lost in all of these little words or the individual components. Instead, we focus on what all of these things work together to achieve: R1 control. \n\nWe learn this control by mimicking positive models. By accurately mimicking what I do, you will be copying the muscle behavior responsible for changing R1. Then, you can work to increase awareness of what's responsible for that shift and work to integrate it into a speaking voice.\n\nHere are 4 of my own favorite approaches that you can take to explore R1:\n1. R1 Raising + Voiceless [\u025b] as in Edge.\n2. R1 Raising + Voiceless [p\u0259] as in Puck.\n3. R1 Raising + Voiced [m]\n4. R1 Raising + Voiced Vowel Gradients\n\nIf you properly mimic these exercises, your vocal tract is shrinking. These should be treated as tools to teach you the general movement and feeling associated with altering R1. Doing these over and over without understanding why, misses the point. These exercises are demonstrations of what it sounds like when we shrink the vocal tract, thus raise R1, to female or beyond female averages. Use them as tools to show yourself the behavior you are trying to learn.\n\nResonance is not a place, it's not a \"feeling\", it's not magic: It's how cavities, chambers, and rooms, cause the sound inside them to behave differently. The fundamental challenge of voice feminization, is learning how to stabilize and maintain a higher R1 during speech without any harsh effects like squeeking, scratching, tension, or awkwardness. \n\nIf every element about your voice is perfect but the R1 is very bad, you will still get perceived as male. If the R1 is very good but everything else is terrible, you will be perceived as female. The weight and importance of R1 control can not be overstated.\n\nI hope this video helps everyone understand this concept more!!\nwarmly,\nz\n\nhttps:\/\/www.patreon.com\/transvoicelessons\ntransvoicelessons.com\ntransvoicelessons@gmail.com\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/zheaerose","publish_date":"2020-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":["Voice Feminization","Female Voice","Vocal Sex","Sex in Voice","Transgender Voice","How to girl voice","How to sound female"],"length":791,"views":1109758,"thumbnail_url":"","yt_channel_id":"UCBYlEnfAUbrYSwF0VujcmHA","transcripts":"Hey there, it's ya girl, Z, and today I'm excited to talk about the single most important element of vocal feminization.  Now before we talk about it though, you need to know that every container around you produces a natural frequency.  The fancy word for this is eigenfrequency, and we can hear this with almost everything around you.  That's a cool one, right?  Just like all of these objects, your throat has its own pitch.  Let's take a listen.  Your vocal tract is like a pipe, like this, right?  What I'm doing is I'm tapping that pipe, and depending on the size of that pipe, it produces a range of different frequencies.  By gaining control of this throat tone, we gain control over R1, and that functions like our gender knob.  So that throat pitch, or that R1, it exists as a separate and independent pitch from the one that your vocal folds produce.  So if I sing this note, there's that pitch, and then there's also this pitch, or or those two pitches, the distance between them is the primary factor responsible for determining vocal sex.  So for instance, if I make this one here, those are like close to the same.  If I make this higher, Ah, heat from fire.  But I speak and sing at the same pitch that I originally sang at.  You hear how different that sounds, right?  This neck tone, so to speak, is actually your first vocal tract resonance, okay?  So we call that R1 to simplify it.  Basically, when you talk or sing, that neck tone or the R1, it's no longer audible like a clear pitch.  When you hear it like this, you can hear what it's doing, right?  But you don't get to hear that when you practice voice very well.  Instead, wherever that pitch is, it turns into a loud spot and everything near it gains volume.  That's where the loud spot of my voice is.  And so it sounds really bright, right?  If I put it lower. And now the loud spot of my voice is low and I sound like this, which is not very good. So we have to think of our resonances as modifiers.  Let's see how this modifies it.  If I change this.  This takes on the same quality, okay?  Your vocal folds make sound down here, right?  And then that sound has to travel through the pipe and depending on the natural frequencies or resonant frequencies of the voice, it gets modified just like that.  It's no different than what you just saw there.  In fact, we can even do this with a model of the vocal folds.  So look, if I take this sound here, this is basically what vocal folds do.  And if I attach that to a dark R1, if I take this neck tone low, it sounds very male.  And if I do the same thing but high, it sounds way more feminine.  But why is R1 so important in the first place?  When somebody is exposed to testosterone, the vocal tract expands, which causes that natural frequency to shift lower.  So imagine if I had never been exposed to testosterone.  If I tapped this, it would be like this.  And as testosterone expanded my vocal tract, it caused it to do this. which makes our voices slowly shift like that as they get developed. By learning how to control the shape and size of the vocal tract, we can control that R1, thereby giving us the ability to reverse the primary effect hormones have on the vocal tract.  While there are other resonances and other elements responsible for voice feminization, this is by far the most significant and important difference.  You can get the biggest results from modifying R1 relative to everything else.  And R1 can be controlled by lots of things.  Oropharyngeal closure, larynx height, jaw behaviors, tongue positioning, epilaryngeal modifications.  Technically, when you open and close your nose, it kind of fluctuates as well.  So, but the key is not to get lost in all these little pieces and little components.  We instead focus on the sound.  We do this by hearing, by mimicking and refining our mimicry.  By mimicking the exercises I'm about to do, you will be copying the muscular behaviors that I'm doing, okay?  And then that will allow you to think, what does this feel like?  What does this sound like?  How is this different from what I was doing?  And that is how you learn to control R1.  Here are four basic approaches that you can do to explore R1.  I'm actually about to put out an exciting community document on tons and tons and tons of different approaches, but here are four simple ones that I find to be very effective in my practice.  Exercise number one.  Okay, so I want you to mimic me.  First, we're going to do a voiceless exercise.  This means that we don't use pitch.  Instead, we use the sound H. and we connect it with different resonance, okay?  So let's do this.  Mimic me.  You hear that?  It's just like eh, right?  It's neutral.  Now what you're gonna try and do is you're gonna try and shift it to the same sound, but it's gonna be a lot brighter and glassier.  It'll sound like this.  Try that.  And really listen to it.  I'll do it several times for you.  When you mimic me do that, you're mimicking all those like weird little technical motions.  You're mimicking my tongue behavior.  You're mimicking my oropharyngeal behavior.  You're mimicking my larynx behaviors.  You're mimicking all of these things.  And if you can achieve this sound, you have the correct resonance.  Now, whenever you feel like you have the right sound, try to convert it into pitch either by going quickly to the sound or by going slowly, whichever you think is more useful for you.  So we could try like this.  Heat from fire, fire from heat, right?  Or we could try and just jump straight to it.  Eh, eh, eh, part.  Okay, cool.  Now I'm using that resonance.  And here's what we're really doing.  See, that's just raising the R1.  That's the whole goal of this, okay?  Exercise number two.  I really love this one.  We're gonna make this sound.  Good.  And then we're simply gonna try and modify it like this.  And when you think you have it, just try and say a word.  Part.  Ooh, okay, not bad.  We'll try again.  Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.  Part.  Party.  Peek.  Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.  Pack.  Pack.  Exercise number three.  Now this one, we're actually going to use pitch.  We're gonna try and do it with our lips closed though, making the sound M, like so. Mm, mm, mm. That's a low R1.  Mm.  And what we're gonna do is we're gonna try and shrink that, like so.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  Hear it?  That's the R1 going up.  It sounds buzzy.  It sounds kind of wine-like or bright.  Here's the sound again.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, ma, heat from fire.  See, it's all the same thing.  It doesn't matter if you do it voiceless, if you do it voiced, if you do it through an M, if you do it with an external device, if you do it when tapping your neck, it's all about how big the space is back there and how that plays with the sounds that you create.  Now make sure that you're not just moving pitch, like so, mm, mm.  That's the sound of the resonance not moving at all while the pitch climbs towards it and the ratio gets narrower.  Exercise number four.  These are called vowel gradients.  These are pitched exercises.  And what you're going to try and do is you're going to try and incrementally make this brighter.  So mimic me.  I'm starting dark.  And then I'm going to go... and then I'm going to go bright. Oh, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah. And you can do that with any vowel. Uh, uh, uh, uh, eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, eh, eh, eh.  Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. All of those were examples of the R1 going up, okay?  And if I do that with tapping my neck, it's all that, okay?  Okay, okay, I get it, but how do I use these exercises?  If you properly mimic these exercises, your vocal tract will be shrinking.  These should be treated as tools to teach you the general movement and feeling associated with altering R1.  Doing these over and over and over and over without understanding why, that's not gonna help you, okay?  Do these four to 12 times, and if you don't feel like you're making any progress, put them down and come back two hours later, or three hours later, or a week later.  This is not something that you like grind at, this control.  It's about precisely moving around and gaining new awareness of what you can control, okay?  These exercises are demonstrations of what it sounds like when we shrink the vocal tract, thus raise R1 to female levels and beyond female averages.  The fundamental challenge of voice feminization is learning how to create... stabilize and maintain a higher R1 during speech without any harsh effects happening like you're squeaking or scratching or you feel tense or your voice sounds awkward.  All right, so some key things that we wanna make sure that you don't do though, don't strain, don't over tense, don't protrude your jaw, don't flip into falsetto.  These are all common things that happen.  This shouldn't be tense, okay?  If you're doing it right, it's not going to be tense.  It is not tense for me.  So if you're feeling tension, that is a key indicator that means you're not reaching for the right muscles back there.  So in summary, thank you so much for watching.  I hope this is helpful.  Resonance is not a place.  It's not a feeling.  It's not magic.  It is simply how cavities and chambers and rooms interact with the sounds inside of them and cause them to change.

Living with chronic pain is hard.  I think most people can agree on that.  Uh, pain sucks.  High pain levels can be incredibly scary, and the pain and fear combined can inspire urgent suicidal thoughts.  It's a tough thing.  There are a few ways my EDS physically and visibly manifests, like hypermobility, the fact that I use mobility aids, and most commonly my power chair, and I wear braces on and off because I can't really wear them all the time.  But there are certain aspects that you'd never know unless I communicated them with you.  So I wanted to share some of those things with you.  Gravity is invisible.  Pain is invisible.  The combo of these for me are not very pleasant.  I am fighting... monsters all the time that nobody else can see.  Whenever I lift anything with my arm extended, and I mean anything beyond like a pound or so, like it could be my phone.  Let's experiment with my phone.  I can feel my wrist turning in and my elbow also start to turn in.  It's very uncomfortable and scary because it feels on edge of dislocating every time.  Using my fingers to lift my phone or to navigate the touch screen, um, it feels like my fingers are sliding off the joint.  Uh, like there's mud holding the joints together.  And so my fingers are just sliding off the edge.  As I explain these things, reminder that I'm trying to describe the fact that when you see me holding my phone like this, you can't see what it feels like inside.  You just see a hand holding a phone.  I'm trying to explain to you what is happening inside.  Does that make sense?  I hope it makes sense.  Trying to do something here.  Trying to pull up my pants with my fingers hurts.  Sometimes holding a glass of water hurts, and I particularly mean a glass, because glass tends to be heavier than plastic or other materials.  Yeah, the weight typically is too much for the joints in my fingers or my wrists to handle.  So again, as I say these things, I keep feeling like the urge to like explain like I'm technically capable of doing the things that I'm talking about usually for an extremely short period of time, but I'm risking injury and I'm feeling really painful things.  while they're happening, and it's just something that a lot of people wouldn't notice about the way that I'm doing it.  When I lie down without support, my knees dip into the pocket or bend backward, and it's very uncomfortable and painful.  If you were to see me lying down, I'd probably just look really lazy to you, but I am actively trying to calm down my pain levels, usually in my lower back or in my leg muscles.  And the way that looks is just either I'm lying flat or in the fetal position.  It depends which pain I'm trying to alleviate at the time.  So I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user, and sometimes I can walk, but for an extremely limited amount of time.  Sometimes I will be using a cane, sometimes leg braces, and sometimes without any aids whatsoever.  And then when that happens, when I'm on my feet, what people cannot see is how the joints in my feet all kind of collapse or crash downward, causing this sharp pain with every step.  When I'm at rest, like in the way I'm sitting right now, I have a very average arch in my foot.  But upon weight bearing, upon putting pressure on them, they appear flat.  And it's really painful.  I guess like the way I would try to make an analogy for it is if someone asks you to put all your body weight on your fingertips.  maybe some people can do that but I feel like the average person cannot and that's what it's like to put weight on my feet.  people cannot see how I struggle and focus to keep my ankles and knees from giving out.  There's a lot of internal tension and stress that's happening when I'm on my feet.  I am trying with all intensity to make sure that the floor is level, that there are no cracks, that there are no inclines, declines that I'm unaware of, anything that's gonna potentially set me off balance.  And I'm also concentrating really hard on keeping my muscles as tense as possible in my legs so that I have a chance of my joints not dislocating while I walk.  When I walk, I feel like I'm stretching like a rubber band or a rubber leash that's around me from my starting point.  And the further I get, or more accurately, the longer I'm on my feet, the more effort and strength I need to keep the leash from shooting me back.  Or in a literal way, cause me to collapse, fall, injure myself or faint.  Sometimes I try to walk around with or without my cane in very small shops or into a restaurant as long as I can get a close parking space or be dropped off at the door because my ability to be on my feet is so limited.  But if I run into a situation where I'm stopped in place, such as having to wait in line, wait for a seat for whatever reason.  I cannot do it without either collapsing or maybe having a seat on the floor.  Though now I have a cane with a seat on the top so that situation happens a lot less now.  I usually have to keep pacing to try to keep the pressure off my legs as much as I can.  Because when I'm standing still the pressure becomes too much and it triggers extremely high pain levels that I Cannot handle Because I have dysautonomia.  In case you don't know what that is.  Well, let me try and do my best and give a little quick explanation.  All right when I stand up my blood doesn't.  so my blood kind of like drops really quickly to my feet and I lose the blood to my head.  My heart kind of starts to panic and starts to race at over a hundred beats per minute.  That is called tachycardia.  And, um, you know, trying to, you know, pump blood back up to my head and it's usually not successful.  so that's when light light so that's when lightheadedness dizziness fainting spells come into play.  um so because of dysautonomia the further i get or the longer i'm up or sometimes even if i get up too fast.  sometimes if i'm triggered by hot temperatures um yeah i i get tachycardia and sometimes i become dizzy or Short of breath.  So there's a lot of struggles that are happening internally when I am on my feet.  I am pulling this rubber leash, metaphorically speaking, stretching it out as best as I can And no one can see that.  And this is particularly invisible because it causes my literal absence.  My fatigue.  It has caused me to sleep for 16 hours in a day.  It's made me miss things.  At minimum, just my day.  I hate missing my day, my life, losing time out of my life because it feels like gravity is too heavy.  The air is too thick.  I'm being pulled into the ground and my eyes roll back in my head.  I lose cognitive function and then I'm trapped in this restless sleep.  I can't participate in anything.  I can't fulfill my responsibilities.  I can't do any of the things that I love to do.  I'm just out of the picture.  It is both very strange and very informative to have the kind of disabilities that can be visible and invisible depending on a variety of things.  When I use my power chair, I am extremely visible as a disabled person.  I'm pretty much the stereotypical image of what people think of when they think the word disabled.  When I use my wheelchair in public, I get all these blatantly ableist things said to me, some benevolent, some just cruel.  I experience a lot of accessibility barriers and often feel pressured into risking triggering my symptoms or risking injury in order to make something accessible to me.  When I use my cane, I think a lot of people perceive it as something temporary.  I get a lot more, what happened?  questions and get better soon comments.  When people ask me what happened, I just say, I'm disabled.  Nothing special.  Because I don't know.  I don't know what you want me to tell you.  I can't stand up for long periods without my cane, but it's a long-winded explanation as you've seen in this video.  And then I can do very small things without any aids, like step out of my car the two feet to pump gas into it, or walking around a small space that has safe flooring and plenty of places to sit for when I need to.  And that is such an exhilarating yet terrifying experience.  It feels strangely nice to blend in in the world.  There's nothing that makes me stand out or... I don't get as many stares or inappropriate questions or comments.  Um, and that feels good, but now here's the part where I test if you were paying attention or not.  Um, it is painful every time I'm on my feet.  Um, so I am putting myself through pain every time that I do it.  And it is not visible and people don't really have a way to know.  There's no signal for them to know when I've reached my limit.  And so when I do reach my limit, like it sends me into a panic.  Like I need a seat.  I need a seat because I can't handle the pain anymore.  And it sometimes makes me worried.  about people later denying my disability because they saw me standing or walking once.  It makes me scared that they will deny me the accessibility that I need.  It makes me scared of violence.  that happens a lot to people who are accused of faking their disabilities.  And I guess I'm making this video to just put it out there that you never know what is going on in someone's body or what they are experiencing just by looking at them.  Maybe you can take a good guess, but you'll never really know.  So many of us are extremely good at camouflaging ourselves, our pain, our fatigue, our various other symptoms.  I think it's really rather presumptuous of people to think that they are capable of deciding whether or not someone is disabled just by looking at them or whatever evidence they believe they've collected.  It's not only an ableist mission, but it is a mission with way too much risk.  to take it upon oneself to try and make the judgment call on whether or not someone is really, truly disabled, there is way too much chance that when you decide they are faking, that you are wrong.  And thus, you are just harassing a disabled person, which is not a cool thing to do.  I don't know.  Just saying.  If you would like to share with me some symptoms or disabilities that you believe other people would never know about you unless you communicated them, please feel free to talk to me about it in the comments.  I would love to hear from you and I will see you eventually.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0nm001s2cdvisg8sn8uk","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCznS4Pk3VcTIfDUuWrQtdzQ","channel.name":"Annie Elainey","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUMs5MgxX-swWUepaOvpmQ-tl21N33UNC7s5nHJRg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2011-11-04T03:43:54.000Z","summary":"Living with chronic pain and disabilities can be incredibly challenging.

Why does it mean a lot? The Trans Pride?  What's Trans Pride mean to you? I either want to be a tattoo artist or an ambulance driver.  They're quite different things, but... No, I don't even know what I want to be anymore. With our hairy legs. We'll be the best. Can you see that?  Just to let everyone know this is my best mate.  Trans people kind of have to grow up more quickly and mature more quickly.  So I'm just used to hanging around with people that are older because I get along with them.  I should be starting T the start of next year.  Yeah, so I came out when I was nine.  I was like quite young when I started Blockers. Puberty blockers give people like Kai more time to solidify their gender identity without developing secondary sex characteristics. I had an appointment recently at the Tavistock in London and our second appointment is the second day I go back to school. I'm hoping for the blockers just to make the whole package, make the whole package really, make me happy and that will be that, I'll be perfect.  If it's too late there's no point of getting blockers because everything's gonna grow anyway.  It needs to happen soon because otherwise It's not going to change anything.  It's not going to work.  So I need to think quick and they need to think quick. If someone asks me if I am on testosterone or blockers, I'm currently on blockers.  I'll be on testosterone when I'm 14 or 16. If Kai decides not to transition, his puberty blockers can be reversed by stopping treatment. There's obviously people at school that are growing some facial hair, you know, getting some guns, but obviously I do feel like I'm falling behind a little bit, like, with my puberty, but, I mean, it's only a little bit left till I start T, so I'm not really worrying about it. I've been on T for a year and three months now, I think, so I was still on the blocker and still on T at the same time, so it was a bit confusing while they were doing that, but now I'm on the full dough, so I've started growing my facial hair on the sides a little bit.  Actually, you can't really see it here.  My friends have their beards now and I'm just watching them grow up and turning into a man and I just want to be on the same level as them.  I've managed to, I guess, get used to that feeling. I mean, I always knew that there was something wrong, but because it wasn't, like, so open and out there as it is now, I didn't really know what it was called.  And then I had a counsellor and the only reason I had the confidence to come out was because of him.  He said, draw how you feel, because I wasn't the best at drawing.  talking about my emotions and talking about how I feel.  So I just drew down me with a willy and my guns like this and he showed my mum and my mum obviously didn't want to say anything to me in case I was just being an idiot and she didn't want to put words into my mouth.  So she waited and then about a month later I told her. Soon as I told her it just got off my chest and I was fine and then she just like helped me with everything. I mean, I do wish it was earlier, but I'm proud that I even came out at nine.  I was completely, like, crapping myself.  Like, when I went into her room, I honestly thought that it was going to be the end of our relationship.  And then for her to be like, oh, I already knew.  I was just waiting for you to tell me.  And I was like, you've literally made me crap myself, waiting for me to be able to tell you, and you already know.  And then when I told my sister, we went to Yo Sushi.  It's my favourite place. I've always known from the start you'd be a boy, and I'm glad and proud of what you've turned out to be.  And in the future, what's going to happen next? I've always, like, grown up, like, being a boy, but I never really knew anything about it. Like a tomboy, that's what I was like, yeah. So, obviously, I first, I think, got spoken about it in school and in assembly, and then, obviously, I watched your video. Before I came out, I was there for only a month.  I wanted to get it, like, just out as soon as possible because there was no point in, for me personally, to wait for it.  to make relationships and then tell them.  Where I used to go a club, he told my form and then everyone started talking about it and now the whole school knows.  So I was there for like a month, made a few friends and then when I told them they were all just fine with it.  So from that point I knew that it was going to be fine like school-wise because I was so scared because I moved from Cheltenham. The boys discussed binders which helped to flatten the chest. The other day I actually got a binder that's like a half one and it's made me feel a bit weird because it feels like a bra. I like having my stomach tucked in. Yeah.  When I was with my ex, when my binder was rubbing in, she'd put cream on it.  I think that was the kind of realisation when I knew that I could have trust and also she trusted not trusted me.  but like kind of wasn't like awkward to kind of do them things because some people would be like i'm not touching that or like i'm not like doing that.  so it's it's good to get that sense of like that they actually like you but shows they care as well.  Oh, I tried to put my middle finger up and I can't.  I just can't wait for the top surgery to be fair.  Yes.  And bottom, I'm just... Being out and running around crazy with no top on in the sun. We'll be going on jogs every morning.  We'll be going on jogs without a top.  Yeah. The main reason I want to be a tattoo artist is because I just love tattoos.  I want to be covered.  So my neck down to my ankles, and then I want to get some of my toes done. I think I'm going to wait to be a tattoo artist to get my first tattoo done. Got another four years yet, mate.  That's fine.  I'll wait four years.  You alright?  Just wanted to ask you about like tea and everything.  Were you on blockers when you were younger? Yeah, I think I was about 12 when I started. When did you start tea?  Just before my 16th birthday. January this year I started on the treatment of hormone blockers which just stops all the like the hormones and everything going through.  I have to take them every four weeks and it feels so much better now because you feel like you've kind of stopped And that means you can carry on as yourself and you don't have to go through all the things that biological females would have to. How many times did you have to go to the tavern to stop and stuff? Too many. It is such a long process.  So have you been to the museum? No, I've never been to a museum of transology before. Have you gone in them?  Yeah. Guys, hi!  Hi, I'm E-Jane, lovely to meet you and welcome to the Museum of Transology.  We've got here in the gallery the largest collection of objects and stories in a museum in the world that relate to trans lives.  It's real trans people's stories, by them, about them.  One of my favourites is the one that was actually done by Fox that says gender roles are dead and it's incredibly popular.  We are part of this movement of protest that we're still struggling for equal rights, that we still want to share our experiences and that we're brave enough to do it quite boldly and like put it on our t-shirts.  Have you ever seen anything like this in a museum before?  No, never.  And I think that's the point, isn't it?  Unless we have collections like this, then the only way people are going to find out about trans lives are through the media, right?  And we need our voices to be heard.  Do you recognise what these are? testosterone, estrogen. Yeah.  Even though they're all hormones, every single story is different.  And you guys have had experiences as well that are quite unique with your hormone taking, haven't you?  You're about to start. Should be starting a month before my 16th. And before your hormones, did you, you started with your blockers? Oh, yeah.  So I started blockers when I was nine. The best thing that could have happened to me, really.  And honey, are you excited about the fact that you're nearly 16 then?  Yeah, I am.  I can't wait.  What are you most excited about? I'm probably most excited about my voice deepening and my beard growing. Starting on that puberty that you're supposed to be on and then you feel that that's right for you, that is you.  And that's been the best part. It's such a different experience from what I went through.  I came out as trans, what, 25 years ago or something, and the struggle that I went through having to get my hormones on the black market, you know, not being able to get medical attention, being forced to have psychotherapy, and then as well having to fight what my body had already done to me, you know, and work backwards instead of being positive about moving forwards. Taylor sees a donation to the museum from his friend Chrissy Bentley, who died by suicide. Here we've got Chrissy's RAF hat, which I think is really important that it's been kept here and it keeps that history and that memory. And what I think is really interesting about it is that she's chosen to give us her boy's cap.  because she didn't need it anymore and she makes a joke about it.  So there's that side of Chrissie that we can remember.  that's not just the sadness of her passing, actually the memory that we've got protected is her being funny and cheeky as well. it's nice you know because obviously everyone's got that kind of non-physical memory of just what a wonderful person she was.  but then you also kind of get that physical history and memory for her as well. i'm so grateful to her that she that's such an important object for her.  you know it marks such a significant time in her career.  so yeah her memory lives on because of her. Fox is probably the reason that I actually had the confidence to come out.  So yeah, just seeing these, it's really good.  I remember wearing one of these the first Pride I went to as well. I can be myself there.  I don't have to worry about, obviously, who's looking at me, what everyone's thinking.  It's also good to see everyone that you don't usually get to see all the time that go specifically to go there. So, yeah.  You're kind of celebrating the whole time of just being your kind of unique self and everyone being together and celebrating that. Yeah. Just kind of having the confidence to kind of go out there and you say, I'm here, this is me, and this is all of us together, and it's fantastic. I think it's my happiest day of the year.  It's my trans Christmas.  Just seeing everyone so positive.  And like you say, just so many different people.  There's not one trans, you know. There's different stories as well. Yeah, just like this collection, right?  We're a really diverse group of people with really diverse experiences.  And sometimes when they come all together, you just feel stronger knowing you're part of a big trans community.  By remembering that we have made progress, we can feel empowered.  To move forward and keep going.  I feel very very hopeful meeting guys like you that that we have a positive bright trans future When we're given this space and we're listened to and we're allowed to control it ourselves.  I feel very positive.  You are the future.  Oh, so I have to stand on my tippy-tails?  Guys, thanks so much for coming.  Next step is that I want something from both of you, okay?  Excellent.  Okay, well, I'm looking forward to that, all right?  It's a promise, yeah?  Great.  Okay, guys. I reckon just to people that are out there, even if, you know, you're scared and, like, it's hard for you, The best thing for yourself is just to tell whoever you're with.  One, it is like the most heaviest weight lifted off your shoulders, even if like your mum or your dad or your carer doesn't accept it.  Like there is so many people that will, you can message.","channel.id":"clxmi0mat00v7cdvio57tdapf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCsDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA","channel.name":"My Genderation","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/g864bFMBAXso_fkzd73ZmSXVmy9E2HHX__MiClzVA-IEppDPNVUpMVC4-dH8_O59GaGahuLOLg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I'm a 14-year-old trans boy who's been on puberty blockers since I was 9.

I don't feel that that is who I am as a person.  I don't feel like this one mistake does define me, but I do sincerely from the bottom of my heart apologize that if I made the son feel as if I assaulted him or if I hurt his feelings. This video was brought to you by the lovely members of my Patreon.  Hey guys, it's Kat and I'm back with another random reaction video.  You guys know I've been trying some new stuff out on this YouTube channel, so hopefully you guys have been enjoying these really random videos.  I wanted to talk to you guys about something that has truly shocked me, I guess.  I've only watched this video once, so I wanted to watch it a second time with you guys and get a reaction from me and also get your guys' reaction.  So we're going to be talking about the Maya Ponseto case. You might remember this video.  Mia Ponsetto approached 14-year-old Keyon Harrell Jr.  at a New York City hotel last month, accusing him of stealing her phone.  His father, jazz musician Keyon Harrell, recorded the encounter and accused Ponsetto of racial profiling. You see two black people? No, I'm not letting him walk away with my phone! Now, the video shows Ponsetto trying to stop the teenager from leaving the hotel lobby and then rushing toward them.  Hotel surveillance video shows the 22-year-old woman tackling Keon Jr.  Now, he never had the phone.  It turned up several minutes later at the hotel.  New York City detectives went to California yesterday to coordinate Ponsetto's arrest in connection with the confrontation.  She was contacted at a traffic stop in Ventura County near Los Angeles.  Officials say that police had to pull her out of the car when she refused to get out. This has led to a lot of conversation on social media about racial profiling.  And she had this interview with Gayle, which was truly shocking to me.  So I thought that I would kind of have a conversation with you guys about it.  I'm very curious what you guys have to say about this.  So let's watch this reaction. Mia, help me understand.  what made you think that Keon had your phone?  That's why I'm confused.  Why did you think he had it? I was approaching the people that had been exiting the hotel because in my mind, anybody exiting... She's got a hat on.  that says daddy. Might be the one that is trying to steal my phone.  I admit, yes, I could have approached the situation differently or maybe not yelled at him like that and made him feel, you know, maybe some sort of... inferior way, making him feel as if I was hurting his feelings because that's not my intention.  I consider myself to be super sweet.  I really never ever meant for it to hurt him or his father either. Are you saying that you were stopping everybody in the lobby, asking them about your phone?  Is that what you're saying? Not everyone. Just the people.  Just the black people. In the meantime, while the hotel manager was checking the footage, I just wanted to do my part. Oh, my God, her lawyer looks dead in the eye.  Like, she's dead.  Like, it doesn't want to be there. I know you've seen the video.  When you look at the video, the reaction seems very extreme.  Yeah.  It doesn't seem like it's someone who's super sweet. Not at all. If you were alone in New York and, you know, you're going to spend time with your family during the holidays and you lose the one thing that gets stolen from you that has all of the access to the only way that you're able to get back home. OK, but I would randomly attack people is what I'm saying to you.  I know you said you could have handled it better, but I just don't think I would randomly attack people in the manner in which you did.  What do you think when you look at that video?  You're standing there in your leggings and your flip flops and it looks like you're just going nuts, for lack of a better word. You literally did assault him. I don't believe one mistake defines anybody.  You literally did.  But I think when I look at that particular video, you did more than just accuse him.  The video seems to show that you physically attacked this young boy. Yeah, ugh.  God, I can't believe she... But at the end of the day, the dad did end up slamming me to the ground and pulling my hair. We don't see that on tape.  That's not on the tape, hon.  It really isn't, though. I... I will say that. Yeah, but I think, you know, the video we saw, it looked like you had just attacked his son. Yeah, the footage shows me attacking his son of attacking him.  how?  Yelling at him?  Yes.  Okay, I apologize.  Can we move on? I know you're saying I don't need to, I just want to apologize, but I do think that there should be some context to your actions that day. Okay, so basically, I'm a 22-year-old girl.  I am, I don't, racism is, how is one girl accusing a guy about a phone? You jumped on him though. Where is the context in that? Mia, Mia. What is the deeper story here? Mia, that's not the problem.  You have to at least understand your actions that day.  You seem to have attacked this little boy, this young boy, this teenager.  You seem to have attacked this teenager about the phone.  And then it turned out he didn't even have your phone.  That's the thing.  I mean, you're saying I'm 22 years old, but you are old enough to know better.  So I will say you're 22.  I get it. Enough.  The hotel did have my phone.  The hotel did end up having my phone.  I did get my belongings returned to me. All right.  Wow. Girl, listen.  Now, I have so many things to say about this because there's just something about this that just blows my mind.  I can't imagine doing this.  There is no part of me that can see myself being this bold, being this disrespectful.  Now I know every black person in the audience is going to understand where I'm coming from with this.  But like, to me, I look at Gail and Gail is like my mom.  Okay.  And you would never, Ooh, don't you ever raise your hand to your mother like that.  Don't you ever raise your hand to your mother like that.  Every older black woman that I see, even if we're not related, there's familiarity there for me.  And I'm like, that's like my mom or my aunt or somebody older than me who I have respect for, right?  And there's just something really wild to me about feeling so comfortable doing that.  Here's the thing, I agree with her on a couple of things, right?  First and foremost, if I was traveling and I lost my phone, I would freak out.  You guys know I used to travel a lot for work.  I have been definitely in a similar position where something messes up with my phone and I freak out.  I understand that emotion of being alone in a city.  with yourself relying entirely on your phone and not really knowing how to emotionally handle it.  I have been there.  I empathize with that.  I also agree with her when she says that you're not defined by the one mistake you make.  Absolutely.  But what blows my mind, what literally blows my mind is how All of this happened, right?  All of this is true.  And it's like, she doesn't even want to sort of even try to put on a show to counteract that image, right?  And what's wild to me was this was the interview that she could have taken and she could have presented herself differently.  She could have been kinder, nicer, and less of the exact person we saw of her on camera.  And she might have, you know, gotten some sympathy from some people, probably misguided people, but she would have gotten some sympathy, right?  I understand and respect that there are some people who we have all these conversations about respectability politics, and I get it.  I'm not going to come here and act like respectability politics are not unhelpful in so many ways, but she could have tried.  She's going to try.  Like if I went, if I was going on trial for something, I would not show up to court like this.  Let's just get that straight.  I would not show up to court like this.  I wouldn't even show up to court showing this much shoulder.  You know, we can criticize all of the reasons why in society as holding those things up is unhealthy and wrong and patriarchal.  And I hear you on that.  I really, truly do.  But to me, there's a time and a place.  And this interview where you're trying to, encourage people to see you in a slightly different light, this interview that is giving you an opportunity to speak up for yourself, that's really not the time to wear a daddy hat and to be brazen.  Sometimes when I see people like this, it's like, we just live in totally different worlds and we just have, I hate to say it, totally different upbringings.  Personally, For me, what I'm stuck with is the fact that she cared so little about this, that this is how she decided to present herself. We're learning more about the young woman who falsely accused a black teenager of stealing her iPhone. Any regrets, Maya? Her identity is now revealed to be Maya Ponsetto, a photographer caught up with her as she was leaving a McDonald's in Southern California where she lives. I'm actually 22, so I don't know what the problem is here.  And I'm also Puerto Rican, so thank you. Now, I know that there are some people who watch my channel for some strange reason and they want to debate with me about stuff like racial profiling.  We're genuinely not gonna have that conversation.  I have been in stores and been followed through the store because the people who worked at the store assumed that I didn't have money to actually patronize the store.  I go to a grocery store pretty close to me, actually, and I remember walking down you know, one aisle, and then there would be an employee who just happened to go down that aisle.  Every aisle I went, he followed me the whole way up to the point where I got to the register, like I was gonna steal something from this grocery store, which is in my neighborhood that I patronize every other day.  Right?  It was insulting.  And this is just part of being black.  Being racially profiled, it's part of it.  And I don't think that you're some sort of victim or something for acknowledging that.  That's part of being black, is people are going to project really shitty racist stuff on you, right?  And she took that and then translated that into assaulting a child.  I know that there are some people who watch my channel who are 14.  I love you, baby.  But to me, you're a child.  You are a child.  And a 14 year old is a child.  And she, and she was like, I'm 22.  I'm 22.  Like her assaulting somebody who is, I'm not great at math, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, seven years, eight years.  eight years younger than you see a girl.  I'm an artist.  Like I'm not getting around, but like you assaulting somebody who's eight years younger than you is like, Like that's like, I'm sorry, you're much older than him.  You're much older than him.  You're almost 10 years older than him.  Why are you making it seem like, and this is what bothered me the most.  Why are you making it seem like you're just this delicate flower who, you know, does know, isn't capable of doing harm.  Something else I wanted to talk about was apparently Maya Ponseto is Puerto Rican.  I think that people need to understand that Anti-Blackness and racial profiling Black people does not only happen at a white person's behest.  A lot of times people of all races have internalized white supremacy, anti-blackness, et cetera, in a way where them profiling a black person, them expressing similar racist ideals towards a black person is just encouraged.  They're encouraged to do so so that they feel a closer proximity to whiteness.  And that's something that, I mean, a lot of cultures is very, very prevalent.  Anti-blackness is not something that is only practiced by white people.  I don't know what to say.  To me, there's something about our culture that got her here.  And that's something that I wanted to bring up.  There's something about the way that she... got here.  that like is really hard for me to process.  Cause I mean, listen, I'm, I'm 30.  Okay.  I'm 30.  And I just, I don't know.  I don't know me.  Like, is it the internet?  Is the internet making people just be like, Oh, whatever.  You know, I'm like, there's, it's like fashionable to be disrespectful.  Like, Oh fuck.  I mean, I understand.  Fuck authority.  I get all that, you know, totally there with you.  But like, There's just a general indecent treatment of other people that I have a really hard time wrapping my mind around.  Like I would never go out of my way to be mean to another person.  I would never go out of my way to ruin somebody's day and be unpleasant towards them.  And I have such a hard time understanding how she could do that and then walk away from it and then feel good about herself.  There's something inside me that really just genuinely struggles with that.  How could she do that and then feel like people are upset with her for no reason?  Yes, I agree with her that not everyone should be defined by the one mistake that they make.  I totally 100% agree.  But... There's not being defined by your mistake and then there's not owning up to your mistake and that process of you not owning up to your mistake, making the mistake even worse because it truly does.  I, again, fully identify with the emotion of being in a different city with a phone that you rely on and that phone disappearing or not working, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  I get that.  That's a real valid emotion that I have no problem saying.  is valid, right?  But you don't take your shit and then make somebody else's day terrible because of it.  You just don't.  You just don't.  You know, and that even goes to just how you treat staff.  Like you don't treat people like that.  And it makes me sad that our culture has shifted in a way where treating people like that is seen as like badass.  You know, it's like badass to like put your hand up in front of a news presenter and say, okay, Gail, stop.  As she's trying to help you, as she's giving you a platform for you to speak for yourself and defend yourself against all the people online.  Like, it blows my mind.  Anyway, on that note, I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.  If you made it through this entire video, please put this emoji in the comment box below.  We love the people who put the emojis here.  All the people who put the emojis here are just the hottest, coolest people with the best phones, you know, and the best attitude.  People who put the emoji in the comment section, like, they're on another level.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, they're definitely better than everyone else.  I don't like to say that out loud, but we're talking one-on-one, so we can say that.  But if you put the emoji in the comment section, I'm not saying everybody else is inferior.  I'm just saying that you are better than them.  So do with that what you will.  Anyway, I'll talk to you guys next time.  Bye.

Assault, transphobia, hate crime, gaslighting, and photos of physical harm.  Anna Montgomery is a 20-year-old trans woman from Newtowners who was in Belfast with her boyfriend, Jamie Girvan, when she was assaulted by someone who smashed up her nose and cut her forehead.  Now what's particularly shocking is the fact of where the assault took place.  Anna wasn't assaulted in a dark alley somewhere, or even outside the restaurant as her attacker waited for her to leave the relative safety there.  No.  She was assaulted while she was sitting at the table, in a lit room with dozens of people around her.  That's how bold her attacker was.  The police service of Northern Ireland are investigating what took place, and they are treating this as a transphobic hate crime.  i.e.  a crime in which the culprit was at least partially motivated by the victim's trans status.  Now, an important thing to note about hate crimes is that they're not isolated incidents by their very nature.  A hate crime targets an entire community by declaring that they're not safe in society.  Therefore, the basis upon which hate crime occur is informed by the larger social narrative.  And that's something the couple of papers that have reported on the assault so far have failed to address.  The social context behind Anna being assaulted.  Which is where the current trans hysteria, something brought to the forefront of the public's attention recently with the transphobia displayed by once beloved author J.K.  Rowling, comes into play.  It's no secret that, over the last six years, transphobia in the UK has come to a boiling point.  We are constantly coming under attack by those with large platforms, being painted as a threat to women and children, or portrayed as lost lesbians forced to medically transition.  Even our own government refuses to stand by the majority of the British public who agree with demedicalising legal transition.  Because the sad fact is, bigotry doesn't require a majority to harm the people it targets, it just needs a platform whilst going unchecked.  Now, at the epicentre of much of the discourse surrounding the topic is the idea that trans women are actually mentally ill cis men, or cis men using crossdressing as a way to gain access to and harm cis women and children.  And this is a perspective that JK Rowling seems to share, liking a tweet from sentient trashcan Janice Turner in 2018 that stated quote, No fox has a right to live in a hen house even if he identifies as a hen, on the misogynist thinking which puts a rapist in a women's prison.  This is how JK Rowling, as with many transphobes, sees trans women.  So when Rowling published her latest book, Trouble Blood, a book in which a cross-dressing serial killer gets frills from masturbating in women's underwear and by stealing jewellery from his victims, The message is not the least bit subtle.  Fact is, this is not the first time.  As discussed in a previous video, Rowling's earlier book of the same series, The Silkworm, had the protagonist threaten a trans woman with prison rape, telling her that it quote, \"...won't be fun for you, Pippa.  Not  pre-op.\".  End quote.  This is how Rowling portrays trans people, as mentally disturbed men who are a danger to cis women and can justifiably be threatened with rape.  Now there's nothing new about this.  Indeed, in 1992 there were numerous protests about the transphobic depictions shown in The Silence of the Lambs, the ways in which it fed into transphobic narratives surrounding the trans predator.  How, as Leslie Feinberg put it in 1992, The film turns reality upside down.  It is actually transvestites and transsexuals who have been the victims of Grizzly murders.  end quote.  The difference though is that The Silence of the Lambs was published long before the 2014 trans tipping point, when the trans community and, by extension, trans discourse entered the public eye.  Back then, we were almost a mythical creature, on par with the boogeyman.  We were largely hypothetical, out of mind for most people, save for the occasional article treating us like a one-person freak show.  Now we're far more real, coming out at people's work, their children's schools, and within their social circles.  We're also being discussed in the news daily.  Sadly, a lot of that news uncritically parrots myths surrounding the dangers of trans people, like those forwarded by Rowling in her bigoted manifesto published back in June.  This has changed things in that we are no longer a hypothetical threat.  In the minds of bigots, we've become a tangible one.  We're in every school, every office, every home.  They can no longer brush us off as a fictional monster or freak occurrence.  We're a part of society, one they've been told is inherently dangerous.  Since this is an issue of narratives, let's examine those surrounding Rowling's manifesto, which was a response to criticism Rowling had received for her attack on an article which used inclusive language in its discussion of menstrual health.  Rowling's initial response perpetuates the narrative of inclusivity as violence.  She treats the simple act of acknowledging that trans men and some non-binary people menstruate as this grave violation of women's rights.  In doing so, Rowling unleashed her millions of followers in a tidal wave of abuse, targeting the article and its authors.  Which is ironic, considering that the article was written by three cis women campaigning for menstrual health.  But I guess the abuse of women is feminist, so long as it's for the noble cause of abusing trans people back into the closet.  On their own, these narratives are simple Davo.  Deny the behaviour, attack the individual doing the confronting, and reverse the roles of victim and offender.  What makes her behaviour truly untouchable is how she frames any criticism whatsoever as an act of oppression.  as if she's owed a platform and money and support, and as though people using their freedom of speech to publicly challenge her horrifically destructive behaviour is somehow a violation of her freedom of speech.  All of which culminated in months of her pretending to be the victim of cancel culture, a term which, by this point, has been watered down to mean criticism of people with substantial power.  How in spite of still being a billionaire, in spite of her books still becoming number one bestsellers, apparently people criticising her for the bigoted things she says is cancelling her.  Indeed, when a group of people started the Rest In Peace Rowling hashtag to metaphorically signify that the author was dead to them, bigots began running the story as members of the trans community threatened to murder Rowling.  This darvo is very plain to see once you step back and look at it.  Meanwhile, trans people are suffering real violence.  When this whole thing really kicked off in 2016, anti-trans hate crime rose by a staggering 81%.  Yet this is only the tip of the iceberg.  As reported by the BBC in 2019, the queer charity Stonewall stated that it quote, \"...estimated that two in five trans people had experienced a hate crime or incident in the past  year.\".  End quote.  With Laura Russell, a representative from the charity, adding that quote, These statistics are the real-life consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere, from the front pages of newspapers to social media and on our streets.  End quote.  Just to be clear, Rowling is not the sole source of all of this hate.  She's merely the latest focal point in a struggle that's been going on for the past several years.  No singular piece, act, or person is responsible for the current state of trans rights in the UK, but it would be unwise to ignore just how central Rowling, as a figure, has become to the transphobic cause.  how they use her vast wealth and platform with over 14 million followers to extend the reach of their violent narrative.  It's a cumulative effect we're witnessing, the result of which are cases like that of Anna Montgomery.  Targeted assaults on people in crowded areas are incredibly rare, with many waiting for the opportune moment to strike, as we saw with Owen Jones, whose assaulter waited for him to leave the pub he was visiting.  But if you've been drip fed this narrative that trans women are an active danger to cis women and children, that they're attacking innocent celebrities and are trying to indoctrinate children into unnecessary medical practices?  Suddenly assaulting them in a lit restaurant not only becomes justifiable in the mind of the assailant, but noble.  They've been emboldened by a constant diet of transphobic narratives, made to feel like their own prejudices are rational.  This is how everyone has had a part to play in violence, like that seen in Anna's case.  By arguing that trans women are a danger to women and children, whether in bathrooms, sports, or prisons, as well as parroting the myth that trans men are naive, vulnerable girls tricked into medically transitioning by some insidious trans conspiracy.  When this is the state of trans discourse, a targeted attack on a trans person cannot be treated as an isolated incident.  This was not some extreme person acting out on their own.  This was someone acting on the ideas that people like JK Rowling have attempted to normalise.  This was so on responding to what they perceived as a threat specifically because of the bigotry that goes unchecked in the UK media.  This is a problem that won't be addressed until we tackle it at its root cause.  Unless we do, we will be seeing a lot more assaults.

I am so sorry.  I haven't shared a video in so long.  I actually filmed the one you're about to watch in July.  And at the end of it, I apologized if, if it was going to be a while before I could do a video again, because what happened was I moved both my house and my office.  I'm actually still in the process of moving my office right now.  And it just kind of took over my life for quite some time.  So what I've done is I've split up the next chapter, between two videos will be this one and then the next one that I end up uploading there.  I didn't plan that ahead of time.  So there might be a very awkward end to this video.  I'll be sure to let you know when that happens and then we'll pick up again in the next video.  So just wanted to preface this to let you know that's what happened.  And I look forward to getting back into sharing more of you and your gender identity, a guide to discovery with you.  So enjoy.  Hey everybody.  Well, I had to get a new headset because I have a kitten and she chewed on the cord of the other one.  So hopefully this one, uh, works well for the purpose, uh, that we are working towards, which is reading you and your gender identity, a guide to discovery.  And here's the cover backwards, of course.  So we are now on chapter one, which is called, why do I need to find out the truth?  So, This is the beginning, the introduction to the chapter.  Oh, actually, what it starts with is that the first part, there's three stages of the book.  This first stage is called preparation.  So I almost skipped it.  Let's read the introduction to stage one, which is called preparation.  There is an approach to life's challenges that many have used in the past and will continue to use for years to come.  Our life is a story and it is filled with many journeys along the way.  You can apply this concept to the subject matter you'll be exploring in stage one preparation.  The next chapter of your story is unfolding.  You are about to go on a journey to discover your authentic gender identity.  Before you can leave home and set forth on this journey, you must put time in at the beginning to plan ahead for what you're about to embark upon.  Stage one preparation is here to help you get ready for this.  The chapters in this stage will help you in your preparation by showing you how to get confirmation that you should indeed embark upon this gender identity journey, gain motivation by looking at why you need to go on this journey, name, acknowledge, and own the fears that might come up while you're on this journey, gather your magical elixirs to help you move forward successfully on this journey.  At the bottom, I say this inspiration comes from the works of Joseph Campbell as well as C.G.  Young.  All right, chapter one, why do I need to find out the truth?  This book has somehow made its way into your hands.  More than likely, this means you are filled with a variety of emotions concerning your gender identity.  Whether you are experiencing curiosity or pain or something in between, there's no more time to waste.  There's a reason.  you want to take the next step toward understanding your gender identity and this chapter will help you figure out what it is.  First things first.  The first step towards preparation is to be sure that this guidebook is the right tool for you at this particular moment in time.  It comes down to one simple question.  Answer it quickly with your first gut instinct.  No one else has to see it but you.  Here's the question.  Are you uncomfortable with your gender assigned at birth socially, physically, and or mentally?  You answer yes, maybe, or no.  I'll pause so you can answer it.  First answer, OK.  In other words, either when you were born or before you were born, certain people examined your external genitalia and saw a penis, a vagina, or a variation of both for those born intersex.  Based on this observation, it was declared that your sex was male, female, or intersex.  This subsequently resulted in you being perceived and raised as the gender that corresponds with that assignment of sex.  So if you answered yes or maybe to the question I read, you should keep reading.  All right.  This is the first.  It's like a assignment.  It's a project.  It's a task.  Creating a log line.  Let me say that again.  Creating a log line.  In this section, we will be creating your personal logline to help identify the main reasons you want to answer your gender identity questions as soon as you possibly can.  In film and television, a logline is a brief summary of the story intended to be catchy and memorable.  It's what the movie preview voiceover person says to grab your attention.  The logline usually goes something like this.  The main character's normal everyday life is like this.  Then major event or realization occurs.  and the main character is changed forever because of it in these ways.  Here are a few examples of well-known storylines.  Star Wars.  Luke Skywalker has a quaint, although fairly boring, and uneventful existence at the beginning of the film.  There's no reason for his life to change at all until his family is brutally murdered.  The Hunger Games.  Sure, life sucks for the people in this post-apocalyptic world, including for the eventual hero Katniss Everdeen.  At least she has her mom, her sister, and a cute guy to go hunting with.  Katniss has no idea what the future holds as she becomes the face of the revolution against their tyrannical government.  Orange is the new black.  Piper Chapman is an attractive white upper class, upper middle class gal with a big secret in her past.  Just as she's about to start her new life with her fiance, she's arrested for exactly what she hopes to escape.  While in prison, She realizes how much she has been pretending to be someone she isn't and gains true freedom through reaching new depths of self-awareness.  So this is a good time to get out your pen and paper or if you're typing because I have a question for you.  Think of your favorite film, book, or TV show and see if this same storyline structure can be found in it.  What story are you thinking of?  How would you describe its logline?  So this would be a good place for you to pause and write down the answer to this question.  I'm going to move along, but you should definitely pause for however long you need to do that.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The creator of this video series is back after a long break due to a move.

It's a question I find myself confronted with on a regular basis in my line of work.  So much of what is labelled violence isn't.  Yet, perhaps more worrying, so much of what isn't labelled violence is.  So how do we go about sorting what is and what isn't violence?  Well, the first thing to note is this.  Not all violence is physical.  This is the hurdle many people have the hardest time overcoming because so much of the discourse surrounding violence focuses on this one form.  Yet the way language and how you refer to it as physical violence, using physical as an adjective, would suggest that there are more forms violence can take.  Now one place to start figuring this out might be a dictionary.  Indeed, Lexico, the online version of the Oxford Dictionary, offers us three definitions of violence, one primary and two secondary.  The first one being, quote, Then we have, quote, Lastly, we have a definition relating to law, which states, quote, the unlawful exercise of physical force or intimidation by the exhibition of such force, end quote.  So in the last definition, we do see an additional form of violence, intimidation, what we could perhaps consider a form of psychological violence.  When a threat is made, it can result in a series of psychological reactions, creating a sense of mental anguish such as fear, frustration, or hopelessness, things that can result in extensive psychological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or depression, resulting in clear harm.  However, is a dictionary definition good enough?  It's true that the last definition is a rudimentary legal definition in the UK, but is that definition, along with the others, internationally recognised?  If not, where else might we source a more universal definition of the term?  Where we could turn to the work of groups like the World Health Organization, a specialist branch of the United Nations, tasked with tending to international public health.  A big part of what they do is tackling violence, and to do so, one must first define it.  As such, the World Health Organization has a detailed definition of violence, which is, quote, \"...the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or  deprivation.\".  End quote.  Now, one thing I should be clear on is the fact that the word intentional solely applies to the act, not the outcome.  So, for example, a parent may vigorously shake a crying infant with the intent to quieten it, causing brain damage in the process.  force was clearly used, but injury was not intended.  And yet, this would still constitute violence under the WHO's definition, since a person may intentionally commit an act that, by objective standards, is judged to be dangerous and have a high likelihood of resulting in adverse health effects, even if the individual does not recognise it as such.  In contrast, a car accident and the resulting harm from that would not be considered violence since, whilst the act of driving is intentional, it was the crash, an unintentional accident, that resulted in harm.  Driving itself does not carry with it a likely chance of causing adverse health effects, unlike crashing, excluding it from being violence.  This is an important concept to keep in mind since many people argue something cannot be violent unless the culprit intended the specific harm that resulted from their actions, when that is not true in the slightest.  If there was probable reason to expect harm on an objective level, their actions were still violent, no matter their personal ignorance or ideological framework.  Now, one thing the WHO is clear on is the inclusion of power, relating to the different sorts of power relationships at play in society.  Violence can also include neglect or acts of remission, withholding something from a person or group of people that results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in harm.  So with those points made clear, we might start to consider the types of power that exist and how they can manifest as violence.  So I tried to come up with a list of different types of power, nothing exhaustive and there's crossover among some of these.  For example, almost all forms of violence carry the potential to double as psychological violence.  However, I wanted a list that included a few that are often recognised, if not thought of immediately, when we say violence, along with some that we don't typically consider as having potential to be violent.  So I came up with a few on my own before taking to Twitter to ask for more, and here are the ones I ended up with.  Physical, psychological, economic, informational, social, political, and sexual.  Now I won't discuss physical and psychological since nobody doubts physical, and I've already discussed the way psychological violence can manifest itself.  However, I'd like to take a few minutes to go through the other items on the list, discussing how violence in relation to said power manifests itself.  starting with economic or capital-based violence.  Let's say we have this couple, Mr.  and Mrs.  Smith.  Now, Mr.  Smith is a bit different.  He's a stay-at-home father looking after three children whilst his wife, Mrs.  Smith, goes off to work.  Over time, however, Mrs.  Smith starts doing something.  She starts withholding access to the family finances from Mr.  Smith, not allowing him to purchase anything, not even necessities like food, bathroom supplies, and cleaning products, without her permission.  Eventually, this grows to the point that Mrs Smith is limiting who Mrs Smith can go and see, effectively severing their connection to family and friends.  If Mrs Smith ever raises an issue with the way that Mrs Smith's treatment is depriving not just him of his basic needs, but the rest of the family, Mrs Smith threatens him with even more severe financial restrictions.  That would be a form of economic violence in an abusive household, something that is legally recognised in certain places.  Another form of economic violence that's not typically legally recognised, but has entered discourse rather strongly recently, is wage slavery.  This idea that if you're unable to work, then you deserve to lack access to things included in your fundamental human rights, such as food, shelter and water, even if there's a surplus of these things.  This is something even more prevalent in countries which lack nationalised healthcare, something that's come to the forefront in American discourse due to workers being forced to risk exposing themselves to the COVID-19 virus, otherwise they'll be fired and lose their health coverage, which is tied up to their job.  This is a form of economic violence targeted at the working class, and it's often used to try and break up unions or stop other forms of protest.  Moving forward, we have informational violence, what we might also refer to as knowledge-based violence or educational violence.  Perhaps the best contemporary example of this is highlighted by the work of Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani woman who, as a young girl, fought for the right to education.  Aged 15, she became the target of attempted assassination by the Taliban trying to put an end to her activism.  But even before the attempt on her life, she was a victim of informational violence.  How?  Well, education is another human right, one which gives the individual the knowledge to use resources that allow for their independence.  Education is a universal emancipator.  One thing we find time and time again is that increasing access to education in an area, particularly for women, increases the wellbeing of not just the individual, but their family and entire community.  This is especially true when it comes to educational matters of gender and relationship education.  Teaching young people about reproductive health gives them the ability to plan a family on their terms, whilst also reducing risk-taking behaviour.  Teaching them about identities outside of cisgender and heteronormative standards lets them know that there is nothing wrong with them in being queer, something households typically fail to do, which results in the harm of the individual.  Much in the same way that groups such as the Black Panthers use school programs to ensure children had proper meals, they can and should be used to ensure that queer people receive the support they often lack at home.  Denying anybody said education, whilst an act of admittance, is neglect and therefore constitutes as a form of violence.  Coming round to social violence, what we might also refer to as ideological violence, this can cover a wide range of actions from adult and child physical aggression, like corporal punishment in schools, to segregation.  These acts are committed as part of a community, ones which impact the social well-being of the victim.  For example, Corporal punishment, whilst also being physical violence and harming the individual that way, teaches children that violence is the proper resolution for matters that could be resolved using explanation, continuing the cycle of violence across generations and even cultures.  It impacts the individual's perception of social interaction in a harmful way, increasing levels of aggression when faced with relatively mundane situations.  Moving on to segregation, the impact this has on a person's wellbeing and self-value is astonishing.  Treatment of entire groups as second-class citizens can, over time, ingrain itself and become internalised, something I've seen with the caste system here in India.  It becomes self-policing at that point, because segregation, whilst it can, doesn't need to be legislated.  Community pressure can be enough to enforce it, making certain people feel unwelcome in certain circles or unable to use services.  in effect making it more difficult or even impossible for them to function as a part of society.  Which is part of the reason I consider it separate to political violence, what may also be known as legislative violence, violence carried out by a governing body.  Because even when a community fully supports a group of people, legislators can go against that and enforce their own form of violence.  For example, 71% of Americans support transgender people being allowed to serve in the military, and yet the trans military ban put in place under Donald Trump remains in effect.  Another common form of political violence revolves around abortion access, with cis men dictating the bodies of cis women, trans men, intersex and enby folk.  We also saw calls for this recently in the secular community, surrounding demands by certain people for numerous human and civil rights to be stripped from trans folk, demands that would not only go on to hurt them, but intersex and cisgender people as well.  To put succinctly, any call to strip a demographic of their human and or civil rights is a call to legislative violence, regardless of your intended outcome.  Lastly, we come to sexual violence, which I'll try to be considerate with as possible.  Thing is, I had a hard time quantifying sexual violence outside of other forms of violence.  For example, surely rape causes physical harm, stalking a form of social or psychological violence, and landlord extortion or sex trafficking a form of economic violence.  So I went back to the WHO's definition of violence and tried to come up with a concept of sexual power.  What I came to is one's control over their sexual autonomy.  Therefore, sexual violence would be the violation of that.  And it's then I realised how I'd messed up in my original thoughts.  Rape isn't always physically violent in that it doesn't always leave signs of physical harm.  When I was raped as a child, my abuser didn't need to physically restrain me, as they convinced me to participate under the pretence of playing a game.  Yet that violation of sexual autonomy, bypassing consent I could not give, that was sexual violence.  In my initial thoughts, I'd hastily generalised the way rape takes place, falling back on how media typically presents it.  So I hope this quick rundown has given you a greater appreciation of violence and the forms it can take beyond physical and the lesser known, but still sometimes discussed, psychological form.  Now again, this is not an official typography or model for the forms of violence, though there are some out there.  For example, we have the typology of interpersonal violence used by the WHO, which whilst a good model, isn't really that helpful in day-to-day discussion.  Models in general are also restrictive compared to a basic definition, requiring you to memorise different categories and subcategories rather than remember a few basic features of violence.  By this, I'm referring to the way that, so long as you remember that violence is the application of physical force or power that has a high likelihood of harming an individual or group of people, if the action itself is intentional.  Regardless of whether the outcome is, you can work out whether something is violent or not from there, thus making the definition much more useful than a set model.  Even the WHO discusses different ways to differentiate between the types of violence, for example, in how they recognise economic, social and political violence, but use the umbrella of collective violence for them.  This video is more about equipping you with some basic understanding, opening up avenues of discussion, rather than offering a strict framework, so hopefully I've achieved my goal in that regard.  Yet before I go, I'd just like to note a few points, starting with a potential criticism of the WHO's definition of violence, namely the idea that its definition is too broad.  Now in response to this, I have to wonder\u2026.  Why is one form of intentional harm worse than any other?  Because that's what you're forwarding when you make this argument.  You are at the very least insinuating that other forms of harm shouldn't be considered because they are lesser.  It can't be because there's a need to differentiate between types of harm, because I've already demonstrated that doing such is possible through the simple act of adding a qualifying adjective.  So the only reason I can see a person genuinely arguing that case is if they, or someone they like, engages in such violence.  Avoiding physical violence whilst engaging in other forms is a method of ensuring plausible deniability in the public eye, something the WHO's definition strips them of.  It means they have to justify their actions in committing or calling for political, economic, informational, or psychological violence.  It puts them on defence, something they never want to be since their entire position relies on avoiding scrutiny and putting the pressure on you.  And that's not a game I intend to play.  Which leads me onto another point, and that is violence can be justified.  there are a number of situations in which violence can become alright.  Whilst the case people typically think of is self-defence, there are other instances.  For example, anti-colonial resistance.  Bhagat Singh was an Indian revolutionary who participated in both the assassination of a British police officer and a series of bomb attacks on the Central Legislative Assembly here in Delhi.  Those actions were entirely justified in the context of British colonialism, yet even in day-to-day we've come to accept some forms of violence as acceptable.  For example, the violence required for policing.  An arrest is not a neutral act, it is a violent one, which is why police are expected to meet a certain level of reasonable suspicion prior to doing so.  Sadly, in our current system, this has been abused to high hell, drawing into question whether the police force can be saved, or if it would be better to demolish the entire system and start again, especially when we consider the existence of canteen culture.  The point is, whilst violence is not inherently bad, the level one has to go to in order to demonstrate that violence is justified is pretty high, usually relating to greater harm against innocent parties, at which point violence can even become a duty.  So when a Nazi goose-steps his way into public, advocating for genocide, taking a swing and reminding him what we do to Nazis, that isn't just okay, that's imperative.

So what makes this show good enough that so many people are still talking about it 12 years after it finished airing?  What makes The Last Airbender timeless?  There are a lot of possible answers to this, and the truth is that it's probably a combination of a million different factors, but I do think there's one thing that stands out as the main reason that The Last Airbender is such a timeless show.  And that's the fact that it is a character-driven show, or more simply, it's the characters.  It's how well-rounded and well-developed the characters are, how they experience change, how their emotions and actions drive the plot, how we relate to them, and how we grow attached to them as a result.  Because when you think back on The Last Airbender, what do you remember the most?  What moments stand out to you?  Obviously there are the big plot things, like Aang fighting Ozai, but a lot of the other moments stand out because of the emotion they were able to imprint on the viewer.  People are very good at remembering a feeling, much better than they are at remembering specific details.  So the emotional impact of a scene or a show as a whole can stick with a person long past when they've forgotten the intricate details of the show itself.  I think that's why The Last Airbender has stuck around with so many of us for so long, and why we were drawn back to it when it made its return to Netflix.  I think the most obvious example of this, which I've talked about before in my videos about Iroh and Zuko, is the scene where Zuko apologizes to Iroh and Iroh immediately hugs him and accepts his apology.  This scene doesn't have much to do with the central plot of defeating Ozai, and it has nothing to do with bending.  It's just one person admitting to another that he was wrong and apologizing.  But because we've been following their story for so long, and we've seen the growth that Zuko has gone through, and we've seen how hard Iroh has worked to help Zuko, we're incredibly emotionally attached to this moment.  Because a story can have the coolest plot in the world, the coolest worldbuilding, and the best fight scenes, but none of that matters if you don't care about the characters.  Avatar certainly does have those other things.  Its worldbuilding is phenomenal, the plot is clear and exciting, and the fight scenes are always fresh and creative.  But that stuff doesn't make up the emotional core of the show.  The emotional core is the characters, their relationships to each other, and their growth.  Different genres of stories can come in and out of popularity depending on what's happening in the world, but stories about people and their connections to other people are always going to resonate with us.  Because no matter what changes in the world, we're always just people interacting with other people, and stories that can capture that in an authentic way will always be able to tug at our heartstrings.  For an example of this, let's look at the final fight between Zuko and Azula.  This is a really good fight scene for dozens of reasons, but I think the most important one is the tone.  Most big fight scenes like this have kind of an epic tone about them.  Smaller fight scenes with lower stakes can have a more lighthearted, fun tone, but big fights try to drum up the scale and importance of the battle.  Think about the fight between Aang and Ozai.  The music has a pace to it that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The explosions are loud, and the stakes are as high as they could ever be.  The show is driving you to root for Aang while being stressed out about how he's going to win.  But with Zuko and Azula, the tone is completely different.  Things get quiet.  The music is slow and somber.  You hear the roar of the flames, but none of their breathing or yelling.  The stakes in this fight aren't necessarily end-of-the-world type stakes, but they somehow feel just as, if not more, important because we've learned so much about Zuko and Azula.  They're both abused children from the same family, though one of them was able to go down a path of redemption, while the other was driven even further and further into a destructive path.  The tone in this fight is sad, which is unusual for this type of fight.  But it has to be sad, because it's two siblings forced to fight each other because of their abusive father.  Even if Zuko wins, he'll still be sad that he had to beat his sister.  There's no real possible happy ending to this.  And as it turns out, once the fight is over and Azula is chained to the Greats, Zuko and Katara aren't happy.  They aren't jumping up and down and celebrating.  They're sad.  They find it hard to even look at Azula.  It's a victory in that they won, but emotionally they're still torn up about having to defeat Azula.  So that fight becomes elevated beyond a typical big end-of-the-series battle because of the emotions involved.  That fight will now stick in your mind better because of that somber mood that's attached to it.  The viewer might not be able to relate to shooting large columns of flames out of their hands, but they can relate to two siblings being forced to clash because of their terrible father.  No matter how far-fetched any story is, if it can be related back to our humanity, we will really feel for it.  And that is only possible if the characters are relatable and have flaws and have aspects of themselves that we can see in ourselves.  So in the end, the thing that makes this fight scene so memorable isn't the beautiful colors or next-level firebending.  It's the emotions we feel seeing these characters collide after an entire series of watching them grow and learning about their backstory.  A character-driven story like this is able to cement this fight scene in your mind in a way that any other story just couldn't.  The core of this fight isn't firebending, it's the characters.  There's one other moment that I think illustrates this point really well, and it's this scene with Sokka and Toph, where Toph is hanging on by her fingertips and Sokka is lying on the edge of the airship without his boomerang or his sword.  On the surface, this is just another close call with death for a couple members of Team Avatar.  I mean, over the course of the series, these characters almost die a bunch of times.  That, in and of itself, isn't noteworthy.  And yet, this scene is far more emotional because, of course, it's the characters.  As I'm sure you're aware, Toph is not known as a very emotional character.  Her whole thing is being tough and sturdy and strong.  She's not great at talking about or showing her emotions.  But particularly over Book 3, we slowly see her start to open up a little.  When Sokka leaves to go train in sword fighting, Toph gets close to admitting that she missed him, and then later when Katara and Toph get in a fight, she offers up a bit more about her emotions when talking to Sokka about why she was mad at Katara.  Toph is a pretty consistent character, who doesn't change a whole lot from when we first meet her to when the show ends, but she still does definitely go through some development, especially when it comes to her relationship with Sokka.  Early on, in addition to not talking about her emotions, she also refuses to accept help from anyone.  It causes her to butt heads with Katara because Katara wants her to be a part of the group and help out, whereas Toph wants to be her own self-sufficient unit.  They reach a resolution in that episode, but Toph continues to be a pretty stubbornly independent character throughout most of the show.  But fast forward to the finale, and Toph is now putting a whole lot of trust in someone else.  Sokka.  Toph launches herself, Sokka, and Suki up onto an airship where Toph is barely able to see.  I get the sense that she's able to see inside the ship relatively well through metalbending, but she seems to be a bit more lost up on the top of the airship, maybe because of the material that it's made of up there?  Maybe it's a more purified metal or something?  But Toph is willing to run around up here, unable to see anything outside the ship, and even bend the rudder of the ship to make it crash into the others, because she trusts Sokka to be there for her.  When she starts to run the wrong way on the roof of the airship, he pulls her back.  When debris that she can't see is falling around them, he dives over her and protects her.  Toph is maybe the strongest character on Team Avatar, but in situations where she can't see through her earthbending, she needs to be able to put her trust in someone else.  There are even moments earlier in the series when this happens, like when Sokka ducks her head when she can't see the ore coming at her, or when he carries her when her feet are burned.  The evolution of their relationship is so amazing, because it's both Toph learning to accept help when she needs it, and Sokka learning to care for someone else, since Katara mostly took over that role in their family.  So all of this culminates in Toph hanging onto Sokka's fingertips, thousands of feet above the ground.  They've exhausted all their other options.  Appa isn't around to catch them, Sokka's leg is broken, Toph can't see anything except for Sokka, and Sokka says he thinks this is the end.  That's when Toph cries, and honestly, when I cried too watching this for the first time.  All of that development between their characters leads up to this absolutely heartbreaking moment where they really think they're going to die.  You know it's real, because Toph doesn't just cry over anything, and after successfully learning to accept help from Sokka, it would be horrible if that's how things ended for them.  Thankfully, it doesn't, and Suki saves them.  But wow, what an emotional moment, and one of the moments that stuck with me for so long after I first watched it.  It's that kind of moment that makes Avatar strike such a human chord with people.  Just like with the Zuko and Azula fight, when you boil down this scene, it isn't so much about the firebenders or the airships or the space sword.  It's about Toph and Sokka and the culmination of all their growth together.  All of that other stuff makes for a really entertaining and captivating backdrop, but at its core, this is a story about people, about how they change and grow and rely on each other.  And that's what gives it such a strong emotional impact and what makes it a good story regardless of what decade you're watching it in.  There are so many other moments like this in The Last Airbender.  When Katara pulls Aang out of the Avatar state, that's entirely about human emotions and about learning to control your anger.  When Katara carries Aang away and Iroh helps them escape, only to let himself be captured and then be unable to look at Zuko, that's not about bending, that's about believing in someone and then being disappointed when they let you down.  When Iroh sings about his son, Luten, it adds so much more to what we know about his relationship with Zuko.  All of these scenes, and so many others, make Avatar what it really is, a story about flawed people doing their best.  And nothing is more relatable than that.

And when I would close my eyes, it was almost impossible for me to imagine what my future would be.  I mean, I would literally close my eyes and I couldn't think of anything.  I didn't really have the words for it when I was younger, but to some degree, I knew that I was transgender and I didn't really know what that looked like.  When I was growing up, there weren't very many examples of who transgender people could be as adults.  Because I had such a hard time envisioning who I could be, I felt like it was important for me to write down who I am right now.  And I bought this journal, and it was the beginning of me having a dialogue with myself.  This journal was the very beginning of me becoming a blogger.  as a kid i kept a journal for a really long time and as i moved into teenager times um i went through what a lot of teenagers went through.  i was angsty.  i was you know depressed and scared and back then blogs were becoming a thing and i just thought that i would take my journal and make it into a public online diary.  and so I started my first little blog and I started using it the way that I would use my old journal.  I would just come home every day and write about what was going on in my day and it kind of gained a bit of a following.  and through my own little blog I started actually having a little bit of a community and it was really great to sort of meet people from around the world who are having similar experiences as I was.  A lot of people who followed my blog told me that I should go and start a YouTube page and so every week my parents would give me $25 for allowance and usually I would go and spend this on Sims expansion packs.  but one time I decided to go and actually get a webcam and I started a YouTube channel and I used my YouTube channel the way that I use my public diary.  I would come home every day from school and just speak to it and just talk right into the camera.  But because it was such a touchy conversation for me, I really wanted to keep it secret.  I didn't want my friends or my family or my classmates to know anything about my little blog.  And, you know, back then, YouTube was definitely not what it is today.  There was no such thing as being a YouTuber.  I was just somebody who had a YouTube page.  So in high school, I was an eccentric art kid.  I was in theater.  I hand-painted most of my t-shirts.  Like, I was just that kid.  My big goal at that point in my life was to get into CalArts, which was my dream school.  It's a school that was started by Disney, and back then, all I wanted to do was be an animator.  And so most of my time was spent with me doing my portfolio, which was, at one point in time, the main topic of my YouTube channel.  Now I will say that I was a little popular in school.  I figured that people knew me because I was in theater.  And I didn't find out until I was about to graduate high school that literally everyone watched my YouTube channel.  And my YouTube channel was peak teenage angst.  It was me gossiping.  It was a lot of stuff that I didn't think people were looking at.  But by the time I was in my senior year, I already knew that I was going to CalArts.  And so I was really excited to embark on this brand new journey in a whole new place where I knew absolutely nobody.  Now, the coolest thing about college is once you get there, you realize that you have no responsibility to be the person who you said you were the day before.  It forced me to really think about who I was.  While I'd always kind of known that I was transgender, it was really my first year in college where I knew that I was a trans woman.  And of course that presented a bunch of complications because specifically being a black trans woman is scary and I knew that transition would paint a target on my back.  But I had to move forward with my authenticity and truly be who I knew myself to be.  So back then YouTube was very important to me.  I needed a place to vent and I needed a place to share all of the things that I was experiencing in that strange point of my life.  So year after year after year, I progressed in my transition and by my last year of college, I had legally changed my name to Catherine.  One of the big reasons why I wanted to change my name before I graduated college was because I, at the time, was very, very invested in stealth.  In the early days when I started reading about trans life, the story kind of went like this.  You figured out that you were trans.  you started taking hormones from some person on the streets, your body started changing, you got a bunch of surgeries, you eventually got the surgery, you killed everybody who ever knew you before, who knew who you used to be, moved to another state, and then you married a man and fell in love.  and now you're writing this account from, you know, your white picket fenced house where you've got 2.5 children and a dog and your life is just perfect.  I mean, all of that with the exception of obviously killing everybody.  But that was the narrative.  The narrative was that you were transitioning to disappear, to not be seen so that nobody knew that you were trans because that would just make your life easier.  I wanted to be able to go through my life only being known as Catherine.  So after college, I moved back in with my parents and my parents had moved to a totally new town.  Um, and in that town I was able to be stealth.  I was able to exist in a way where nobody knew that I was transgender.  I worked in the animation industry for a little bit of time and it's kind of funny, you know, when you go to the top school for animation in the country, the likelihood of you avoiding people who you went to college with is pretty slim.  So I figured out pretty quickly that stealth in the animation industry was not only kind of impossible for me, but also really irrelevant because animation really is one of those things where they really do care about what you do and less about who you are.  And so going into the animation industry was actually one of the first times I recognized that maybe I didn't need to be stealth.  Maybe that wasn't the most important thing in the world for me.  So after working in the animation industry for a bit, I kind of recognized that it wasn't for me, which of course was a really upsetting realization to have when I'd worked so hard to get there.  So I went back home and I did a bunch of children's illustration for a bit.  And after that, I went back to YouTube.  and by the time I returned to YouTube, YouTube was a totally different platform, like a completely different thing.  Being a YouTuber was a thing you could be.  When I started back up on YouTube, it was this weird thing where I was trying to on one hand remain stealth, but also have enough of a following to where I could kind of make a little bit of money and sort of sustain myself a little bit.  And of course, these two goals were kind of contradicting each other.  In the midst of me wanting to turn video creation into a career, I had this amazing idea to make a video with a little startup company that no one knows about.  about being transgender.  And I remember when I went in to film this video, which was about pronouns, I thought to myself, who's gonna watch this video about pronouns?  So the video goes up and it comes out really well and it reaches a bunch of people and the view count just gets higher and higher and higher and more people see it and more people are sharing it.  And I start getting messages from people.  I start getting these emails from people who have met me, you know, in the past two years who had no clue that I was trans.  So people in general had a pretty positive reaction to that video, but the worse was yet to come.  So at the time of me publishing this video, I was in a relationship and I was living with some of my partner's relatives and his relatives did not know that I was transgender.  And when this video came in their feed to really over summarize the whole story, they were really uncomfortable with me living with them.  and they moved to evict both me and my partner.  And I have to say that that was honestly one of the scariest points in my life because when I got evicted from the place that I lived with my partner, it was absolutely terrifying to recognize that my initial fears were not totally unfounded.  But sometimes a good thing about hitting a low point in your life is recognizing that you can only go higher.  In that moment, I realized that one of the worst things that could have happened happened, and I was still here.  So that really truly was a turning point in my life.  And I started to sort of attack YouTube and blogging with a lot more confidence.  I started to actually make an effort to be a blogger, to be, you know, a person making content on the Internet.  And I'll be honest with you guys, I got a lot of scary stuff early on.  I mean, I'm one of the only trans people on this platform and I've been on this platform since 2005.  And a lot of people who are trans YouTubers, they come on here and they're there for a couple of years and they disappear.  But I'm one of the few that is stuck around.  And, you know, even though YouTube makes me so uncomfortable, even though being on YouTube makes me so uncomfortable, I've learned that me being here touches so many people.  I will never forget that I was speaking at UC Boulder, Colorado and there was this trans guy who came up to me after one of my talks and he told me that the video that I made where I spoke about pronouns was one of the things that helped him realize that he was transgender.  Honestly, when I heard that, it made all of the scary experiences I've had with my eviction and the harassment that I've gotten on the internet, it honestly made it worth it.  I became the representation that I desperately needed when I was a child.  Even though sometimes it still terrifies me to be out, I know that being out means that I'm helping so many people.  When you feel alone in this world, sometimes all you need is to know that there's others just like you.  So don't ever underestimate the power of your words.","channel.id":"clxmi0oqh02kncdvicaxc7qeq","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxFWzKZa74SyAqpJyVlG5Ew","channel.name":"Kat Blaque","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJWT7XDNz1Vl0sA7fBPrC4jkoFJO34GYvdMQlqX0Vg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"When I was younger, I knew I was different, but I didn't have the words to describe it.

The word transgender hadn't even been coined then.  At that point, I didn't want to die.  I just wanted to be me. In 1975, a group of trans people went on a secret journey to meet the only doctor that was willing to talk to them about medical treatment. He faced huge amounts of opposition within the hospital to even seeing us. And he said, because I realised that you people are not getting any help from anywhere, I'm willing to help you. He treated us like ordinary people. And so this trip up was a sort of a mini pride.  We were out there living our lives, living our truth. I think it was a place I learned to laugh.

So it has been a while.  How are you?  How's things?  I have been about as good as one can be these days.  The last year or so has been interesting for me.  During my hiatus, I've been trying to broaden my horizons a little bit.  I've been trying new things, revisiting some of my old passions, and experimenting with some new business ventures.  And one of those ventures has been, and I need you to just take a moment here and prepare to receive this information, One of those ventures has been writing heterosexual erotica.  Not a joke.  Basically, in my spare time, I've been doing a bit of freelance writing for one of those choose-your-own-adventure visual novel apps that are mostly romance based and mostly aimed at straight women.  And a lot of that work has involved writing sex scenes between heterosexual couples.  And I think that's hilarious.  Generally speaking, literary erotica is, I will admit, not my personal cup of tea.  But there's one particular name that, at least in my circles, has dominated the erotica genre, and in particular the queer erotica genre, for several years now.  And that name is Chuck Tingle.  Chuck Tingle, or rather the person whose pseudonym is Chuck Tingle, specializes in surreal, self-published queer erotica involving people having sex with anthropomorphized things that people are not normally known to have sex with.  His body of work, which he refers to as Tinglers, began with a focus on creatures such as dinosaurs, unicorns, and Bigfoot, eventually branching into sentient objects and even intangible concepts.  Tingle quickly went viral for his off-the-wall titles and cover art.  Even if you've never read a Chuck Tingle story, there's a decent chance you've seen a Chuck Tingle cover or heard a Chuck Tingle story title at some point.  In fact, most of the third-party content out there that deals with Chuck Tingle is basically just people reacting to the names of his books.  And the title is... Pounded in the butt by my own butt.  What?!  What?!  A lot of Tinglers also capitalize on current events from the latest news cycle.  For instance, after the recent unpleasantness surrounding JK Rowling's feelings towards trans people made headlines, Tingle came out with a full novel entitled Trans Wizard Harriet Porber and the Bad Boy Parasaurolophus.  A big part of the Chuck Tingle brand is also the unique persona that he embodies on Twitter and on the podcasts that have spun off from his work.  Greetings, buckaroos.  It's Dr.  Chuck Tingle, world's greatest author, and your new radio bud, with an exciting message about love on this timeline and the next.  Outside of his stories, Chuck speaks with a distinctive vernacular that's uniquely his own.  Men are buckaroos or bucks.  Women are ladybucks.  Sexual orientation is preferred pound.  Knowledge of human mortality is the lonesome train.  And pretty much the worst thing that anyone can be is a devil man.  It's unclear exactly how much of the Chuck Tingle character is based in fiction, but considering that he presents himself as a taekwondo master who exists in multiple timelines and is haunted by the ghost of his dead wife, I think it's fair to say probably some of it.  But I feel like the premises and branding of Chuck Tingle's books, as well as his online persona, often greatly overshadow the content of his work itself.  And even more so, a lot of people don't seem to be aware of the larger context in which Chuck Tingle exists.  If you're new to the world of online erotica, you might be surprised to learn that Chuck Tingle's work is not as entirely singular as you might expect.  As bizarre as the idea of erotica featuring dinosaurs, unicorns, and Bigfoot might seem to someone of a more vanilla persuasion, those are all genres of erotica that actually predate Chuck Tingle's literary debut.  A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay, for instance, seems like it could quite easily fit into Chuck Tingle's oeuvre.  Yet, it was actually authored by Hunter Fox, several months before Tingle's earliest published story, My Billionaire Triceratops Craves Gay Ass.  While I suppose it's possible that Chuck Tingle and Hunter Fox are both pseudonyms of the same person, there are simply too many dinosaur erotica books out there under too many different names for all of this to be the work of just one mastermind.  This is to say nothing of the multitude of stories in which characters have sex with centaurs, tentacles, leprechauns, gothic mansions, and living Tetris blocks.  I hope y'all like this video, because my Amazon search history is ruined now.  So, like... This is all a joke, right?  Surely this is just one of those newfangled memes the kids are always talking about.  It's not really meant to be taken seriously.  Is it?  Well, as far as I can tell, it's sort of not, but it also sort of is.  Stories about people having sex with really weird stuff have been around for a really long time.  Greek mythology alone is full of people being ravished by gods in the form of a swan, a bull, an ant, an eagle, a cloud, a bunch of gold coins.  Most of those were Zeus, by the way.  He was into some weird .  Clearly, this is something people have been fascinated with for a while.  And even in the realm of what some might consider relatively more mainstream erotica, things can still get... Kinda weird.  Much has been made over the trend of vampire romance novels over the past couple decades, but the paranormal romance genre often dips into more inhuman territory.  Erotica featuring shifters, which is basically a catch-all term for werewolves, other types of lycanthropes, and various breeds of anamorph, is incredibly popular.  If you're perhaps familiar with the Omegaverse genre of erotic fiction, it's more or less a variation on werewolf erotica that focuses on the themes of domination and submission.  What I'm getting at here is... A lot of people kind of want to f*** monsters.  Their reasons for wanting to do so might vary greatly from person to person, but a lot of it seems to come down to power dynamics.  For the same reason that a person might get turned on by BDSM, some people get turned on by the idea of being ravished by something scary and powerful.  Something that is, on some level, alien to themselves.  Whether that's a billionaire, a vampire, a werewolf, a velociraptor, or even something intangible like the crushing existential weight of sentient self-awareness.  Chuck Tingle's work and other stories like his are just a very extreme satirical extension of a fairly prevalent human desire.  What does set Tingle's body of work apart from that of his peers is the ethos of inclusivity and acceptance that it's developed over the years.  Where the early Tinglers pretty consistently featured jacked cis white gay guys in the lead role, at least according to the covers, Chuck has since made a conscious effort to diversify his work, including more racial minorities, lesbians, bisexual and transgender representation, and occasionally more varied body types.  Some of his stories are even specifically non-erotica in an effort to appeal to asexual readers.  The one constant element is that all of his stories are unabashedly queer.  Insofar as, in the Tingleverse, a jet plane can also be a gay male billionaire.  Chuck's overarching philosophy is all about proving love is real.  And as silly as it might sound, there's something kind of beautiful about imagining a world in which everyone, everything, every concept is intrinsically capable of love.  And I think that's exactly what we need to help us get through a year that has truly pounded us in the butt.","channel.id":"clxmi0maa00uucdvikem5m222","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC8MYk8ZpcIZeO7Z2ljBAj3g","channel.name":"rantasmo","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/IA4C5gtxOxvsJnNAVbo4em0yQrKyKcqFEvA8x97BoZK-C4rmJ2Y5_ClB6u9YFDQaY4Lrf_2apg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2010-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I'm Rantasmo, and I'm here to talk about Chuck Tingle, a renowned author of surreal, self-published queer erotica.

The main character is dealing with a certain stirring within them.  It might be experienced as painful and troublesome.  It might also be experienced as mysterious and intriguing.  The character could also be aware, unaware, at least consciously, that there is something within them that needs to be expressed and explored.  Next part.  Then something happens to reveal just how much is really going on beneath the surface for the main character.  It's at this point they realize their life will continue to stay exactly the same unless they do something about it.  Next part, the main character parks upon a quest, which can be internal and or external, searching for answers to these questions, hoping to create a life that feels more authentic to who they really are.  Last part, the main character's illusions are revealed, helping them see the world through different eyes.  their old selves fall away.  they question everything they had previously believed to be true.  you've probably figured out by now that you are the main character and this is your story that we're talking about.  your search for answers about your gender identity is your quest.  you're basically your personally created log line will become your mission statement your beacon and your guiding light.  the first step toward creating this log line is to take a look at your life as it is right now.  there has to to be some sort of explanation why you, the main character, are feeling unsettled, perplexed, unhappy, curious, or all of the above.  Step one, the opening scenes.  Think about yourself and your life as if you were watching it as a movie.  What do you see?  How would you describe what you see during the opening scenes?  Keeping in mind that you are the main character, use the following prompts to help you explore this.  Describe the main character in third person using they, them, or she, he pronouns.  How old are they?  What is their perceived gender?  What do they look like?  What's their personality like?  What are their interests and hobbies?  What are their strengths and weaknesses?  So again, you can pause here.  Describe the physical world of this character.  In what country, state, or town do they live?  What type of dwelling?  What does it look like?  Pause.  Next question.  Describe where this character spends time.  What are these places scenarios?  How much time do they spend in each?  For instance, home, work, school.  local bar, be careful, it's a pandemic, the gym, same, hangouts, friends or relatives' houses, in the car commuting, in combat, in isolation.  This book was clearly not written during a pandemic.  Describe how the character spends their time.  How much do they work?  How do, sorry, do they go to school?  What's their family life like?  What's their social life like?  Are they frequently alone?  Next, describe the other people in the character's life.  Who are the important people in their life?  What is the character's relationship like with each of them?  Next question.  Describe what the other characters think of the main character.  Are they well-liked?  Are they seen as mysterious and aloof?  Are they seen as being challenging or difficult?  Next, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not very and 10 being very much so, how content do the other people in the story assume this character is with the current state of their life, regardless of how the how content the character actually feels.  OK, next, step two, zooming in.  Now that you've established what the world of the main character seems to be like, let's zoom in to get closer look at what's actually going on.  Answer these questions.  Answering these questions sets up the entire story that's about to unfold for the main character.  In other words, you.  Question, what does the character do when no one's watching?  What does this character struggle with that no one else knows about?  What takes up the most space in the character's thoughts?  What does this character wish they could do to further explore these thoughts?  What steps have they taken so far to accomplish this?  What do they want to try but haven't yet?  On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not very and 10 being very much.  so, how content do you think this character actually is with the current state of their life?  All right, step three.  Creating the logline.  Follow these steps to create your logline.  Create a several word description of yourself.  For example, a highly intelligent, charismatic software engineer.  You can use these adjectives and nouns to get you started.  So under adjectives, I have intelligent, nerdy, music loving, hardworking, creative, ambitious, socially awkward, tattooed.  You could list your nationality.  You could list your culture.  You could list your sexual orientation.  Nouns could be college student, athlete, military, former military member, whatever your role is in your family, whatever your job or career is, geek, recovering alcoholic addict, survivor of fill in the blank, entrepreneur.  You could list your political party.  You could list your religious affiliation.  Next, create a phrase that describes your current state of existence.  Examples.  So you would have your adjective and noun and it would be dot, dot, dot, is tired of hiding their true self.  Dot, dot, dot, is bursting with newfound self-awareness they are ready to share with the world.  Dot, dot, dot, can no longer stand turning to fill in addiction as a way of running from their true self.  Dot, dot, dot, is delighted to be learning things about themselves they had never expected to learn.  Next, create a description of what the possible solution or solutions might be.  You can make this as obvious or as mysterious as you would like.  Examples.  By facing the truth about their gender identity, or by exploring possibilities about themselves that they never thought existed, or by challenging the assumption that they are a man slash a woman, or by no longer hiding the truth from themselves and from others.  And then next, create a phrase describing what the cause might be.  if you don't do this.  Example.  Examples, a disturbing feeling of never truly becoming themselves, an existence filled with the same old, same old, a lifetime filled with regret over what could have been, the chance at missing out on the peace of being fully self-aware.  Last, combine your phrases to create your final logline.  Be sure your logline hooks you on an emotional level.  You're going to be turning to it throughout your journey as a reminder of what you are doing and why.  So you're going to put that description of yourself, plus the phrase that describes your current state of being, plus what the possible solution might be, plus what the cost might be if you don't do this.  That equals your log line.  Step four, how you can use your log line.  Come up with ways you can use this log line as a handy companion throughout your journey.  Note, modify the following ideas if you need to be discreet.  All right, so I say place a check mark next to the ideas you would like to try.  First of all, be creative.  You could use a photo editor to give it a design, such as using quotescover.com, pickmonkey.com, and a wide variety of free apps which are available.  You can make a collage with photos or cut items out of magazines.  You could set it to music, use an existing song, and create your own lyrics or create a new song entirely.  You can put it where you can see it.  home office cork board, bathroom mirror, in your vehicle, on your computer or tablet, in your wallet, purse, or bag, on your refrigerator, as wallpaper for your phone, laptop, or desktop, as your social media profile picture or wallpaper.  Write it on your body.  You may want to wait for the tattoo until you're further into your journey.  Oh, Dara, you're so funny.  In the coming days, be sure to return to your log line for motivation and inspiration.  Go back and read it on the days you are feeling defeated, afraid, and frustrated.  Memorize it and make it your mantra.  Do whatever you must so you can remember it, repeat it, and relive it.  Send it to a trusted person who will remind you when you need it the most, kind of like a gender identity sponsor.  All right, so that's the end of that chapter.  So I could see how it might be a little challenging to do those exercises without having the actual book in front of you.  But hopefully, again, if you kind of watch this and you're like, ah, I'm lost, just go back, start the video again, and then kind of like go through a part and then pause, get out your notebook or your computer or use your phone to type your notes in and start to work on the exercises.  That's how it's going to go for the rest of the book.  Every chapter is going to have exercises like that.  So I'll just read it straight through, but you can pause it at any point to be able to answer those questions.  Talk to you later.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"To create a compelling story about your journey with gender identity, start by breaking down your log line into its core parts.

At first, my mind jumped to The Tales of Ba Sing Se, specifically Iroh's story about his son, because that's just an incredibly good, emotional story.  But the rest of the short stories in that episode are kind of lackluster, so I don't know if it could be the best episode overall.  Then I thought maybe one of the finale episodes, because simply by being the finale, those episodes have higher stakes and give a really satisfying conclusion to a lot of major plot points.  But that feels like cheating.  The finale is always going to have that kind of advantage over the rest of the episodes.  So I started thinking, what would make the best non-finale episode?  What would just your average Avatar episode need to be perfect?  And as I was rewatching the series over and over again, as you do, I kept finding the most joy in the firebending masters.  As I thought more about it, I realized that this episode has absolutely everything that a good Avatar episode needs.  So in this video, I want to break down those reasons and talk about why I think this is the perfect Avatar The Last Airbender episode.  Number one, worldbuilding slash backstory.  Part of the appeal of the Avatar universe is the incredible worldbuilding.  This feels like a real, actual place that you could visit, with its own distinct regions, cultures, traditions, and people.  So much time and effort goes into fleshing out this fascinating world.  By the second half of the final season, when you reach the Firebending Masters, you probably think you understand most of this world by now.  You've gone with the gang from the Southern Water Tribe to the Northern Water Tribe, all across the Earth Kingdom, stayed in Ba Sing Se, and even lived in the Fire Nation for a bit.  A lot of the worldbuilding has already happened, and so you're probably content to sit back and think, yup, I understand all of this world now.  But then they hit you with some new information.  Toph learned earthbending from the badgermoles, who were also blind and used earthbending as an extension of their senses rather than just as a fighting form.  The airbenders learned how to master airbending from the sky bison, which sheds a new light on Appa, and the firebenders learned from the dragons.  But the dragons are all gone, which sets you up for an amazing plot twist later in the episode, when Ran and Shaw are revealed.  And as a part of all this new worldbuilding, you get some extra insight into a now very beloved character, Uncle Iroh.  You start out the episode thinking, geez, maybe his dark past is even darker than I thought, and you end it with the knowledge that Iroh actually was deemed worthy by the dragons and lied to protect them, which helps you understand his character a lot better.  When he was trying to teach Zuko not to draw all his firebending from anger and hate, It wasn't just old person wisdom, it was wisdom from the dragons that he had been gifted.  It recontextualizes a lot of what you know about Iroh, and therefore even what you know about Zuko, all the while expanding the scope of this world in a really fun way.  We now know that when the badgermals helped the gang get through the secret tunnel, they weren't just goofy creatures placed there by chance, they were the original earthbenders who have a deep connection to that land.  A good episode of Avatar should expand on the worldbuilding in some way, because that's such a large and engaging part of the show.  And this episode excels in that department.  You learn about an entirely new culture that's been hidden away from everyone, even the Fire Nation royalty.  You get backstory on Toph and Iroh, as well as information about how people used to learn bending long ago.  It's all relevant to the overarching story, while also having a great deal of meaning to Aang and Zuko's arc in this one episode.  It's really just perfectly delivered worldbuilding and backstory.  Number 2, the Aang and Zuko parallels.  I'm not running.  I'm tired of running.  It's time I faced Azula.  This show really loves to beat you over the head with the fact that Aang and Zuko mirror each other, which I honestly think is great.  I love the many camera transitions from one of them to the other, and how we repeatedly learn about their backstories at the same time, like in the storm in season 1 or the Avatar and the Fire Lord in season 3.  Aang and Zuko from the beginning are set up as having their destinies intertwined, and so we know the whole series is leading up to something happening between them.  The climax of all that setup is kind of when Zuko returns to the gang and offers to be Aang's firebending teacher, but the Firebending Masters is the episode immediately following Zuko joining their team, so it's like the adjustment period for Aang and Zuko learning what it means to be on the same side.  Because up until now, their stories have paralleled each other, but in opposing ways.  Now their stories need to drive in the same direction, and yet somehow, the show manages to find the perfect way for this to happen.  They both need to learn firebending.  Now Aang has been struggling with firebending for basically the entire series, but Zuko's struggle is new.  Now that he's not trying to capture the Avatar, he's lost the anger that fueled his firebending.  So they both set out on an adventure together to learn the true meaning of firebending.  This is the perfect scenario for them.  For so many episodes, we've been seeing the show compare these two and their backstories, and if they're not setting up to have some world-crushing battle between them at the end, what could they possibly be mirroring each other for?  That kind of prolonged setup needs a really satisfying payoff, and I think Zuko joining the gang is good, but it's not enough.  Aang's firebending teacher didn't need to have all those parallels with him.  If all Zuko did was just join them and then hang around and then fight Azula at the end, I think it would have devalued the parallels he had with Aang earlier on.  I don't think it would have ruined the story entirely, it would have just taken away some of the impact.  But instead, Zuko and Aang meet the firebending masters and learn the secret of firebending together.  That's a satisfying payoff.  They both had to go on their parallel journeys through the series because they needed to get to this moment, where they could both recognize that fire is about life and passion, not anger and hate.  Zuko couldn't have gotten there without Aang's forgiveness and resourcefulness, and Aang couldn't have gotten there without Zuko's knowledge and persistence.  I think this moment, where they stare into the fire of Ran and Shaw together, that's the real climax of their parallel stories.  It changes them both significantly and bonds them in a way that they couldn't by just normally hanging out and wanting to take down the Fire Lord.  It has the finale energy of tying up a really satisfying arc without actually being a finale.  Number three, contrasting personalities.  Aang and Zuko, despite all their parallels, are very different characters.  Aang is a happy-go-lucky kid who wants to see the bright side of everything while staying upbeat.  Zuko, on the other hand, even once he's joined the gang, is a broody teenager who's grumpy and quick to anger.  Personality wise, they're about as opposite as they could possibly be.  They're foils of each other, each one used to highlight the other one's defining traits.  And, you know, there is nothing I love more than the trope of the peppy sunshine and rainbows character annoying the broody grumpy woe-is-me character.  It's just a perfect dynamic.  It makes for fun and wholesome character interactions, and it generally ups the enjoyment level of the whole episode.  While we've seen Aang and Zuko interact plenty before this episode, this is the first time where they're starting on the same side together, which just leads to some of the best moments in the entire series.  And when Aang is trying to make Zuko feel better by being like, that one felt hot, and Zuko is like, don't patronize me, and then they start flying on Appa, and Zuko makes this observation about Appa being slow, and Aang's like, in our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude.  Nothing is better than that.  Zuko's literally like, dang, I thought this thing was faster because it was so hard to capture you.  And Aang only sees it as an insult to Appa, and is like, come on Zuko, don't be mean to Appa, he's flying as fast as he can.  And it only gets better once they get to the Sun Warrior Temple, and Aang has to convince Zuko to dance, even though he really doesn't want to.  And then they get trapped in the sludge and Zuko's like, what do we do?  I don't know, I guess think about our place in the world?  That's what Iroh would want.  We also get maybe my favorite moment in the whole series when Aang is like, you're not as bad as everyone says, and Zuko just has this big goofy smile that's incredibly rare for him.  And eventually the show manages to squeeze a compliment out of Zuko when he's like, come on Aang, you're strong, you can keep a stronger fire than that.  That was such a sweet moment, largely because of how it contrasts with their personalities.  You know Zuko isn't one to just throw out compliments all over the place, and you also know Aang really needed that little boost.  But then, this exchange, when they're facing the dragons after Zuko said they could fight the masters if they had to, is top tier content.  Because now we're getting Aang teasing Zuko and forcing Zuko into this, like, awkward situation where he doesn't get to be the tough broody guy.  It's just perfect.  And it all ends with Zuko at the end having to justify to everyone why his dragon dance is more than just a dance, which is embarrassing for him, but helps solidify him even further as a member of Team Avatar.  It's just such a fun episode because of all these little moments between Aang and Zuko, which helps it stay lighthearted and joyful even when it's about all this worldbuilding and learning the true meaning of firebending and all of that.  And it's also about something else, which brings me to... Number four, it drives the main plot.  There are a lot of really great, fun episodes of Avatar that expand on the worldbuilding or tell us more about a character, but only a few non-finale episodes can drive the plot forward as much as the firebending masters.  Aang is supposed to master firebending in order to face the Fire Lord, even though, to be honest, it doesn't come in that handy when he actually faces the Fire Lord, but it is a very central part of his drive to prepare for the final battle.  So this episode obviously drives him closer to that goal.  And for Zuko, allowing him to learn the true meaning of firebending and getting his firebending back means that he's now one step closer to being able to face his destiny in the finale, which is facing Azula.  Not to mention that he needs his skilled firebending to get through the next couple episodes with Sokka on the Boiling Rock.  So on top of expertly handling the worldbuilding, backstory, parallel stories, and contrasting characters, the Firebending Masters episode also manages to help drive the main plot forward in a significant way.  Aang's firebending teacher now knows a secret about firebending that maybe only one other living firebender, Iroh, knows.  And that's why I think The Firebending Masters is the best overall non-finale episode of Avatar.  It does everything that a good Avatar episode should do, from the character interactions to the world building to driving the main plot, and it does them all in exceptional ways.

They both learn firebending together, and their contrasting personalities create a fun and wholesome dynamic.\n\n3. **Contrasting Personalities**: Aang and Zuko's opposing personalities make for great character interactions, and their banter and moments of vulnerability are some of the best in the series.\n\n4. **Driving the Main Plot**: The Firebending Masters episode drives the main plot forward by helping Aang master firebending and Zuko learn the true meaning of firebending, which is crucial for their respective storylines.\n\nOverall, the speaker believes that the Firebending Masters episode is the best non-finale episode of Avatar because it excels in worldbuilding, character development, and driving the plot forward.","responses":"[1] Education: Mentions learning bending long ago (\"...how people used to learn bending long ago.\")\n[1] Culture: Mentions new cultures and traditions (\"...introducing new cultures, traditions, and people.\")\n[1] Human Behavior: Mentions contrasting personalities (\"...Aang and Zuko's opposing personalities...\")\n[1] Personal Growth: Mentions Aang mastering firebending and Zuko learning the true meaning of firebending (\"...helping Aang master firebending and Zuko learn the true meaning of firebending...\")\n[1] Society: Mentions the main plot and the characters' storylines (\"...driving the main plot forward by helping Aang master firebending and Zuko learn the true meaning of firebending, which is crucial for their respective storylines.\")"}

Hey guys, it's Kat and I'm here to talk to you guys about something that I've actually already discussed five months ago, JK Rowling and her interesting thoughts about transgender people.  So yesterday, JK Rowling retweeted an article from a website called Devex.  The article was called Opinion, creating a more equal post COVID-19 world for people who menstruate.  She replied to this tweet with the quote, people who menstruate.  I'm sure there used to be a word for those people.  Someone help me out.  And of course she was responding to the usage of people who menstruate instead of outright just saying women.  She followed up that tweet with a few others.  She says, if sex isn't real, there's no same sex attraction.  If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased.  I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability for men and women to meanfully discuss their lives.  It isn't hate to speak the truth.  She continues, the idea that women like me who have been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they're vulnerable in the same way as women, i.e.  to male violence, hate transgender people, because they think that sex is real and has lived consequences is a nonsense.  She also tweeted, I do not believe that it's hateful to say so.  So let's start off this conversation by establishing a couple of things.  First of all, this did not upset me.  I'm not angry with JK Rowling.  So anyone in the comment section of this video saying that I am is literally not listening.  I honestly don't know why people are surprised she feels any other way.  To me personally, while I understand that a lot of people love Harry Potter and I understand that a lot of people have this sort of connection to JK Rowling, I also recognize that she's already made her positions on this clear.  For me, people who are still acting surprised have not been paying attention or have listened to what she's previously said and held out hope that she didn't actually mean what she said.  In my opinion, JK Rowling is old enough and thoughtful and educated enough to feel a certain way about something and to say it.  I believe that JK Rowling is completely within her right to express these things.  I think that she has the right to go onto Twitter and say that she thinks that sex is real and that everyone who has a menstruation cycle is a woman.  I think that that is her right.  She can say that out loud and proudly, right?  But I don't think she gets to say that and somehow not be transphobic.  Right?  So in this video, I actually wanted to talk to you guys a little bit about transphobia and what it actually is.  Cause I think that some people get really wrapped up in the semantics of that particular conversation, but I wanted to sort of outline some of the things that she said in this video, because while I'm not mad at JK Rowling, the truth is I've known so many people.  like JK Rowling, right?  I've known so many people who on one hand say that they support and love transgender people, but on the other hand say that their identities, their lived experiences, how they experience gender is not valid, right?  So let's start from this, right?  The baseline of transphobia is an outright rejection of a transgender person's identity.  The article that she shared deliberately uses the term people who menstruate to be inclusive of trans and non-binary people who do have menstruation cycles, right?  And that was a deliberate choice.  JK Rowling went out of her way to counteract somebody who was attempting to be inclusive to transgender people and i think for that reason let's i mean there's a lot of other things to unpack but for that reason on its own I don't think she gets to claim that she is in support of transgender people.  You don't get to sort of be a person who says, well, actually you're just a woman to a non-binary person or to a trans guy and still consider yourself to be an ally to the transgender community.  You just can't, right?  So this is really common.  We have people like JK Rowling who are feminists who have created this sort of space for women to discuss their stuff and they have a hard time wanting to shift that around because they fought so hard for that spot.  Right.  So JK Rowling can, I'm sure of course know that there are transgender men and non-binary folk, et cetera, who menstruate, who can express and have experienced the same sort of things that she has, even though they don't identify as women.  I'm sure she kind of, to some degree understands that.  Right.  But if for her to concede that point, would be her losing the sort of protection that she has sort of created for other women.  Women obviously in this context being cis women.  I know that in these videos a lot of people don't like for me to use the term cis women.  Now because we're talking about trans people and we're acknowledging the fact that cis and trans folk have different experiences, we'll get to that later, I'm going to use the term cis.  Trans is a word and cis is the opposite.  That's just what it is.  For me, the phobia part of the transphobia is revealed in the fact that JK Rowling reads a phrase like people who menstruate and believes that it is some sort of great movement against women for her to consider that to be this great movement against women.  I have a hard time not seeing that as a fear.  It's something that she has totally fabricated in her mind to justify her position.  For me, one of the frustrating parts of this conversation is this assumption of how transgender people experience their biology and feel about their biology.  Most of the time when you're transgender, you're transgender because you were designated one sex at birth and you said, No.  Or you said that may be my sex, but my gender is this, right?  Most transgender people are very, very aware of how they experience, you know, their gender and how that disconnects with their biology, right?  That is... really what being trans is for most of us, right?  And the thing is, most people are not saying that most women aren't oppressed by their sex.  That's not an argument that anyone has made.  The problem of course is that there are plenty of people who were designated female at birth the way that JK Rowling was, who do not identify as women.  And that's why terms like people who menstruate exist because those are terms that are being used to deliberately include people like that.  I know that this is going to be really sort of upsetting for some people, but I think some people just need to accept that this is how JK Rowling feels.  She feels this way.  She's made how she felt very, very, very clear.  I don't think she's ever tripped over her words.  She might not have been as blatant as this, but this is how she feels.  And I think she's entitled to it.  I think that she is allowed to feel how she feels.  I just also don't think she can feel that way and then consider herself to be a meaningful ally to the transgender community.  Right.  And I think that that's something that some people really need to think about when they are bucking against the idea that they are transphobic, when they are trying to make the argument that they are on our side and that they would fight for us.  Right.  Part of fighting for us is working to deprogram a lot of that language that excludes us, right?  I don't really call a lot of things transphobia, but I think it's silly to sort of act like something like this isn't transphobia.  When you're trying to say that the only people who menstruate are women, you are alienating trans folk.  You just are.  You are completely alienating a whole group of the people that you say you advocate for.  I don't think you can do that.  I don't think you get to alienate certain aspects of the trans community and then claim to be a trans ally.  It does not work that way.  She feels how she feels.  She's made her feelings known.  It's time to move on.  It's time to read another book.  book.  This might be the Hufflepuff in me speaking, but there are so many great books out there.  You don't have to read this one.  You don't have to cling onto this one.  JK Rowling feels how she feels.  We know her, her position on transgender folks.  It's time to move on and spend our energy elsewhere.  This really is not the kind of person that I think you should be expending any energy on.  I don't think that that's something that you should even try to do.  It's just not worth it.  I know you're heartbroken, but there are other books.  I would love to know how you guys feel about this.  So please feel free to share your opinion and perspective in the comment box below.  Of course, let's keep it cordial.  We like to be a productive community over here and actually talk about things.  So if you're into that, please feel free to join us in the comments and yeah, I'll see you guys next time.

Today I watched Battle for Terra.  It's a battle over this planet that humans are calling Terra, but it's not actually called Terra, between humans and the natives of the planet that the humans are calling Terrarians.  The villain of the movie is a white guy who leads the military and is all about preserving the future of humanity by any means necessary.  Instead of, like, attempting to work with them from the beginning, This military guy just wants to eliminate them.  I had never heard of this movie before this project.  This was the first time that I had ever even, like, been aware that Battle for Terra was a movie that exists.  But would you like to know who's in it?  Evan Rachel Wood plays the main character, an alien named Mala.  Luke Wilson plays the main, like, protagonist, sort of.  I'll get to that.  Danny Trejo is in it.  Ron Perlman.  David Krumholz.  Dennis Quaid.  Amanda Peete.  Justin Long.  Mark Hamill and Danny Glover.  James Garner.  The cast for this movie is pretty star-studded, and I just had never heard of this movie.  Battle for Terra was released in 2007 and it was directed by Aristomenes Serbas.  Okay, the first pro is that it was free on YouTube.  This is the third movie that I've seen in this series that either takes place in space or involves space and space travel, the other two being Sunshine and Fantastic Four.  The CGI from the trailer and like the promos and stuff, the CGI didn't look... great, but it really wasn't that bad.  I liked it when it came to the Terrians, the aliens, in this movie.  Their animation was very fluid, the rendering was done really well, the animators clearly very much cared about what they were making, and I appreciated that.  Like I said, Justin Long is in this, and it's just been too long since I've watched a movie with Justin Long in it.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking now?  Because clearly it's time to go back.  I know, like, his face isn't in it or anything, but I like Justin Long.  Mala, Evan Rachel Wood's character, does the Tinkerbell thing where she is an inventor and she's very curious and the society that she lives in has very strict rules as far as, like, how far she can take her inventing or what kind of boundaries they set for, like, behavior and such.  And there's a reason for all of that.  But Mala, throughout the movie, is just like... Bet I could make something to help me look closer. Mala, you know that's forbidden. But why?  There's a tiny robot sidekick named Giddy, and he's my favorite character. I must say, this is not very pleasant. Finally, a space movie that actually acknowledges that, like other planets, don't have oxygen. Lieutenant Stanton requires oxygen.  Gaseous chemical element vital for respiration. But also I don't want to say like provides possible solutions to that problem because A it's only a problem for beings that require oxygen for life like humans and B I don't really know what the science behind these options are.  The movie is just kind of like.  well Mala knows how to create oxygen to sustain human life.  So Mala brings Lieutenant Stanton back to her house and creates this little oxygen environment for him so that he can, you know, restore his health and eventually help her save her planet.  Giddy tells her that he is frightened.  I scare him.  And she doesn't really understand the concept, because while her people understand what fear is, they're a peaceful planet, they're a peaceful people, so she doesn't really understand being scared of other beings.  And Giddy says to her, Everything different scares them.  Because the human beings... are human beings.  And also they've been stuck on a spaceship for, like, at least 200 years.  I feel like a lot of times in space movies, or even just in, like, sci-fi thriller or action movies where, like, big catastrophes happen, the military comes in and is usually, like, an aggressive force, but not necessarily the villain.  This movie does not go in that direction.  It is inherently told from the perspective of the natives of the planet.  that the humans are trying to colonize, and the military is in itself framed as the villain.  Jim, Lieutenant Stanton, does end up sacrificing himself for the sake of Terra.  I liked Jim, especially when he got over Xenophobia.  And with the big white meanie gone, the humans and the Terrarians live in peace and harmony and they work together to build new civilization and they build a statue in Jim's honor.  and it's like kind of sweet by the end of the movie.  I didn't really know whether this should be a pro or a con, because the captions were all accurate, and it was clear that, like, somebody, not a machine but a human being, had done the captions, had done work on them.  But then they were also on both sides of the screen, not at the same time, but, like, it's still a lot of work to have to read one end of the screen and then move to the other one.  Those were all of my pros, so now going into cons.  There isn't, like, a lot of dialogue for the first 15 to 20 minutes of the movie.  And that's not inherently a bad thing.  There just, like, wasn't anything for me to really comment on.  Dennis Quaid gets kidnapped.  I don't know what this character's name is.  He's Mala's father.  Humanity is on this spaceship looking to colonize another planet because they blew up Earth, Mars, and Venus! Eventually, humans exhausted their world's natural resources.  Two neighboring planets, Mars and Venus, were terraformed.  The colonies demanded independence.  It meant war.  All three planets were destroyed. This movie went all in with the the humans mantra.  There's definitely a missing scene somewhere.  After Mala brings Jim to her house, there's like one day where he's like freaked out by her.  Giddy.  one of them but she's also supplying him with oxygen.  and then like the next day they're having a conversation like they're just two long-lost friends that really haven't seen each other in a really long time and just haven't caught up and don't know who one another is anymore.  you made this for me rather than not knowing who one another is at all.  The humans keep attacking the native terrarians for like no other reason than colonization.  There is absolutely zero prompting on the part of the aliens to have the big white military meanie come in and blow them up.  I know there are metaphors in there.  I'm trying not to give the white creators of this movie and the white cast and the white characters too much credit for these metaphors, because when you don't have a diverse cast or crew or cast of characters in the case of an animated movie, those metaphors tend to get lost.  given that characters and people of color are really the ones that those metaphors affect.  The metaphors don't end up working as well when you don't actually put the work into diversifying your movie.  See also Zootopia.  There's like no expression on any of the human beings.  I could understand if it was like.  you only gave over-the-top expressions to some of the main characters and didn't focus so much on the secondary characters or even the characters that only show up in one or two scenes, but none of the human beings had any expression in their face whatsoever.  And I don't know if that was intentional.  Like, was it supposed to be that way?  Because the human beings are really terrible in this movie.  The story is really advanced and it looks like they tried to do a lot with the CGI, but it kind of... just looks like the first Toy Story, which was amazing in 1995.  To be fair to this movie, Toy Story didn't even really know how to handle human characters until after The Incredibles.  So imagine me barely knowing anything about this movie, literally only watching it because Chris Evans is in it somewhere, waiting to hear his voice come through one of the aliens, only to realize about 20 minutes in that he is one of the humans.  Hey, Jim.  I missed you, bro.  This is the first movie in a while in this series that Chris is not one of the main characters in.  He's a secondary character.  He plays Luke Wilson's brother in this movie.  He's kind of a villain for a little while because he's, you know, one of the military men that takes a while to, like, convince.  that what the military is doing is evil.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.  So early in the movie, before the humans ever come to Terra, Mala and Justin Long's character, Sen, are out flying.  Like the disabled character in Avatar style, Mala creates these flying contraptions.  They have mechanical wings, basically.  then we go back to their civilization and I realized that the aliens don't have legs.  They float.  They levitate.  A little bit later, Mala goes and like floats out into the night without her little flying contraption.  My question here is why does Mala need to make a flying contraption and why does she have to worry about falling at a certain velocity out of space when She floats.  Maybe I don't know that much about physics, but shouldn't she be able to, like, control that?  Because she flies!  There seems to be some kind of altered level of gravity on their planet, too, because since they don't have feet, they don't walk.  They just glide everywhere.  I'm just trying to figure out why she should be concerned with trying to fly if she already does it.  The humans think that they're at war, but the humans literally started the war.  Nothing prompted them to go to war with the Terrarians, except that they're, like, greedy and hungry and lonely and running out of oxygen in space, and instead of, you know, trying to work with the natives, they just straight up go right for the kill.  General, by any means necessary, freaks out when two of his officers or whatever are like blown into space and obviously killed.  Two more human lives lost.  But then when the big battle comes and Jim is like, The Terrians are flying new ships with more powerful weapons.  And the big bad white meanie by any means necessary general is like, oh, who cares?  Anybody that dies today will be remembered by history as a hero.  But you don't get both.  You can either freak out over the two people that died uselessly, or you can not care about them because it's two people and you've got a whole army ready to go to war with some random peaceful alien civilization.  You cannot have both, friend.  Those are all of my pros and cons.  My arbitrary rank is from Alyssa... Alyssa Ulanetti?  How similar characters' reactions are to what my reaction would be to any given situation.  So, you know, I'm not a terrarian.  So, like, my experiences are not going to be everything that Mala's are or everything that Jim's are, because I also don't live on a spaceship.  my whole life trying to find a planet so I could have some damn oxygen and water.  I feel like Jim's reaction to learning about Mala's culture is more akin to, like, my kind of reaction, but I also try not to have the kind of initial reaction that he does of just, like, immediately hating everything about it because that's xenophobia.  On the other hand, like, Mala is very, like, brave and very stubborn.  very curious, and I think I can be all of those things.  I think I can definitely react the way that she does to certain situations.  If something happened to somebody that I really loved, I probably would do whatever I needed to to go and help them and find them and bring them home.  Yeah, we'll go with that.  The IMDb score is a 6.6.  The Rotten Tomatoes score is a 5.52.  I gave this movie a 6.5, which is my first half-point score, because I liked it more than I liked the perfect score, but I didn't like it quite as much as I liked Cellular.  And the total score for Battle for Terra is 18.62.  I had not seen this movie before.  Like I said earlier, I had not even heard of this movie before.  Am I glad that I've seen it?  Yeah, sure.  It's good.  I don't think it was a waste of time, and it was free to watch, so would I watch it again?  If somebody I knew had the need to watch it, sure.  Why not?  Next up is Street Kings, which I also have never seen and didn't hear of until I did research for the series, but Keanu Reeves is in it, so how bad could it be?

Welcome to a writing vlog, I suppose.  So today it is just about 12 o'clock on Tuesday the 24th of March.  To be honest, I had a pretty rough morning.  Yeah, obviously there Life has been changing so rapidly and has been so surreal during the global pandemic that we're living in.  Like a bunch of things that I've been dealing with in my life have kind of taken a back seat.  One of which is I'm still working through things from my breakup.  Yeah.  Nothing has changed, but it was a five-year relationship, which has now been over for, you know, a few months.  and there are still emotions and stuff that come up around that obviously.  I haven't really experienced those kinds of things welling up while I've been in self-isolation because I guess I've just been distracted by everything else that's going on.  But this morning like a wave kind of crashed over me a little bit and I just was quite upset and it wasn't a great time.  But I had my cries tried to just let myself feel it and then I started to put myself together and I listened to The Adventure Zone while I was getting ready and doing my makeup and getting changed and honestly The Adventure Zone has been like saving my life every day for the past like four months and now it's time to get to writing.  but today as well as having been kind of difficult in the morning is also an exciting day because if you watched my Writing Day with Kirsty vlog, you will know that I am starting a new novel or I have started a new novel, I should say.  So I've taken something of a break from working on that while I had coronavirus and while I've just been trying to deal with everything else and take care of work and stuff.  So I think in terms of how long I've actually spent on prep and working on this novel, Preparing to start drafting I have spent about two and a half days I think like actual work time over the past couple of weeks and I am at the point where I have a complete plot embryo for the main plot.  I have a bunch of my magic system rules kind of nailed down.  I've got a rough kind of idea of the setting although there's still a bunch of stuff to figure out for that.  I want to get to drafting today.  I want to start my first draft and I'm gonna be trying something new and I'm gonna be attempting or experimenting with what I guess what I'm calling Garth Nix's drafting method.  So Garth Nix is a beloved fantasy author and one of my personal writing heroes to be honest.  Sabriel is one of my favorite books of all time and I just really love his work.  and I was really intrigued by seeing some of his old manuscript notebooks on Twitter and seeing that for quite a long time he wrote his entire draft by hand.  I think he only writes parts of his draft by hand now and does type things on the computer for his draft.  But I am super into handwriting and the power of analogue.  I do all of my brainstorming analogue, just pen and paper, and I have been burned by the idea of handwriting first draft the past.  but I also know exactly why that didn't go very well and it's because I had no idea of my plot or my main character's motive, the central conflict of the story.  So I think I want to give it another go now that I have that stable foundation of the plot embryo to guide me.  I want to try handwriting some first draft.  I'm going to attempt to do maybe just the first chapter and see how I get on with it, see if I like it, see if I feel like it works for me and then I'll kind of decide if I'm going to be typing or trying to do the entire first draft by hand or what.  We will see how I get on.  I may find that it's just too slow and it's annoying to type up and that actually just typing my first draft works better for me.  but I think it's going to be really interesting to experiment, especially since I have changed as a writer.  so, so much since the last time that I wrote any first draft, any first draft really, but especially any first draft by hand.  This book is still really, really amorphous.  I haven't had the idea for it for very long and like I said, I've only put in two and a half days worth of actual work into creating it, into creating the entire plot embryo and a world building.  Yeah, so there's a lot of stuff that's still kind of up for grabs and that I still need to figure out if I'm going to actually write this.  But I do have a rough idea for the first scene.  I don't know, I might end up having to do some more brainstorming on that as I go forward because I don't even know where it takes place and stuff.  That is what I'm going to be attempting to do today, is start writing the first scene.  If I could finish the first scene entirely, that would be amazing.  But we'll see how we get on.  Mm-hmm.  Happy Tuesday.  Let's try and do some writing.  Ooh.  Scary.  Exciting.  Book.  Writing.  I did not intend for that to rhyme, but it did.  Well, moment of truth.  Let's not overthink this.  Progress, not perfection.  Let's just start.  Okay, I am trying to nail down a particular ambient noise mix that I want to use for this book, so that I can start to create that association that when I'm hearing that noise, it is time to work on this story.  So I'm just trying to actually find an app that will let me play white noise and stuff, but also at the same time as music, because that is one of my favourite things to do, is to have some kind of white noise or rain sound or ambience and then have some music really low in the background.  But I usually do that with multiple tabs on a browser on my laptop or whatever.  So I'm just trying to find out if there's a way to do that on my phone.  Okay, well, I got very sucked into that for quite a while but I have picked the ambient noise that I'm going to start with I'm actually just picking a YouTube video because I have premium.  I can download that to listen to offline on my phone which means that I will have access to it everywhere.  I'm not sure this is the one that I'm going to stick with for the entire thing.  but I also found that some of the ambient noise soundscape channels had just like really interesting concepts for places and I think I might even though I went off on a tangent.  It's actually been quite inspiring in terms of thinking about setting and locations for this world.  So that's nice, I guess.  Making some tea and we're going to get down to this for reals.  For reals.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I did it!  So my first 20 minute sprint or session I had to kind of figure out like where the scene was set and what was happening in the beginning.  The scene is really about the main character getting some important news and then having to take action based on that.  and I couldn't figure out like well how does she get the news?  Does she get an email?  Does she get a call?  Where is she?  and what's she doing, when she gets the news and stuff.  So I had to figure that out first and that took me about 20 minutes.  And then I did another 20 minutes of actual writing.  I wrote the first sentence and I managed to get to a whole page in 20 minutes.  So it feels so weird to be doing like a complete first draft again.  And like, yeah, having to like manage that voice, which wants to say that everything I'm writing is terrible, that none of this sounds fun or good.  But yeah, also just reminding myself that, um, That is not the point of this exercise, and it will be fine.  And I need to not be too perfectionist about these sentences.  So I'm trying to just push forward and, like, because I have so much work to do in this first draft because all I have is this plot embryo and, like, a couple of, you know, a small handful of ideas about the world and stuff.  So I'm building so much as I write here that I just can't fuss over the exact wording of everything.  But that's fine.  Yeah.  It's exciting.  It's fun.  It's gonna be good.  It's gonna be good.  I probably need to eat some real food.  Yeah, I think I'll take a bit of a break and get some food and maybe do some more of this today?  Yeah.  Thank you.","channel.id":"clxmi0r7004awcdvi35jusdms","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCXjda70KpggxCpmrLpxdHuw","channel.name":"Rachael Stephen","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/np6OxA__VgCJbk5OIlCijDSyBJv5-JmLOOcSZaTlE69txJqSDb4AyF2v4d3P8KgdD5IVi3i7=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello, welcome to my writing vlog.

I have already begun legal proceedings against Pink News for this defamatory accusation.  Take this down immediately, or I will take appropriate measures. I am being threatened by Graham Linehan.  I explain why.  what Graham is fighting for, all intent aside, is effectively child torture using charity and peer-reviewed sources.  The video is now published below.  I mean, seriously.  Linehun has more than 608,000 followers compared to my 3,000.  So how on earth did this tweet of his get ratioed so badly compared to my response?  It was all over before Linehun could even realise what had happened.  You are already dead.  What?  You are already dead!  So yeah, for those of you who don't know, in the lead up to publishing my Wonderfully Evidenced video, Graham Linehan Rolls Out Plans to Eradicate Trans Children, I received a legal threat by none other than the bigot himself.  Turns out Linehan had been tagged in a retweet of my Patreon promotion which shared the video thumbnail and title, the person who did so suggesting that Linehan target my income.  And whilst Linehan had never even seen the video and the evidence contained, he decided to try and force me to take the post down mere hours before scheduled release.  So rather naturally, I went ahead and published on schedule before putting out the message that he was threatening me, the result of which was glorious.  Linehan very quickly discovered that I am immune to his threats of legal action.  I've been an online commentator for 11 years now.  I've been threatened by religious fascists and child predators, so this sort of threat is nothing new.  I've been here before, and every time, it has failed.  My wife and editor is a former practising lawyer who has become intimately knowledgeable on UK defamation law these past six months.  something that's important since, unlike places such as the US, both the UK and the Republic of Ireland place the onus of demonstrating the veracity of the original statement on the defendant.  So that is the base standard my videos adhere to.  I can very easily demonstrate due diligence carried out on behalf of my statements using evidence, because that was the focus of my video.  So Linehan really has no case no matter which court of law he attempts to pursue this in, though he could try to waste my time and resources, as slap suits are mostly intended to do.  Thankfully, if recent events have shown me anything, it's that I have a dedicated wife, circle of friends, and viewers willing to help me fight this.  Now, I'm not alone in this.  Pinknews has also been targeted by Linehan and has since removed their article reporting on his actions.  Whether this was done following them receiving a letter from Linehan's lawyer, or simply to avoid the issue altogether, is unknown to me at the time.  but I'm preparing for the worst.  Now since then I've gone ahead and started making plans for a fundraising campaign, which I'll put at the top of the video description as well as release a future video on when it's done.  We're still trying to gauge costs, but we're preparing for the worst.  So please, subscribe, like our Facebook, and follow on Twitter to stay up to date on that if you'd like to help.  By the way, the Pink News article was incredibly tame.  Titled, Graham Linehan is compiling a horrifying database of therapists with stark conversion therapy undertones, the article refused to come out and label Linehan's actions for what they were.  merely reporting on what others, such as journalist Katie Montgomery, have said on the matter.  I'd just like to add, before anyone claims the reporting of the article to be entirely one-sided, they did attempt to contact Linehan for the story, but he seemingly refused to defend his actions, instead waiting until the article had been published before posting to Twitter. that I am aware of serious unfounded allegations having been made against me recently, and this matter is now in the hands of my legal team. Funny enough, they followed this up with the statement that... As you will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment. right before Linehan would go on to start throwing his weight around.  Fact is, after I'd uploaded my response to Linehan's bullshit, I came across an article by Raoul Wilde published on the Friendly Atheist Pathias blog and shared by editor Hemant Mehta.  And in the article, which again is rather reserved, they mention Linehan's threats of legal action and how they've kept reporting the indiscretion facts of the situation.  Shortly after Hemant shared the article, Linehan came forward and told him that, Now Hemant asked to know what exactly Linehan believed to be defamation.  and receive no reply from him.  So currently the article remains up, unedited, as it should.  Now I want you to go ahead and read both articles as they're rather short, yet they both share a common trait.  Compared to my work, both articles are relatively reserved in what they say.  The Pink News article kept to what Linna himself had said and how others were responding to it, Meanwhile, whilst Rao's article on the Friendly Atheist was a little more upfront with her own feelings, they didn't come anywhere near my level of open scorn.  I not only note the fact that gender critical is simply a euphemism for transphobic in the same way that race realism is for racism, I not only point out the fact that all attempts to change a trans person's gender are harmful, I go so far as to correctly label said act as torture, and therefore child abuse.  But even these articles that do no such thing, that simply report on what Linehan had said and how others responded, those articles, in Linehan's eyes, must be silenced.  Why?  Well, most people are intelligent enough to put two and two together.  They see what Linehan is attempting to do.  something he'd much rather keep out of the scrutiny of the general public.  He's fine with his Twitter followers seeing it because he's spent years cultivating an audience that is hostile, if not apathetic, to the harm he calls as a trans community.  But the moment larger scrutiny is turned towards his actions, That seems to scare him.  And you know what?  It should.  It should scare him.  It should scare him in the exact same way that misogynists should be scared of their sexism being called out.  That homophobes should be scared of their homophobia being called out.  both of which, by the way, are things Graham Linehan also partakes in, as can be seen in his attempted policing of cis lesbian.  Linda Riley, publisher of Diva Magazine, which is Europe's leading magazine for lesbians and bisexual women, going so far as to question her lesbianship and erase the sexual identities of Diva Magazine's readership.  Graham Linehan talks a lot of shit about how he's a feminist, all the while doing everything he can to belittle and silence women who refuse to accept his bigotry, both cisgender and trans.  I mean, seriously.  What the fuck, Graham?  Mona was covering the 2011 protests in Egypt when riot police sexually assaulted her and broke both of her arms, and yet she still fights for justice.  She practically led the Mosque MeToo movement in 2018, only for you to come along and threaten her with legal action because, in her expert opinion, your actions are dangerous, yet you still claim to be speaking for women.  The women have spoken for themselves.  Linehan also recently went on to write an article for the Daily Fail, a paper that can at best be described as such. Daily Fail is far right, openly longing for fascism to take root here and abroad.  Supported the Nazis before World War II, no different now. Now, who describes the Daily Fail this way?  Well, it's Graham Linehan from 2016, of course.  The daily fail is fascist, and as a result, it's routinely misogynistic, unbasterly homophobic, and therefore makes Linehan feel right at home.  You see, I think I finally got to the core of why Linehan is the way he is.  And do note, this is just my opinion based on what I observed in regards to his actions.  Linehan is just a run-of-the-mill misogynist, only he's somewhat smart enough to realise that even his few remaining supporters likely wouldn't support outwardly misogynistic displays.  Therefore, he sets his sights on a marginalised sub-demographic of women, one he's less likely to be called out on for abusing, and for that he's chosen trans women and the many women who vocally support him.  is an outlet, a reprieve for his bigotry. He even went so far as to congratulate the Daily Fail, stating, Genuinely, thanks to everyone at the Fail, the more light shone on regressive, homophobic, misogynistic gender ideology, the better. Again, this is a paper which, among many other things, Linehan has accused of sexualising children.  And though the daily fail has only got worse as the years have progressed, Graham Linehan is now all too happy to cosy up with said fascist child groomers.  Why?  Well, to protect the little girls.  Somehow.  Something I will come around to cover in a future video.  But for now, I think that's enough said on that.  Though for someone who likes to pretend that there's some sort of transgender cabal out there, throwing around money to silence critics such as himself, I do hope Linehan comes to realise his projection on this.  To throw around the threat of lawsuit when people accurately report on your actions is a genuine attempt to stifle free speech.  Linehan has no case and he knows it.  He's merely doing this as an attempt to intimidate his critics into silence.  And it just won't work, not simply because I have a case, but because he's done the exact same thing without said evidence.  Linehan has, on multiple occasions, accused people of supporting conversion therapy because they support trans rights.  erasing the existence of gay and bisexual trans people such as myself.  And this is something Linhun does with zero basis.  Whilst I am able to show precisely how what he is fighting for is harmful and destructive, he can't do that with affirmative care.  The only peer-reviewed sources that touch the subject show that gender affirmation reduces levels of depression and anxiety in trans teens to levels equal to those seen in a cis control.  That is, it reduces it to levels seen in the general population.  It is the only ethical course of action.  That's what the science tells us, the work of countless people across various scientific disciplines.  And yet Linehan doesn't care to face the truth.

There it is, a guide to discovery.  Right now we're in chapter three, feeling the fear and doing it anyway.  Right now we're going to get to the section that has to do with being kinder to yourself as you are on your gender identity journey.  So let's dig in.  There's a good chance you are unaware of how many negative messages related to gender and gender identity you've taken in over the years.  These messages create self-loathing and shame, which fear hungrily feeds upon.  Therefore, we need to minimize how much you might be working against yourself during your gender identity exploration.  The following are ideas as to how you can do this by being kinder to yourself over the course of your journey.  Put your self-care checklist to work.  Find at least one activity a day to do for yourself from your checklist.  You can certainly do more as well as doing several at the same time.  Continue to add ideas to the checklist as you discover what it is you enjoy in life, what brings you into balance, and what gives you comfort.  If you didn't receive an adequate amount of care during your childhood and or didn't have self-care modeled for you, this might be difficult to try and can feel initially uncomfortable.  Take it slow and allow yourself to adjust to self-care becoming a regular part of your life.  Your body and mind will eventually begin to ease into it, so keep at it until it becomes as natural to you as breathing.  Cut down on excessive escapism.  You may have noticed that you indulge too much and too often in certain activities on your self-care checklist.  These activities, if done in excess, can become distractions and escapes that inhibit forward motion.  If reading that caused you to feel even a little uncomfortable, ask yourself, is this true for me?  Circle your answer below.  Yes, no, or maybe.  If you answered yes or maybe, then this is no easy step to take.  These activities have provided you with comfort over the years, protecting you from whatever it is you have buried about yourself.  However, these self-care activities crossed over at some point into avoidance technique.  Question, what activities on your self-care checklist do you think you might use for avoidance and or excessive escapism?  Let's approach cutting back on avoidance and excessive escapism in your life step by step.  By the way, the self-care checklist, you can find that in an earlier video that I recorded.  that you can find in the playlist for this video series.  Step one, cutting back a little at a time.  If you're spending on average four hours a day playing online games, cut it down to three.  If you watch Netflix 12 hours a week, cut it down to 10.  If you're on social media three hours a day, cut it down to two and a half.  During this downtime, you can continue to work more through this guide.  Explore whatever it is that this guide stirs up or inspires in you.  Journal about the challenges you encounter, what they did and didn't work, what did and didn't work, and how you are going to stay motivated to keep moving forward.  Do a different self-care activity that you know is not excessively escapist.  Continue to chip away at the amount of time you are in the excessive zone with any of the self-care activities.  You'll know you've reached your sweet spot with these activities when you sense they are helping you recuperate as opposed to helping you avoid.  Question, what else could you do during the times when you are used to doing this activity?  Step two, determining the right amount of time.  Next time you're overindulging in one of your self-care activities, listen to that little voice inside that says, I should probably stop soon, or just one more episode, game, chapter.  Think of this voice as an alarm clock inside of you that has a snooze button.  The little voice goes off, you hit snooze.  The little voice goes off again 15 minutes later.  Time to stop, the little voice says.  This is when you should close down, shut it, walk away, and find something else to do.  At what point during your activity do you usually begin to hear this voice?  Once you get into the habit of catching this voice when it comes up, Set an actual timer for 15 minutes, giving you time to wrap up your activity.  When the timer goes off, stop what you're doing no matter what.  Have something else already planned for you to do when you stop.  Step three, find other things to do.  The activity doesn't matter as much as being sure you already have it planned.  One trick is to make sure this is something you have to do at the time you're supposed to stop what you're doing.  For instance, tell someone you'll call them at the time you need to stop your activity.  Tell a family member or friend you will meet them somewhere or pick them up at a certain time.  Have a class, meeting, or gathering that you are really motivated to go to.  Turning to activities on your self-care checklist that engage a completely different part of your mind, change up your environment, and awaken your senses can also help to break these patterns of behavior.  This can include physical activity, meditation, cooking or baking, listening to music, taking a shower, sitting in a park,  etc.,  Question, what activities can you schedule for yourself ahead of time so you can do them once you stop your excessively escapist activity?  So that's a pretty intense part of the chapter and I encourage you to spend some time thinking about those questions.  Maybe listen to the video again and write down those questions and see what you can do about honestly addressing them.  So next we're going to talk about create a nurturer as a way for you to do a little something to help yourself through this part of the gender identity journey.  It turns out this part is really short, so I'm going to read it to you.  Create a nurturer.  At the very heart of self-care is the ability to receive nurturing.  What does the word nurturing bring up for you?  What do you imagine ideally that the experience of nurturing would feel like to you?  This answer will be different for everyone.  Some people need warm, comforting, and gentle nurturing.  Others need nurturing that is wise and mentor-like.  Still others enjoy a more playful, enthusiastic, and empowering side of nurturing.  There are even those who connect best with tough love approach to nurturing.  Your nurturer can also work together with your bodyguard as a team.  The nurturer can be there to help your bodyguard calm down, enabling you to be able to turn to both of them for advice, to complain about life, and to lean on for support.  Use space below to create your very own nurturer.  If you want to picture an animal instead of a person, such as a lioness or a mythical creature, then by all means do so.  The only stipulation is they need to be someone or something that you can easily conjure up in your mind when you are in need of nurturing.  Imagine them holding you, preparing you tea or a big lunch, listening to you, giving you advice or making you laugh.  The mind is powerful enough that if you allow yourself to really sink into these experiences with your nurturer, you will feel physically better afterwards.  A reduction of your blood pressure, a slowing of your breathing and a calming of your mind.  Question, how would you describe your ideal nurturer?  The next time you're in need of comfort, call upon your nurturer for help.  This will serve as a reminder to you that your self-care must become a priority and that you deserve to be treated with care, compassion, and love.  That's it for chapter three.  Next video, we're going to get into chapter four, which has to do with building your support team.  In the meantime, I'm Dara Hoffman Fox.  Thanks for tuning in and I'll see you in the next video.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello, I'm Dara Hoffman Fox, and I'm reading from my book, You and Your Gender Identity.

Can I get in the car?  Like, pardon.  I wanna, like, get in the car.  I don't know and stuff.  Like, I wanna, like, go and, like, play, like, rock and... Hi there, it's your girl Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video I'm going to showcase 25 different voices.  First, I'll start with my average voice.  So this is my average voice.  This is what I sound like if I'm not really, you know, doing anything fancy or whatever.  It's a pretty average voice for me.  I am warmed up today since I recorded the clips before this and stuff like that.  So I kind of have different forms of my voice.  So like, you know, sometimes I'll be like more here or whatever.  And sometimes I'll like come down here if I'm like really, really dark or feeling androgynous or whatever.  Of course, and I also like to operate here sometimes.  And of course, my teaching voice is more like this.  So when I'm like, okay, look, you've got to understand that this thing relates to this thing and this thing goes there.  So those are my average voices that I typically utilize.  Part, purr, heat from fire, fire from heat.  Part, heat from fire, part, purr, push, port, pool.  Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  per, part, port, pot, pool, pew, put, purr, push, never, ever, heat, pit, part, pot, port, pool, pew, put, purr, push.  Nah, I mean, like, if I'm, like, talking in a voice like this or whatever, like, normally that's, like, not, like, super, you know, desirable or whatever, but it is a valid vocal quality and this is definitely more feminine than average.  Um, okay, so, yeah, here I am with, like, a voice like this.  Like, I like this as, like, a really, like, pumped up kind of film sound, you know, where it's, like, my lips are barely even moving.  They're, like, pushed out a little bit.  It creates this warmth, and, I mean, you can do, like, a lot of different stuff with that.  Like, um, so, this is fun.  How dare you do that kind of thing, Harold!  Get your butt over here, Harold!  Get your butt over here!  I can't believe you do that in this house!  I've raised you better! I taught you better morals than that!  You young whippersnappers!  You get off my property!  Get off my lot! I see you out here on my YouTube comments!  Get out of here!  Billy!  Go get my walker!  Uh, here's a baby voice.  No, Scottish accent can differ wildly.  Scottish accent can differ so drastically.  It's a stone's throw away here.  So if I'm over here, it's just a little bit over that way.  So it's not a big deal or anything like that.  Okay, so one of the things that the falsetto does have going for us is it allows us to get like, it allows us to do, I can just like bridge that back down here or whatever, right?  So, and I'm in falsetto the entire time here.  This is like a much more difficult kind of sound.  This is like a falsetto that's like a little bit more like tamed, you know?  So this is like probably a more passable falsetto, but yeah, I'm definitely in my falsetto here.  I'm not using my modal voice.  Um, okay, so, like, everybody always says, like, don't speak in falsetto or whatever, and this is why it's- Here is an androgynous, bimodal voice where we produce multiple fundamentals at the same time. There are multiple ways to do this, I'll put a clip of the one that I've done the best, and if it's still not androgynous enough, then perhaps something more here might be akin to your liking.  This is much more of like a cyborg quality, right, so I'm trying to make my- now it's gonna be even more confusing because I've got a really high R2, but I'm trying to make my R1 bigger while I keep up the same degree of glottal behavior.  If I take it down here, then what you end up with is like another kind of, wow, I've changed the bitonal relationship in my voice.  I'm not sure how people would gender this kind of voice, so I'm going to present this as a kind of degree of neutral androgyny.  So if you think that this voice is androgynous, let me know. So this is like a voice that to me seems like it's kind of... So I would say that this is like more of an androgynous mask leaning, but it definitely has like an androgynous quality to it.  Okay, so this is, like, my stoner girl voice.  Uh, it's one of those things where, you know, you kind of just get, you know, one way or the other, but, like, it just seems like, um, uh, it just seems like it's, like, like, there's more, like, false fold in, like, a lot of those voices.  Um, it's just, like, uh, it's chill, you know?  It's chill.  Yeah.  No, no, you're- God, really?  I cannot believe that.  That is honestly so atrocious.  I can't even believe that that was like a combination, you know?  So yeah, it's going to be one of those days.  There's like a lot of this kind of digging in on the sound, right?  And it's just one of those things where you kind of want to like emphasize certain things, but at the same time, you want to like drive away from them too.  I refuse to go there.  If you plan to go there, I will not go there.  I drew my lines here when I came onto your ship.  So this kind of voice basically is when you have an asymmetric closer control over.  So it's a little bit noisier, but it's a really cool sound still nonetheless.  Here's definitely a different speaking quality than what I normally utilize.  This is more of like a, there's a two-point constriction.  I've got up constriction lower, and I've got a constriction forward. Like, I mean, if I'm all the way down here or whatever, I mean, you might as well get back to that kind of quality, right?  It's one of these things where it just, it comes out of me.  It's just a soulful expression.  You know, it's just something I've always been born with.  Coming in with a southern voice.  I grew up in a midwestern area there.  I mean, this is a little bit more... I'm gonna talk like Katherine Hepburn.  And when I'm in a voice like this, you hear, I swear, Dexter, so if I'm talking to you in a voice like this, so if I'm talking to you in a voice like this, Um, okay, so here I am and I'm just going to talk to you and I'm just going to go back and forth. And basically, I mean, I can just have a normal conversation with you and just switch back and forth between these different qualities of sound.  While we're in the middle of it, I might as well go a little bit slower with it.  You know, this is like a sort of undulating gender voice where you are sort of perpetually flipping between different gendered qualities.  I wonder if there is anyone in the world who has ever slowly started to normalize this kind of speech behavior pattern, because technically you could totally normalize this kind of speech behavior pattern, but it would certainly be a very dynamic quality that might have a lot more to do with the way that you're feeling on that day than necessarily the way that your voice normally sits.  You're actually so rude and I cannot believe that you treat your customers this way.  I demand to speak to your manager right now.  Right now.  You better send your manager out to me right now.  Oh, my name?  Yeah.  No!  Oh my god, I cannot believe that you did that.  No, it's like one of my favorite things ever.  Oh my god, thank you.  so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so much for doing that for me.  I literally can't thank you enough.  It's just such a heartbreaking moment.  There's something about that.  It's just, it touches me in such a positive way.  I'm just overcome with grief.  I'm just overcome with grief and emotion.  There's just something about that.

He's the loving father figure to everyone's favorite villain turned hero, a dedicated tea enthusiast, and one of the most powerful benders in the show.  But what exactly makes him so memorable and lovable?  As the uncle of a character who only joins the main group in the final season, it would be easy for his role to be simple and forgettable, but it's definitely not.  In this video, I'm going to run down just some of the reasons why I think we all remember and cherish Uncle Iroh so much.  When you first watch Book 1, Iroh comes across as just a really chill uncle.  He's supportive of Zuko, but he mostly just wants to drink tea and relax.  He's a bit of comedic relief to Zuko's constant angst.  But as the series progresses, we learn more and more about who he is.  We learn that his son died fighting in the war, and that he gave up being a general after that.  We learn that he just wants a humble life with his nephew and a tea shop.  We learn that he did not actually kill the last dragon, he only lied about that to protect the dragons.  As a part of that, we learn that he knows the true meaning of firebending, which many in the Fire Nation have forgotten.  He knows that firebending is about life and energy, while many others continue to feed their firebending with rage and hatred.  And we learn that he's part of the Order of the White Lotus, an ancient secret society with members from multiple nations that seeks to learn about the world.  The slow unveiling of all this over the course of the series gradually gives Iroh more and more depth.  That makes him an interesting character for sure, but there are two specific Iroh moments that I think really have the biggest emotional impact on the viewer.  In Book 2, in the Tales of Ba Sing Se episode, Iroh goes around helping people, first an infant, then some children, and then an adult.  It seems normal enough.  I mean, his role is kind of that wise old person dishing out advice and proverbs.  But the end of the episode really hits you hard and recontextualizes everything you just saw.  That episode takes place on his dead son's birthday, and he had been gathering things to have a memorial for Lu Ten.  This one line from Iroh is so powerful.  If only I could have helped you.  This changes the meaning of everything he just did.  He wasn't just being a kind old man.  He was trying to help people in the same way.  he wishes he could have helped his son.  He feels like he failed his son, and he's spending the rest of his life, in a way, trying to make amends.  There's nothing he can do to bring back Lu Ten, but he can make the world a little bit better by helping others.  Maybe through helping someone else, he can set them on the right path before a tragedy befalls them or their loved ones.  It's too late for him, but it doesn't have to be too late for someone else.  It's hard to express how much emotion and meaning is portrayed in this very short story.  The song he sings at the end has the lyrics about a soldier boy marching home, but his son never got to march home, and I just, I can't handle it.  But there's also the second Iroh moment I want to talk about, and that's his reunion with Zuko at the end of Book 3.  Iroh was absent from a good chunk of Book 3.  We saw him early on in a Fire Nation prison, but he escapes, and then Zuko goes to join Aang and the others.  While they go on training and doing their team avatar thing, nobody knows where Iroh is.  Zuko is worried that Iroh will never forgive him, because Iroh had already believed in him so much, and Zuko had betrayed him.  So when they finally do meet up with Iroh again, there's a big question mark looming over how Iroh will react to Zuko.  When he was in prison, Iroh had at first refused to even talk to Zuko, and then later tried again to convince him that he still had good within him.  so it could go either way.  At the very least, he would have every right to be mad at Zuko at first and forgive him later.  But what actually happens is that as soon as Iroh sees Zuko, he grabs him and pulls him into a tight hug.  He's just happy that his nephew has chosen to fight for what's right and has finally managed to break away from Ozai's horrible influence over him.  What mattered to Iroh wasn't how long it took Zuko or how Zuko had betrayed him earlier, it only mattered that he had finally gotten to the place that Iroh had wanted for him.  And I don't know how you don't cry at that moment.  It's such a pure, wholesome moment of love.  Iroh cares so deeply about Zuko that he's willing to instantly, without hesitation, forgive Zuko's betrayal at Ba Sing Se.  He's been a loving, understanding father figure for the whole show, but that's really the biggest gesture he could possibly make, and it's exactly what Zuko needed.  I think it's those two moments, Iroh setting up the memorial for Lu-Ten and Iroh hugging Zuko, that really cement Iroh as a fan favorite character.  But it's how those moments are connected that I think really makes Iroh a more interesting character.  My first reaction to learning about Lu-Ten was that Iroh was trying to raise Zuko well because he didn't have the chance to keep raising Lu-Ten.  Zuko was like the people in the Tales of Ba Sing Se that Iroh helped.  He was someone who needed guidance and love.  But I think there's actually a lot more to it than that.  Iroh didn't see Zuko as Luten, necessarily, but as Iroh himself.  Iroh used to be a general in the Fire Nation army, next in line to the throne.  He bought into all the Fire Nation's propaganda and was fueled by anger and hate.  He was just like Zuko.  That is, until he lost Luten.  After the death of his son, he was beside himself with grief.  He stopped his siege on Ba Sing Se and left to travel the world, leaving Ozai to claim the throne in his absence.  We don't know a lot about what happened during his travels.  All we know is that he changed a lot, since he had previously laughed at the idea of burning Ba Sing Se to the ground, but was now happy to live in Ba Sing Se serving tea.  During his travels, he must have learned about the different forms of bending and became friends with earthbenders and waterbenders.  which we know because of his connection to the other members of the White Lotus, and because of the importance we see in place on the balance between the elements.  Zhao even mentions that Iroh has been to the spirit world, which probably happened during those travels.  When Aang is in his spirit form and no one can see him, Iroh somehow does, meaning that he has a level of connection to the spirit world that very few other people do.  I think his travels after Luten's death did a couple of major things for him.  First, it humanized the people outside of the Fire Nation for him.  The Fire Nation propaganda relied on the idea that the Fire Nation was spreading prosperity, and that their war was necessary to share that prosperity with the world.  To make this argument, they had to position themselves as the superior nation.  According to the propaganda, the Earth Kingdom obviously couldn't be happy without the superior Fire Nation to rule over them.  But in his travels, Iroh must have seen that that wasn't true at all.  He would have seen that people from the other nations got along just fine without the Fire Nation, and in fact, they hated the Fire Nation and the war.  He had been so steeped in propaganda before that, and only surrounded by other Fire Nation people who were also steeped in that propaganda.  His travels allowed him to finally see outside of that limited worldview, helping him to see the humanity in those who were different from him.  And secondly, it allowed him to incorporate aspects of the different nations into himself.  This is best illustrated in the episode Bitter Work in Book 2, when Iroh teaches Zuko how to redirect lightning.  In this episode, he explains how knowledge must be drawn from different sources, and that knowledge drawn from just one perspective is rigid and stale.  He explains that even a firebender can learn from studying the ways of earthbenders, waterbenders, and airbenders.  This is directly at odds with the Fire Nation propaganda that fire is the superior element.  And so Zuko pushes back on this idea, but Iroh insists that learning about others is important.  He illustrates this by noting that he developed lightning redirection by studying waterbenders.  His connection to the spirit world is also unlike other firebenders, since airbenders are the ones who tend to be the most spiritual, so the loss of his son.","channel.id":"clxmi0m7i00t1cdvi0a5yca5r","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCVF8SAGEQnBA-yKM4iQNqfw","channel.name":"Riley J.

So let's talk about Jeffree Star.  Now, this is not the first time I've actually talked about Jeffree Star.  I made a video a couple of years ago when a lot of people were pulling up his old racist videos.  In that video, basically, I made the argument that we really can't judge people's current feelings about racism based on these 10-year-old videos.  I also made the argument that, you know, MySpace was a different time because it truly was.  I mean, it was definitely a time where lots of choices were made.  we should actually interrogate him about how he currently feels.  Basically, I made the argument that if the only black people in Jeffree Star's life are there to make him money, that's not necessarily evidence that he's not a racist, right?  Now, hearing that, y'all should be able to see that I gave him a lot of leeway.  I cut him a lot of slack.  Now, what some of you guys might not know from just watching that video is that after I posted that video, Jeffree Star filed a copyright claim against me.  It was one of the few times where I've had a video literally just yanked off of YouTube.  It was one of the most upsetting experiences I've ever had on YouTube, right?  And of course I disputed it.  The video got reinstated.  Everything was copacetic and cool.  But Jeffree Star, even with me giving him a very light criticism where I defended him low key, still, still, try to get my YouTube channel deleted.  So I'll be honest, all the leeway that I gave him, I almost immediately regretted it because he did not deserve it.  So in this video, I'm definitely going to be speaking really bluntly.  Now we know that we're not a drama channel over here.  This is not a drama channel.  We're not here to spill tea or dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  If I have conversations like this on my channel, it's because I do believe there is a larger message here, but I wanna make it really clear that I'm not here to mince words.  So I want to start out by saying that I've known a lot of people like Jeffree Star, people who believe that everyone they interact with is jealous or bitter or doesn't like them.  You know, people who have enemies everywhere, people who have this like revolving door of friends that never stick around or leave as quickly as they came.  Like, I've known so many people like this.  And when you get closer to people like that, you kind of start to understand that it's not that everyone hates them and everyone's bitter and no one can stand them.  It's more that they're just toxic people.  People like Jeffrey really require praise, right?  And whenever somebody goes just a little bit off script, a little bit off script they've got to either bump them off or butter them up to the point where they're back on the script.  do you know what i mean?  and i think we saw that with a couple of people.  i mean we saw that with rich lux who used to openly criticize jeffree star but is now seemingly on his payroll right.  and again we're not a drama channel.  we're not here to talk about all the tea but you guys can tell i i do watch.  Now listen, I want to give people credit where credit is due.  Jeffree Star, even though he's been accused of being a terrible racist, has been posting a lot about Black Lives Matter.  He's been posting about George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and I think that that is actually a really great thing.  But like a lot of these companies who have come out and started to say these really positive things about Black Lives Matter, there have been some people who have decided to take this opportunity to call them out for their own anti-blackness.  So in my first video, I basically say that we can't really judge Jeffrey based on what he did 10 years ago.  We have to judge him based on what he does today.  Well, recently, a person named Tab, who is a former friend of Jeffree Star, released this video where he goes into detail about some of the racist things that Jeffree Star said in his earshot. So the story begins me coming up to the hotel room.  We were supposed to go see Gwen Stefani actually live in concert.  And basically she canceled the show.  So we were all figuring out what we were going to do for the night.  And I had stepped outside on the patio and Jeffrey told me, you know, like, wow, I can't believe.  she canceled the show and continued to say a very derogatory word towards Jewish people.  It starts with a K. I'm not going to repeat the word, but that's what he said.  And when we went to the store, were looking at all this different stuff all these different bags or whatever different wallets or whatever inside of the store and Jeffrey had made a specific comment about illegal leathers and exotic animal skins that are available at Hermes but aren't legal in the state of Los Angeles and he had made a comment saying that the same mayor that's making exotics illegal in Los Angeles is the same mayor that is giving illegals green cards.  And I had told Jeffrey, you know, hey, I'm just going to go home because I had already been feeling uncomfortable, but he begged me to come to the club and was like, hey, you can wear a pair of my security guards pants or I could buy you a new outfit, whichever you like.  So when we were walking to his hotel room which was a couple of rooms down from Jeffrey's at the time and I'm not going to mention his name but he had told me a story about how he was an ex-police officer and he had got fired in Miami for saying the n-word on the job and Jeffrey flew him from Miami to be his personal bodyguard or security guard or whatever.  knowing that this guy named rich lux or whatever his name is he had come up to the hotel room with two security guards or whatever that was about and He had bought Jeffrey a gift from Hermes, the same store we were at earlier.  The second he left the room, Jeffrey tells me and everyone else in the room, like, yeah, he got me the cheapest thing in the store.  And it's just funny.  I already have that.  The reason why I mentioned that is because he has a tendency to just talk bad about everybody. And it... really just sucks. so jeffrey likes to point out that a lot of people who call him out are just these fame hungry people looking for likes shares and views and i'll be completely honest and say that i think that's very very true to some degree.  there are a lot of people who make jeffree star content where They're just sort of, you know, posturing and being so offended and, you know, doing all of this stuff.  that's just so over the top to talk about Jeffree Star.  Honestly, in a lot of cases doing things that are kind of innocuous, right?  But that all being said, Tab is not a person who is looking for social media followers.  And I watched the entire video and I definitely got the impression that Tab was just the sort of person who wanted to come on here, say those things and leave.  He's not looking for subscribers.  He's not looking for clout.  He's not looking for any of that.  So I tend to find what he says to be very credible.  I don't want to believe that, you know, Jeffree Star is a terrible racist, but how many times do we have to hear this story over and over and over again?  until it becomes true.  So Tab came out and had those conversations, but also as a reaction to Jeffree Star posting more Black Lives Matter content, a micro influencer named Cameron Lester decided to share his experience working with Jeffree Star.  Now Cameron has been in several promotional photo shoots for Jeffree Star's cosmetics and he's partied with Jeffree.  He considers himself to have been a friend to Jeffree Star and he made a video recently detailing why he no longer supports him. This is my story and I just want to be upfront.  I was like, hey, like, you know, are you going to say anything?  Like, you know, I feel like it would really say a lot if you could apologize to Jackie and the community and all this kind of stuff.  And he kind of shut it down.  He's like, she doesn't deserve a fucking spot on my platform.  And so I was just like, whatever.  It wasn't personally towards me.  So I was uncomfortable, but I just was like, whatever.  It got to a point where I just felt like I was being used as a black boy. I felt like... I was always defending Jeffrey on Twitter.  I was always going in, going in, but I've never got the same in return energy from him.  He's done so much for me.  And I used to always like, you know, he put me in my first campaign, he's done all these things and I'm like, let me not say anything.  So I was going hard for him on Twitter because I'm getting backlash, but he would never defend up for me.  So I was really hurt. Now, full disclosure, I've met Cameron and I think that he is an absolutely lovely young man, but I gotta be honest, I really don't know what he was expecting.  I don't really take any pleasure in essentially saying I told you so, but I don't know what Cameron was expecting.  And to some degree, I know he was expecting more views, I know he was expecting more subscribers, but I gotta be real with you guys.  Cameron Lester worked with Jeffree Star because Jeffree has a massive platform.  And if Cameron worked with Jeffree, that obviously would mean a lot to his career.  Jeffree Star has 18 million subscribers on YouTube, and it seems like no conversations about his former or current racism are ever going to significantly hurt his platform.  And I'll be honest with you guys, it has been really interesting for me to observe the way that Jeffree Star has been handled and seen and still celebrated.  Now, in this video, he talks a lot about feeling tokenized, feeling like he is going out and defending Jeffree Star and then being called a coon and being called all of these terrible things because he's defending somebody who a lot of people said was a racist right and how he didn't feel like that was reciprocated how he didn't feel like his labor in defense of his white friend who was accused of racism was not reciprocated right.  i think that isolation has opened a lot of people's eyes to the energy that they spend and whether or not it was productive and good and useful for them.  And when I look at the situation, I look at somebody who spent a really huge amount of emotional energy defending somebody who, frankly, we warned you about.  What I call Jeffree Star out, a lot of people's reaction to that was to tell me to be patient and to be educational and to help them out, understand.  And, you know, honestly.  When he claimed my video, I kind of knew that he wasn't the kind of person who would listen to that.  When it comes to racism, there are definitely people who are ignorant.  There are definitely people who don't know.  no better, right?  But one of the sort of sad realizations I've had is that there are people who know better and know that they're being racist and know that they're saying really bad things and they just don't care.  Furthermore, there are people who know that they can't say certain things publicly, so they will only say them privately amongst friends and amongst people who they know they won't get called out for saying those things.  Personally, I've learned a lot in isolation, and one of the things that I'm constantly thinking about now is who I give my energy to.  recently finished this really amazing book called why i'm no longer talking to white people.  you can't really see it about race.  it's by renny edo lodge and it's a really amazing book.  it's really vital i think for anyone who's trying to understand why so many of these conversations are frustrating.  And I wanted to read a passage from it because it really made me think a bit about this whole Cameron Lester situation.  This is part of the chapter about race and class.  She writes, so although class and race are inextricably connected for people of color, moving or changing class can be a tantalizing prospect.  Children of immigrants are often assured by well-meaning parents that educational access to the middle class can absolve them from racism.  we are told to work hard go to a good university and get a good job.  we can't berate our parents for wanting us to have a better life and better chances than they did.  but after i graduated i quickly realized that social mobility was not going to save me And I thought that that was a little bit relevant here because it's almost like Cameron saw the racism and was like, okay, but not me though.  You know, okay, maybe he did say this about this person, but like, not me though.  It's really seductive to a lot of black people to believe that you're going to be able to put yourself in a position if you just walk and act and talk the right way.  Racism is something that you're not going to experience.  But, you know, for me, again, I don't take pleasure in saying I told you so, but I don't know how Cam looked at Jeffree Star and all the merriest accusations of racism and didn't think it would happen to him.  I don't understand that.  I do not get that, right?  For me, the lesson in all of this is, again, to really think about where you're spending your energy.  After all of that, Cameron still has under 100,000 subscribers.  I think his most recent video has under 2000 views.  He put himself all the way out there, exhausted himself, got attacked on Twitter, put himself into a position where he's potentially going to be seen less favorably by other black influencers.  All for nothing.  All for nothing.  And I'm not saying it would have been worth it if he got something out of it.  But I just want to point out the little that was gained from it all.  Because at the end of the day, I do think that that stands... as evidence that this is not productive for you.  This is not helpful for you.  So at the end of the day, I again think that this was a big lesson for Cameron.  I think that he is going to really come out of this with more awareness.  And I think that's a great thing.  I think that in this time in quarantine, I think this is a Really important time to hunker down and to gain more awareness.  I think that Cameron fell down the trap that a lot of us fall through, a lot of Black people fall through.  We believe that it's just not going to happen to us if we act the right way.  And I'm glad that he was able to see through it and to call it out.  And I hope he moves forward, not backwards.  There have been a couple of people who have called out Jeffree Star only to get some PR randomly.  And I just, that's, we really hate to see it.  We really, really, we really do hate to see it.  So anyway, I think I've said all I want to say about this.  If you have anything to add, I would love to hear it in the comment box below.  I'm curious for the black folk watching this right now.  Would you ever work for Jeffree Star?  Would you ever collaborate with Jeffree Star?  Would it be worth selling your soul?  Let me know.  I'll talk to you guys next time.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0oqh02kncdvicaxc7qeq","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxFWzKZa74SyAqpJyVlG5Ew","channel.name":"Kat Blaque","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJWT7XDNz1Vl0sA7fBPrC4jkoFJO34GYvdMQlqX0Vg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The video discusses Jeffree Star, a YouTuber who has been accused of racism.

Do you like D&D?  Are you feeling sad about the soy state of British discourse surrounding trans people?  Or do you simply hate Graham Linehan?  If you answered yes to any of those three questions, then haven't I got the stream for you.  On both the 6th and the 7th of March at 7.30pm Coordinated Universal Time, I'll be DMing a couple of one-shot sessions to try and raise money via Twitch.  Money for what, you ask?  while to act as a legal defence fund against Graham Linehan.  You see, the once-comedy writer has threatened to file a slap suit against me and numerous others for accurately reporting on this ongoing harassment of the trans community, and rather than lay down and take it, I've decided to stand up and set a legal precedent.  Down with this sort of thing, as the actually funny writer for that old show might have written.  So I'd like to personally invite you to tune into our antics on Friday the 6th as the party tries to survive Monstrous Park, the biological preserve founded and run by gazillionaire dwarf John Hammond.  Then, on Saturday the 7th, join in as our party sets out to uncover the secrets of the Seamot Orphanage in the Terror of Gragom, fighting to free it from the clutches of a truly foul creature.  But that's not all we have to offer.  On Saturday the 8th, we intend to host a series of interviews with various trans people, covering a wide range of topics and experiences.  And if you'd like to be a part of that, then please, do contact me via either Facebook, Twitter, or the email given below so we can set a time.  You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter to stay up to date on our guest appearances.  Now, I need to be clear.  I need some practice.  So I'll be doing a series of spontaneous streams in the weeks leading up to the main events.  It's my first time streaming, so it should be very interesting to see me learn how to swim by throwing me into the pool.  So don't forget to subscribe on Twitch as well.  Now, our initial goal is to raise the \u00a36,000, or US$7,800, to cover travel expenses and initial legal fees, though we'll be trying to raise more in case Graham attempts to drag this out.  which, yes, I know is a lot of money, but that's how slapsuits work.  Any money not used to fight Graham in this case will go to a public trans defence fund to fight any future slapsuits targeted at human rights activists and feminists by people such as Graham.  Activists and feminists like the many wonderful creators helping out on this project, such as The Serfs, Vadim from Creationist Cat, Objectively Subjective, So that about sums it up.  Though, do be aware, if you'd like to know more about the situation as a whole as well as the breakdown of legal costs, I've gone ahead and produced a slightly more detailed video covering all that information, and there'll be links below in the description and the pinned comment.  So hopefully, we'll see you there, and from myself and Edita, take care now.","channel.id":"clxmi0qha03srcdvizorbrtrp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCmFJ77PwU4PD4Im3s9kiWCg","channel.name":"EssenceOfThought","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVV4yEm1r9yCEmYRauRYtlLJb2PJpsoF5-bjlsbMA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The streamer will be hosting two one-shot Dungeons & Dragons sessions on March 6th and 7th at 7:30pm UTC to raise money for a legal defense fund.

Raymond. Outside of their relationship together, Holt has all sorts of other plans and ambitions.  He wants to be the commissioner of the NYPD, and when that fails, he goes on a solo vacation to Mexico where he accidentally interrupts Jake and Amy's honeymoon.  He's a complicated character who isn't defined solely by his relationship to Kevin, but who's allowed to have a partner who is a major part of his life, just like any straight captain would.  Kevin even has his own relationship to many of the other characters, like Jake and Gina, and doesn't exist solely as Holt's husband.  When your queer characters are allowed to be their own people with motivations and troubles and relationships just like any straight character, that's when you're nailing the good queer representation.  We don't need more stereotypes, and we don't need more half-second long kisses between nameless queer background characters.  We need fleshed out main characters who just happen to be queer.  We need more Holts, Kevins, Rosas, and Jocelyns.  Hell yeah.  And bonus points if the actor you get to play the character is queer too.  Rosa is played by Stephanie Beatriz, who is out as a bisexual woman, and Jocelyn is played by Cameron Esposito, who is an out lesbian.  I don't think it's necessarily wrong for a straight actor to play a queer character.  I mean, kind of the whole thing about acting is that you're pretending to be someone or something that you're not.  But when a queer character is played by a queer actor, it just means so much more.  That representation exists not only in the character, but also in the actor.  They get to be the representation that they needed growing up.  And people looking up to that character can also look up to that actor in a similar way.  Watching interviews with Stephanie Beatrice is incredible because she's able to talk about what this representation means to her personally, and I think that in itself is powerful and important.  People often ask, why does this character need to be queer?  And it's kind of an insulting question because nobody asks, why does this character need to be straight?  There doesn't necessarily need to be a reason.  Some characters are straight, some are bi, some are gay.  Your characters don't need a reason to have brown hair or be tall, because that's just a part of who they are.  that's chosen by whoever wrote them.  The same goes for their sexual orientation.  But at the same time, queer people exist in the real world, and if you want your show to reflect the real world in some way or be relatable for the people watching it, then it may sense to include queer characters.  It would be weirder to just completely ignore the existence of queer people.  So don't ask, why does this character need to be queer?  Just make queerness a normal part of some of your characters, because it's a normal part of so many people's lives already.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine understands this lesson, which is why the queer representation on the show is so good.  With season 7 coming out so soon, I'm excited to see where it takes Rosa, Holt, and the rest of the cast.

Thanks, everyone, and I'll see you next time.  Nothing would make me prouder than being your big daddy.  A while ago, I made a video about Rosa Diaz's coming out arc on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but now I want to talk about basically what happens after the coming out.  Queer stories so often revolve around coming out because it's such a big moment in the lives of so many queer people.  But it's definitely not the only part of our stories.  After every coming out, there's an entire life that follows.  And what I think Brooklyn Nine-Nine has done well and continues to do well is portray its queer characters in a realistic, funny, relatable way beyond their coming out.  These characters don't just spend one episode having their coming out arc and then never talk about it again.  Just like real people, they continue to live their lives, something that, if you're queer, involves a bit of queerness.  But they also don't become just stereotypes.  Their stories don't only become about their queerness.  That kind of representation can be exhausting, because that's not all we are.  These characters on Brooklyn Nine-Nine are given the space to just be normal characters who happen to be queer, which is refreshing and heartwarming.  It strikes a good balance between no queer representation, which sucks, and the full-on only-ever-give-them-storylines-that-have-to-do-with-being-queer kind of representation.  This middle ground is what I'm calling, in this video, casual queer representation.  But really, it's just well-done queer representation.  So first, let's go over Rosa and her girlfriend Jocelyn, and then we can talk about the queer couple that's been in the show since the beginning, Captain Holt and Kevin.  Let's do this.  After coming out as bisexual in season 5 and having some brief things with women, season 6 is when Rosa gets a girlfriend.  In episode 6 of that season, we learn about her because Rosa has some wacky hairstyles throughout the entire episode, and she explains that her girlfriend is in cosmetology school and practicing on her.  Is it bad? Before I answer that question, do you currently have a knife on you?  Yeah, several.  Then I love it. So not only does it make every scene hilarious when Rosa consistently has new, out-of-character hairstyles, but we get a little peek into what her dating life is like.  The episode is definitely not about her relationship, it's about her and Jake trying to solve a seemingly impossible murder, but the little glimpse we get of it is sweet and funny.  That's solid, casual queer representation, if you ask me.  It fits into the plot, it's not forced, it just makes sense.  Can we find a segue? What?  You can't just say let's find a segue. Well, we're off track now, so, uh, good day. I just did.  Okay.  Later, in episode 11, as the B-plot for that episode, Captain Holt wants to meet Rosa's girlfriend and invites them over for dinner. Kevin will be making his famous rice. I thought this plot was interesting because it shows that queer people don't all just automatically get along with each other and have everything go smoothly.  There's conflict between two main queer characters, even if it is really just an issue of miscommunication.  You see, Rosa and Holt's relationship is fun to watch not just because they're both queer, but because they're the two emotionless main characters.  Emotionless in quotes, because they both definitely have emotions.  Holt just hides his behind a nearly unreadable poker face, and Rosa tries to act too tough for emotions.  And so seeing them have any sort of emotional reaction when interacting with each other makes it that much more emotional for the viewer, since they normally don't outwardly express those feelings.  And when you add on top of that the fact that Holt has been out for decades while Rosa only came out recently, you get this incredibly sweet relationship where Rosa looks up to Holt, and Holt wants to make sure that Rosa is happy.  Holt has blazed a bit of a trail for Rosa.  His coming out as a gay man was definitely different from her coming out as a bisexual woman, but he was still the first out queer person in their precinct, and he comforted her when she came out and was scared. Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place. So now that Rosa has a girlfriend, you can see why she would be nervous about having her meet Holt.  Holt means so much to her and has helped her through a lot, so if he doesn't like her girlfriend, that would break Rosa's heart.  Thankfully, at the end of the episode, Holt meets Jocelyn and does like her.  The next episode to feature Jocelyn is episode 14, where Rosa has to choose between helping her coworkers catch a hacker in the precinct, or talking to Jocelyn to stop her from breaking up with her.  This episode manages to extract some emotions from Rosa, and has her admit that she really loves Jocelyn.  Here, we see that queer relationships have ups and downs, just like any other relationship.  Jocelyn feels like Rosa prioritizes her work over their relationship, which is a problem that many people face in their relationships, and Rosa has to do something drastic to prove that she will prioritize spending time with Jocelyn more in the future.  It's a really cute moment squeezed into a hectic episode that nails the casual queer representation.  This is Rosa's life, girlfriend and all.  It's not any sort of statement, it's not about her queerness per se, it's just her life, and her life definitely involves her girlfriend.  It's real and genuine and casual the way good queer representation should be.  In between these episodes, Rosa does all sorts of other stuff.  She fires a flaming arrow into a pile of stuff that the squad has thrown away as a part of a Norwegian organizing technique called Munchensmat.  She helps Amy realize that she did the right thing by pursuing a difficult case.  She goes undercover to get the name of someone's supplier.  She solves a murder.  And towards the end of the season, she ships Boyle to New Jersey and opens a door with her chin.  She's got quite a bit going on.  that has nothing to do with her being bi, but she is given the space to date people and talk about them and have them be a part of the show, just like any other character.  And importantly, she doesn't become any kind of stereotype of a bisexual person.  She's still the same Rosa, it's just that now she dates women sometimes.  Then there's Holt and Kevin, also known as Jake's father figures. My two dads.  straight smashing it. These two have so many adorable moments, despite the fact that, to my knowledge, they have not shared an on-screen kiss.  Both Holt and Kevin are very serious, professional people who are not big on public displays of affection.  In fact, in season six, there's a scene where they shake hands and comment on it being PDA. PDA in the office?  My, my. Couldn't help myself. That's something that makes complete sense with what we know about the two of them and their personalities.  But just because we don't see them kiss doesn't mean we don't see any affection between them.  One of my favorite little things that happened twice in season six was the show slowing down for a moment, showing Holt on the phone with Kevin, and having him say, I love you. We'll eat the extra rice for breakfast.  I love you as well. This short scene completely breaks the otherwise blazing fast pace of this 20 minute comedy show, which makes it all the more sincere and heartfelt.  It's not another bit, it's not a joke, it's just a quick pause so that Holt can tell his husband that he loves him.  It's such a small thing, but it warms my heart so much.  Maybe because you kind of expect big heartfelt moments when something dramatic happens or when there's a fancy scene, but you don't necessarily expect to see just a casual.  I love you on the phone, which makes it feel all the more genuine.  Like you're getting a little sneak peek into how they talk to each other normally. I'll tell you the entire story, Timothy.  I love you as well. There's also the moment where they both independently push back against the idea that being called a dirtbag is a bad thing because they have the same literal interpretation of it. A dirtbag is a useful part of a vacuum.  I don't see how it's an insult.  Sorry, I couldn't bring myself to call him a dirtbag. Then why would you?  A dirtbag is a very useful part of the vacuum cleaner. Or there's the time where they have a flashback to when they got married, just as same-sex marriage was legalized, and bond over a little joke that Holt made. I remarked afterwards that I wish the O-ficient had been more... And then, because they're such literal, rational people, one of my favorite moments between them was when they decided to take a trip every year.  Not because they have to do something, like buy a pie when they get there, but because they like spending time with each other.","channel.id":"clxmi0m7i00t1cdvi0a5yca5r","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCVF8SAGEQnBA-yKM4iQNqfw","channel.name":"Riley J.

We're in chapter three, which has to do with feeling the fear and doing it anyway.  The next part of this chapter has to do with how you can take a positive approach to your fears as they come up.  This isn't for everybody, but for those of you who it might work for, I invite you to listen to this.  Taking a positive approach.  If you believe in the power of the mind to change a negative to a positive, then give any or all of the following pointers a try.  Think of these as magic elixirs.  you can whip out of your cloak at the first sign of a fear arising and douse it with these tips.  Wow, I was feeling really creative that day.  Number one, remember, why are you doing this?  Quote, people don't transition to become less happy.  I heard this at the 2015 Transforming Gender Conference in Boulder, Colorado, and was struck by its simple yet empowering truth.  We all go through transitions over the course of our lifetimes.  We go through them hoping to improve our lives, even if it's totally nerve-wracking while we're going through it.  Whether or not you end up literally transitioning with regard to your gender identity, taking a closer look at yourself will more than likely result in a life transition for you.  So the first thing I ask you to do is to go back to your logline, and in the book it's on page 12, and I ask you to write it here.  So that's from an earlier video that you can look up.  that has to do with creating a logline.  This is your reminder of why it is.  you are tired of feeling the way you feel and of living the way you live.  Although you may have unhappy moments along the way, your goal is to move more toward happy or content or peaceful or balanced, whatever word works for you.  Two, focus on the possible positive outcomes.  Sometimes it's hard to know what you will end up enjoying after you go through a life transition.  Right now, take a moment to imagine what your life could be like several years after you have embarked upon your gender identity journey.  Think about what sorts of positive changes have occurred.  Let your mind wander through the possibilities of your new life.  List at least five positive changes that you can see resulting from making this life transition.  So then you'll write them down.  What you've written about, what you've written above gives you hope and hope is one of the most powerful elixirs you can use against fear.  Three, expose yourself to more positive narratives.  Many of you use social media and more than likely read through the feed on your favorite platforms several times a day.  More than likely, you are friends with or follow people who are transgender, non-binary, gender diverse, or questioning their gender identity.  You may follow or subscribe to groups and organizations that share these kinds of stories and experiences.  Next time you are perusing social media, pay attention to the types of videos, messages, and stories you are taking in.  Let's look closer at the first 10 to 20 posts, tweets, pictures, messages, or videos that you see.  How many of them leave you feeling better, inspired, motivated, excited?  And I have a line here for you to write that down.  So what I said was the first 20 things you look at, Keep track.  How many of them help you feel better?  How many of them leave you feeling worse, worried, defeated, depressed?  And then write that down here too.  If your worst number is higher than your better number, then something needs to change.  Go through and remove, hide, unlike, unfollow, or block the people and groups that you need to distance yourself from, even if it's just temporary, so you can increase the positive number of messages you are receiving and decrease the number of negative messages.  Start keeping track of your social media exposure and what it is that makes you feel better and what makes you feel worse.  Take this empowering step toward gaining control over the types of messages you are taking in on a daily basis.  So that's it for that part.  This is a very long chapter that has to do with feeling the fear and what to do about it.  So there's going to be a couple more suggestions that I have.  Next, we will be talking about how you can be kind to yourself in the meantime.  Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next video.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello, I'm Dara Hoffman Fox, and I'm reading from my book, You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.

I am going to be reading to you today from You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.  I know it's reversed every time I show you it, but I'll show you it anyway.  I'm going to be reading to you from the self-care checklist.  So before I begin, this is something you might want to get out pen and paper or if you'd like to keep track of things in your phone or on your computer.  feel free to do so because I'm going to be reading to you quite a few ideas about what you need to do in terms of making sure you make self-care a priority as you go through this book.  So let me read to you the introduction of it, then we can talk a bit more about that.  The self-care checklist.  Self-discovery can be a difficult process, so it is crucial to set aside time to take care of yourself as you work through it.  Below, you'll find examples of what self-care can look like.  You'll be given reminders throughout the guidebook as to when it would be a good idea to turn to your self-care checklist.  Later on, we will look at how there may be items on your self-care checklist that you do to excess and thus are more harmful than helpful.  For now, feel free to list anything that comes to mind.  And so what I do is I say circle items on the list you already use for self care and or that you'd be interested in trying and then you can use the blank lines to add more self care ideas as you go along.  So one reason I felt it was important to include this is that I wrote this book in part because I knew there were so many people out there who needed help trying to figure out their gender identity and they weren't able to access a therapist to help them through this process.  And so I wrote this with keeping in mind, you know, how can I best help somebody through a book, but almost act like it is me counseling that person, me helping to be there for that person.  And what I always like to check in with my clients about is self-care because this is not easy.  This is not easy work.  that you would be doing here.  And you do need to make sure that self care is something you're prioritizing.  For some of you, I'm sure many of you, myself included, this is not always easy to do.  And it could be something completely new, even for some of you.  So I'm going to read to you from this list.  And I'm just going to read everything on this list.  And that way, you can start coming up with ideas on your own as to what it is that you could do for self care.  And Like I said, when you read the book, it shows you that you have blank lines to write down what else you do for self-care.  And then as I'm reading the book, I'm going to let you know at what parts in what chapters you should pause and make sure you plan ahead for your self-care.  Sometimes it's going to be at the beginning of an exercise.  Sometimes it's going to be at the end of an exercise.  Sometimes it's going to be both for some of the more intense exercises.  So, OK, here's a list of things that I have on here.  listen to music, sing in the car or the shower, karaoke, play an instrument, yoga, Pilates, walking, Tai Chi, stretching, weightlifting, running, martial arts, Zumba, cycling, hiking, dancing, meditation, lighting a candle or incense, cooking or baking for yourself, cooking or baking for others, watching a favorite TV show, watch an old favorite movie, watch a new movie, play a video game, journal, creative writing, browse the internet, social media, read fiction, read your favorite blogs, study a subject you love, paint your nails, take a bath or shower, shop, volunteer, spend time with your pets or other animals, pamper yourself, visit a favorite place, visit a favorite restaurant, visit a favorite coffee house, knit, sew, crochet, drink your favorite beverage, spend time in nature, pray, chant, garden, use aromatherapy, scrapbook, massage, reiki, spend time with a friend or several friends, painting, drawing, organizing things, taking a nap, eat something replenishing, go for a drive, photography, do puzzles or brain games, crafts, tarot cards, I Ching, watch or play sports, breathe deeply, make a music mix, write code, listen to comedy, recite affirmations, watch your favorite YouTube videos, cry, play, role playing games, coloring, religious ceremony, cleaning your living space, bowling, spend time with children.  I do list a few resources at the end that I will put in the notes for this video.  As I was reading those, I did think to myself, hmm, during the pandemic, some of those things you might not be able to do that you normally would do.  I know for myself, I've been struggling with that a bit because I'm actually learning that I have a lot of extrovert energy and I enjoy doing things like going out to movies, going out to karaoke, going out to coffee shops and restaurants.  And I've been unable to do that here lately.  And so knowing that that'll be something I can do later, I've had to figure out more things that I can do.  That involved me staying at home, connecting, you know, still being able to connect with people, but doing it from a safe distance and virtually.  So it's interesting how this book, of course, when I wrote it, I didn't know there'd be a pandemic.  But those are the kinds of things that you can keep in mind that you could always make a note that this is something you want to do once it's more safe to do so.  or if you can find ways to do it in a safer way, this is a good opportunity to reflect on what are the different methods of self-care that you feel like you either need to do more often or you already do, or maybe you want to try something new.  And like I mentioned in the introduction, There may be things that you do that it turns out you do them to excess and they end up being more harmful than helpful.  So you might want to put those on a separate list, knowing that there is some work to do on that.  And that'll be a future chapter that I'll be reading from.  So that's all I'm going to read from for today.  And I look forward to reading more to you.  I've enjoyed very much reading the comments that you've left.  And I'm so happy to know that so many of you have already gotten the book and have learned a lot from it and that some of you are going to be maybe following along.  I just want to warn you, I'm probably only going to post maybe once a week.  Life is pretty wild right now and I've got a very full client schedule, but I'm going to try my best to upload once a week.  Indeed.  So thanks again.  And we'll talk again soon.

The first murder, I give him a pass, because that dude was... I'm the Scrivener, and I know everything about movies. Hi, my name's Paige. Oh my god, what's happening? Scrivener means writing. This is our friend, this is our friend Andrea.  That's what Scrivener means. Y'all have to be in the video. I'll talk about Phantom of the Opera just by myself.  Hello, everyone.  Scrivener here, along with some friends.  Obviously, you know my girlfriend, Michaela. But this is somebody who's never been on the channel.  This is Andrea LaSalle.  She is a disability and just a very cute YouTuber. She's also shorter than me, so... We're all in California for our friend's wedding.  I live in California, so I didn't really go far.  That's fair.  She's getting married today, which is Halloween. This video will obviously come out way after Halloween. Happy Halloween 2020. 2020?  It's 2019!  I'm making a joke about how long it'll take you to edit this. Hey!  That's not... That's mean! Last night I showed these two, Phantom of the Opera, the 25th anniversary Royal Albert Hall taping.  You've never seen any version or read any version. No, no, nothing cool. Yeah. I know most of the music. You know most of the music because it's everywhere.  Yes.  And then you'd never seen, like, the stage. I've never seen, yeah.  I act as well.  I've sung the songs in a lot of vocal lessons, but... not the stage version. What I enjoy most about Phantom is not the writing or anything, it's really the theatricality of it.  The strength of that show is really 90% theatricality. How OTT it is over the top. It's interesting though, because for me it's not over the top, it's just normal for theatre.  It follows the very basic what is great formula of great theatre.  feels like the stage version is more about the ensemble.  Like, I loved it for the ensemble. There's plenty of that good old Gillian Lynn's whole ensemble striding across the stage as one choreography.  Just like in Cats.  I won't mention Cats again, I'm sorry. I mean, I think what I really really enjoy about it the most are like the costumes.  The costumes are so pretty. They were gorgeous. From a choreography stance too, they just add to the choreography.  I don't know who did the one for that specific stage. All the choreography is based on Gilliam Inn's original choreography. Well yeah, but the thing is with choreography, every... Choreography is different.  So you're allowed to in theater to change stuff.  There's like a degree you're allowed to before you can get sued.  It's the same with ad libs.  But whoever did that?  and then with the costuming, choreography is great.  But if the costuming wasn't where it was, I think it would have not been as amazing.  with the way the dresses would move, with the certain, like... It's a very kind of ballet, like, costumes.  Yeah, I didn't realize it would be like that.  I didn't know there would be a lot of ballet in it. There's, like, a lot of really wonderful, like, lovely ballet sequences, because we're constantly, like, seeing them put on different productions, where the stage that we're watching acts as the stage of the opera house, and I really enjoy those elements because it's very interactive. I think if you didn't know about Phantom, I feel like you would be lost.  Yeah.  Because I do think the fact that they're putting on multiple shows within one show is confusing.  There's moments I zoned out because I, oh yeah, I don't like Phantom of the Opera.  It's like one of my least favorite musicals.  But there are moments I zoned out and then all of a sudden everyone's in different costumes putting on a different production.  And I'm like, what is happening?  But it's not that hard to catch up either.  It's not a complicated thing.  play. The writing is, like, so tremendously mushy.  What Phantom of the Opera is is essentially, like, a long version of one of the operas that they put on.  You have to be paying, like, really really close attention, or you have to have watched it a couple of times to really get what's going on. Yeah. One of the bad things about, like, the Schumacher movies that, like, It can't really do that in a movie as much as you can suspend the disbelief when you're watching something on stage.  They feel the need to explain everything and ground it all in reality, and I think that's to its detriment, because it's hard to translate that sort of thing to film well. And obviously they pulled out the stops for it being a 25th anniversary.  Yeah.  big thing in Royal Albert Hall.  The ensemble is much bigger than it would be at Her Majesty's Theatre, which is the theatre that it's in right now, day to day. I just think they just didn't have someone that's good at it.  Because there's a lot of movie adaptations of musicals that are great, because usually the people that write it well, they realize there's things with live theater you can't recreate, so you need to be creative enough to just move it around a bit and do it in- or take it out, which is why some musicals do that when they go to movies. Okay, so I like the songs.  I admit that there are like six or seven songs and then they are used throughout the whole thing. It's not right though, they're a leitmotif.  I don't even like the show, but I... It's not how it works.  Fine, fine.  I want to make sure that Andrea says her bit about the theatre.  The ghost? Yeah, I was about to bring that up next. I remember talking about, like, oh, I think that there's this implication that, like, the Phantom has some kind of, like, mystical kind of power over, especially Christine, because, like, He's basically a vampire. He has to control them. Yeah.  He seems to enthrall her when she's around him.  But then you mentioned something that I had never thought about before.  that makes a lot of sense about theater ghosts. All theaters are haunted.  It's just a fact.  Yeah, it's just a fact.  Even if your theater was just built... you just assume it's gonna be haunted.  So anytime you're done with rehearsal or a theater's closed for the day, you always leave one stand with a single light bulb on, constantly.  And it's for your theater's ghost.  It's also, like, respectful to your ghost.  Like, it is.  It is thanking them for using the theater.  Because when things go wrong during rehearsals, if something breaks, like one time in high school, a metal pipe fell on my shoulder.  It just like broke off while we were rehearsing and we blamed the theater ghost.  So when things go wrong, you also blame the theater ghost, which is kind of what Phantom is. Yeah, that's definitely what they do. Like, I had an epiphany watching it.  I was like, this whole play just sounds like people who did theater their whole life decided to write a play of what rehearsal is like.  The Phantom falls in love with Christine just from her voice.  If you've ever been in a show That's like your number one rule.  Don't fall in love with castmates because cast relationships will never work out.  You're not in love.  It's always the leads that do it and then they break up right before opening night and then there's stress.  Everyone's like, what do we do?  Because they don't want to do this scene now.  Phantom just seems like all the stress of being an actor.  put into a fantasy on stage, along with the ghost light. And I gotta say, like, your reading of it in that way makes me appreciate it more. Yeah, it really does.  The Phantom, like, references the fact that, like, oh, Raoul, he only loves Christine because, like, I put so much work into you. Honestly, like, I know some directors who have done that.  Yeah.  Yeah, no. With their actors.  Exactly.  And you'd mentioned Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman. Yeah. Who he made this role for. Andrew Lloyd Webber, yeah.  I mean... Andrew Lloyd Webber met Sarah Brightman when she was in the ensemble for Cats.  Third time, I'm sorry.  And they got married at some point, and he wrote the role of Christine Daae for Sarah Brightman.  And she decided that you're divorced. I've seen the movie a lot, but I've never had that epiphany until you showed me the stage version. The stage version is just full of stage actors doing stage acting. Yeah, I think that's why I liked it more, because, like, again, you were like, it's more mushy.  But for me, I think since this... Because the movie isn't mushy to me.  No, it's not.  The movie's boring to me.  The movie is really, really boring.  I feel like Phantom is just... an autobiography of every theater person's life in theater.  It feels like I'm looking in a mirror or revisiting what my childhood was like in high school theater with a mix of what theater is in terms of how extravagant it has to be.  Especially for that, not the time period of when Phantom is set, but the time period when it was made.  Mm-hmm.  The 80s.  Yeah.  1986.  And 80s musicals are great.  Because even, like, again, Little Shop of Horrors, it also is very cheesy, too.  Yeah, it is.  And it's a great cheesy.  I think that's why I'm not so critical on, like, the lyrics, on how well written they are, because for me, at the end of the day, I'm just kind of like, theater's supposed to be just fun.  At least, like, from an actor's perspective.  Like, there's more when you're the spectator, and, like, you want like A plus theater.  And then I'm sure as well, if you're a composer, there's other elements.  But for an actor, we're more just like, we want good writing, but we also just want a chance to have fun.  And I could tell that the actors in the live one we watch, And I said it to you a few times, I'm like, they're having fun.  There's moments where I like stop listening to the story and I just am looking at the actors on how they're acting.  And that was where I felt the most enjoyment.  I'm going to mention Cats now.  I don't like Cats, but I respect it.  But when I see actors having fun in Cats, then I can sit through it and I can say, oh, I had a great time going to see Cats.  But I don't like Cats.  I'm just going to put that out there.  Especially because I made a face earlier when you two were talking about cats and I'm looking at the camera like, no.  No.  So now it'll make sense. Sarah will have zoomed in on that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that the cast that's assembled for this Royal Albert Hall edition is just really fantastic. This ensemble was the best ensemble I have ever seen.  Everyone was in sync, everyone was just doing more than they probably were told to do.  Just to be in that audience for that ensemble, that would have been magical. But I think that really what those songs are supposed to be is that they are supposed to be a showcase for whoever is singing them.  More so than, like, most other musicals, where I'm like, okay, these are, like, good songs.  With Phantom, I'm like, this is so that, like, whoever's playing Christine can, like, really, really, really sound great. You're not wrong.  As an addendum from someone with a musical theatre master's degree, not that I'm boasting, I feel like it was probably one of the first shows that was written to specifically showcase different locales.  rangy.  He's a baritone, but he's got a very rangy bit.  And it requires a very good falsetto as well as a very good chest belt. Any role you do in Phantom, you have to be talented.  There's no cutting corners with it.  You can't fake it at all.  You have to be talented.  It's the same.  We should do a cat's count of every time we bring it up.  It's the same like cats.  You have to be talented to be in that show.  because there's you're not hiding behind anything in that show.  and like carlotta the woman who plays carlotta oh my god.  wow.  she has an incredible incredible voice.  i would say she's one of like the most talented in that show. Obviously the Phantom is disfigured under the mask.  It's not necessary, he doesn't need to be disfigured.  Yeah.  It has no bearing on the plot.  Yeah!  Apart from the moments where everyone's like, oh no, he's a monster. He's a monster!  Like, you said that to me last night, where you were like, he doesn't need to be disfigured. It's not necessary, it is only there because it was in the book. The way that he's disfigured in the book is that he has an incredibly gaunt, hollow face.  But instead, in the stage musical, you have, like... He should be dead, for one thing.  I know!  He has exposed brain tissue. You're right.  He doesn't need to be disfigured.  There's not really any reason for it.  Especially because, like, the reason that they have is a bad reason.  The reason is that, like, it adds to the mystery.  It adds to him being like, oh my god, is he a man or is he a monster?  And I think they also kind of use it as like, oh, it's a fantasy element. There are rumours and speculation that I'm gonna head off that, like, the idea is that Andrew Lloyd Webber is ugly and he wrote this in part to have an ugly guy get the girl.  I mean, for one thing, he doesn't. He doesn't. Quite clearly rejects him.  Andrew Lloyd Webber is not this big.  That's not the point.  I'm kind of glad.  that I didn't get into this when I was really into musical theatre when I was 16, 17.  It's not good to think as a role model and The Phantom is an incel.  I had a bit of trouble with that kind of thinking 10 years ago or so, but also I never liked Phantom.  I didn't really think about the disfigurement stuff at the time, which is funny because I was definitely thinking about it in terms of Beauty and the Beast, which is something I can talk about other times.  The Phantom's just not a good disfigured role. What I noticed is that every time he's unmasked, when his disfigurement is on display, he's almost always like... pathetic or whiny or angry or monstrous.  Even though, like, Christine literally says to him in the final song, it's within your soul where the true distortion lies.  But I don't think the play really believes that.  What I really like about the stage musical, that the movie gets completely wrong, is that, really, the Phantom is only ever presented as a romantic interest for Christine, like, really up until the moment where she removes his mask.  in his lair.  He's never really a romantic interest for the rest of the play.  Raoul is her romantic interest. And I think it switches to focus on him being a father replacement. I appreciate the fact that in the musical they don't use that scene, the point of no return, like the way they do in the movie, where in the movie it's this big scene where like, oh my god, the Phantom and Christine are singing to each other and he's gonna take her down to his basement and they're gonna get married and it's like, oh, are you team Raoul or are you team Phantom?  Yeah.  And like, in this stage musical, you're like, no!  There is no team Phantom.  You don't want them to end up together.  He's a murderer and he's a terrible person and he's creepy and possessive. I will say Raoul, uh, the guy who plays him in this version.  Hadley Fraser.  I love him.  He is so attractive and could be Dimitri and Anastasia. And Sarah and I saw him as Dr.  Frankenstein. Ugh!  I love Young Frankenstein. If you haven't checked out the Young Frankenstein cast album, you really should.  He's not in the original cast.  I prefer Hadley Fraser as Frankenstein, but you can't beat Mega Malali in the original cast recording. But we take Andrea's point as well. He would be a very good Dimitri. I still don't like the musical, but I can appreciate it. Yeah.  Yeah, and now you wanna play Meg. Yeah, Meg is the best role.  Like, even if she's not, like, the lead, she's not Christine, she sings a lot, she's almost in every scene, and she ends the show.  And that's how you know.  she's a good role, she gets her own bow.  Honestly, it doesn't matter what role you play, your bow is what shows what you did in the show.  And the fact she's solo... I'm saying- I'm just saying.  She's a good role.  All right, let's wrap this thing up. Thank you all for watching.  Andrea, thank you for being in this video.  Thank you for having me.

{"id":"clxmm7h7cl8szo6z1mf52s8ra","yt_video_id":"hniY6-QOWKg","title":"TransVoiceTech: How to Hear Yourself Better!","description":"Hi Everyone! In this video I will document a simple strategy for hearing a more accurate representation of your voice. Have you ever noticed how there is a discrepancy between the way your voice sounds on recording vs to yourself? \n\nWell, both of them are inaccurate. The sound you while talking is actually the result of internal vibrations propagating through the jawbone, cheekbones, and inner sinus cavities. The voice you hear is actually a muffled, filtered version of the \"real deal\". \n\nThis \"skull voice\" phenomenon makes it hard to get reliable self-feedback, so people typically turn to audio recordings. Audio recordings have their value but are not exactly close to what someone will hear when talking to you in a room due to the behavior of microphones, proximity, and playback variability.\n\nA sound is a spatial event. In order to hear the most accurate version of your voice we need to dampen the skull vibrations, turn down the early reflections, and boost the late reflections. As a result, the sound is more true to what someone else hears.\n\nThe process for achieving this is simple:\n1. Fingers together! Thumbs out! Keep your hand in that shape.\n2. Place the point where the thumb connects to the hand right below the ear.\n3. Lightly press inwards towards the fact with both hands.\n4. Begin speaking and observe if it sounds any different.\n\nIf you have this technique correctly, you should immediately notice a difference in the way you sound. The voice should sound \"cloudier\" or more \"diffused\". While this is not identical to what people here, it's much closer than both recordings or the voice \n\nI have seen countless cases of people using this strategy to alleviate dysphoria during practice. Remember that this is a lot closer to what you really sound like. This sound is almost always more palatable and comfortable for a student to hear. Use this if you feel you are stuck in place from dysphoria blocking your path.\n\nThanks so much for the support.\nwarmly,\nz\n\ntransvoicelessons@gmail.com\nhttps:\/\/www.patreon.com\/transvoicelessons\ntransvoicelessons.com\nhttps:\/\/zheaerosemusic.bandcamp.com\/\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/digital.harmonic\/","publish_date":"2020-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":["TransVoiceTech","TransVoice","Psychoacoustics","Zhea Erose","Zheanna Erose","Trans Voice Lessons","Male to Female Voice"],"length":192,"views":90555,"thumbnail_url":"","yt_channel_id":"UCBYlEnfAUbrYSwF0VujcmHA","transcripts":"Hey there, it's your girl Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video I want to teach you a very easy trick to hear yourself better.  Okay, let's get into it.  As you may have figured out by now, the way you sound to yourself is not how you sound to other people.  You might have tried to circumvent this by recording your voice.  Well, that is also not really what you sound like to other people.  When you're actually in a real space talking to other individuals, so much of the voice that they actually hear from you is created by the room, okay?  So when you talk, your voice bounces around the room hundreds of times, which creates what we call reverberation, okay?  Now, You need to be able to have reverb in your voice in order for you to truly understand what you sound like to other people.  Now, The easiest way to do this is like so.  You take the hands like this.  The ear is gonna fit behind it.  This presses up against your jaw and cheekbone, which dampens the vibration.  The back of the hand is amplifying the late reflections off the back wall in your room, and it's blocking the early reflections.  So you end up with a much more Realistic model of what your voice actually sounds like to other people in the space with you.  This is a much better way to hear your voice than recording or just listening to yourself back while you talk.  So overall you're gonna do this.  Okay, you do that on both sides heat from fire And then you can practice like that.  Oh my God.  It sounds so, so, so cool.  So this is like a modified approach.  I first learned this with folders in a psychology class and the folders work, but they are not near as ideal as using your hands because they don't produce enough mass and they're not soft enough and squishy enough to really dampen the vibrations that come from this place.  So yes, seriously, try this right now and tell me what you think about your voice in the comments below, okay?  I swear, I have seen this be such an effective tool for so many people to hear their voice better and to feel more confident in their practice routines, okay?  If you have any questions or comments or anything, please post below.  I hope this is incredibly helpful for you.  Please do not underestimate how powerful this can be for your own psychology to feel more confident and powerful and free in the process of voice feminization.  So yes, if you have any questions or comments, please post below.  Thank you so much for the support.  Check me out on Patreon.  Like and subscribe.  And until next time, love ya.  Bye.

So following my recent run-in with Graham Linehan, go check my other videos on that, I got sent a video by Caroline Franzen, aka Twitter user CoachCaroline.  Caroline Franzen, for those who don't know, is the founder of the Relation Academy in the Netherlands, which as far as I can tell is just a fancy name for her relationship fair who practice.  She's also the self-declared initiator of the Dutch Debate and Stop Self-ID movements, and a proud supporter of Linehan's work.  Want proof?  Well, the website she links on her Twitter, stopselfid.nl, has a link to Graham Linehan's blog post along with the rest of the Shitbag Squad, so I can say with relative certainty that Caroline Franzen posted that video as a means of supporting Linehan's support for gender identity conversion efforts.  Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.  they prefer to call it gender critical therapy.  The video itself is titled, If conversion therapy is bad, why is sex reassignment good?  And seeing that title, I think we all know what's coming.  The video is by an American group known as What Would You  Say?,  which is a far-right Christian organization that, among other things, attacks abortion access and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.  Because that's the sort of people riding in to defend Graham Linehan and his position.  Groups such as What Would You  Say?,  The Heritage Foundation, and The Daily Fail.  Not to forget those who treat them as an authority.  Far-right Christian organisations or fascist rags that seek to destroy every major social advancement the human species has made the past couple of centuries.  Now, I responded to Franzen's tweet very bluntly with a question asking, what scientifically illiterate trash is this?  For which she blocked me.  Well okay, that's her right.  I'm just amazed it was so easy.  However, it's also my right to go through the video and point out how the source she turns to for information is so full of shit, to offer an example of how to challenge this imported bigotry for my Dutch siblings.  So let's get down to business. One trick of LGBT activists is changing the meaning of words.  We see this in the way they celebrate sex reassignment as gender affirmation, but condemn conversion therapy as sex reassignment. What you just said there has no basis in reality.  Yes, sex reassignment surgery has shifted towards gender confirmation as language and scientific understanding of the field has evolved.  But no one has ever referred to conversion therapy, more accurately described as conversion torture, as sex reassignment.  Just over 20 seconds into the video and we already have a pure fabrication designed to set up a fictional position for the video to respond to and refute.  A straw-arm position that does not accurately reflect the language used by either the LGBT community or the medical community.  So already, we're off to a bad start.  Also, the example you showed of changing the meaning of a word didn't change any words.  It displayed changes to a secular institution that was co-opted in Europe by the Catholic Church in 1188 when the Council of Verona made marriage a sacrament.  Later, the Roman Catholic Council of Trent of 1563 made church involvement mandatory.  Now, prior to this, the Church had already meddled with marriage, they just hadn't claimed it as sacred.  Most notably in the 4th century CE, during the Christianisation of Rome, the Church changed the legal definition of marriage to exclude same-gender couples under penalty of death.  So, maybe read up on your history.  This is how the video, Franzen Forged in Defense of Graham Linehan, starts, with an open attack on same-gender couples.  This is what happens when you open the door for transphobia.  It's only a matter of time before homophobia and biphobia follow. Let's imagine there's a six-year-old boy named Johnny, and Johnny experiences gender dysphoria.  He says he wants to be a girl.  Science shows that in at least 80% of the cases, gender dysphoria eventually goes away on its own.  So, if Johnny and his parents do nothing, the odds are that by the time Johnny goes through puberty, his gender dysphoria will go away. Except that's not what the research shows at all.  I know, as I've actually read it.  Whilst What Would You Say fails to reference the actual study, this common statistic comes from a 2011 article titled, Desisting and Persisting Gender Dysphoria After Childhood, a qualitative follow-up study, which found a desistance rate of 84.2%.  However, the text is somewhat misleading.  The study did not qualify feelings of gender dysphoria on a clinical diagnosis of the condition, but simply referral to gender identity clinics by untrained adults.  Clinics which take the scientifically grounded gender affirmation approach.  Gender affirmation, for those who don't know, is an approach to gender which prioritises child-led exploration.  All it prescribes is support for said child.  If they wake up and want to go by he pronouns, use he pronouns.  If they want to use she pronouns, use she pronouns.  If they change their mind next day or midday, lit them.  That is gender affirmation.  supporting a child as they explore who they are.  When you do that, as noted, 84.2% of children referred to said clinics and supported under the gender-affirmative approach.  do not seek out further support.  The study also found differences between the two groups in how they express themselves, something a follow-up analysis published in 2013 would support, stating, quote, Persisters indicated that they believed that they were the other sex, and desisters indicated they wished they were the other  sex.\".  So, put rather plainly, what would you say is misleading its viewers in this section?  That 80% stat only discusses gender dysphoria.  if we change the qualifier for gender dysphoria to being referenced to a clinic by an untrained adult, someone who does not understand the difference between gender identity and gender expression.  And since that is the qualifier for gender dysphoria used, the notion of doing nothing is equally misleading.  Gender affirmation is about helping a child reach the best resolution possible, and for the vast majority of children referred to such clinics, they receive no further support.  Why?  Well, because it turns out that the specialists in the field actually know how to do their job and are not forcing children to be transgender.  That is a bold-faced lie.  Speaking of which... However, if a therapist or doctor were to help Johnny get over his gender dysphoria and counsel him in a way that helped him identify as a boy, this would be described as conversion therapy.  In several states, it's illegal.  In those states, the only thing a therapist is allowed to do with a child who has experienced gender dysphoria is to help them embrace their identity as the opposite sex.  If they don't, they would be professionally punished or even lose their license. Actually, both doctors should lose their licenses.  Thankfully, there are no cases of therapists forcing a child to be a gender other than that they were assigned at birth.  The closest to that we find are doctors forcing intersex patients to conform to either a male or female gender.  And people such as myself are the ones seeking to combat that practice.  You are simply lying about gender affirmative care.  Why?  Well, because you have no case against the actual practice, so instead have to make a phantom version you can demonise.  And it's not like your viewers are going to be critical of that.  Hell, you've managed to fool actual therapists from different disciplines.  Yet the moment you actually have an understanding of the practice, the lie becomes glaringly obvious.  But that doesn't stop it being propagated in real life, as seen with the Luna Damon Younger case, a particularly brutal case that gained a lot of attention last year.  What the Christian right was pretending was a case of a liberal mum forcing their son to be a girl, turned out to be a case of an abusive father using his daughter's identity as a means to hurt his former wife.  Whilst in public the father pretended like he allowed Luna to do what she wanted, Under oath, his story changed.  Under oath, he admitted to refusing to have girls' clothes in the house, to refusing to use Luna's actual name and pronouns, to shaving his daughter's head against court order, to constantly belittling his daughter for her choices.  The only reason his story gained so much traction is because the mother, who took their child to multiple therapists when the father initially took issue with the first opinion, felt her daughter deserved privacy.  Privacy the father could not respect.  The truth is, forcing a child to deny who they are is destructive, and we most often see that in gender identity conversion efforts.  efforts to force a child to adhere to their assigned gender, something that increases attempted suicide from around 8% to 57% in trans people.  Another study which conducted research of 27,715 transgender adults living in the US 3,869 of which had been exposed to GICE, found that quote, Meanwhile, gender affirmation has been found to reduce levels of anxiety and depression in trans adolescents to levels equal to a cisgender control, to general society.  Gender affirmation works, demonstrably.  Gender identity conversion efforts amount to nothing but torture.  And that is a science the creators of this video have to ignore. However, if a therapist assures Johnny that he is really a girl, gives him puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and then helps him get surgery that removes healthy body parts and permanently sterilizes him, this is referred to as gender affirmation. No, that's referred to as a lie.  Children do not receive hormone replacement therapy or surgery.  At most, they will receive fully reversible and safe puberty blockers as they enter Tanner Stage 2, averaging around 12 years of age.  This is a medical necessity.  Denying them this would be akin to denying a diabetic insulin because they're underage.  Now some rare cases may receive blockers much earlier than 12.  This is because the usage of blockers is tied to puberty and not to any arbitrary age.  Therefore, if a child suffers precocious puberty, aka early onset puberty, they may receive the blockers earlier.  But here's a fun fact about that.  Puberty blockers.  not tested my macular arse.  That's one of the many things the medications are used for, that and hormone-sensitive cancers.  So the only instance of children being prescribed puberty blockers at a young age is if they'd receive them anyway, so it's really a two-for-one in that situation.  Point is, if you want to argue against puberty blockers for trans children on grounds that they're unsafe yet fail to do so for cis children with precocious puberty, You're a selective bastard with a bigoted agenda who is merely concerned policing.  Also, don't think I can't see what you're doing with the visual propaganda, keeping the character as a child who remains unhappy as they go through the procedures, not to mention the incredibly gross stereotypes of trans people shown throughout the video. But isn't it interesting the words they use to describe these situations?  Helping a child identify with the body they were born with is called conversion therapy.  Giving a child artificial hormones and plastic surgery is called gender affirmation.  If that seems backwards to you, that's because it is. Forcing a child to adhere to their birth assigned gender is not helping, a fact clearly demonstrated earlier.  The very notion that you would attempt to pass it off as such shows just how grossly dishonest you are.  a fact that transfers from the creators of the video to people such as Caroline Franzen when they attempt to use it to defend Graham Linehan's support for gender identity conversion attempts.  Franzen is not some layperson like Linehan.  They're a therapist, and yet they're more than happy to turn to a video that not only demonises trans people, but all LGBT plus people, all to defend Graham Linehan.  Now what's interesting is that unlike Linehan, who is from Ireland, a country which has yet to outlaw conversion therapy, France and Liz in the Netherlands, a country which last year voted to not only ban conversion attempts, but pass motion that stated those guilty of it would be punished.  Now there was no timetable given, But for all intents and purposes, conversion therapy is illegal in the Netherlands now.  So one has to consider what this means for Franzen, because I hope to hell that none of the people she sees are families bringing their child to her because they believe their child's gender nonconformity is a relationship problem.  I also wonder what Franzen's clients would think if they knew she was sending videos demonising same-gender couples to people.  Because transphobia aside, the social debate on homosexuality is long lost, so I think that could do a lot of damage to this picture Franzen has created of herself.  I checked out her website, not the StopSelfID site that she links on her Twitter, though I did check that one out as well, and yes, she used the thoroughly debunked Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria article.  I mean the Relationship Academy website.  I don't know what it is, every time I say that name I get total Prager University vibes.  Now, in her About Me section, she spins such a pretty story.  One about how she grew up bullied, and though she moved on, her bullies did too, and how that made her want to reach out and be compassionate towards others.  And yet here she is, happily spreading lies put out by Christian fascists.  Lies about LGBT plus people created as an attempt to hurt one of the most marginalised and vulnerable communities, seemingly because she has an irrational hatred towards us.  So she advocates for the youngest among us to be tortured in order to put them back on the straight and narrow.  That, my friends, is the truth of Caroline Franson.  She's not a compassionate woman, she's just a run-of-the-mill bigot who feels big in hurting others.  Ignorance on her part can only be willful, and therefore be no excuse.

For those who don't know, a group consisting of fascists, homophobes, biphobes, racists and misogynists pretending to be feminists, a group that likes to label themselves gender critical, has been chipping away at trans rights in the UK, as well as trying to prevent further provisions.  Now, in order to achieve this, the so-called gender-critical camp has been propagating a number of myths, such as the idea that trans women pose a threat to cis women, something far-right groups later admitted they'd made up, stating that, quote, \"...our side concocted the bathroom safety male predator argument as a way to avoid an uncomfortable battle over LGBT ideology and still fire up people's  emotions.\".  end quote.  Another popular myth spouted is the idea that the trans cult is indoctrinating young people and turning them transgender, typically focusing on trans men.  A common practice in this regard is to show photos of minors prior to going through their medical confirmation and post, remarking about how they're lost potential, sexually.  that they should have just been a butch lesbian, irrespective of the sexuality of the person in question, since gay, bisexual, and ace trans men do exist.  This sense of sexual entitlement among gender-critical folk mirroring that seen in cis-et men towards non-heterosexual women.  A myth that doesn't add up with the evidence in how the vast majority of youth refer to gender identity.  clinics, clinics which take the child-led gender-affirmative approach desist without seeking further support.  Because if there really was a trans cult at work here, we'd expect to see most, if not all, of said people go on to receive medical support.  The truth, meanwhile, is simple.  There are key, observable differences between trans youth and youth simply exploring who they are, differences professionals can use to guide teens down the path best suited to meeting their needs and ensuring their well-being.  That's why those that remain and are started on puberty blockers, a flu-reversible medication used to delay puberty to offer the individual more time to arrive at the right conclusion, have a 100% persistence rate with the individual going on to pursue HRT or confirmation surgery.  It's not because of some fictional cabal, it's because our systems are so cautious that they filter out those simply exploring who they are.  However, recent reports show this lie to be based in projection, with gender-criticals claiming their targets are guilty of what they themselves do.  Enter Amy Dias, former member of the gender-critical cult, and that's a word she herself uses.  In an interview conducted by Pink News journalist Vic Parsons, Amy Dias laid out some of the many ways that she was groomed, stripped of her autonomy, and even had her abuse ignored by the very people claiming to care about her as a lesbian.  She talks about the way in which As she was first becoming aware of the gender-critical cult, she was approached by a series of well-known names who constantly checked in and fed her this narrative that lesbians were under attack by trans people.  Now Diaz talks about the fact that, at the time all this was happening, she was in a vulnerable state.  She'd lost her job and her home and was living out of her car, something which understandably had a profound impact on her mental state.  To quote, for the first time, Amy's voice breaks a little as she recounts what this period of her life was like.  I felt like everybody knew and they just would exploit.  Instead of helping, they would just keep taking from you.  They wanted you to be unstable.  She pauses.  That's like I noticed.  It was at this point that the emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of the gender-critical movement was at its worst, Amy says.  Another pause.  The more stabilised I got, the less they could control me.  And they try to control you.  That's where the struggle started.  It's harder for you to see things and process things when you're working to pay your bills and survive.  End quote.  There was also a lot of covering up for abusers.  In fact, it seems that the whole topic of female-led abuse was deemed off-limits, seemingly because it challenged the myth of the trans predator, or as the article states, quote, \"'Amy, herself a survivor of sexual violence perpetuated by a woman, wanted this issue to be part of the discussion, but she was repeatedly shut  down.'\".  When I talked about it to any gender-critical feminist, they would downplay it and say, well, it's not as bad as with men, or we want to focus on men, she says.  The gender-critical movement, Amy says, is covering for abuse.  I call them the matriarchy.  They cover for abuse of women, right and left, no matter what it is.  They won't let lesbians discuss issues that matter to us.  Like, that's a lesbian community issue, and they get so defensive and mad when you try to talk about it.  It's like women can do no wrong.  Basically, they wrote us into this thing just to use us, so they could say, we've got lesbians on our side, and then they're hurting  us.\".  Now, the article also goes on to discuss said group's association with fascism and conservative Christianity, something that's been covered extensively on this channel, though I would suggest you go read the original article.  I don't want to quote too much of it, as that would be unfair to Vic.  However, I did want to bring this news to you, as well as discuss some things that have happened since the article, and my thoughts on how to proceed.  Starting with the way in which Julie Bindle came forward and declared herself as the person who groomed Dias at the start, going so fast to try and get her to move to the UK so Dias could be controlled easier.  Now of course, she does this in the most mocking fashion, in line with what we've come to expect from many abusers.  However, what's really interesting is that she's begun throwing around threats of legal action, in spite of the fact that the article never names who it's talking about.  My bet would have split between professional abuser Julia Long and stalker Venice Allen.  So it's not like.  you can read the article and go, that's Julia Bindle.  So it would be an interesting case to see go to court.  Of course, we have \u00a31,989 and 78 pence in the anti-trans SLAP fund, though I doubt it'll ever make it that far, though it's worth noting in case it does.  Fact is, all this comes out during a time where things continue to seemingly get worse for trans people in the UK thanks to the rhetoric created by the gender-critical cult.  Liz Truss, Tory MP and current Minister for Women and Equalities, has made a series of threats of legislative violence towards the trans community in line with gender-critical doctrine.

Today I'm going to be reading to you from my book, You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.  And I'm going to be reading to you from some of the introduction contents.  For those of you who are watching this in the future, future, future, we're going through quite a time right now.  And who knows what's going to happen in the future, future, those of you who are watching this in the future future, but right now we are still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.  And last week, George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, Minnesota was murdered by a white cop.  And there are, I guess I would say far overdue reactions, protests, and the such that are happening.  And there's a lot going on right now.  And I wondered, I hesitated, should I continue my plan to read my book to you?  And from what I can gather from my clients as well, even though everything that's happening is very much heavy and in our hearts and on our minds.  And especially for those of you who are African American and having an incredible level of intensity on a regular basis that I myself for one will never understand.  Um, and especially right now, you know, what is the right thing to do?  And so I decided that also from talking with some of my clients, people are still needing to answer about their gender identity and so this is here for those of you who want to tune in and if it's something you want to look at later you'll look at it later.  but I just wanted to kind of put a little pin in it to let you know this is what's happening right now at the moment that I'm making this video and when some of you will be making comments on this video it'll be interesting to look into the future and see who is going to watch this video a year from now or three years from now, what's going to be happening.  So just so you know, that's what's happening in history right now.  I have to wear my glasses while I read to you and I know they create a little bit of a glare, but I'm not, I don't have the ability to make this high production value.  So hopefully everyone's okay with that.  I want to start off by reading to you the little quotes that I put at the beginning of the book.  Because, you know, people do that when they're authors.  I have a quote from Carl Jung that says, the privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.  And then Joseph Campbell, quote from him, it is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life.  Where you stumble, there lies your treasure.  And the reason I put those in there is because so much of this book is inspired by the work of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell.  This book, as I will explain, It has a lot to do with the hero's journey.  And I patterned the writing of it around that.  I have one more quote from a movie called I Heart Huckabees.  And if you have seen this movie and you like it, please let me know in the comments because it's kind of rare for me to find somebody who treasures this movie as much as I do.  But the character Brad Stand said, how am I not myself?  That just gives me chills.  If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean.  But if you haven't, you'll have no idea what I'm talking about.  So just to let you know, there is an introduction, first of all, by Zinnia Jones called Toward a Transformation of the Self.  there's also a foreword by Sam Dillon Finch and there is also an introduction by Xander Keeg and I'm not going to be reading those I'm not.  I'm actually not going to read my own introduction as well.  so this will be because I want to kind of jump into the heart of the book as quickly as possible.  something I will mention is that I am and I'm not sure for how long I'll be doing it but check out in the notes for this video that I'm offering the PDF version of this book for $1.99 and I'm gonna put the instructions in the notes of this video as to how you can order it and that way if it is something that you would want to follow along with or if there's something I say I'm not gonna read and I think it'd be better for you to read on your own, you can take advantage of that offer.  So check it out in the notes.  So here's what I'm going to start with.  The ins and outs of this guidebook.  So this is kind of long, so I might split it up into two videos.  We'll see.  Let's see how this goes.  But let's start off.  But actually, you know, I'm going to drink some coffee.  Now I'm ready.  Who is this guidebook for?  I created this guidebook for anyone who has questions, curiosities, doubts, confusion, struggles, or concerns about their gender and their gender identity and how this contributes to who they are as a whole.  Here's where all of this began.  You were assigned a sex at birth based on the appearance of your genitals, which also became the gender you were assigned at birth.  At some point in your life, you began to realize you were not entirely comfortable with this assigned sex and gender.  There are many reasons why this could be the case, which you will explore throughout this guide.  Having questions about your gender identity can confuse and complicate your understanding of who you are as a whole.  When gender identity is a missing puzzle piece, every area of your life is strongly impacted.  These questions can create stress, painful confusion, uncertainty of your place in the world, interpersonal difficulty, not having a solid sense of self, and many other issues.  Thus, taking time to explore these feelings is crucial.  If you have found yourself intrigued by the title of this book and are wondering if it might hold answers to the questions you have about yourself, I suggest you keep reading.  So the next section is called, Can I Put This Off?  Will It Maybe Just Go Away?  These questions frequently arise for those who are wrestling with their gender identity.  It's also common for someone to test this theory out, waiting to see if the confusion surrounding their gender does indeed subside or disappear over time.  However, one's instinctual need to be true to oneself will almost always make itself known one way or another.  Choosing to give in to this drive to become your authentic self can be nerve-wracking and full of risks.  Nonetheless, the suffering that can result from not doing it can feel worse than any of the possible consequences that would result from exploring your gender identity.  The rewards of increased self-awareness are often difficult to describe until one has actually achieved the state of being.  I asked my conversations with a gender therapist Facebook community what they learned about themselves once they had a better understanding of their gender identity.  So then I list some quotes.  Not knowing who you are is terrible, empty, and cold.  You're lost.  Not knowing who I, wait, sorry, knowing now who I am has helped me feel like I'm finally alive, that I exist.  Realizing this allowed me to better understand myself, express myself, and most importantly, accept myself.  I understand now that what I was asking was not, am I transgender, but is it okay to be me?  And it is.  Oh, I like that.  It's been a while since I read my own book.  It helped to break down the walls of isolation.  As I reconciled my feelings toward myself of fear, self-loathing,  etc.,  they melted away and comfort took its place.  Now that I have the words to describe who I am, a world of information is unlocked.  Now I have a better, more truthful sense of identity as well as clarity.  The answer helped me find balance in my life.  It was like hearing a voice that said what you feel exists and you are not alone.  And then I go to say, is this type of self-awareness something you would like to experience as well?  Then keep reading.  Next, clearing up a damaging myth.  I have heard a disturbingly high number of individuals say they have been taught there is a certain way they must experience their gender identity in order to be seen as valid.  This belief can be so damaging that it convinces people they shouldn't even bother attempting to explore this any further.  Here is what is actually true about your gender identity exploration.  One, this is your discovery process and no one else's.  Two, only you get to decide how to describe your identity.  Three, you are allowed to take as long as you need to explore your gender identity.  Four, everyone's experience is different and is to be respected.  Five, you will figure some things out now and others later.  Reread this list as often as you need as a reminder to not let anyone else's opinion about what the right or wrong way is to go about this journey.  Next, how do I use this guidebook?  This guidebook was designed to help you achieve greater clarity regarding your gender identity by undertaking a journey of self-exploration.  The stages of this journey are separated into three sections.  So just so you know, this is what's inspired by Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey.  Stage one, preparation.  Preparation is your setup for success.  The work you do in this stage will prepare you for the following stages, much like a martial artist must undergo intensive training before engaging in their first fight.  You'll solidify your motivation for embarking upon this journey, reveal fears that are holding you back, and learn how to build support for yourself during what can be a both challenging and rewarding time.  Stage two, reflection.  This stage will take you into the past to examine hints and clues that may have been present during your formative years.  This will help you make sense of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors you may not have understood before.  This section will also help you become more aware of the shame and guilt you may be carrying as a result of what you experienced during this time of your life.  Stage three, exploration.  This stage is full of exercises that will help you actively explore your gender identity.  The process of discovering one's gender identity is often complicated and overwhelming, and so we'll be breaking it down into easier to digest pieces.  You'll examine individual layers that make up one's gender identity and then have the chance to put these together to form the big picture of who you are.  Working through this guide.  The guide was created with the assumption that you will be working through it in the order in which it was written.  However, if you reach an exercise that you feel you are either not ready for or have already explored, then you should skip it and move on to the next one.  It's also okay to leave blanks when you aren't sure what to write, coming back to them once you discover your answers.  By all means, take the time as you work through this guide.  you can start and stop as often as you need to, whether it's for weeks, months, or even years.  Although this guidebook has room in which you can write your answers, you can instead choose to use a separate notebook, sketch pad, or Word document for this purpose.  Your responses in this guidebook will create a journal of sorts, providing you with a record you can return to for perspective on just how far you have come.  Think of you and your gender identity a guide to discovery as a compass, map, or navigation system that will act as a guide for however long you need it.  Challenges in Creating a Gender Identity Guidebook.  The topic of gender identity is very complex.  Conversations around it are constantly evolving, so writing a book about discovering your gender identity presents its unique challenges.  Here are the main ones I encountered.  Language and Lexicon.  Language and lexicon have to do with which words I choose to use throughout the book to describe gender, gender expression, gender identity, etc.  I monitor on a daily basis which terms those who are sensitive and inclusive about this subject are most commonly using.  Nonetheless, it's possible I will accidentally offend or leave out someone by certain word choices.  You are more than welcome to let me know at darahoffmanfox.com slash contact if you come across such verbiage so I can address that in future editions.  You can put it in the comments too of this video.  Additionally, through the duration of the book, I use pronouns they, them instead of he, his or she, hers.  This is done to avoid the cumbersome task of having to write he, she, they whenever I am referring to a person and not as a dismissive gesture to those who use female or male pronouns.  International readers, I receive a large number of messages from individuals all over the world.  Although every attempt has been made for the material in this book to be applied as universally as possible, there will more than likely be instances where something is discussed that persons outside of North America will be unable to identify, relate to, or may even be put at risk by.  I welcome your feedback again in the comments below as to how I can improve future editions with regard to this concern.  Age generational differences.  I have received messages from individuals ranging from ages 12 to 72.  This brings about the unique challenge of how to create a book that will be relevant to all ages.  There is an undeniable difference in how someone who is 72 has experienced their gender identity over the duration of their lifetime compared with someone who is 30.  There's also a difference between the experience of those who are 30 compared with those who are currently in their teens.  In just a few short years, the power of the internet combined with dynamic cultural shifts occurring around the world have dramatically changed the face of gender identity exploration.  I have endeavored to present the material in this book as inclusively as possible across generations.  A note to those of you who are in your teens.  Many of you, especially if you are in your younger teens, are unable to access needed resources without the involvement of a parent or guardian.  You may have concerns that you won't be understood or supported by them, which is a reasonable fear.  For further assistance, I recommend, and then I list two books, which I will put in the notes.  I'm also going to put a couple of other resources for younger folks to be able to access for help with this.  You can also check out the further resources at the end of certain chapters for ideas as to how you can approach your parents and get support from others.  Remember you don't have to go through this alone.  The importance of self-care.  This guide will be helpful to you in many ways.  As you progress through it, be aware that many unexpected emotions, memories, and realizations are likely to surface.  As I was faced with the question, how do I make sure my readers are going to be okay on this journey?  I was inspired to create the self-care checklist.  And I mentioned what page it is on, but if you don't have a copy of the book, I will be reading the self-care checklist next in the next video.  There you will find ideas as to how you can practice self-care as you work through this guidebook, as well as having some place to list your own self-care techniques.  I highly recommend you have a mental health practitioner you can turn to as you work through this guidebook.  If you are unable to find a trans-friendly practitioner in your area and or cannot afford one, seek out knowledgeable and supportive persons you can turn to for support, advice, and friendship.  We will cover how you can do this later in this guide.  What is your gender identity, Dara?  My my audience.  OK, when did I write this?  2000?  This might have been three years ago, so I might have an update for you.  My my audience often asked me about my own gender identity.  Curious to know more about who it is they are turning to for guidance and advice.  I've actually discovered a lot of my answers through writing this book.  By the time I reached the end of this writing journey, I concluded I connect most with the term non-binary to describe my gender identity.  androgynous to describe my gender expression and queer to encompass my gender identity, gender expression, and my sexual orientation.  I haven't used the word androgynous to describe myself in a really long time.  Not that I'm against it, but that's interesting to read and reflect on.  Although I'm accustomed to she, her pronouns, I am experimenting with the use of third gender pronouns.  Okay, so I don't use she, her anymore.  FYI.  I find that I most prefer the use of my name in place of a pronoun.  That is true, and also I would not use the word prefer anymore.  I would instead say I use they them pronouns or the use of my name.  See, things can change over time.  I've also begun using the suffix mix mx as an expression of my desire to not be gendered as female.  This is a gender-neutral alternative to Miss,  Mrs.,  Ms.,  Mr.,  etc.  So Mix, Dara, Hoffman, Fox.  I haven't done that for a while either, but it's fun to throw that in there now and then as a way to remind people and educate people.  Being the first student of this guidebook proved to be an unexpected and illuminating experience that I hope its readers are able to experience as well.  Final thoughts before we begin.  As the subtitle of this book states, this is a guide to discovery.  The hope is by the time you reach the end of it, you will be closer to understanding your gender identity as well as yourself as a whole, but it will be far from the final finish line.  Growing in self-awareness will point you in the right direction as to what you might want to do next, which will lead you to the next step and the next.  However, the journey of discovering your authentic self is one you will be on your entire life.  Self-discovery isn't easy.  Will others receive what you discover about yourself with compassion, respect, and understanding?  Will your relationships with your loved ones change?  We live in a time of increasing awareness of what it means to be transgender, non-binary, and gender diverse, but there's a long way to go.  With these realities in mind, I've made sure to include tools throughout this guidebook that you can use to help navigate the waters if they grow choppy.  I have a few other resources that I list.  at the end of the chapter, and I will put those in the notes for this video as well.  Well, you know what?  That felt good to read the whole thing, and I know it's going to mean that this video was long.  But thanks for hanging in there.  for those of you who did hang in there with this.  I look forward to picking up again with the next part of the book, which is your self-care checklist.  And then we will begin part one, preparation or stage one, I should say, preparation.  Until then, I mean this from the bottom of my heart.  Please take care and take care of each other.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Today, I'm reading from my book, \"You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.\" I'm aware that we're living in a challenging time, with the COVID-19 pandemic and recent events like the murder of George Floyd.

How?  How?  Now a lot of people commented on the piece saying surely it would be more productive to educate people with an answer rather than giving them a slap on the wrist for asking the question in the first place.  I still stand by the fact that you should never ask such a personal questions to someone you barely know.  However, being a really open person myself, I'm going to voluntarily open myself up to you and answer the question.  How?  So first of all, everybody likes different things in the bedroom.  Trans or not, there are countless sexual acts and not all of them involve... Whenever you first start dating someone, you never know what the bits are going to look like or what they're into.  Unless, of course, you slept with them right away.  You dirty dog.  Secondly, some trans people have had surgery and some haven't.  So it's really impossible to tell you how all trans people have sex.  I can only speak from my personal experiences, so let's get to know each other.  So, do you want to see my dragon?  I hadn't had any lower surgery.  when I met my girlfriend, and I remember when we were first talking about sex, she said to me that it may take some getting used to.  At the time, I was a little upset by this, thinking that I was no different from any other guy.  But looking back, I realised that my girlfriend's reaction was perfectly normal.  She'd only ever been with non-trans guys before, so of course she was going to be nervous about it.  She didn't know what to expect.  What she didn't know was that trans guys' anatomies change on testosterone treatment.  the clitoris grows into a small penis.  Even before testosterone, I always saw that part of me as male.  I never acknowledged my vagina.  I never called it that.  And even though I've had surgery now, which means I've got no female-associated bits left, I still have trouble saying that I once had a vagina.  It's important to note that some trans guys are really comfortable with that part of them, and they use it, and they enjoy it.  Personally, I could never do that, and I know a lot of trans guys who feel the same way I do, but again, everyone is different.  But anyways, back to me.  Even though I wasn't big enough down there to... I could still do lots of other stuff the same way that non-trans guys could do.  After our first time, my girlfriend was amazed by how natural it felt.  Since then, I've had a type of lower surgery called the metoidioplasty.  which works with what is already down below and even though it's not the biggest it looks totally natural.  you'd never know that i wasn't born with it.  now sex is even better with me and my girlfriend mainly because i'm more comfortable with myself but in all honesty it hasn't made a massive difference to our sex life because even before the surgery i was still a guy with genitals that resembled a guy's.  i know that not every person on the earth would feel comfortable getting with a trans guy or a trans girl but I like to have faith that when you do really like someone you look past their physicality.

Welcome back to the channel.  It's been a while since I've actually filmed anything.  The last thing that I filmed was the Birds of Prey review, so I really just haven't given myself the opportunity to get my camera out and talk.  And Sarah and I talked a little bit about this.  We kind of both had the idea of doing videos talking about things that are making us happy at the moment, specifically because of the current situation globally.  So since we're all alone right now, I decided I wanted to talk about things that made me feel not quite alone.  I have felt this weird sense of almost fear in doing that.  and I don't really know why, and normally I don't really combat feelings like that.  I just let myself feel them until they go away, but this was one that I knew easily I could make go away by just doing what it was that my brain was telling me not to do.  We need to talk about the things that we like in order to connect with one another, and that is so immeasurably important at this moment that it just I had to break out of that fear mold.  So here are some things that have recently made me really happy or that I've just consumed because I've had the time and the ability to do so.  I can't actually remember when we finished it, but my mom and I binged all of The Handmaid's Tale, which I didn't think I was gonna watch.  I thought I was just gonna let her watch it and I would do work while she had it on, and then I got sucked in and it's dark and it's stressful and I had to, you know, sleep with the TV on in my bedroom, which I don't normally do anymore, but watching The Handmaid's Tale at one o'clock in the morning and then immediately going to bed didn't really work out very well, so I just had to distract myself.  before I fell asleep.  I don't know if I really need to talk about what it is, because it's The Handmaid's Tale.  The book's been around for God knows how long, the show's been going on for years now, so if you have Hulu and you think you can handle The Handmaid's Tale, I think it's okay to watch even now, because the situations are a little different.  My mom and I also watched the entire second season of Shrill because there's only eight episodes.  We loved the first season a lot.  I don't really know what her thoughts were on the second season.  My thoughts on the second season are.  it's good.  I like it.  I'll watch the third season whenever that happens.  However, my biggest complaint Through both seasons now, it's just that Annie is the main character.  She dates this guy, Ryan, who puts no effort into pretty much anything, and Annie continuously gives him chances to, like, actually learn and grow, and he doesn't put the effort into that either.  It just, to me, insinuates that, like, fat girls should just settle for any person that wants to be with them regardless of how they're treated by that person.  And I don't like it.  Just, you know, food for thought, because... Both seasons now I've been like, Ryan is my least favorite part of the show.  And if you didn't know what Shrill was, it's a Hulu original show, just like The Handmaid's Tale, actually.  But it's kind of loosely based on a book by Lindy West.  It stars Aidy Bryant from SNL.  She plays this girl Annie, who's a writer, and she kind of... at the beginning of the first season, decides to take her life into her own hands, like, in a productive way, and seeks out different marginalized groups to talk to and talk about, and she goes to that kind of now famous fat party, fat pool party that, you know, I really need to know where I can find one of those.  Obviously not at the very second, but... I'd like to go to one of those.  It's just kind of like cute and coming-of-age and rom-com-y, so it's fun.  It's a good watch.  Like I said, I'll watch the third season when it comes out.  I'm really excited to see where Annie's gonna go after the second season.  So I don't actually think that I've talked about how I like to do arts and crafts.  I love to do arts and crafts and I picked up crocheting within the last two years, probably more recently than that.  I'm not very good at crocheting, but I like to do it.  I found that crocheting was way easier to pick up than knitting, and I've heard opposite things from other people, but knitting I just could not compute for.  Crochet, however, I like doing.  My friend Brittany's birthday is coming up like tomorrow, so I made this bat for her.  It's a little wonky and his head is a little heavy, but I crocheted this whole thing.  I made the whole thing.  So that was like my handsy artsy project of the moment.  Let me tell you, it is so easy to learn how to crochet from YouTube.  I learned how to crochet from YouTube videos and I like to crochet while I'm watching TV, especially like shows that I either don't really have to pay attention to fully for me to understand what's happening, or through things that I've already watched.  So like today I finished The Bat and watched movies that clearly I had already seen before.  But speaking of, I've also been watching a lot of Grace and Frankie recently, and that's been really nice because it's not really like plot heavy, so I can sit and crochet or sit on my phone and watch Grace and Frankie and not feel like I'm missing out on too much.  Grace and Frankie is a Netflix show with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda and they play these two older women who their husbands come out to them in the first episode and they get divorced and their husbands get married to each other and Grace and Frankie move into their shared beach house and basically from then on it's just the development of their friendship and they go into business together.  It's a cute show.  It's a nice show to sit and not have to, like, use too much brain work to figure out what's going on.  I love all the characters, including all of their adult children.  The show is very funny, and I highly recommend it.  I've currently been in a reading slump.  which I have not allowed to freak me out because it really doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter how many books I read this year.  I would love to get back into reading soon because that's a thing that I enjoy doing.  However, I'm not making myself angry at my own self for not being able or not having the motivation to pick up a book and read it right now.  However, the one downside that is kind of weighing on me because of that is that not only am I finding it hard to read and be engaged with other people's books, but I am finding it very hard to read and be engaged with my own draft of a manuscript that I've been working on for close to three years, if not three years by now.  My book really needs attention and I just do not have the motivation to do that right now.  Somebody please tell me what the answer to that problem is, because I really need to work on it again.  I'm not thinking of anything else that I've, like, done in the last couple- the last week, essentially.  So, today I watched four movies.  It's been six days that I have been in self-isolation, and today is the first day that I've dedicated to movies.  But I watched four.  I wasn't planning on any certain number or anything, it just happened.  So in this order, I watched Howl's Moving Castle, Mad Max Fury Road, Beauty and the Beast, and then Hunt for the Wilderpeople is on Hulu, which I did not know until I went onto Hulu.  So I watched Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which was the only one in the pile that I hadn't seen before.  Let me tell you, Taika Waititi is at it again!  I think it's pretty clear, like, these.  these three are really popular.  Like, everybody's seen these three, and if you haven't, Look them up.  But Hunt for the Wilderpeople is the one that I'm going to talk about because it's the one that I didn't see before today or hadn't seen before today.  Hunt for the Wilderpeople is written and directed by Taika Waititi because, like, What project of his did he not do both on?  besides, like, Thor?  It's about a young boy, Ricky Baker, who is put into a new foster home in New Zealand.  He's kind of labeled as a troublemaker by the Child Protective Services of New Zealand, and the new foster family, the new foster mom is really excited to have him there, and the foster dad is kind of, like, not really a people person.  He's like, Bella wants you here, so I don't care what you do.  kind of thing.  They have a good first couple of days together.  I don't actually know how long it is that they're together before Bella passes away, but she does pretty early on in the movie.  And then the rest of the runtime is, what is his name, Hector, Sam Neill's character, and Ricky kind of bonding, but bonding in this really weird way.  Faulkner is Caucasian.  Well, they got that wrong because you're obviously white.  Where they go off into the wilderness and have to survive because the New Zealand government is after them.  It's a really heartwarming but also heartbreaking and sad and dirty and joyful story, which, to be very honest, Taika Waititi is pretty much always good at doing.  It's a really good movie.  Like I said, it's on Hulu.  It's free with subscription, so if you have Hulu, you have the ability to watch it, or you can rent it from somewhere maybe, highly recommend it.  And the last thing that I wanted to talk about is probably the biggest thing that has really made me laugh, made me feel connected to other people, even though I don't really interact with other people with it, but I downloaded TikTok.  I have no intentions of making my own TikTok.  Please do not ask me to do it.  Right now, I just don't want to focus on that.  I want to focus on this and my book eventually again.  I don't want to make TikToks.  I want to watch them.  This is something that I exclusively want to view.  I love it though.  I'm obsessed.  I cannot explain to you how much I have enjoyed my time watching TikToks and I lose so much time doing it, but right now What's the difference?  I'm not doing anything more important.  I've learned through TikTok that when somebody has a ferret, they do not stop at one ferret.  Is it because the ferrets need friends or is it because you just enjoy having ferrets?  I haven't been able to ferret that one out yet.  One that I recently just found is Felicia.st.  She does cosplays of Anne Boleyn.  So that's how niche I can get on TikTok.  I also like Veebles.  She's a Scottish woman who just does a lot of TikToks talking about how people talk about her accent.  Like her a lot.  Fairhopeherps is a TikToker who does a lot of stuff with her Bearded Dragon, who's TikTok famous.  Little Margo.  Big fan of Margo.  I like Paige Lael, not only because we have the same name, but because she talks about being a woman with autism and other disabilities, and she makes her TikToks really accessible, and I like that a lot about her.  Olivia Van Foxface lives on a farm, and basically all of her TikToks are just her going and feeding her farm animals.  She has, like, four llamas, a bunch of goats, two mini horses, a little piggy, three dogs.  Like, I just really like animals, in case you couldn't tell about me.  Then there's KTS Canvases, who pretty much her entire TikTok is just her painting these really pretty floral designs.  I just find her voice and her painting to be very comforting and very relaxing.  She's a good one to watch right before bed.  I also really like Youth Pastor Ryan.  He's just very wholesome and funny.  He's not actually a youth pastor, he just... says that he uses Youth Pastor basically because that's his personality.  I do follow a couple cat accounts that I absolutely love.  I do not have any cats and I do not consider myself a cat person.  However, One-Eared Uno is one of the most adorable cats I've ever seen in my entire life.  He does have one ear and he goes on lots of adventures and I love him.  MorganDrinksCoffee is a very relatable TikToker because I used to work in a bookstore that had a cafe and I was cross-trained to work in the cafe.  So I know what it feels like to be a barista and have to deal with customers.  But I think her TikToks are very funny and again, relatable.  I follow a lot more, but I'm only gonna suggest two more for now.  I really love John's Bones.  He has a cat named Chonk.  And pretty much whenever I open TikTok, Chonk is the first thing that I see, and it just... Chonk brings me so much joy!  I love Chonk!  The Chonky boy!  The perfect angel!  Love him!  And my absolute favorite TikToker, who I have liked for a while, not necessarily on TikTok, although the videos that I've seen of him are from TikTok, I've just seen them on other social media sites, is Ghost Honey.  Tyler is... Perfect.  We'll just go with that.  Tyler's famous for being the most perfect husband in that he went back to the airport to get his husband's very expensive Lush product out of a bush.  And he also does quite a few TikToks where he puts on this, like, Victorian dandy persona, which is, they're hilarious.  I love it.  It's very Oscar Wilde, and I love it.  Tyler genuinely makes me so happy.  So those are the things that have been keeping me busy and connected and feeling like I'm not alone in the last six days as of me filming this.

For those of you unaware of who Graham Linehan is, he was once a comedy writer who faded into obscurity before making his presence known on Twitter.  How?  while continually targeting and abusing trans people and those that support us, including people such as Linda Riley, a cis lesbian and the publisher of Diva magazine, Europe's leading magazine for lesbians and bisexual women.  But because Linda is more than capable of speaking for herself and won't be bullied by a man into accepting his transphobia, Graham set about attempting to discredit her lesbianship.  Because, as we all know, Graham loves to protect the wands.  Now, at the end of 2018, Graham Linehan attended to have funding designated for a trans youth support charity, Mermaid, a charity that offers support and advice to young trans people and their parents, withdrawn.  Linehan took to famously transphobic forums such as Mumsnet to demand that they copy and paste his letter, sending it off to the Big Lottery Fund.  a letter that accused the charity of offering children hormone replacement therapy among various other things, even though Mermaids is a purely social support charity and has no dealings with pharmaceuticals of any kind.  Now, thankfully a review found such claims to be entirely baseless, and the funding resumed.  as well as an extra lump sum which had been raised during the review period, giving Mermaids an additional quarter of a million pounds on top of the half million pledged by the Big Lottery Fund, after which he slunk back to his toxic corner of Twitter, a funnier joke than any he'd written in his dead career.  However, just over a year down the line and he's re-emerged, this time asking his fellow transphobic bigots to supply him names of therapists who are happy to torture children to try and convert them.  The tweet reads as quote, Some assistance required.  The extremely awesome Stella O'Malley is trying to assemble a list of Irish gender-critical therapists as a resource for parents.  Can anyone help?  End quote.  Stella O'Malley, by the way, is someone I've exposed previously for deliberately lying to the general public about puberty blockers, comparing changes in persistence rates in young children to teenagers, whilst acting as if these samples are the same.  She is more than happy to lie about the science to further her transphobic agenda.  Much like Graham.  Now, perhaps you read that tweet and didn't think much of it.  After all, it's just a call for gender-critical therapists.  Why is that a problem?  Well, gender-critical is a euphemism for transphobia in the exact same way that race-realist is for racism.  It's meant to make the bigotry sound more scientific and therefore palatable.  The truth, meanwhile, is that every major medical establishment condemns the self-labelled gender-critical approach, which is a form of reparative therapy, though, as noted earlier, it is in fact torture.  Said methods are abusive and inflict severe harm on the victim in attempts to turn them cisgender and force them to adhere to strict and archaic gender roles.  It's totally destructive, a fact agreed upon by the UK Council for Psychotherapy, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, to name a few.  O'Malley and the so-called gender-critical therapists have to ignore the entire scientific consensus in order to defend their position as even remotely ethical.  Their methods are about the scientific as forcing a child to drink bleach in order to cure their autism.  Not only does it not work, but it invents a problem where there isn't one.  Only last year we got clear results from the Trevor National Survey on LGBT plus youth mental health.  42% of LGBT plus youth who are the victim of so-called reparative therapy attempt to commit suicide, compared to 17% who aren't victims.  This number actually increases for trans youth to 57%, suggesting that people are more sensitive towards attempts to change their gender than attempts to change their sexuality.  Whether this is innate or as a result of cultural differences i.e.  lesbian, gay and bisexual people are more likely to find support elsewhere than trans people is really irrelevant.  What really matters is that trans people are at a greater risk, Fact is, the survey also looked into attempts to convince people to change their gender or sexuality, just in case Linehan wants to bullshit his way by pretending like he's not advocating for conversion therapy.  What the survey found is that 23% of LGBT plus youth attempted suicide if someone had attempted to convince them to change their gender or sexuality, compared to a baseline of 80% of those who hadn't experienced such attempts.  So, repetitive therapy actually increases attempted suicide from a base level of 8% all the way up to 57%.  And that is, regardless of how we might protest, what Graham Linehan is attempting to support through his actions.  The torture of children who he believes should not exist, that they need to be eradicated, like a disease.  And there's been even more evidence to come out to support this since the Trevor Project survey.  In November 2019, an article was published with the title, Association Between Recruited Exposure to Gender Identity Conversion Efforts and Psychological Distress and Suicide Attempts Among Transgender Adults in the JAMA.  That is the Journal of the American Medical Association, the American Medical Association being the largest association of physicians and medical students in the US.  It is regarded highly in the medical community because, in large, it kind of is the US medical community.  Now, the study itself conducted research on 27,715 transgender adults living in the US.  3,869 of which had been exposed to GICE .  They found that, quote, exposure to GICE before age 10 years was significantly associated with several measures of suicidality, including lifetime suicide attempts.  end quote.  They also found no significant difference when comparing religious or secular conversion attempts, so it's not a case of finding the right way to do it.  There is no right way to do it.  You're simply torturing someone for the sake of inflicting pain, and that's fucking disgusting.  And the thing is, we know how to help young people who are questioning their gender.  and that is to take the gender-affirmative approach.  That is an approach that allows a child or young teen to explore their identity with support.  no matter the conclusion they arrive at.  And compared to the gender-critical approach, the results of gender affirmation is that the rates of anxiety and depression, the things that bring about attempted suicide, these decrease to levels equal to those seen in a cisgender control.  Children exploring their gender who are supported in it show levels of depression and anxiety on par with the rest of society.  This is not a debated topic.  This is not controversial.  The science is entirely one-sided.  If you want to help your child, then support them in exploring who they are.  Affirm their gender exploration.  If you want to torture them, though, forced them to see a gender-critical quack like O'Malley or another one of the Disgracers on Linehan's little list.  I believe very strongly that adherence to transphobic torture should result in instant revocation of one's licence, as well as sanctions in line with those in place for other child abusers.  Because that is what it is.  demonstrably.  Another thing that should be happening is the social media accounts promoting said child abuse should be terminated.  Throughout the years of Linehan's transphobic abuse, Twitter has done nothing, and it's long past the point of being fucking ridiculous.  Do we just allow advocates of acts that can be demonstrated, not asserted but demonstrated with scientific evidence, to be child abuse?  Do we just allow them to continue to promote said acts?  By doing nothing, Twitter is telling people that they're on board with supporting the torture of children.  That's just the way it is, and it needs to change.  So yeah, I hope you gained something from this video and the resources it has supplied you, because that is why I do this.  It's less about convincing people such as Linehan to stop being a pro-child abuse fuck, it's more about supplying you lot with the resources to stand your ground should the topic of affirmative care versus reparative torture come up.

I would imagine myself as an adult, alone, and playing oldies music on the radio, watching the sunrise through a window, having a cup of hot coffee.  And this is what peace looked like to me.  And now I'm an adult and I can give myself that fantasy.  I can hold my hot mug of coffee and take a deep breath in and a deep breath out, and really appreciate that moment.  Staying in one place and in periods of or total isolation can be really psychologically taxing.  So you deserve to find your moments of joy and peace and to give them to yourself.  When I was recovering from surgery and I couldn't really get out of bed at all, the thing that brought me joy was musical theater.  I would either watch musicals on TV, or if I couldn't watch TV, then I would listen to cast albums and imagine what the musical looks like in my head, essentially directing musicals inside of my head, kind of like a musical audio book.  And that was the thing that would make me happy.  What's something that you can do at home that would make you happy?  Let me know in the comments and maybe you guys can like bounce ideas off each other.  When it comes to daily activities, if structured routines is how you want to go, you can make a schedule for yourself.  Set up times for your meals, for learning something new, maybe a new language or a skill, or trying new things like a new recipe or watching a new movie or a new book.  or working on creative things like writing or painting.  If you love your unstructured time, have at it.  But if you come across the feeling of, I'm bored, I don't know what to do, ah, maybe what might help you is to at some point sit down and write down those things that make you happy, that bring you joy, the things that you'd like to try.  Put them on little pieces of paper and then just have them in a bowl or a hat or whatever you want.  And when you have those feelings of restlessness, then you can just pick something out of the bowl and try that.  Or if you need to rest, rest.  Try not to be so hard on yourself for needing to.  If you gotta, you gotta.  Self-discovery.  Self-discovery is a huge opportunity to be gained from alone time.  And I think that more people should attune themselves to that.  It's a time to figure out what are the things we do that are performative versus innately us.  How do you behave when you're alone?  What actions do you do solely because people are watching you?  Do you like these things about yourself?  Is there anything about yourself that you would like to work on?  This is a great time to take all those personality quizzes and see what kind of insight they can offer.  There's things like the Myers-Briggs, the color code, the Enneagram, finding your love language, getting your birth chart done, so many.  I'll go ahead and leave some links in the description for you.  Who am I is often an existential question that a lot of people dread, but I love exploring myself and learning about myself and finding the places where I would like to grow, learning the language that will allow me to communicate myself better.  It's one of my favorite benefits of all my time isolated and at home.  Self therapy.  Whether or not you are seeing a therapist, and remember that there are some who do video calls and phone calls and texting for their sessions, Something that I always practice is some form of self-therapy.  By self-therapy, I basically mean keeping an eye on my mental health and doing whatever is in my power to keep my brain healthy.  but I'll go into more detail about what self-therapy means for me.  I started doing this because I dealt with mental health issues as a teen and as a young adult, and I didn't really have access to a professional therapist.  My only real options at the time were to research my symptoms, essentially self-diagnose, and find healthy ways to cope with whatever was available to me.  And I know the idea of self-diagnosis and self-work may sound alarming to some people, but when it's that or nothing, you do what you have to do to survive.  Two separate times in my life I dealt with severe mental illness, by severe I mean I was in the depths of mental illness and it was extremely harmful to myself.  And I had no idea for the longest time that I was even dealing with mental illness at all.  I just thought my intrusive thoughts were logical and factual and they went unquestioned for the longest time too.  And as I said, it ultimately put me in very dangerous situations.  When I started to question it, which is essentially what I mean when I say self-therapy, I learned as much as I could and I put words to what I was experiencing and did whatever it was in my power to to just try and help myself.  At the time when I was dealing with the very deep lows of my mental illnesses and doing my self-therapy and self-work, A lot of it was instinctive, but with the amount of information we now have available through the internet, I can also recommend seeking out coping mechanisms and healing tools through that avenue.  Without having the names for it at the time, I was practicing mirror work, exposure therapy, correcting intrusive thoughts as though another being were saying them, discovering my triggers and setting boundaries, etc.  There is of course a limit to this because there will be some cases where seeing a professional is the best option.  whether it be for medicinal reasons or for some other kind of treatment.  However, trying to be attuned to ourselves, question our thoughts, question our mental health, discovering the parts of ourselves that need healing or accommodation so that we can navigate the world more safely and to grow is definitely something rewarding that we can try to do on our own.  Grieving the life you once had.  For many of us, being homebound is a transition, and it can be a really difficult one.  It's often not a choice, and so it feels forceful, out of our control, and that's one of the first triggers.  It sometimes means we have to find new ways to work, or that we cannot work at all.  It means less socialization, less getting to hug people we love, getting to hang out with them and do activities with them.  For me, that was one of the most painful things, particularly right now, not knowing when I'll be able to hug my friends again is something that has literally brought me to tears. I was originally trying to keep this video a bit broad so it might be used for a variety of different circumstances where one might become homebound, but in this next part I will be touching on some grieving topics where the difference between pandemic lockdown and being homebound due to chronic illness and disability become a little difficult to tell apart.  A lot of it is actually very similar, but I do want to take this moment to say that in these shared experiences, there can be so much trauma on top of trauma.  And while I am referencing the current pandemic, I would like to offer my deepest condolences to those who have lost their loved ones, whether or not it was to COVID-19.  If you have lost anyone you love at all, for any reason, my heart is with you and I hope you have the time and space you need to grieve these losses. There are things to be angry about, like oppressive systems of power, failing leadership, hoarding of resources, continued racist violence, disregard for human life.  There are anxieties like contagion anxiety and income anxiety and the anticipation of the long-term emotional and psychological wounds this will create.  The PTSD.  The fear.  All of our current circumstances have such an emotional toll.  It's very common for them to trigger anxiety and depression, among many other mental illnesses.  It can cause us to feel hopeless and irritable, be hypersensitive to microaggressions or perceived microaggressions.  Grief is ever-present and can just sort of spike or burst in those moments where you feel the impacts of change.  You will ache in nostalgia for the past.  You will mourn the things you imagined for your future.  You'll feel moments of longing and anger and sadness.  Whatever it is that you feel, allow yourself to feel it.  Do not try to numb it.  Just go through it.  And remember that it's not the end.  We just have to find new ways of doing things.  In the future, I recommend looking at disabled folks in that regard.  Disabled people have always led the way in finding new ways to adapt.  Hashtag the future is accessible.  We now have the ability to livestream with professors and teachers, work from home with our computers, meet up with our friends through video chat.  The possibilities are endless.  Work and education, community, and joy can continue even if you cannot leave your house.  I've been having to spend most of my time at home for years now because I'm chronically ill.  I've already been through the trapped feelings, the exhaustion of looking at the same four walls every day.  For me, I've experienced the anger, the anxiety, the sorrow.  And to this day, grief comes in moments and waves.  For anyone, being stuck at home can cause psychological distress, restlessness, irritability, depression, anxiety.  I can feel that way not just about my house, but my body.  Sometimes I become all too aware of my chronic pain if I'm not distracted by something and then all I have is my pain.  It's like this horrifyingly loud, intolerable ringing in my head.  And just like you might wish to just erupt like a rocket out of your house, can sometimes feel that way about my human suit.  All that to say, my grief is multi-layered.  I've had to grieve not just my ability to go out, be among people that I like, do the jobs that I used to do, attend college courses, etc.  and the ability to do those things on a daily basis, but I've had to grieve my body's specific loss of abilities that put me in this position in the first place.  And I had to grieve the loss of privilege.  I'm making this video during a pandemic, when most of us are staying home.  But when things eventually open back up, I'll still be here.  For the most part.  And others are home 24-7.  So I just hope that the tools that were being used by disabled people for accessibility, now popularized by the pandemic, hopefully are here to stay and that we continue to pursue equitable accessibility for all of us.  If you have arrived at the end of this video, it was a long one, I know.  Thank you for sticking around.  I hope that you leave here reminded to be kind to yourself and be kind to others.  If you have more than you need, spread it onto others who don't.  Keep an eye out for those who are vulnerable, and this is inclusive of elderly folks, chronically ill folks, people with low income, or people who have lost their jobs.  And also remember that there are so many people struggling right now.  So the least that we can try to do is have an understanding that we are all experiencing collective trauma experience.  So many of us are in survival mode or exhibiting our trauma responses, so try not to take small outbursts personally and hold ourselves accountable.  We shouldn't be having outbursts at people, taking things out on other people, projecting whatever we are experiencing onto other people.  But also remember to set clear boundaries and keep yourself safe.  Please share things you find rewarding about staying at home in the comments.  Like I said, I'm sure so many people are looking for things to uplift them in this time.  And I will see you eventually.  Take care and stay safe.","channel.id":"clxmi0nm001s2cdvisg8sn8uk","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCznS4Pk3VcTIfDUuWrQtdzQ","channel.name":"Annie Elainey","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUMs5MgxX-swWUepaOvpmQ-tl21N33UNC7s5nHJRg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2011-11-04T03:43:54.000Z","summary":"If you're struggling with isolation, this video is for you.

These are the things that hormones cannot change. Body parts that have already developed. Body parts like my bones. Hormones. Hormones.  I was assigned female at birth. I was assigned male at birth. I was 11 years old when I first started bleeding.  I remember my body changing, growing.  It scared me.  I attempted to take my own life. I banished parts of myself and hid them away. My teenage years were lost years.  I hated my body.  But I don't want to tell you yet another story of a trans person who hated themselves and their body. I had never for one day in my life conformed to what society thinks men should be like.  My bone structure was mostly feminine and my voice never dropped. Before I started taking testosterone, I was at a crossroads.  Either go for it or not live at all.  I was so desperate for hormones that I got them illegally.  I just couldn't wait any longer. My body became an ever-changing landscape that hormones resculpted. There are so many things that hormones can change. Hair. Hair. Fat distribution. Fat distribution. Cravings. Cravings. Sex drive. Sex drive. Skin. Skin. Voice. Bones. My Adam's apple.  My wrists My voice. I would pose in the mirror and cover my breasts and imagine what I would look like without them.

I couldn't wait when I started the hormones.  I was checking my face every day for like a new hair coming through.  And it was a bit of an obsession.  A lot of the time I say to people, I never really looked like a girl before.  I kind of just looked more like a young boy.  And I felt like I was waiting to go through the puberty that I needed to become a man.  So from a boy to a man, basically, rather than saying from a girl to a man, that just kind of sounded wrong.  After about a year on testosterone, I had a full beard.  So from one side of my face to the other, I can't imagine my face without a beard anymore.  It just feels like it's part of me, obviously, at this stage in my transition.  There's absolutely no question of whether I pass or not.  Not that that's even an important thing in transitioning anyway.  So the beard at this stage really is just, I suppose you'd call it maybe a fashion choice.  I don't know.  I feel like my face looks a lot better with a beard.  It really suits having a beard.  Another worry I did have was trying to look older to get into the clubs and I felt like a beard would help that.  Whereas now that I'm 25, I'm constantly worried about looking too old.  So there's a few reasons why I want to shave my beard off, and one of those reasons is that I'm just intrigued to see how my face looks because I think that the beard has been the most... the main change since starting the hormones.  By that logic, you'd think that perhaps I would look more androgynous, I don't know, maybe more feminine without the beard, but I know that's not going to be the case, so then it leaves the question of okay, how has my face physically changed apart from the beard?  The second reason is satisfaction of how it's gonna feel to shave it all off and have this really smooth skin underneath that can moisturize and watch it grow back.  It might even grow back thicker than this.  And I guess the final reason is that with me wanting to go to more acting auditions, I can give people the choice of how I'd look with and without the beard.  So I'll get my girlfriend Sophie to take some head shots of me without the beard.  if I look semi-decent and I can use that to show people and say look you know I can look hopefully maybe younger without the beard.  so yeah I guess I'll just see what I look like and I am quite scared but I'm gonna do it.  there's no going back now after filming this pre-interview so let's wait and see.","channel.id":"clxmi0mat00v7cdvio57tdapf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCsDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA","channel.name":"My Genderation","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/g864bFMBAXso_fkzd73ZmSXVmy9E2HHX__MiClzVA-IEppDPNVUpMVC4-dH8_O59GaGahuLOLg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Having a beard was a significant aspect of my transition, especially in the early stages.

I don't wish harm or hate on anyone and I just want to make that very very clear.  I'm an imperfect person and I do my best to be caring, kind, and loving and I screw up. Recently Tati Westbrook uploaded a video where she spoke intimately about how Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson manipulated her into uploading a video a year ago where she accused James Charles of being a sexual predator. Cracking someone's sexuality is not an escape room. Now I'll be totally honest.  Tati Westbrook has consistently been one of the few makeup YouTubers that I've had respect for.  She is definitely somebody who is very no nonsense about makeup and that's the kind of beauty influencer that I personally like to follow.  But I will say that I became a little concerned when I started to see Jeffree Star's lipsticks in the background of her videos.  In my mind, Tati has always kind of been this unproblematic YouTuber who is disconnected from the drama of the beauty community.  So I was a little disappointed when I saw her starting to become closer and closer to Jeffree Star and unfortunately it seems that that has not worked out for her.  Now in my previous video, I talked about the leeway that we give creators like Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson, right?  And I also talked about the fact that we're going to see a redemption arc for Shane Dawson, who in my opinion has definitely in comparison to Jeffree Star engaged in what I would say is more extensive and more intense racism.  Now I said this in my Jeffree Star video, but I definitely believe that people can change.  I definitely believe that people, regardless of what they've done or what sort of ideologies they have engaged in, I think that they do have the capacity to change, right?  This truth, right, does not contradict the fact that you don't need to be present for that person's growth.  You don't need to be there to congratulate them for no longer engaging in something like racism.  I think that it is very healthy for people to draw up a boundary and say, you know what?  Maybe you can change.  Maybe you have the capacity to change.  But I'm no longer going to be invested in you as a person or as a creator.  I think that that is healthy and that's something that a lot of people don't tend to acknowledge when we talk about so-called cancel culture.  That drawing lines between yourself and this sort of content is healthy.  It's not weak of you.  to want to withdraw from the content.  that hurts you.  So she talks about a lot in this video and I'll be completely honest, I don't think that she's completely owning up to everything, but that's not really what I wanted to talk about.  I don't really want to talk about Shane or Jeffree Star in this video, even though we've talked about them a couple of times on this channel.  You guys can check out this last video that I made about Shane Dawson if you guys want more of my perspective on this.  What I wanted to focus on in this video was Tatia Westbrook's first public apology to Jackie Aina and kind of what it says about a lot of friendships and relationships between a lot of white people and their black friends or acquaintances.  So I'm going to assume that a lot of you guys watching this have no clue about any of this stuff.  So we're going to go over really quickly a timeline of events.  A few years ago, Jackie Aina made a statement during one of her auntie halls where she said that she would not support Jeffree Star's cosmetics because she's aware of Jeffree Star's anti-black history. I'm not buying Jeffree Star cosmetics, at least not anytime soon.  I'm not trying to make this open season on anybody.  just being very honest, but I just, I just have a deep issue with the anti-black like comments and things that have been made publicly. And this public statement got her blocked by Jeffree Star on Instagram.  Then if we fast forward a little bit, David Scissorhands, who is Jeffree Star's former hairstylist and friend did Jackie Aina's hair.  And this obviously set off Jeffree Star.  Now this happened in 2017, but in 2018, David Scissorhands released text messages that showed Jeffree Star referring to Jackie Aina as a gorilla.  Back in 2017, Jeffree Star and Jackie Aina had a very public Twitter fallout where Jeffree Star ultimately called Jackie Aina an irrelevant rat.  So I think it would be an understatement to say that they're not fond of each other.  Now, around the time when they had their Twitter fallout, Tati Westbrook posted a collaboration video with Jeffree Star.  In fact, in her apology, she references this and says that this should have been the moment where she turned her back on Jeffree Star.  but she didn't.  In fact, she would continue to have a relationship with him and would continue to make videos promoting his products.  I wanted to make this video because I saw all of this happen and listening to Tati say what she says about Jackie Aina in this video was kind of hard because I had a hard time justifying how she could say that she's always loved and supported Jackie and has always had a positive relationship with her.  And see how she could feel that way and also still maintain a relationship with Jeffree Star, somebody who is a known racist, who has said and done several things against Jackie Aina that have been clearly a little coded.  And the most that Jackie said was that she wasn't going to promote or support his products because of his previous engagement with anti-blackness, which again, going from my previous video, is a very healthy boundary for her to set.  When there are all of these makeup brands out there, why would you go and support the makeup brand of somebody who has been outwardly and loudly racist, even if they've changed, even if... they've grown.  Of all of the options you have, why Jeffree Star?  And what I wanted to talk about in this video was really how I think for black people, drawing that line is a little bit easier than it is for a lot of white people. I got it twisted that you had provoked Jeffree because you were angry that I had filmed with someone who had a history of being labeled by others as a racist.  Jackie, I'm sorry that I did not do the right thing and walk away from him then. Listening to Tati say this triggered a very familiar feeling to me.  That feeling of having a white friend who is hesitant to stand up for you.  Now, contrary to popular belief, I don't personally believe that every white person is a racist.  But what I will say is that I believe pretty much every white person has a relationship with a racist that is more valuable than any relationship they will ever have with a black person.  Now before you get defensive, before you get defensive and say, oh no, no, no, not me.  Think about your racist family members.  Would you cut them off before you cut off your black friend?  Think about your racist partners.  Some of you are sleeping with racists while posting Black Lives Matter on your page.  Would you cut them off quicker than you would cut off your black friend?  Think about it.  Think about it.  I want you to really think critically about this because this is something that I've observed.  People who are friends with me, who have no problem with me, but have these people in their life who engage in racism, who they struggle to let go of.  And I've had these experiences where their friend is saying something racist and I say, Hey man, you're being racist.  And suddenly I'm the asshole.  Suddenly I'm the angry person.  Suddenly I'm the jerk for saying that this racist person who they care about is being racist.  Now I've always had a really hard time understanding why someone would maintain a relationship with somebody who hates the people that they love.  I don't get it.  I personally don't understand it.  But for me, from my observation, it seems like it's very, very hard for a white person to let go of a white person who they are friends with, who they are sleeping with, who is part of their family, who engages in racism.  Now, Jackie Aina, being a black woman, saw Jeffree Star's racism and she still still held out space for him to potentially not be that person anymore.  And when he showed her that he indeed was still that person, she drew the line in the sand.  In fact, she stopped associating with people who supported him.  She stopped working with brands who supported him.  She recently deactivated her code with Morphe because Morphe continues to support and work with Jeffree Star.  and who these companies continue to support and work with definitely speaks volumes.  And that's what I really wanted to talk about in this video.  Look, you might not be racist, of course not, you're one of the good ones, right?  But the relationships that you choose to maintain with the people who hurt the people whom you claim to support really does express where you stand.  Tati said in her video that Jeffree Star was like a lion.  He was dangerous, but he was always nice to her.  And I found that to be really interesting.  So yeah, maybe he's racist or whatever, but he's nice to me, so... There's just something about hearing that out loud that really cuts a little too deep.  Her saying that basically affirmed the point that at the time her relationship with Jeffree star was more important than her relationship with Jackie Aina, which frankly boggles my mind because when it comes to aesthetics and you know, people who are in, your sort of realm of makeup.  Jackie Aina and Tati Westbrook are obviously in the same category.  They do a very similar type of makeup for a very similar type of girl.  And Jeffree Star is just so outside of the aesthetic realm that it's strange to me that she wouldn't want to foster a productive, healthy relationship with Jackie Aina, who is clearly way more in her realm.  But let's be honest for a second.  Jeffree Star can do more for Tati Westbrook than Jackie Aina ever could.  Jeffree Star is mega rich.  He's mega famous.  He's got 18 million subscribers on YouTube.  A relationship with Jeffree Star is more beneficial to Tati Westbrook than it would have been for her to maintain a relationship with Jackie Aina.  While Jackie Aina is a powerhouse in her own right, she doesn't quite have the same amount of reach or power as Jeffree Star.  Now, it shouldn't surprise you that as a black girl who wears makeup that I am a huge Jackie Aina stan.  And one of the things that I've always appreciated about Jackie Aina is how she holds onto her faith.  Now, I'm an atheist.  I don't believe in any of it.  But I've always respected the fact that in a time where being religious is becoming less and less popular, that Jackie Aina stuck to her guns.  That she still puts Bible verses in the descriptions of her videos and sometimes even in the videos.  that she's always held on to God and always been a religious person.  I think that's beautiful even if I don't believe it.  Part of holding on to your faith is doing what is unpopular because it's godly.  It's remaining steadfast in your walk with God while everyone around you sins.  It's having integrity.  And what's clear to me while watching Tati Westbrook's video is that she greatly lacks integrity.  Now in her video, Tati Westbrook says that she is a woman of faith.  So I wanted to read her a Bible verse.  1 Timothy 6.10 says, Tati valued money over integrity.  And that's why she maintained a relationship with Jeffree Star, somebody who screams ungodliness and unrepentant sin.  Of course it is the Christian thing to do to see the best in others, but I think it's important to point out that Tati Westbrook did more than just try to see the best in Jeffree and try to make him a role model and et cetera, et cetera.  She suspended her disbelief to the point where she looked at his racism and gave him so much more support than she's ever given Jackie Aina.  If you go to her channel right now, you will not find a single time where she has supported anything that Jackie Aina has put out in terms of makeup.  She's reviewed pretty much every Anastasia Beverly Hills palette except for hers.  But meanwhile, there are several, several videos of her supporting Jeffree Star's product releases.  And those videos are still available for you to watch right now on her channel even though she just made... An apology video saying that Jeffree Star manipulated her.  Tati Westbrook tries to really minimize her relationship with Jeffree Star in her video by saying that they weren't even close like that.  But even still, she still went out of her way to promote his products.  And I think that it's worth talking about why that is, why the racism wasn't enough.  I think it says a lot that the accusations of racism weren't enough for Tati Westbrook to be like, yeah, no, I don't need to work with that person.  I think that there was so much suspension of disbelief, so much leeway, so much consideration.  And it's a degree of consideration that Jackie Aina wasn't given at all.  Jackie Aina was just dismissed as some angry, bitter black girl who was mad that she didn't have as many subscribers or wasn't as loved as Jeffree Star was.  But Jeffree Star could go into the middle of the street and say, heinously racist things and get just an endless amount of support, concern and consideration.  Four months ago, Jackie Aina did what Tati Westbrook didn't do and she supported her release.  Jackie Aina made a video reviewing Tati Westbrook's new palette and her makeup sponge and she gave it a raving review. Tati reached out to me and said some really heartfelt things and really truly made me feel like she was sincere in trying to start over and mend something with me and like I really appreciated that.  Tati, I'm not gonna put all of that out there, but I thought that was worth mentioning. It'll always be interesting and depressing to me that people will sooner defend a racist reputation than they will stand up against racism.  What I ultimately wanted to communicate in this video is that your black friends see you do this.  You know, you may think that your black friend, you know, just doesn't notice you bending over backwards to justify your relationship with a racist, but we see it.  And the more we see it and the more you do it, the less we trust you.  Personally, I don't have racist or transphobic or misogynistic or homophobic or any kind of phobic friends because life is too short.  My patience is too thin and my integrity is too important to me.  I really hope that Tati continues to grow.  I think that she is.  I think that the video, while it definitely is a lot of her not being fully culpable to everything.  I definitely think that it is a step in the right direction.  I think that she is taking more and more accountability and that is great.  I love that she is acknowledging how her actions have negatively impacted others.  I hope that she continues to move forward in a positive direction.  And as time goes on, she can become a more and more trustworthy friend.  Anyway, that is all I had to say about this.  If you guys want to watch any of my other videos about this subject, I will have a handy dandy little playlist over there because honestly, I've made so many videos about these people that I might as well have a playlist at this point.  So there you go.  Anyway, I'll see you guys in the next video.

The Last Airbender is full of complex characters and interesting parallels between those characters, but one of my favorite comparisons is between Katara and Azula, because the first time you watch the show, you might not see too many connections between them, but if you rewatch it, you can see how the show uses them to contrast each other, and that gives a lot more nuance to all of their interactions, especially making their final battle together even more meaningful.  So, let's start from the beginning.  Katara and Azula are the same age in the series.  Both of them lost their mothers when they were very young, both of them grew up with a dad and an older brother, and both are highly skilled benders who learn a specialized bending technique in blood bending and lightning bending.  But after they lost their mothers, their lives massively diverged based largely on how they were raised and how they dealt with their mother's death.  First, let's talk about how they were raised.  Azula was always encouraged by her father Ozai to dislike her mother Ursa.  She was fed lies about how her mother thought she was a monster and hated her.  We learn about this when she's sitting around the fire and makes this kind of offhand joke about how her mother was right to believe she was a monster.  But importantly, there's no evidence in the series that her mother actually ever said that.  The biggest glimpse we get into how Ursa felt about Azula is at the end of the series when Azula is having her breakdown and sees her mother in the mirror.  At this point, Ursa tells Azula that she loves her, even though this isn't really Ursa, it's just a figment of Azula's imagination.  But still, I think it's telling that Azula's subconscious in this moment is trying to tell her that her mother never actually hated her.  because deep down, Azula knows that's true, even if she doesn't want to admit it or believe it, because the belief that she is a monster has already driven her so far down her angry path.  Quick note, I'm only going to talk about The Last Airbender TV show in this video because I don't want to spoil anything specific from the comics, but suffice to say that the Search comics give even more evidence that Ursa loved Azula.  So anyway, from a very young and impressionable age, Azula was basically encouraged by her father, the person she looked up to the most, to hate her mother.  And after her mother disappeared, she was never able to get any kind of closure over the course of the TV show.  Nobody was ever able to convince her that Ursa actually loved her, because up until the very end, she was loyal to Ozai, and nobody really knew what happened to Ursa.  Katara, on the other hand, seemed to grow up in a very supportive household where her parents loved each other and didn't use their kids as pawns against each other.  Katara knew that her mother loved her very much, and towards the end of the series, she even learns that her mother knowingly sacrificed herself by claiming that she was the last waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe.  So both of these characters were loved by their mothers, but Azula had no idea, while Katara knew very well that she was loved.  Now, real quick, before we dive any deeper into Katara and Azula's stories, I want to tell you about this video's sponsor, Surfshark VPN.  Surfshark is an app and browser extension that basically lets your phone or computer pretend that it's in another country so that you can access region-locked content.  This is really great for if you're traveling and want to watch a show from your home country that isn't available in the country you're currently in.  And it's also great for just accessing content you wouldn't otherwise be able to see.  For instance, The Legend of Korra recently came to Netflix, but only in the US, so if you're living outside the US, you can use Surfshark to easily access The Legend of Korra on US Netflix.  On top of that, Surfshark adds an extra layer of security by encrypting all the data you send over the internet and by hiding your IP address.  which is especially useful if you're connecting to any kind of public WiFi hotspot.  And you can use Surfshark on an unlimited number of devices, so you can protect all the computers, tablets, and phones in your household.  I've personally been using Surfshark regularly for the last year, well before they even reached out to sponsor this video, and I love it.  So you can use the link in the description and the code RileyJ to get 83% off and 3 extra months for free.  And rest assured that there is a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there's no risk to try it out for yourself and see how you like it.  So be sure to check out that link in the description and use code RileyJ to get started with Surfshark.  Now, back to Katara and Azula.  So, even before Azula lost her mother, Ozai was encouraging the worst aspects of her.  He taught her that violence and aggression were to be praised, and that weakness and emotions were to be hidden and locked away.  But without Ursa there to even try to counteract some of Ozai's teachings, Azula went fully down the hateful path that Ozai designed for her.  She knew nothing else in her entire life except being rewarded for being cruel and being punished for being kind, so that's what she did.  But for Katara, her father Hakoda seems to be a nice person, who encouraged Katara to be a nice person as well.  Katara was raised with love and allowed to be who she wanted to be, without a strict punishment-reward system to guide her down a narrow, hateful path.  What happened with Katara, though, was that she felt a pressure to be maternal because of the absence of her mom.  Her dad, nice as he might be, seemed to be more of a warrior than a caretaker, and so she kind of assumed the role of mom figure.  Sokka talks about this with Toph at one point, saying that when he tries to picture his mom, all he can see is Katara's face.  So even though Katara wasn't abused like Azula was to go down one specific path, the trauma from her mom's death kind of pushed her down a specific path anyway.  She adopted this kind, nurturing, motherly role to take care of Sokka.  Azula didn't have that option, because Ozai would not have tolerated Azula behaving in any kind of nurturing or motherly way.  So despite both of them losing their mom at a young age, the circumstances of their lives drove them in very different directions.  Their parents and upbringing even defined their relationships with their siblings.  Azula always felt like she had to be better than Zuko because Ozai pitted them against each other.  He made them compete against each other and fight for his attention and respect.  And Azula, as a firebending prodigy, often did much better than Zuko, which led to Zuko feeling a lot of jealousy and led to Ozai treating him worse, because he exhibited signs of weakness.  As a result, Azula also hated Zuko for showing any weakness, because she learned from the only role model she had, Ozai.  Zuko was undoubtedly abused by Ozai, but so was Azula.  While Zuko was physically abused and abandoned, Azula was emotionally manipulated into becoming a weapon for Ozai.  He used her to further his own interests, and never cared about actually doing what was best for her.  Katara and Sokka, unsurprisingly, weren't pitted against each other in the same way.  They have sibling squabbles, like any siblings do, but their relationship is a lot healthier because of the way their dad raised them.  And because there's no royal title for them to fight over, there's no pressure or competition between them to be better than the other one.  So Katara's able to have a much better relationship with her brother than Azula was able to.  And when talking about Azula, I've seen people try to say that she was evil from the beginning, because even in the flashbacks we see of her as a very young child, she has cruel tendencies where Zuko has nicer tendencies, but I think that's still very much her being a product of her environment.  Zuko tries to be cruel as well, but his mother reprimands him and tries to show him another path, which she's able to do because Zuko doesn't feel super close to his father.  Whereas Azula is so greatly praised and, in her mind, supported by her father, that she won't listen to her mother telling her anything different.  So, from the beginning, because Ozai chose to praise Azula and not Zuko, Azula never really had a choice in how to behave.  Sure, I guess she could have stood up to her father and said, no, this is wrong.  But what small child does that?  At that age, all you know is what your parents tell you.  And even if Azula was a bit more violent as a child, good parents and a loving household could have helped her work through that.  But instead, Ozai just encouraged and fostered that behavior.  It's difficult to know if any aspect of a person is nature or nurture, but I do think that if Azula had grown up in a more loving, supportive environment like Katara, she could have turned out much differently.  Like, Katara obviously went through a lot of trauma losing her mom, but she was still raised by her dad and Gran Gran and the rest of the Southern Water Tribe community, who all seem to have encouraged positive traits in her.  If you can't imagine Azula being raised to be nice, try imagining Katara being raised to be mean.  For example, imagine if she was raised by Hama.  If the only parental figure Katara had ever known was Hama, who raised her to be a bloodbender, do you think tiny five-year-old Katara would put her foot down and say, No, that's unethical.  I refuse to do it.  I highly doubt it.  If Hama was the only parent she had, the only one who fed her and took care of her, she would look up to her and want to earn her praise.  And in that alternate universe, we might have a bloodbending Katara determined to take out firebenders and exact revenge for Hama.  Now, that's not what happened, obviously, but that's because of the environment Katara grew up in.  And if there's anything these parallels between Azula and Katara can teach us, it's that the environment you grow up in can have a massive impact on who you are when you're older.  And the point of that is not to say that if you grow up with bad parents, you'll be a bad person, because that's not the case at all.  I think the point is just that it's important to realize why people behave a certain way so that you can offer them the support they need.  Like, Zuko is a great example of becoming a good person even when raised by terrible people, but that's because he had Iroh to believe in him and then later had Aang and the others to support him.  Azula never had an Iroh, and the friends that she had didn't and probably couldn't offer her a better path.  Katara isn't only good because of how she was raised, and Azula isn't only bad because of how she was raised, but it's important to recognize how someone's upbringings can drive them in a certain direction.  And that brings me to my second main point of comparison between Katara and Azula, how they dealt with the loss of their mothers.  The answer, unsurprisingly, relies a lot on how they were raised.  Katara is given the space to talk about her mother and her emotions, and so she does, and therefore is seen by a lot of viewers as a very emotional character.  I've seen people say that this is a negative aspect of Katara, like they're tired of Katara bringing up her mother all the time.  Even though Zuko does the exact same thing with his honor constantly, and everyone loves Zuko, I mean, I love Zuko too, but I think both him talking about his honor and Katara talking about her mother make a lot of sense.  In fact, Katara's ability to be very openly emotional about her mother is a really good, positive thing about her character.  It allows her to cope with the loss of her mother and express her emotions without bottling them up.  She's still traumatized, but she's dealing with it, and that allows her to heal and move on.  Azula, on the other hand, is the queen of bottling up her emotions.  Ozai did not like anyone expressing their emotions, and so Azula is never allowed to grieve the loss of her mother.  She's never allowed to talk about it or express any empathy for her mother, or even say that she misses her.  It's the complete opposite of Katara, and it hurts her immensely.  Unable to express her emotions, she never deals with that loss, and it eats away at her.  When her friends betray her, it begins an unraveling of her mental stability, because she's never gotten over her mother's disappearance.  She starts to think that everyone will leave, just like her mom.  So she banishes everyone and hallucinates seeing her mom, and ultimately she's defeated by Katara.  And only then, when she's lost everything, does she finally allow herself to cry and feel her emotions.  But by then, it's too late.  She bottled her emotions up for too long, and they destroyed her.  And now, all she can do is cry.  I think, writing-wise, it was a really interesting choice to have Azula lose to Katara instead of Zuko.  I remember when I first watched the show, I was a bit confused by that choice, because it was supposed to be this big showdown between Azula and Zuko.  But now, thinking back on it, it makes so much sense.  Azula being powered up by Sozin's comet, probably should have won, but she didn't.  She might have been more physically powerful in that moment, thanks to the comet, but mentally she was a lot weaker because she never processed the loss of her mother, which led to this whole downward spiral she had of not trusting anyone.  But Katara was calm when facing down Azula.  She had dealt with her trauma, and she knew exactly who she was and what she had to do.  In the end, Katara's ability to talk about and freely express her emotions helped her save the world, and Azula's inability to do the same was her downfall.  And a part of Katara dealing with her trauma wasn't only talking about it, but also confronting her mom's killer.  I've made a whole video about why that episode is so good, but in this context, it's important because Katara has the opportunity to become like Azula.  She has the opportunity to become the person Hama wanted her to be.  She could kill the person who killed her mother and become fueled by rage and hate.  But she chooses not to, not because she forgives the man who killed her mother, but because she doesn't want to become the type of person who kills a helpless old man in the street.  It's an important decision for her, and one that she's able to make because she's processed what happened to her mom and knows who she wants to be, rather than just being consumed by grief and rage.  I do wonder what Azula's path could have been like if she, likewise, had been given a path to becoming more like Katara, if she'd had an Uncle Iroh or someone to guide her in a better direction.  I think the beach episode with the Fire Nation kids shows that Azula wants to get along with people, she just doesn't really know how.  But regardless, as her story is, it's a really good contrast to Katara's character, showing how these two people from relatively similar backgrounds can grow up to become so very different.

So it's no surprise that, no matter how many times I watch the movie of the same name, I get emotional.\n\nThis is probably the most sentimental I've ever gotten in a video that wasn't about someone passing  away (i.e. our videos about Carrie Fisher). \n\nAlso, just a note but Hannah is played by Bex Taylor-Klaus, who is nonbinary themselves, but if I remember correctly, Hannah is not. If I'm wrong, absolutely tell me so! (Hannah is definitely not nonbinary in the book, which is probably why I felt so comfortable using she\/her pronouns, but I don't mind adjusting captions and adding a pinned comment if it's necessary.)\n\nShe's All Fat podcast episode with Julie Murphy (VERY fun, worth your time!): https:\/\/shesallfatpod.com\/pod\/s4e2\n\n#WithCaptions\n\n--\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting the Princess and the Scrivener on Patreon: https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/PrincessScrivener\n\n* THE PRINCESS * \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/paigetheprncss,\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/paigetheprncss,\nhttp:\/\/jmberries.tumblr.com, \nhttps:\/\/ko-fi.com\/princesspaige, \nhttps:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/princess_paige \nhttps:\/\/letterboxd.com\/prncsspaige\/\n\n* THE SCRIVENER * \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sarahthescrivnr,\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sarahthescrivnr\/,\nhttp:\/\/gildedbadger.tumblr.com, \nhttp:\/\/goodreads.com\/sarah_the_scrivnr,\nhttps:\/\/letterboxd.com\/sarahthescirvnr\/\n\n* P&S  * \nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PrincessScrivener,\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/PrncessScrivnr,\nhttps:\/\/princessscrivener.tumblr.com\/","publish_date":"2020-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":["\"Dumplin\"","\"Dumplin movie\"","\"Dumplin book\"","julie murphy","danielle macdonald","maddie ballio","willowdean dickson","jennifer aniston","\"dumplin 2018\"","fatphobia","fat liberation","bex taylor-klaus","\"dumplin\"","dolly parton","netflix movies","dumplin movie review","dumplin book review","dumplin book movie","princess and the scrivener","princess and the scrivener review","willowdean and bo","willowdean from dumplin","julie murphy dumplin","dumplin"],"length":882,"views":3330,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xMXaLxuyHlw\/sddefault.jpg","yt_channel_id":"UCtilV9LOwqBXw_xMQTk0JZA","transcripts":"So we're watching Dumplin'.  And yeah, the shirt that Willowdean is wearing, I have that shirt.  I have that exact shirt.  This movie was made for me.  Me and me alone.  Okay, bye.  So unlike Willowdean, a cute boy that likes me did not give me these sunglasses for my birthday.  But I was listening to the book and completely forgot that that's what Bo does.  And as I was listening to the part for her birthday, I was wearing red heart-shaped sunglasses.  Hello, everybody.  Princess here.  And I'm actually not talking about Chris Evans for once.  Y'all have been not necessarily hounding me, but certainly I felt like there was always a level of expectation that I was going to make a review of the movie Dumplin' because not only am I, you know, a fat content creator on the internet, but also I read Dumplin' a couple years ago and did a book review of that as well.  And also, like, if you follow me on any social media, you know just how much I love Julie Murphy.  I just, like, had a lot of things happening around the time that the movie initially came out on Netflix, and then I had, like, a million other ideas, including Chris Travaganza.  That's why it took me so long to actually do this review.  I thought again about doing this review, but I hadn't read the book in so long.  And when Sarah and I had talked about the book, she started talking about these things that, like, I could not recall at all.  And I just wanted a refresher on the book before I dove into this movie review.  And then, of course, I also had to rewatch the movie to remind myself of what's in that as well.  The timing had to work out perfectly for all of this to happen.  So going into the movie, I was really excited.  I do really love this movie for a lot of very personal reasons.  Watching the movie for this review is like the fourth time that I viewed it, and I still cry at certain points because there are just some very poignant moments that like hit home with me.  I mean, including, you know, in the first... 6 minutes of the movie, Willowdean is wearing this very shirt.  Dumplin' as a story and Julie Murphy as an author mean a lot to me.  I just want you to know, like, what level of enthusiasm and emotional vulnerability I'm going into this video with.  I don't know how else to say what I felt about the movie, except that I felt seen.  If you were to ask me if I liked the book or the movie better, I don't know if I could answer.  I like them both in different ways for different reasons.  I don't think that they tell the same character journey.  Book Willowdean is trying to figure out who she is in the context of the relationship she's conducting, and Movie Willowdean is much more concerned with trying to figure out how to live without her Aunt Lucy.  Aunt Lucy is to Willowdean as, honestly, Julie Murphy is to me.  So that's why I'm getting worked up.  I remember when Dumplin' the book came out and I was like, okay, it's just about a fat girl that enters a beauty pageant.  And I didn't want to read it.  There was like an irrational fear of seeing myself on a page and having to like reconcile knowing that I was being represented a fat character.  I definitely had some fatphobic tendencies that were ingrained that I had to unlearn.  Dumplin' really helped me, like, figure out how to talk about certain things without feeling ashamed or without feeling like I was pushing myself into a group I didn't want to be in, because this group that I have pushed myself into now is full of vibrant, wonderful, beautiful people, and I regret having those feelings, but also don't.  If I had never had those feelings, I wouldn't know to grow past them.  Because the movie came out after the book, obviously, it didn't like push me in any direction because I had already been put in that direction that I needed to be in.  The movie just like reinforced those feelings of validity.  Let's try to stop talking about emotions and go into content.  says the Enneagram Type 5.  In case you don't know what Dumplin' is about at all, it's about a young fat girl whose mother is a former pageant queen and runs a pageant in Texas.  Her late aunt Lucy is her only, like, positive fat role model.  And in the wake of Lucy's passing, she and her mom are trying to reconcile their relationship, but also they're trying to go through all of Lucy's belongings, and in doing so, Willowdean finds an application for the pageant that Lucy had started to fill out and never submitted.  And she decides then and there that she's going to enter the pageant partially for Lucy and partially to also try to dismantle the establishment of the the pageant, but that kind of falls apart.  It's not just like Julie Murphy just forgot about it, it's like the characters focus their energies elsewhere.  It doesn't end up being about the pageant, it ends up being about the group of girls that she inevitably joins, or they just kind of like surround her, and then they all make each other better.  The unfortunate thing about the movie is that it kind of dwindles.  her friend group down from like four girls to three, which doesn't sound like a lot, but the one girl that they cut is pretty important, I think.  And I don't want to make excuses for excluding a disabled or disfigured character from a story that they are actually canonically a part of.  But I will say that initially the rights to the movie were picked up by Disney, and then Disney just decided they didn't want to make Dumplin' and instead put their time and money into these god-awful remakes.  And Julie Murphy actually spoke a little bit on this topic on the She's All Fat podcast.  I'll link the episode in the description below.  Basically, Jennifer Aniston and a few other producers bought the rights from Disney and made it independently, and then Netflix just picked it up for distribution.  A group of people wanted to see a movie starring a fat girl.  they made it happen.  I think from here I'm just gonna go into pros and cons.  I love the movie.  Daniel McDonald does such a wonderful job with Willowdean, but the star of the movie is really Maddie Ballio?  I just have to say Millie Mitchell-Chuck is a perfect sunshine queen.  Well, I made yours yellow because you remind me of sunshine, so... She deserved to win the pageant, but the fact that she doesn't is, it's fine.  She beats out all these skinny girls and is the first runner-up because she is talented and smiley and beautiful and amazing and... I already said talented, but I want to say it again.  For what the cast is, I do really like them.  I don't remember the guy's name that plays Belle, but he's like really cute.  Also, I'm really glad that this was made by an independent company or just like independently because nobody made him shave his arms.  The flashbacks with Lucy are... so special and inherently meaningful, and they show Lucy wearing a bathing suit, and they show Lucy dancing with Willowdean, and just like basically raising her to be a woman that isn't ashamed of what she looks like.  It's not something that a lot of young fat people get.  Watching this movie is emotional for me on a personal level, but also thinking about other people seeing it and having a reaction that's even similar to mine makes me so happy that I cry.  Lucy's dolly themed room that Willowdean goes into for comfort.  Knowing that that room is all about community and comfort and safety makes that addition worth it, for sure.  The chemistry between Willowdean and Belle is tangible.  It's tangible in the book too, but because there's so much less of Beau in this movie, it has to be, like, cranked up to really come across to the audience, and it does.  I sat there, like, squealing because he's just adorable and very clearly really likes her.  From start to finish, the scene where they go to dolly night at the hideout, always always makes me emotional.  No wonder your Aunt Lucy never took you here.  Lucy who?  Lucy Dixon.  She's good people.  I cried in the car listening to the book.  I cried watching the movie again.  I can't tell you if I cried the first time that I read the book because it's been so long that I just don't remember, but it's very likely.  Okay, I'm like hurting my head trying to remember another like good pro.  to mention that isn't just, oh I liked this thing.  So I'm just gonna move into the cons.  I think Beau has his own very emotional journey to take in the book.  He has a lot of bad decisions to make up for in the book that are not ever touched in the movie.  To be fair, the book isn't about Beau's journey whatsoever.  We don't really get anything super deep and emotional with Beau.  We don't get anything about him suddenly showing up at Willowdean's school.  And that freaking her out, we don't get anything about Willowdean being so uncomfortable working with him when she messes up their relationship that she leaves Harpies and goes to work at the Chili Bowl and is miserable and making less money and only stays there because she can't fathom going to face Beau again.  I know that that is not the point of the story, but I think it plays very heavily into Willowdean learning about who she is.  We couldn't have the red sunglasses?  There's no Mitch in this movie, and that's okay.  It's not necessarily a con in the way of, like, I hated the movie because of it or anything.  He is kind of Willowdean's only friend for a while.  There is almost nothing in the movie in the way of Lucy and Rosie.  There's, you know, a few brief mentions of how they were both fat as kids.  It is harder for big girls.  I was one, I know!  And Rosie lost the weight and became a pageant queen and Lucy never did.  And Rosie seems to think that Lucy's weight had to do with why she passed away so young.  You were always so focused on her weight.  You never even really got to know who she was.  Rosie coming to terms with her broken relationship with her sister after Lucy has passed away is what helps Rosie realize that she needs to fix her relationship with Willowdean in order for her own daughter to be happy.  So it's not that I mind that Lee is the one that makes a dress for Willowdean, but in the book, Rosie finds a dress for Willowdean or helps Willowdean find a dress and says that she won't approve it because of how it sits on Willowdean's body, even though Willowdean is comfortable and she likes the dress and she honestly likes how she looks in it.  I feel like that could have made the movie a little bit stronger and really wouldn't have added more than five minutes to the whole runtime.  And I think it could have earned it.  There's just a little bit more like character development with Rosie in the book.  So Hannah Perez in the book is a woman of color, and she's queer, also has big buck teeth that she gets made fun of for.  And there's a conversation between Willowdean and Hannah at a sleepover at Millie's house.  Willowdean says, Hannah, I want to ask you a question.  It's rude, but I'm not asking to be rude.  Shoot, she says.  Why haven't you ever gotten your teeth fixed?  Why should I have  to?\".  she retorts immediately.  Her voice softens as she adds, plus it's expensive.  You're right, I say.  You shouldn't have to.  In the movie, Hannah is very funny, but I think they also could have and probably should have made more choices.  And to be very honest, I would be more satisfied with how little Beau is in this movie if Hannah had been a bigger part.  And speaking of Hannah, along with Hannah comes a character named Amanda from the book who wears orthopedic shoes, and this is why I think you could read it as disfigurement even though it's not spoken of as a disfigurement in the book.  Essentially she's either disabled or disfigured or both maybe.  She and Millie get along because they live their lives exactly how they need to according to their own statutes and rules and their own personalities.  And I recognize that to some level that does give them quite a bit of privilege.  Amanda, Hannah, and the queer people at the hideout open Willowdean up and make her a better person just by being themselves, essentially.  They teach her how to be herself by being their own people.  The fact that like half of this is missing.  I don't want to say it diminishes the movie or makes it not worth watching because, I mean, I've seen it four times and I cry every time.  I just think that it definitely could have made the movie stronger than it already is.  The movie functions well as a story about a young fat girl learning to cope with the death of her only fat mentor, the only person that has ever supported her as a fat person.  Ellen even goes far enough to say, I never thought of you as fat.  Even though she is, and it's not offensive that she is.  She shouldn't be ashamed of it.  She shouldn't have to fix it.  The book does more work.  It has more room to do the work.  But there are certain things that I think it could have had the room to do.  if they move some things around.  Or if Disney had just made the damn movie in the first place.  Overall, I love the book and I love the movie.  They both make me emotional.  They both call me out on some bullshit that I used to do.

Alright, look, everyone knows that Zuko has one of the best redemption arcs ever.  I don't think I have to convince anyone of that.  At this point, he's basically the blueprint for a good redemption arc.  So today, all I want to do is go through the three reasons I think that Zuko's redemption arc succeeds where others fail.  There is a whole lot of stuff that makes his story so interesting, and I could go on and on about it forever.  But instead of doing that, I've done my best to boil it down to just three key reasons that I think his arc works so well.  Number one, his redemption is not linear.  What I mean by that is that Zuko's path doesn't just go straight from bad to good.  His path in Book Two leads you to believe that that's what could be happening.  When he goes to Ba Sing Se with his uncle to be safe from the Fire Nation, he's largely given up on hunting the Avatar, so it seems like he's improving.  But when it turns out that the avatar is in Ba Sing Se, he's right back on his avatar hunting, since he clearly never got over it.  But when his uncle confronts him when he's trying to steal Appa, he does end up doing the right thing and setting Appa free.  So even though there was a little hiccup on his journey to becoming good, he does seem to be on a good path now.  He goes through some physical symptoms, essentially sweating out his badness, but then wakes up happy and ready to live a chill life with his uncle at a tea shop.  At this point, it seems like Zuko has changed for good.  He's much different than the person he started out as, and the show leads you to believe he's good now.  But when Azula presents him with the opportunity to throw it all away and instead return to the Fire Nation and get everything he used to want, he ends up going back on his progress and joins Azula.  I think when I first watched the show a bunch of years ago, I was genuinely very shocked by the moment when Zuko chooses to join Azula.  You know it's a good scene because of its emotional impact, because of how it leads you one way but then jerks you another way.  It gets you to root for Zuko, to really want something better for Zuko, and then nope, it takes it all away.  I think for the viewer, that makes for a very emotional and memorable moment.  Which is great storytelling on its own, but what makes it even better is how it really does make sense for Zuko.  For years, he's been searching for the Avatar.  For years, he's wanted nothing more than to go back to the Fire Nation, be forgiven by his father, and get his honor back.  Releasing Appa was a good step, working at the tea shop with his uncle was a good step, but it wasn't enough to undo what was a very deeply ingrained idea in Zuko's head, that maybe he could go back home and things could go back to normal.  If he had to decided to join Aang at this moment, I don't think his redemption arc would be nearly as loved as it is today.  It would've felt just pretty easy, like.  all he needed was a little encouragement and he changed his entire worldview.  The fact that he betrays his uncle and goes back on the progress he made was necessary for him to really earn his redemption.  And it's realistic.  For most people, growth is not linear.  In any aspect of your life, you'll probably mess up before you get it right.  You'll probably slip up even when you want to do better.  Not only is Zuko's arc compelling, but it's relatable, too.  And it's Zuko's betrayal at Ba Sing Se that leads me into my next point.  Number two, Zuko's story comes full circle.  After Ba Sing Se, Zuko returns to the Fire Nation and gets everything he ever wanted.  He has his honor back, he sits in on war meetings, he has a girlfriend.  Everything he was fighting for for years is suddenly real.  That is absolutely critical to his development, because if he never went back to the Fire Nation, there would always be those unresolved questions in the back of his mind.  What if he could go back?  What if things could return to normal?  What if his father could love him?  Zuko needed to return to be able to get a definitive answer to those things.  He needed to see that the life he was yearning for was not one that he actually wanted.  He was chasing after a dream of the past, of an idea of what he hypothetically thought could exist.  But in reality, the normal that he could return to was not what he imagined it to be.  The thing he had been chasing did not exist, and so that leads to a lot of internal anguish for him.  When he's back in the Fire Nation, we see him being unhappy, and we even get a whole episode of him working through his emotions with Azula, Mei, and Ty Lee, where he realizes that despite having everything he ever wanted, he's angrier than ever.  Confusion about who he is and what he really wants has always been a core part of his character, so of course he's not able to easily sift through his emotions and see what he wants.  But over time, he gets there, and the last straw seems to be the fact that he finally comes full circle to the moment that got him banished in the first place.  Years ago, he sat in on a war meeting, but when he heard about a plan to knowingly sacrifice Fire Nation troops, he spoke out against it.  That's what led to his father challenging him to an Agni Kai, giving him his scar, and banishing him.  So this time, he's invited to a war meeting, something horrible is proposed.  This time, it's his father saying he's going to wipe out the Earth Kingdom.  But unlike last time, Zuko says nothing.  He's the perfect prince.  He's had the chance to come back and do it all again the way he thought he should have before.  And that, finally, is what gives him clarity.  He knows that using Sozin's Comet to wipe out everyone is wrong.  He knows that speaking out against that plan is the right thing to do, which means that maybe he was never meant to be the perfect prince.  Maybe he should have spoken out before.  Maybe he wasn't in the wrong, but in fact his father was in the wrong for attacking him.  It's a pivotal moment that creates a domino effect in Zuko's mind, allowing him to see how awful Ozai has been, both in his mistreatment of Zuko and in his quest for world domination.  I think there's something very poetic about the series coming full circle with Zuko in the war meeting, but it also just makes so much sense for his character.  Of course, the only thing that could fully turn him against his dad is him getting another chance to be the perfect prince and realizing that that isn't who he is.  At the same time, even back in the Fire Nation, he continues to be manipulated by Azula when she tells Ozai that Zuko is the one who killed Aang, even though Zuko knows Aang is still alive.  That puts even more pressure on him to think about who he is and what he wants.  Because he could stay and fight and blame Azula and accept any punishment from his father.  Season 1 Zuko might have thought that that would be the honorable thing to do.  But he sees now that the honorable thing is for him to be true to himself, and to leave so that he can help Aang defeat the Fire Lord.  Even at home, Zuko is manipulated and in danger.  And that's not the life he wants for himself.  He wants to live a life where he does what is right, and not just what his father wants of him.  That's the best possible way for Zuko to have to come to that realization, and it leads to a heart-wrenching confrontation with his father when he leaves and is finally able to tell him off.  I love that scene so much, and I love that you can hear the emotion in Zuko's voice when he's finally able to say the things he's been too afraid to admit.  How can you possibly justify a duel with a child?  It was cruel!  And it was wrong!  But after that, after Zuko has come to this realization and decided what side he wants to be on, that's what brings us to the next part of his redemption arc.  Number three, he knows that people will hate him, and he accepts that without getting defensive.  When Zuko tells off his dad, he's talking about the people outside of the Fire Nation, and he says, They hate us, and we deserve it.  That we deserve it part is very important.  Zuko's not here to say, not all Fire Nation people.  He realizes how horrible the Fire Nation has been, and he rightfully believes that the hatred of them, including him, is justified.  He could have taken a different approach to this.  He could have said, they hate you, the Fire Lord, because they don't know the real Fire Nation.  He could have shifted the responsibility off of himself and tried to defend aspects of the Fire Nation while still admitting that what the Fire Nation was currently doing was wrong.  People do this all the time when they don't want to accept responsibility for the harm they've done or the harm they've been complicit in.  It's vital to Zuko's redemption arc that he accepts that the hatred of the Fire Nation is justified.  That's him accepting responsibility for his role in the war, rather than him trying to say, well, I'm good now, so they have no reason to hate me.  He knows that he can't erase his past and that people are going to hate him, and he accepts that.  We see this more in depth once he goes to join Aang and the others.  He admits that he's done horrible things and apologizes, but obviously they still don't trust him.  Aang straight up says, We'll never let you join us.  This would make it really easy for Zuko to hate them.  He could easily get defensive and think something along the lines of, well, I'm good now, and I said I'm sorry, and they still won't trust me, so they don't deserve my help.  I've seen this reaction from people a lot.  They do or say something really bad or rightfully hated for it, but then they give a single apology and expect all to be forgiven.  So when they're still hated, they dig their heels in even further to the bad thing that they said or did.  They go, well, I tried to be good, but you all were mean to me, so now I'm bad again.  You did this, not me.  When in reality, people should want to do good just because it's the right thing to do.  Not because people will be nice to them or praise them for it.  If you really do want to be good, you'll continue to be good even when people are mean to you or hate you or spray you with water and refuse to even take you prisoner.  So the fact that Zuko doesn't get defensive, that he sticks around and tries to help them anyway, that shows the viewer that he really has changed.  On the flip side, the writers could have had Aang accept Zuko right away.  After all, Aang's whole thing is being a pacifist and wanting to find the good in people.  so it would be in character for him to want to accept Zuko.  Plus, since Appa likes Zuko and Aang trusts Appa so much, it really would just make sense if Aang was like, okay Zuko, come join our group, thanks for being good now.  But Aang had to say no at first because Zuko needed some pushback to really challenge his dedication to being good.  And writing-wise, it's believable that Aang would listen to Katara and Sokka's concerns and side with them, because he wants to trust their instincts.  And then, of course, Zuko digs himself into an even deeper hole by accidentally burning Toph.  Which is a heartbreaking scene, because you know that Zuko didn't intentionally hurt Toph, but you can also see why Toph wouldn't trust him after that.  The key thing here, though, is that even after that, Zuko never gets mad at Toph for sneaking up on him or for hating him.  He only gets mad at himself for hurting her.  This was, again, another chance for Zuko to shift the responsibility for his actions elsewhere.  He could've blamed Toph.  He could've gotten mad at all of them and stormed off.  But he doesn't.  He sits with his mistakes and tries to do better.  And in a really clever way, that incident ends up being the thing that convinces Aang that Zuko should be his firebending teacher.  Zuko admits that he needs to learn to control his firebending better so that he doesn't hurt people, which is exactly what Aang has been worried about since he first tried firebending.  On top of all of that, after Zuko joins their group, he continues to put in the work to get the others to trust him, first by going on a mission with Aang to discover the original source of firebending, then by helping Sokka free his dad from prison, then by helping Katara confront her mother's killer.  He really puts in the work to get them to trust him.  rather than just expecting them to trust him solely because he says he's good now.  Zuko's redemption arc feels so satisfying because he has to earn it.  He's not easily accepted by the gang, and he never gets defensive about that.  He does the work to be accepted, and never gets mad at them for hating him because he knows that based on his past actions, he deserves it.  It's both a well-written story and a blueprint for how anyone can try to be good once they realize that they're on the wrong side.  There's a whole lot of other stuff that goes into Zuko's redemption arc, but I think those are the main three things.  His redemption isn't linear, he gets everything he wanted when he comes full circle, and he accepts that people will hate him without getting defensive.  This isn't the only way to write a redemption arc, but it is definitely a very good way.  If you liked this video, be sure to subscribe so that you don't miss any future uploads.

Today, I'm going to discuss why I think Zuko's redemption arc in Avatar: The Last Airbender is so successful. There are three key reasons why his story works so well. \n\nFirstly, his redemption is not linear. Zuko's path doesn't just go straight from bad to good. He has setbacks and moments where he reverts to his old ways, making his eventual change more believable and satisfying. This is a realistic portrayal of growth and change, as most people don't change overnight. \n\nSecondly, Zuko's story comes full circle. He returns to the Fire Nation and gets everything he ever wanted, but it's not what he expected.

Today, I'm going to discuss why I think Zuko's redemption arc in Avatar: The Last Airbender is so successful. There are three key reasons why his story works so well. \n\nFirstly, his redemption is not linear. Zuko's path doesn't just go straight from bad to good. He has setbacks and moments where he reverts to his old ways, making his eventual change more believable and satisfying. This is a realistic portrayal of growth and change, as most people don't change overnight. \n\nSecondly, Zuko's story comes full circle. He returns to the Fire Nation and gets everything he ever wanted, but it's not what he expected.

You can look at the playlist on this channel for the book if you want to go back and see the other episodes.  Right now we're picking up with chapter three, which is called Feeling the Fear and Doing It Anyway.  It's a very dense chapter and there's a lot in here, so this is definitely going to be broken up between more than one video.  So let us begin.  Chapter three, feeling the fear and doing it anyway.  There's something you need to know from the start of this journey.  Your fear is still going to be with you and may even increase as you move forward on this journey to discover the truth about your gender identity.  In any good story, the main character usually has reluctance to take on whatever challenge they're being faced with.  How many times in Lord of the Rings did Frodo say he wasn't meant for this type of adventure?  How many times in The Hunger Games did Katniss throw down her bow and arrow, both literally and figuratively, and try to walk away from her destiny?  Think of your fears as unwanted guests in your home.  They aren't leaving anytime soon, so you need to come up with a plan to deal with them.  The more you get to know them, the more you'll know what to do about them.  By examining the root of your fears, you'll shift from feeling as if they are controlling you to you feeling more in control of them.  This mastery comes from having awareness and understanding of your fear and then using this knowledge to break its hold over you.  This chapter will provide you with tools to keep your fears from paralyzing you as you move closer to the truth about your gender identity.  Learning to work together with your fear.  What follows is a visualization exercise to help you gain a different perspective on the role of fear in your life.  Through this shift, you'll learn how to work together with this fear as opposed to letting it overpower and paralyze you.  Step one, introducing your bodyguard.  Picture someone you would like to have as your very own personal bodyguard to have by your side when you're feeling threatened and unsafe.  For example, I imagine that my bodyguard is Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules from Pulp Fiction.  What does yours look like?  What's their name?  They can be human, animal, mythological, whatever you most connect with.  This is a chance for you to write it down.  Step two, why do you have a bodyguard?  First of all, what's the name of your bodyguard?  Write it down.  Imagine that name of bodyguard has been with you since you were born.  It's inevitable that we will encounter threats in our life, and this bodyguard is there as a psychological defense to keep us safe.  As you move through your childhood and adolescence, your bodyguard is highly alert to what it is that makes you feel hurt, sad, or afraid.  Therefore, they're going to do whatever it takes to keep you from feeling that way.  In theory, this probably sounds great.  Who doesn't want to avoid those feelings?  But the problem is that your bodyguard is hypervigilant.  They take the job of protecting you very seriously.  So even though your bodyguard means well, there's a downside to this, uh... so-called overprotection.  Anytime someone is overprotected, they risk being unable to experience life to the fullest, stunted growth, and hiding truths from themselves.  For example, your bodyguard saw you pry open your trunk of secrets on page 16, their ears perked up as they heard your hidden thoughts and feelings about your gender identity rustling around in there.  They looked up and saw you crouched over the trunk, reaching your hand in and beginning to lift that part of you out, hoping they could get to it before it was too late.  Your bodyguard sprinted toward you, bellowing out to your trunk.  You there, close your lid and don't open it ever again.  I won't allow you to harm my human.  In the past, your bodyguard has seen what it's like.  When you tried to let that part of you out, they didn't like what they saw happen to you, not one bit.  So they grabbed that part of you and put it in the trunk, hoping it was for good.  Anytime your bodyguard thought someone, maybe even you, was getting too close to that trunk, for comfort, they would pull out a weapon, a gun, a knife, nunchucks, whatever they thought might work.  Your bodyguard's weapon is actually your fear.  Your bodyguard knows just what to say while holding up that weapon.  Anything that will keep you from getting closer to that trunk.  Quote, you know I hate to do this, but I can't allow you to go into that trunk.  Don't you remember how you felt before I locked all that stuff up in there?  Do you want to be judged, hurt, cast out?  Let me remind you what will happen if you take that out of the trunk.  Your bodyguard is really only trying to protect you and keep you from harm.  but your bodyguard does not know what actually constitutes a real threat.  This means that fear, in other words, your bodyguard, in other words, yourself, can mislead you into believing things.  They may not actually be true.  That may not actually be true.  Additionally, even if there are actual threats for you and your bodyguard to reckon with, you have the right to choose self-actualization over continued repression.  All right, now we're going to go through an exercise in which you are going to create a relationship with your bodyguard.  It might take a while for you to recognize when your bodyguard is making their presence known.  However, once you are able to do this, you can develop the habit of starting a dialogue with them whenever your fear surfaces.  Here are some ways you can do that.  Thank them for being there for you all this time.  Remind them that you know this is going to be scary, but you can get through this together.  Ask them to continue to let you know when they think you are in danger, because this can help you be more vigilant and cautious.  Encourage them to understand your point of view and listen to their point of view as well.  Here's an example of how this can work.  All right, the scene is Dara hanging out in their office, deep in thought.  Dara says to themself, I think I'm ready to get a big tattoo on my right forearm.  It's something that I've always admired on others, and I've imagined it on myself and really like the thought of it.  Jules enters the room.  Hey, Dara, I couldn't help but notice your line of thinking just now.  And as your bodyguard, I have to say I'm getting a bit concerned about it.  Dara.  Hey, Jules, what's up?  What do you mean?  Jules.  Well, I mean, think about it.  When you were a kid, you would do some, let's say, not so feminine things with your friends.  And most of the time you got made fun for it.  Dara.  Yeah, I remember that.  Like when I would try to play football at recess with the guys, how I'd want to be Han Solo instead of Princess Leia, how I liked having short hair and wore jeans and t-shirts all the time.  Jules, right, do you remember feeling so awkward and weird and isolated?  I hated to see you go through that.  That's when I told those not-so-feminine feelings of yours to F off because I didn't want to see you hurt  anymore.\".  dara so you see me getting this tattoo as being a not so feminine thing.  huh jules not just yes but hell yes i'm not saying i don't think it's a true expression of who you are or that it wouldn't be cool as um hell.  i'm not sure how much i can curse on youtube without it being a problem.  cool as hell to have it.  But think about the judgment, the looks, the snickering.  You'd be labeled as being butchy or a wannabe guy, you know?  Dara, I can definitely see why you are worried about this, Jules.  But don't forget, I'm 40 years old now, not eight.  I really do think I'm ready for a step like this.  Even, and even if those things happen, I don't know if I really care anymore.  Jules, swinging his gun around, stomping his feet.  Dara, you're killing me here.  I really do hear what you're saying, and I'm almost convinced that I might be acting overly protective right now, but it just makes me so nervous.  I don't want to see you get hurt, child.  Dara, you're awesome, Jules.  I'm so lucky to have you on my side.  Look, let's find a way to do this nice and slow, so you can feel a little more relaxed about this.  I will always need you to be there to watch out for me.  Jules, aw, chuckles.  Okay, I'm open to trying that idea now.  Now, how about we go grab a big kahuna burger?  All this serious talk has got me starving.  The next time one of your top fears arises, take the time to dialogue with your bodyguard to learn more about the roots of your fear.  That's one of my favorite chapters, I must say.  And it's one that I usually read at book signings and gatherings and things like that.  So, oh, the chapter is not over, but that's one of my favorite parts of this chapter.  So go ahead and take some time to think about how you can start dialoguing with your bodyguard.  And next we're gonna pick up with this chapter.  The next portion is called setting appointment times with your fears.  Um, lovely to, uh, have you here listening to my book and feel free to list any comments about how this maybe has been helping you.  And, oh, by the way, at the end, you're going to see how you can get a copy of the book as a PDF for only a dollar 99.  So hold on one second.  It's coming up.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello, I'm Dara Hoffman Fox, and I'm reading my book, \"You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.\" Today, we're discussing Chapter 3, \"Feeling the Fear and Doing It Anyway.\" \n\nYour fear will be with you throughout this journey, and it's essential to understand and work with it.

We are currently in chapter three, which is called Feeling the Fear and Doing It Anyway.  So this is now the second part of chapter three, which continues to explore different things you can do to help acknowledge and manage your fears during your gender identity journey.  This next suggestion is called setting appointment times with your fears.  If you find yourself constantly interrupted by your fear list, which was two videos ago, then this exercise is for you.  Fears often come up without any warning in the middle of your workday while you're hanging out with your partner, kids, or pets, or in the middle of a test at school.  They can also slowly seep into your mind when you are more relaxed and therefore more vulnerable when you're driving, showering, doing yoga, or when you're trying to sleep.  This exercise will help you create a plan for keeping your fears from overwhelming you and interrupting your life.  You'll learn to do this by setting appointment times with your fears.  By doing so, you gain control of your fears instead of letting them control you.  When you set boundaries with your fears, you're saying to them, I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of something right now.  You'll have to make an appointment and I'll get back to you then.  Go ahead, give this a try.  Step one, so get your paper and pen out.  There's gonna be several things to write down here.  When do they arrive?  Think about a typical day.  Are there certain times of day when your fears come up?  Are there certain situations that trigger them?  Step two, where can you meet them?  Now, imagine places where you can spend time with these fears.  This could be your car, a room in your home, somewhere out in nature, at a cafe, the gym, and so on.  Step three, how long will you meet with them?  Decide on a period of time you're going to set aside for these appointments with your fears.  Start with a small number such as five or 10 minutes and increase from there as you get the hang of this.  So here I have where you would write down number of minutes.  Step four, how many times per day?  How many times a day will you set these appointments?  Eventually you may even be able to change this to how many times per week.  So now you write down how many times per day.  Step five, where will you keep track of your appointments?  What is your favorite method of keeping track of things?  This could be a notebook or on your phone or your computer.  So write that down.  Step six, scheduling your appointments.  During your day, whenever a fear comes up, if it is not during one of your designated appointment times to spend with your fears, jot it down in the log you identified in step five, which is where are you going to keep track of your appointments?  Give yourself permission to let be meeting with it later.  Step seven, self-care before the appointment.  When your next year appointment arrives, go to one of the places you listed under step two, choose an activity from your self-care worksheet to do at the beginning of the appointment.  Do the same activity each time as this will create a comforting and grounding ritual.  Which self-care activity did you choose?  Step eight, start the clock.  Set a timer such as a watch, a phone, or something on your computer for how many minutes you have scheduled the appointment for.  Step nine, let the appointment begin.  Take a deep breath and say out loud or silently, so fear what brings you in today.  Then totally immerse yourself in the dialogue.  During the meeting, you can dialogue out loud, journal, scream, stomp around, punch the air, dance, laugh in fear's face, video or audio.  record yourself, draw, sing about it, immerse yourself into the experience.  Don't stop until your timer goes off.  Take another deep breath and say, well, thanks for coming, fear.  See you at our next appointment.  Step 10, self-care after your appointment.  Choose a post-appointment self-care activity.  This can be the same or different from the one at the beginning.  Again, do the same one every time so as to signify to yourself that this appointment is over and you can return to your life.  Which self-care activity did you choose?  Start paying attention to when your fears make themselves known, get into the habit of keeping track of them to tend to later, and create a ritual for when you will be spending quality time with these fears.  This will reduce the amount of distraction they create in your life and put you in the driver's seat as to when they will be addressed.  So that's it for that exercise.  In the next video, we're going to talk more about how you can take a positive approach.  I'll see you then.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello, I'm Dara Hoffman Fox, and I'm continuing to read from my book, You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.
