Hello, hello! Today I am doing another collab with a friend of mine.  This is Lolo from Sitting Pretty. Hey everyone!  I'm so freaking excited for us to finally do a collab together.  For the people who don't know who you are, tell them what you do on your channel and like what other social medias you're making videos on. Awesome, so what's up everyone?  It's your girl Lolo here from Sitting Pretty.  I have my YouTube channel where I create lifestyle content with a disability spin, and I talk about everything from dating with a disability, as you know, things not to say to people with disabilities, and just the whole gamut of Pretty much educating people, able-bodied and disabled-bodied, on what disability lifestyle looks like from all different angles.  And I also model for Tommy Hilfiger Adaptive and so many other brands that I've also worked with.  And I do public speaking and I act. My movie, can I plug my movie? So my movie that I star in, I am what, now this is what they told me.  I am the first black woman with a disability to star in a feature film.  Yes.  That part, the movie is called Give Me Liberty.  It comes to theaters August 23rd.  So please make sure you check your local listings and get your ticket and support content that involves disabled talent.  That's amazing.  Yes, it's literally a really great film.  It premiered at Sundance and the Cannes Film Festival, which are like the two biggest, most prestigious film festivals in Hollywood, in the world.  And yeah, so I do that.  And of course, follow me on Instagram at itslololove, I-T-S-L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E.  And you'll find all kinds of other content there as well. Yay!  Oh my god, it comes out the day after my birthday. Shut the front door! Girl, that's why I was like, that's awesome!  Birthday present to me!  Yes! Wow, disabled women of color!  Yes!  Oh my god, I'm so excited.  I'm hyped, I'm hyped about it. Alright, so today we are going to be talking about being ambulatory wheelchair users.  Yes.  More specifically, being chronically ill and wheelchair users. Yes. Answering the question, why, how, when we started using wheelchairs to accommodate our chronic illnesses. Yes. so do you want to talk about yourself like what was your experience like diagnosis and like when?  when did you decide to start using a wheelchair?  why like go ahead and just give me like the 411 on you. okay so i was diagnosed with als when i was 14. at the time uh throughout high school I used leg braces that helped lift my feet because by that time my legs started to weaken because ALS is a neurological muscular disease that affects the nerves in your back that go to your muscles to tell your muscles to move.  So over time, your muscles become weaker and you lose muscle mass.  So upon my diagnosis, that was kind of the, the first thing was my right arm.  went completely limp, and then my legs started to be affected.  So, by the time it was time to move to LA to go to college, cause originally I'm from Northern California, I needed to figure out how I was gonna get to class.  And I knew the leg braces were not gonna get me to class in time.  The college campus is like three times bigger than my high school campus back home.  So I was like, okay, I'm gonna have to start using a wheelchair.  And I just made the decision based on what my needs were in order to get through my day.  I didn't, it didn't even cross my mind of anything socially.  what the issue could be if, you know, would I get bullied for using a wheelchair?  Would I be looked at different because I use a wheelchair?  Literally, my thought process was, I have to get to class, I'm in college, how am I gonna get there?  I gotta use a wheelchair, I have no other choice, and that's kind of when using the chair started, and that's pretty much how I've gone these past 13 years as a wheelchair user throughout my life.  I look at it like I have to get from point A to point B, I'm gonna have to use my chair. Yeah, I was just wondering, so with like muscle difficulties specifically with ALS, so is what's happening, is it painful or is it that it's not functioning for you in order to like move forward? Um, it's a little bit of both.  It's a little bit of both.  It's painful in the sense of when I overexert myself, um, that's when the pain will start to kick in.  Um, it's, it's painful because like, for instance, like my back is hurting right now.  But it's because I have a slight bit of scoliosis because the muscles in my back aren't holding my spine in the place that it needs to be.  So it will cause me to have pain that way.  So it's a little bit of both.  And then, you know, even my legs, they work because I'm able to walk around in smaller spaces or short distances.  But... You know, it's... You have an effect at gait. Exactly. And for gait, for anyone who doesn't know, gait is a word that just means how you're walking. Yeah. And it would affect your gait.  Maybe, like, you move a little bit slower. And like that, cause like there's no blood up here. Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So I move slower.  I like to call it, like, the penguin walk.  I do, like, the left-right, left-right thing.  And I don't necessarily, like... Bend my legs at the knees.  It's more so like keeping my legs straight and just going like back and forth back and forth.  I try to consciously like Try and use my muscle to you know walk, but I look at it as like.  as long as I don't lose my balance I'm okay. However that whatever I need to do right to make that I think a lot of people with chronic illnesses try to like.  I think there's a really like bad misconception that like chronically ill people who use wheelchairs are giving up. And like, like when I get that a lot on my channel. Yeah.  Like, so if you use a wheelchair, you're not even trying to like, maintain muscle mass or trying to like you know keep your health stable and or preserve your energy right.  and so like you just said like obviously not just because you use a wheelchair doesn't mean that you don't that you don't try to do those things but It just may not be when people are seeing you because when people are seeing you, you're out and about and the world is very big. Exactly. And you need to use your wheelchair to get around it. Exactly. For me, I only Recently, it's been a few years, but it feels recent to me.  I started using a wheelchair and I feel like it's been like three or four years maybe.  And so I have a degenerative condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is a connective tissue disorder.  And it means that my body is creating defective collagen.  And collagen is the glue that holds your whole body together. So it affects... everything from like my senses to my internal organs and obviously like my joints and my muscles and my blood vessels.  So when people ask me why do I use a wheelchair?  I try to just say I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but a lot of people don't know what it is. Yeah, exactly.  That's the same thing with me.  I'm like, oh, because I was diagnosed with ALS and they're like, uh, okay. So yeah, with time I can explain like that.  there's actually quite a few different reasons for me to use a wheelchair.  The first being that it's very painful for me to walk because essentially all my joints are loose hinges.  So it's two things.  The joints themselves hurt because they're like, you know, they're swishing around on themselves.  Got it.  And then my muscles hurt because my muscles try to compensate for the fragility of my joints by being tight and tensing and trying to hold the joints together.  So I'm experiencing muscle pains and joint pains.  And it's very intense, like whenever I stand up, I compare it to like walking on rocks or if sometimes it gets very bad walking on glass.  when I first started feeling the pains I thought that I had fractures in my feet was like was what was what I thought the pain was?  yeah um but really it's just that when I stand up I'm putting pressure on my joints and my feet and all of them kind of collapse into the ground.  my feet are kind of like bags of bones And so, and so when all those bones like squished down, it's painful. It does feel like walking on rocks. Um, so like, so there's the pain aspect of it, like the muscle and the joint pains.  Um, but also, like I said, the joints, they're not, uh, like, held together properly.  so they're very fragile and every time I walk I'm at risk of like dislocating my ankle or dislocating my knees or my hips which is like an injury that's gonna like hold me back.  so I try to not dislocate things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  The wheelchair is going to be the safest way for me to move around in terms of injury risk.  And it's the only way I can get around.  because if I try to walk for more than, I think I have like, I reach my like, tap me out, tap me out, I can't handle it anymore moment, like after five minutes.  of walking.  My gait is not really affected at all.  Like if I walk around the room, like I walk at a typical speed, I walk in a way like, it depends on how much pain that I'm in. Yeah. If I'm in more pain, I will kind of, my gait will be affected.  But if I'm in like moderate, like tolerable levels of pain, then yeah, you would never be able to tell.  It's like a very typical gait that like people are like, you don't look like you're in pain.  yeah yeah i've just learned how to tolerate it very well.  yeah yeah yeah um and uh.  and the final thing is the dysautonomia like because i have connective tissue problems um and defective collagen my blood vessels they are impacted in a way.  uh i don't want to say anything that's like incorrect, but they're impacted in a way that, like, if I'm standing up for too long or even sometimes, it depends on my health on any particular moment, sometimes if I stand up too fast even, like, the blood will come rushing down to my feet and pull on my feet and I'll lose all the blood in my head.  Oh shit. So then I'll get dizzy and nauseous and eventually faint.  I'll pass out. Got it. My face turns white and then like, got it. So I can't, I can't be on my feet. for long periods. But at maximum, I have maybe a five minute limit on my feet.  And I'll probably have to shift my weight.  Maybe I'll put my knee to rest on top of a chair or something.  I'm trying to navigate pain the entire time that I'm standing up. Interesting.  Interesting.  You know what?  I never knew that.  I mean, I think the thing that's so interesting and what I love about just like YouTube in general is that although I've had my disability, I've been the only person within my immediate circle of family and friends with a disability.  So online is really how I've been learning about other people's disabilities.  And I know I've known you for a long time now and I never even really understood exactly what the disability was.  and then especially when we were just kicking it like right before we started recording we was chopping it up big time.  before we started recording, I was kind of like observing because I'm never around other people with disabilities like that.  So I'm always like curious, like, oh, you know, well, how does Annie get around?  Does she get around the same way that I do?  Or what, you know, why is she using the wheelchair versus me?  And like all these other things.  So I'm just really glad to like hear have a better understanding of your experience versus, you know, mine, because truthfully, I'm usually the only person with an experience that involves a disability.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.  So now you know, essentially when I'm walking around, it's, I'm walking around. Cause you was killing it.  Cause I was like, oh damn, like Annie's out here killing it right now.  Like walking around and I'm just like, and I'm like, and I'm walking around and I'm like holding onto the wall and I'm just like trying to like make sure I don't fall. But yeah, But I do that but in a more kind of discreet way like in a way that like a lot of people just won't notice.  Like you don't notice.  like you just think that me I'm being cool when I'm leaning against the wall or when I'm like Or when I want to have my foot on top of a table of a coffee table, right?  Like or people think like it's bad manners when people put their feet on top of the table.  I'm like, yeah, I'm trying to accommodate my pain level. Yeah. Yeah, like.  so yeah, I don't know if I do that on purpose I don't think I do But people will interpret it like, oh, this person has, like, cool body language. Yeah, yeah. Like, they're, like, leaning on stuff.  Right.  And they're very, like, comfortable looking.  Especially, like, putting your feet up on things.  Right, right.  Or, like, I did, like, the Captain Morgan on top of a table. Yeah. Right.  So that kind of thing, I guess, is interpreted as, like, cool body language. Yeah, yeah. And I'm like, I'm lifting my leg Captain Morgan style onto the table because it hurts. Yeah.  And you know what's interesting is that, um... You talking about how you discreetly are managing your pain, for me, because I have the more of a muscle weakness, muscle mass thing, I discreetly move literally in different ways.  So my right arm is limp, but I always use this as an example because it's the most obvious one.  My right arm is limp.  I can't bend it on my own right now, but if I do this, people don't even notice it.  I'm mind blown.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So a lot of times when I'm doing this I'm talking like cuz once it's in this position I'm good so I can do like this or I can like turn up like this and so I'm look good.  But then like my arm will start to drop so I'll just catch it on this side and I just like do one of these numbers or something like when I'm out partying or whatever the case is.  so it's always kind of exactly what you said like yeah, just discreetly and even when I'm in leg pain or my hips will hurt or my knees will hurt I will sit like in the inside exactly like what you do.  this is like the best thing.  to like ever do or stretched out is like always a fave um but I do the same thing as well.  like in order to manage my pain is I'll sit a certain way or I'll sit cute or people like oh that's kind of like the whole sitting pretty thing like oh you sitting pretty or you sitting cute like you know it's just like. well I'm just trying to make sure my hip doesn't pop out of place.  I would love for more people to know that because for me, when I see people sitting like this with crossed legs under, sometimes I'm like, what an EDS pose, right?  I see it because I live it, right?  So when I see people doing these very wide-hipped poses, position um seating because like hips wide like i said all the joints are like in pain.  so like like think about how many joints are in the body it's so much.  yeah so my hip joints are in pain all the time too.  it's and for me it's the most comfortable like this.  yeah even like putting my knee up like this because like in this position i'm pushing my leg joint into my hip.  um So I'm more comfortable like that. Interesting. So you don't... Clicking the joints. Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what's interesting?  So when I'm sitting in my chair for too long, my hips will start to hurt.  So for me, I'm trying to like... It feels like, in my head, this is how I interpret it.  I don't know, like no medical situation or whatever.  But I will sit a certain way in order for the pain to almost move away, to get the pressure off of one hip.  But the way I'm sitting, you think I'm cool.  If I were to sit like this or something like that, people would be like, oh, you're killing it.  But it's really to get the pressure off of this hip because it's killing me right now.  You know what I mean?  And so I'll do that in my chair.  And a lot of times, like, you know, when I'm doing my modeling, I will model in a certain way to, like, manage kind of, like, the pain.  But it'll come off, like, super dope.  So I'm, like, in my chair like this.  And they're thinking, oh, she's hitting a pose.  And it's like, no, like, my back is just killing me.  So I have to, like, rest back.  But I'll keep my face, like... So it's all kind of, like, working within itself.  You need to do a video about, like... disability posing in fashion modeling.  I feel like I pose like this and I and I love that you just told me about like.  so I very discreetly like lift my arm up to this level and once it's up here I can do whatever I want with it like.  yeah this is such cool information especially like just in terms of like.  I so I love like when people talk about body language and how to interpret body language and I feel like I feel very excluded as someone with physical disabilities because body language is so different for us.  Like I just said, someone might think that I think I'm all that because of the way I lean on stuff or put my feet on stuff.  And so people who interpret body language will interpret it like that.  They'll interpret it like that.  Oh, this person thinks it's too cool for school or like what bad manners or whatever.  So like stability is so excluded from that.  Like body language isn't always going to mean. Right. Those things.  Right.  Right.  So like, I would love like stuff like that.  I think it's so important to, to talk about like, yeah, like.  the different small things like that that we do with our bodies in order to like accommodate whatever is going on with us physically.  coming up in part two what was the process of actually getting our wheelchairs as chronically ill and ambulatory people?  yes um because i think that a lot of people uh think that they have to wait for a doctor to prescribe them with the chair.  but there's actually a few different ways to you know navigate the situation and there's a lot of details that people just are unfamiliar with and like don't even know how to like.  ask yeah so yeah so what was your process like?  how did you bring it up to your doctor?  like the possibility or like or did you even like?  did you even talk to a doctor before trying to get one like?  what was your process with that?","channel.id":"clxmi0nm001s2cdvisg8sn8uk","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCznS4Pk3VcTIfDUuWrQtdzQ","channel.name":"Annie Elainey","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUMs5MgxX-swWUepaOvpmQ-tl21N33UNC7s5nHJRg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2011-11-04T03:43:54.000Z","summary":"Today, I'm collaborating with Lolo from Sitting Pretty to discuss being ambulatory wheelchair users, specifically those with chronic illnesses.

She started using a wheelchair in college, focusing on her needs rather than social concerns.\n\nI, on the other hand, have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that affects my joints, muscles, and blood vessels. I use a wheelchair due to joint pain, muscle weakness, and dysautonomia, which causes me to faint when standing for too long. We both use our wheelchairs discreetly, often hiding our pain behind seemingly cool body language.\n\nFor example, I use a limp arm to compensate for muscle weakness, while Lolo sits in a way that appears comfortable but actually helps manage her hip pain. We both use these strategies to navigate pain and maintain our independence.\n\nWe're excited to share our experiences and help others understand the complexities of living with chronic illnesses and using wheelchairs. In part two, we'll discuss the process of getting a wheelchair, debunking common myths and sharing our personal experiences with navigating the medical system.\n\nLolo's movie, Give Me Liberty, premieres on August 23rd and features a black woman with a disability as the lead character. We encourage everyone to support content that showcases disabled talent and promotes representation.\n\nOur conversation highlights the importance of understanding and accommodating different abilities, especially in social situations. By sharing our experiences, we hope to raise awareness and promote inclusivity.","responses":"[1] Disability: Mentions individuals with chronic illnesses and physical disabilities."}

Green New Deal.  Green New Deal.  Green New Deal.  Green and new just morph into one word.  I'm just gonna call it the GND.  So, the GND is a resolution stating goals for Congress to achieve by 2030, mainly to do with the environment, but also other issues.  It's massively progressive, and it's something that we all need to get behind if we want to fight climate change.  And we should want to fight climate change, because it will literally make this planet uninhabitable for us.  So today, I want to talk specifically about what the GND is trying to do, because it's important that we're educated about what we're advocating for.  Legislation that tackles climate change is important, but we have to know how it is doing that.  So first things first, this is not a bill.  This isn't a piece of legislation.  It's not doing anything on its own.  It's a resolution, which is just a statement saying, we plan to achieve these things through future legislation.  So if all goes according to plan, a lot of smaller pieces of legislation would be proposed that tackle different problems, and they would fall under the umbrella of being a part of the GND.  So don't expect the GND to get super specific.  That's what the future bills would be for.  Right now, the GND is intentionally vague.  It's basically a mission statement saying, here is what we want to do, and then we hash out the how to do it and the specifics of each individual bill.  Realistically, those bills aren't going to get anywhere for the next two years, because even if they pass the House, the Republican-controlled Senate is likely to vote them down.  And even if by some miracle it did get through the Senate, Trump would have to sign it.  So depending on what happens in 2020, we could start seeing GND legislation being put into place then, with the goal being to accomplish a lot of major points by 2030.  And given how climate change is increasingly exacerbating natural disasters and causing the sea level to rise, we can't afford to wait any longer than that.  So a major part of the GND happening in 2020 is electing Democrats to Congress and the presidency.  Without that, the people who believe in this plan won't have the power to do anything about it.  Between now and 2020, hopefully we'll see a bunch of different GND bills and have a chance to analyze and debate them before there's a real chance to enact them when the next Congress comes in.  So, with all of that said, let's talk about what this resolution says.  In the beginning, it basically makes a justification for why it exists, by listing a bunch of the ways that climate change is hurting the US.  And citing a 2018 report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it says that to prevent climate change from becoming even more destructive, we need to reach net-zero carbon emissions from human sources by 2050.  It goes on to list other ways that climate change is damaging the world, including its effects disproportionately harming marginalized communities, like communities of color, indigenous communities, and poor communities.  It even says that climate change is a threat to national security, as natural disasters worsen around the world and destabilize other countries.  Then it goes on to list several other crises that the US is having right now, including stagnating hourly wages, massive income inequality, and a racial wealth divide.  Then it basically says that the federal government has the chance to do something on a New Deal-sized scale that could both address climate change and many of the other issues plaguing the country.  That's when it lists its five main goals.  which I'll summarize in plain English, but you're welcome to go read the resolution for yourself.  I'll link it in the description below.  So those five goals are basically 1.  Get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in a fair way.  2.  Create millions of good, well-paying, secure jobs.  3.  Invest in modern infrastructure.  4.  Ensure that everyone has access to clean air, water, and other necessities.  And 5.  Promote justice for and repair the historic oppression of marginalized communities.  Those are the five big main goals of the GND.  It's essentially, stop climate change and do it in a way that benefits the people.  It goes on to say that these goals can be achieved through a 10-year national mobilization, and it gets a little bit more specific about how those goals should be achieved.  It emphasizes that funding and investment should go towards community-led projects.  because local communities know the best way to protect themselves against climate change.  It says the federal government needs to invest heavily in renewable energy sources and the infrastructure to deploy those renewable sources.  And it needs to make sure those sources are affordable for everyone.  It says we need to upgrade all the existing buildings in the country to maximize their energy efficiency and energy sources.  It says we need to support family farms and invest in sustainable farming practices to reduce or eliminate the pollution coming from the agricultural sector.  It says we need to overhaul our public transportation system to make it zero-emission and affordable.  And it specifically says that we need to invest in high-speed rail.  Which, oh my god, we really do.  Quick note before I cover the rest of this resolution, if you're American and you've never left the country, I think it would blow your mind how much better public transportation works in, like, every other place except the US.  Like, most of the US has really been designed with cars in mind, and it's life-changing to go to a city where there's a solid public transportation system, and you realize that there's a better way to do things.  Imagine the US having a high-speed rail system to go from LA to SF in a couple hours, or even to go cross-country.  It could happen, and it would fundamentally change the way we travel, especially by cutting down on flights that use a lot of fossil fuels.  Okay, sorry, back to the resolution, I just really love public transportation.  So the GND also says that we need to restore natural ecosystems that have been destroyed, and work to protect those that are endangered or fragile.  It says we need to clean up hazardous waste sites, and we need to promote the international exchange of technology and expertise when it comes to climate change, because we're all in this together.  And it says that the US should become a leader in this area so that other countries can follow its lead.  It emphasizes, again, that marginalized communities need to be consulted at every step of the way.  And it says that we need to ensure that the people benefit from the economic boom that will come from so much investment, not corporations.  Then it says we need to provide higher education to everyone, with an emphasis on people from marginalized communities so that they can be equal participants in the GND.  It emphasizes the importance of hiring local workers who are part of a union.  And it says that we need to guarantee good jobs with a right to unionize.  It says we need to improve workplace safety and anti-discrimination laws, stop the transfer of jobs overseas, and not allow companies to monopolize entire sectors.  It says that the US government needs to obtain consent from indigenous people for any decisions that affect them, they need to honor all treaties with them, and they need to protect the sovereignty of indigenous lands.  And lastly, it says that all people of the United States should be provided with high-quality healthcare, affordable housing, economic security, and access to clean air and water.  That's a lot of stuff for what many see as just a thing about climate change.  It's actually about way more than climate change.  It's about repairing this country in a bunch of different ways, and a big part of that is climate change, because it's already wreaking havoc on the globe and on the US specifically.  But the way that it chooses to address climate change, by ensuring that marginalized communities are consulted, by creating good jobs, by making sure everyone has healthcare and clean water, All of that stuff doesn't necessarily have to be a part of a climate change resolution.  But it is here, and I think that's a big deal.  The GND is very progressive, and it's actually gaining support among Democrats thanks to the hard work put in by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and so many other progressives who continue to push the Democrats to the left.  There's still a ways to go, for sure, but it's already got 60 House cosponsors and 9 Senate cosponsors.  And if we make it a key issue for 2020, it's going to push Democrats left, and it's going to ensure that we end up with a presidential candidate who's ready to take big steps towards fighting climate change.  So don't think of the GND solely as a climate change resolution.  Think of it as a massive community project to improve life for everyone.  At the end of it, we could have pollution-free air, high-quality public transportation, safe and well-paying jobs, a right to higher education, a right to quality healthcare, and so much more.  This could change so much, but only if we get behind the GND.  So when you're voting in local elections , make sure you're voting for candidates who support the GND.  If your representative or senator hasn't voiced their support for it yet, call their office and tell them you want them to support it.  We've got two years to build support for the GND, and we cannot wait any longer than that to act on climate change.  Anyway, that's all I had for you today.

It's a resolution stating goals for Congress to achieve by 2030, mainly focusing on the environment, but also addressing other issues.  The GND is a progressive plan that aims to fight climate change, which will make the planet uninhabitable if left unchecked.  It's not a bill, but a resolution that outlines goals to be achieved through future legislation.  The plan is intentionally vague, serving as a mission statement, and will be fleshed out in smaller bills.  These bills will likely be proposed in 2020, with the goal of achieving major points by 2030.  To make this happen, we need to elect Democrats to Congress and the presidency in 2020. \n\nThe GND resolution lists five main goals: \n\n1.  Get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in a fair way.\n2.  Create millions of good, well-paying, secure jobs.\n3.  Invest in modern infrastructure.\n4.  Ensure everyone has access to clean air, water, and other necessities.\n5.  Promote justice for and repair the historic oppression of marginalized communities.\n\nThe resolution emphasizes funding community-led projects, investing in renewable energy, and making these sources affordable for everyone.  It also calls for upgrading existing buildings, supporting family farms, and overhauling public transportation to make it zero-emission and affordable.  The GND aims to restore natural ecosystems, clean up hazardous waste sites, and promote international cooperation on climate change.  It also emphasizes the importance of hiring local workers, providing higher education, and guaranteeing good jobs with a right to unionize. \n\nThe GND is not just about climate change; it's about repairing the country in many ways.  It's a progressive plan that's gaining support among Democrats, and if we make it","responses":"[1] Government: Mentions the importance of legislation and the role of Congress in achieving the goals of the GND.\n[1] Politics: Mentions electing Democrats to Congress and the presidency, and the importance of unionizing.\n[1] Social Justice: Mentions promoting justice for marginalized communities, hiring local workers, and providing higher education.\n[1] Community Development: Mentions funding community-led projects and hiring local workers.\n[1] Education: Mentions providing higher education and guaranteeing good jobs.\n[1] Environment: Mentions goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy.\n[1] Climate Change: Mentions the importance of addressing climate change and its impact on the planet.\n[1] Infrastructure: Mentions upgrading existing buildings, overhauling public transportation, and supporting family farms.\n[1] Energy: Mentions investing in renewable energy and making these sources affordable for everyone.\n[1] International Cooperation: Mentions promoting international cooperation on climate change.\n[1] Health: Mentions ensuring access to clean air, water, and other necessities.\n[1] Labor: Mentions the right to unionize and guaranteeing good jobs.\n[1] Waste Management: Mentions cleaning up hazardous waste sites.\n[1] Transportation: Mentions overhauling public transportation to make it zero-emission and affordable.\n[1] Economy: Mentions creating jobs, investing in infrastructure, and making sources of energy affordable.\n[1] Agriculture: Mentions supporting family farms."}

So it's a very good time.  I love her channel.  Please, I'm going to link it in the description so that you all can go follow her.  I'm so excited because we are both together for Clexacon, which is a convention conference about LGBT representation in the media.  So we've been having a great time hanging out with a bunch of our LGBT plus pals, community, and talking about LGBT representation and culture and our intersection of identifying as both queer and disabled.  It's so great.  So for this video, What we wanted to try and do is I have to actually get ready for another panel.  that I'm doing.  You're on three.  You're on three panels.  Me, one, you, three.  Now, and you know what?  We have a really good urgency moment because there's a time crunch.  I've got to get out of here in a certain amount of time.  Urgency.  Alexa's going to try to help me do my makeup.  Okay.  With one hand.  Yes.  Okay, so I'm going to pretend that I know how to do this.  I don't, but we're going to have fun.  Thank you for trusting me.  That's a big deal.  Yeah, you don't.  usually, I'm just going to say now, you don't really wear makeup?  No.  Or is it a never?  It's not a never.  Like, sometimes if I'm feeling fancy, I'll put on mascara.  But I don't wear makeup otherwise.  So... This obviously covers up things that you don't want other people to see.  So, like, your baggage, your, like, hard memories, you know, your past traumas and shit.  Oh, my God, how accurate.  Yeah, but I don't know.  You want me to tell you?  Yeah.  It's very accurate because the only way that I use that is kind of, like, highlight.  So I use that, like, under my eye circles.  Okay.  So I was wrong and correct.  Yeah, because it's for my traumas and bad memories.  Oh, neat.  Am I pushing too hard?  No.  wow that like the magic changes things.  mm-hmm I'm sorry no I have nervous eyes but like half the makeup on the table right now is eye makeup.  so that's really funny.  okay yeah good I think that's enough that's good.  okay great.  what's next?  yay like.  as you can see like one is the main used one.  we should have figured that out.  This one is the one you like to use.  Is it like a face massage?  I was going to say the exact same thing.  It's like a face massage.  Actually, it makes it so smooth.  Say that again.  Try to sing me a song, Annie.  Fun time.  This makeup is going to be shit, but we're having the time.  That's all that matters.  Now, next, if I was making a choice, I would do something on your eyes.  Okay.  But I don't know what.  Maybe... Oh, look.  We do have this if you want to try, but also there's no tools for this.  So I'll use my fingers.  Yeah.  Great.  The makeup gurus hate us right now.  I'm going to do one eye with my finger and one eye with my finger.  Nice.  I can't believe you're agreeing.  Absolutely.  What color?  Whatever you want.  Whatever I want.  Okay, what's going to go good with yellow?  Oh, maybe, like, some of these blue situations.  Do you think so?  I do think so.  Yeah, I never, like, I barely ever use eyeshadow.  I have it, like, in case of emergencies.  What would make up an eyeshadow emergency?  If I had to go to a club or something, like, like that, then I need, like, bolder makeup.  I understand.  Now I get it.  Okay.  All right.  Close your eyes and trust me.  I'm doing double-handed or double-limbed, I guess, eyeshadow.  Okay.  And I'm not allowed to help one with the other.  All right.  So let's get some more over here.  You know what?  I've always really liked, of the eyeshadow that I've ever done, either on myself or others, I've always really liked using my hands just because I feel like You almost have more control, and it's like, I don't know.  Well, also, because... Us broke fellas don't have enough money for, like, 25 brushes.  Absolutely, right?  Your eyelashes are so long.  Aw, thank you.  Look at them.  They're like a pony.  You know how ponies have such long eyelashes?  Aw.  Yeah.  That's really sweet.  Because, like, I don't know because of anxiety or dehydration, I, like, rub my eyes so much that I've gotten rid of quite a few sections of my eyelashes.  Really?  So I've had to try to grow them back out, yeah.  Well, it looks like you're doing a great job.  Thank you.  They're very full and they kind of fan out like ponies.  Aw, thank you.  All right.  Okay, now I would do, I don't know, this thing?  Okay.  Do you wear this?  Yes.  Okay, great.  I took away everything that's, like, I even put the eyeshadow on the other side, but I was like, if you want, give it a try.  Give it a shot.  Yeah, because I usually just use that for, like, places.  That's very good.  Eyeshadow emergency.  Oh, so pretty.  Okay, now this side's going to be a little weird.  Okay.  Because it's, like, reverse.  Oh, God.  Okay, open.  Okay.  I'm going to come in like this.  Okay.  I'm just going to steady myself.  Yes.  See, they're so long, I don't even have to go near your eyes.  Because they're just like... It's good to make sounds when you do makeup.  I learned that from myself.  So what's your next video that's going to come out?  The next video is probably how to book and prepare... For traveling while disabled.  Yeah, I bet you there'd be so many, like, well, there are, like, even thinking about, okay, so on my flight here to Vegas, I was sat in the emergency exit row.  Mm-hmm.  And I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and I hid my arm the entire time because I've had friends who have been asked to like be removed from the row because they think that they can't handle the door and all these things.  Or, you know, friends with like prosthetic legs or whatever.  And it's like, you know like we we know the limits of our body.  we can have a conversation.  you don't need to make those choices for us.  um so that's like probably my main one of my one of my things when i'm traveling just like if i'm in that row it's like yes i can sit here don't make assumptions right?  you know.  yeah it's gonna be different for like every disability.  so absolutely i never know like how to use the language like outside of like because i identify as disabled.  so i'm like how to prepare for traveling as an EDSer.  I don't know, maybe, but like, but I feel like it's.  a lot of the things are not going to be necessarily specific to my disability, but some things will be.  Yeah.  And some things will be more broad than a lot of folks can kind of like tune into.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of things you'll be able to use whether you're disabled or not.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Like we've talked about a few of the packing techniques that I have.  Okay, so I do not prepare when I pack.  I just shove everything into a bag.  And Annie's like, do you know if you roll stuff, you save room?  I'm like, excuse me?  Or just like packing things on the bottom that you're going to need last versus first on top.  Like, that's just very good.  Very good.  I love it.  I love it.  I always think that those things are common sense, but they are.  Well, they're not.  We need to know.  We need to know the information.  I'm ready.  I'm ready to put it all out there.  Are you ready for lip time?  Sure, yes.  I'm like trying to wipe off because what I did before in preparation is I use this Brujita Holistic Skin Care and it is like an avocado cream.  Oh my gosh, I want to bathe in it.  Yeah, you can.  It's like you put it like, it's like a treatment for your skin face, face skin.  Your skin face?  Yeah.  Your face skin.  Your face skin.  Uh, also you can put it on your lippy.  So I put it there to try and like, cause it's very dry here in Vegas.  Oh, it's so dry.  So I put it there to try and like moisturize before I put any lip color on.  Okay.  That's great.  The more you know.  Exactly.  I have no idea.  And I just want to note that I'm using the elementary school pencil hold for this lipstick, so this is how we're going to do it.  I think this is the correct way.  Not at all.  Okay.  All right.  You have fun lips.  They are so nice and full.  Mwah.  And then this thing goes in the middle of them?  That's a choice.  That's a choice I'm going to make.  Okay, great.  And then the tops are always the hardest.  But the pencil technique helps.  Wonderful.  That's not bad.  Oh, I thought I was going to really mess that up, but I don't think I did.  Yay!  This just, like, looks like too much fun, so I'm just going to put a little dab in the middle just to give it, like, wow, you know?  Okay.  Oh, it's really dark.  Okay.  It's fine.  We made a choice.  You can also blend.  That's true.  Let's see.  You can also blend the dark into the... With this or with... With itself.  Thank you.  You can also blend.  It can also... Yeah, that is a darker color.  It is, but then that's okay.  Oh, that makes you look like a vampire.  Wow.  Okay, I'm going to do this one, and then I'm going to let you do that one.  So we can see the difference, and also you can fix them if I mess them up.  Okay.  All right, so we'll start with this eyebrow.  Even, like, if you're on the actual hair and darkening the hair itself, it's like... Okay, let me see.  Oh, yeah.  A full brow.  A full... Brow.  Everyone.  You can see the difference a little bit.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  But it's just, like, a tiny bit of, like, distinction or whatever.  Right.  The finale is always that, like, I have, like, my hair twisted up, and then when I pull it out, it's, like, wavy.  Yeah.  That's how you do that.  Yeah.  I was wondering.  Okay, so those eyes with that hair look so great because your hair is so dark.  it actually looks blue.  Did you know that?  Yay.  That's the magic.  It's magic.  You look so ready for your panel.  I'm ready for my panel.  You're going to rock it so hard.  Yay.  Oh, yay.  And it's like a little part of me will be there with you.  Aw, yay.  Because she's got other plans.  Well, yes, I'm going to an animal sanctuary to pet the animals.  And then I'm going to cook a vegan dinner because, yeah, that's what I do.  What a cutie.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bueno.  I think.  What time is it now?  I don't know.  Is it time to go?  I don't know.  It's probably.  I should probably.  I should probably.  So we can get out of here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bueno.  Thank you so much for being on my channel.  It was my pleasure.  Being in my video.  This was so great.  And for helping me put this look together that I'm literally not even going to change.  Oh God.  I'm going to go there just like this.  Bless you.  Bless you, friend.  It's really great.  Yeah, thank you for having me.  This was so much fun.  Yay!  I'm so glad.  So good.  I'm so glad.  Yay!  Okay, everyone, please go down in the description, click that link, follow Stump Kitchen, and like, subscribe, all the usual fun stuff for me.  And I will see you eventually.  Bye!

I'm really excited.  Three years together, that's amazing.  Fiona is still snoozing because she's a sleepy gal.  But I'm gonna go to the store and get us some avocados and stuff for breakfast.  Ugh, I love her so much.  Okay, I'm gonna go get food. Out there with your friends.  Your cell phone all night long.  Calling you.  Calling you.  Wonder where you've been.

These are Power Shells, and when I was a kid and was on an elevator, I was obsessed with Power Shells.  So we are going to be in New Zealand for a week, so I want to do a little vlog.  We have one night in Auckland right now, and then we're going to Rotorua for a few days, and then to Queenstown for a few days.  I'm really excited.  We've got all sorts of fun activities planned.  I got my girl.  So let's get on with the vlog.  Woo! No supermodel in my dirty jeans, but in my 24 inches heels. No rubbish to be left in or around this Garden? That's like a very generous use of the word. We found a very dark wharf and a bridge that's very far away. And a boat called Daddy. Close.  William C. Daddy. Dolby.  I'm not pretending.  I'm born like this again for the right place.  It's so extreme and I don't really care.  I don't really care. The cutouts of random people along this wharf scare me so much. We are in the tunnel of love.  Of love. Apparently Auckland has a Space Needle?  Did they steal it from Seattle? Sorry, not in service!  It's so polite!  Calling me a madwoman, madwoman, madwoman.  Calling me a madwoman, madwoman. No, I don't really care, I don't really care.  So, we had our one night in Auckland.  Now we're headed down to Rotorua.  We got like a three hour drive.  Gonna go visit a Maori village. You're looking at like my armpit.  Like when you look to the side, you're looking at my armpit. I'm trying to drive.  I don't have a lot of time to look over there. It's like you're not even trying to look at the camera.  I positioned it here so you can look at it.  That was the mirror.  Sorry, guys. So, we've made it to Rotorua, and it is pretty smelly. Yes!  I was hoping, because I was worried that I hyped it up, and I was telling you it was going to be smelly, and then it wouldn't be smelly. Yeah, it's like a sulfur-y smell, because of the geysers or something. Yeah, and the Airbnb guy said that it's actually not too bad, because it's been raining. Yeah.  So, it's dry.  It's going to be stanky. Our Airbnb is gorgeous, though.  I love it. Yeah. Will I see you when I get there?  We found love, yeah Together we will shine But we know we're running out of time Cause we met like strangers in the night.  Don't tell me it's over now.  I could travel a thousand miles Just to feel your arms around me.  I will give my love to you But will I see you when I get there?  I could travel a thousand miles Just to feel your arms around me.  I will give my love to you But will I see you when I get there?  Will I see you when I get there?  Travel a thousand miles Just to feel your arms around me.  I will give my love to you But will I see you when I get there?  I could travel a thousand miles Just to feel your arms around me.  I will give my love to you But will I see you when I get there? So we went ziplining this afternoon, and it was super cool. It was so much fun. It was amazing.  And then we just found, it's like around sunset, and we went down to the lake to get some photos.  It was really pretty.  We got some great photos.  Now we're just walking back over the screen.  It's like slime.  Yeah, we're going to go do some more tree activities.  It's like a redwood tree walk.  It's a tree day.  Did you know?  the third anniversary is always trees? Wow, bad joke.  You should cut that one. Oh, baby! This is Riley trying Goody Goody Gumdrops ice cream for the first time. It's so weird. It's like you're eating, um... Bubblegum?  Yeah.  And sweets? It's like, it's just strongly bubblegum flavor.  Like, I feel like I can't swallow it. Like, I just have to keep chewing.  After staring holes in all my walls Don't you cut me off like you did.  that time Once was already enough, I'd say.  But I wonder if you hear me.  Can you hear me?  And touch the fire with your hands.  Cause you're gonna get burned.  You're gonna get burned.  You're walking into quicksand.  Now let us learn.  Cause you're gonna get burned.  \u00b6\u00b6 I gotta say That you could do so much better Like a vagabond lost in your own place Stranded in your desert.  I hit you up but there's no one there.  If I wanted something to stand I would've found just what I wanted. Oh my god, right, no, stop it, stop it, no!  You can do it on that side.  Oh my god.  What is with your knee to, like, try and balance next to an acid pool?  It's fine.  Oh my goodness. We know we are lost, in love with the lost Like hard drums that fly so we'll win anyway.  Yet we own the sun, not in love with drugs.  Oh, it's not up, up, up, up, up, up, up.  We're in love with you, I'm with you.  Okay, real quick, why does this McDonald's have a plane? It is in Lake Taupo for reference. A whole plane? I need a nonsense. A whole McDonald's branded plane? Why do you exist?  I won't make it easy for you now.  You got two minutes of my time And I don't really break too easily.  But I'm worth it.  Cause I'll slip into your dreams tonight.  So give me, so give me your all.  I'll take it, I'll take it to Mars.  I'll stick like glue inside your mind. Just watch me break in your sweat. You're falling into me, touch me, I swear.  You'll do anything that I want.  So keep us awake till the dawn.  Baby, I wanna make you sweat on me.  I wanna make you sweat on me.  I got you wrapped around my finger But don't you try to call me tomorrow.  There's nothing personal in having a little fun.  You wait and see if it's worth your while.  Talking is helping me, you're all.  I'll take it, I'll fake it tomorrow.  I'll stick right to inside your mind.  Just watch me break it.  You're sweet.  You're falling into me, touch me. How are you going, Riley?  I'm so cold.  Just walking home.  It's so cold.  There's another crazy setting. I had an increasingly cold feet run.  Okay, so we made it to Queenstown, and it is very cold here. I am freezing.  I'm loving it.  That is a singing sheep joke that you're hearing, by the way. But Queenstown is really beautiful.  There's some gorgeous mountains surrounding the city, and it's a huge, gorgeous lake.  I really like it, even though I'm frozen.  Yesterday, we went jet boating, and it was super cool.  They're like speed boats, little speed boats.  They go on really shallow water.  It was super fun. They're super fast.  Yeah. And today we're going lujing, which I'm super excited for.  It just looks like go-karts that go downhill. It's like go-karts that go down a mountain. Okay, so we just went lujing, and it was so fun.  So fun.  We went down like five times.  It was incredible.  I didn't get any footage of me actually going down because too busy with lujing.  All right, the trip has come to an end.  We are back at Queenstown Airport, and we are just about to leave New Zealand.  Fiona doesn't want to be on camera because she's all comfy and doesn't feel camera ready.  But yeah, I hope you enjoyed this vlog.  Thank you so much for exploring New Zealand with me.  It was a lot of fun, and I look forward to doing some more travel stuff in the future.  I'll see y'all next time. Bye!

I think it was well.  it was about feminism.  okay not very similar but they have things in common.  last year I think but this year I'm coming off as new I'm further in my transition.  a lot of things changed.  I went through a lot I understood a lot of things So maybe my perspectives have changed and that's life.  So I want to talk about this topic quite from like different angles.  So the first thing I want to say is like a very weird conclusion that I quite got to.  is that toxic masculinity in the trans male community kind of makes sense.  It's not excused but... My voice, okay, it did that.  It is not excused, but you can understand it.  And I choose to understand every side of the story, even those that I don't agree with.  So, trans men, being a trans man myself, and, you know, growing up within my culture as well, like, we were quite forced to be feminine, okay?  Or we forced ourselves, even if it wasn't others, to be feminine in order to, like, be approved by our family, or by the people around us, or to just fit in.  So, femininity quite had a negative connotation to it, because of the way it was just put up on us.  So I totally understand trans men that don't like anything feminine, wouldn't want to Wouldn't feel comfortable wearing something feminine, etc, etc.  I know this will not make any sense, but I have come to analyze this and I'm like fuck.  this makes absolute sense.  So I feel like okay, I'm gonna unfilter this talk.  Okay, the trans community most of it are pretty much liberals pretty much fit in within kind of like politicizing it in a way and I kind of understand because you know, the other side of the political spectrum isn't very accepted neither.  It started off as embrace your femininity and androgyny.  And then it was like, be proud of it.  And then it was like, you kind of have to be it.  It's like, you know, if you look more androgynous, you're going to get more attention, you're going to get more recognition, respect, love, and all of that from the trans community.  I have noticed this.  Maybe it's not your experience.  Again, it's just mine.  And I know it makes absolutely no sense because You know, with cis people, it's literally the opposite.  I know that, you know, people that are more passing get more respect and are treated well.  And I can confirm this myself.  But after passing, the trans community kind of tries to kind of make it out as if you're not trans anymore.  You know, and it doesn't make sense to me.  Is being trans the process or is being trans who I am?  Or is being trans me pretty?  You know, looking very ungravenous.  It just confuses me.  It really confuses me.  With that being said, and especially with the first part that I said, it still does not excuse, you know, how toxic masculinity affects you and the people around you.  You know, if you're... Because, you know, at the end of the day, you're literally just sabotaging yourself.  You're harming yourself to begin with.  And it could come off ugly on other people, too, if they have attributes that you hate about yourself.  And I have noticed this with a lot of trans guys who deal with, you know, internalized... Transphobia or who just have toxic masculinity overall and they'd be like not taking the androgynous trans guys seriously.  So I feel like the community is like an absolute mess and like the two parts are just like No.  So we need to chill.  I can't just cure your toxic masculinity.  I try to understand it instead and know where it is coming from because it's probably coming from a dark place Especially if you're a trans man.  but you have to quite think for yourself and redefine why do you think what you think, and where does it come from, and is it actually healthy, is it a good, you know, you know, you know, you know.  I feel like I mixed up all the topics, but I'm just gonna add this.  I think it's really weird, because I feel like with cis people, I'm one thing, and with trans people, I'm another thing.  And I have noticed with the queer community, it's like, I feel like sometimes they force me to quite do feminine things.  And then when I don't enjoy it and I don't want to just because I'm not comfortable with it.  I'm not gonna hate on you for putting makeup if you're a guy.  You do you.  I mean, props to you in a world where it tells you not to.  But don't make me do it.  I don't feel comfortable myself.  And when I will feel comfortable, I will do it.  So a lot of people told me that I had toxic masculinity just because I don't feel fucking comfortable wearing a dress.  I don't feel comfortable putting on makeup.  You know what I mean?  Do I really need to explain why I don't feel comfortable doing these things?  If you're trans, you should understand that.  It blows my fucking mind how... crazy.  So I think there is, you need to make the difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity.  Okay?  There is an actual difference and It's important to separate both.  I think we should stop throwing words like, y'all, you have toxic masculinity, you're transphobic, you're racist, with people that we just don't agree on shit with.  If they're actually racist, if they're actually transphobic, then fuck them.  But, you know, you need to know what they actually are.  Not because when you don't agree on one simple idea and one simple aspect of the whole topic that it means that, you know... You know, I feel different for so many reasons, but also because I'm treated and perceived differently by the trans community.  Or at least the trans community, like, around here in North America, I guess.  Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know.  Because I have been part of, like, the trans community in Malaysia.  It was different.  There's no fucking trans community in Algeria, but, like, the LGBT community there, it's different, I feel.  I don't know.  Yeah, so feel free to comment that my struggle is not valid and because I'm a man, you know, it's meant tears and like men shouldn't complain about shit because I'm gonna flip at you in the comments because I think that is fucking stupid.  Everybody should be allowed to speak up about whatever struggle they go through.  I mean, it's just my opinion and take it to the grain of salt because I want the best for this community and I want it to be inclusive of everybody and we should not force people or tell people what to wear or what to do.  If it's their thing, if it's what they want to actually genuinely do good for them.  If they don't, then they don't.  That's the message that I'm trying to send.  You can find endless videos talking about how shitty talks of masculinity is.  So, you know, I'm not gonna add anything new to the table.  But I feel the rest of the things that I said might make you think about it from a different perspective.  Anyway, so that was it.  I'm done with this video.  Let me know what you think.  Feel free to disagree with me.  Feel free to give me your own argument and I'll listen to it gladly and I'll probably reply to you as well.  So I'll see you in another video.

This video is intended to be an EAR TRAINING demonstration. There is a tremendous amount of voice modification on display here. Try to listen critically and hear the difference between resonance and pitch.\n\nHopefully finally clear up the idea that resonance and pitch are dependent on each other. I see the misconception that they are connected all over the internet. While untrained voices will accidentally connect them, this is due to a lack of control.\n\n0:00 - 0:49 Introduction\n0:49 - 6:13 Ear Training and Demonstrations of Voice Modulation\n6:19 Summary\n\nThe reason its easier to produce higher pitches with brighter resonance is due to the nature of Constructive and Deconstructive interference. Essentially the acoustic feedback to the vocal folds during bright resonance makes it more efficient to produce higher notes. Vice versa for low pitches\/larger tubes. When you go to make voice, you ignite a cascade of acoustic feedback. AC waves travel in both directions, so your vocal fold \u2018feels\u2019 the vocal tract length, and experiences greater resistance at certain pitches which are disharmonic to the fundamental frequency.\n\nIf you really want to master your voice, it's crucial that you learn to control these parameters somewhat independently. One of the easiest ways to begin separating the elements is by taking a pitch tracker. Try to maintain a single note while changing your sound. Voil\u00e0! You are now in the beginning stages of learning to manipulate resonance while keeping a single pitch.\n\nwarmly,\nz\n\nLove my videos? Consider supporting me on patreon!

Okay, and now I'm just going to go ahead and start to brighten it back up until I end up back up here.  Okay, and then I'm just going to slowly start to darken the resonance again. And now I'm all the way down here with like a lower pitch, but I have really, really bright resonance, okay?  And then I'm just gonna slowly start to bring the pitch back up on that, okay? And now I'm back up here in the very, very brightest of the possible sounds that exist.  And I'm going to keep my pitch the exact same, but now I'm just going to slowly start to darken my voice. Let me have you.  Hey everyone, it's Z from transvoicelessons.com, and in this video, I want to demonstrate the differences between resonance and pitch.  One of the most difficult aspects of altering the voice is learning to separate your resonance from your pitch.  When you finally manage to detangle these two crucial elements, a vast world of sound will be rewarded to you.  Alright, the way I like to think about this is with a simple X and Y graph, okay?  So, on this graph, the Y axis represents pitch, from high to low.  And the x-axis will represent resonance from dark to bright, okay?  So sit back, get comfortable, and I'm going to show your ear the difference between resonance and pitch once and for all.  Wherever I drag the indicator, that's the sound I'll do my best to make.  All right, yeah, so I'm gonna start kind of in the middle of the female average here, and I'm just gonna slowly start to bring the pitch down a little bit on that, so now I'm in the kind of bottom part of the female average here, and then I'm actually just gonna go, I'm actually just gonna go all the way up into the very extreme corner of the female voice, Now, I'm actually brighter and higher than a lot of female voices.  And what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna take this, I'm gonna keep the resonance the exact same, and I'm just gonna slowly start to bring the pitch down over time, but I'm gonna keep the resonance the exact same, okay? And now I'm just going to slowly start to bring the pitch down while I'm also keeping it nice and dark and everything like that.  And then I end up with something like here, okay? And now I'm actually going to just slowly start to bring this into the very middle of the androgyny zone.  For me, this is kind of what I interpret my own voice as androgynous with. And now I'm just going to slowly start to bring it back up into a linear area and feminine.  And now I am bright and feminine, slightly higher and brighter than the female average, OK?  And now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to start to lower the pitch a bit, right? And I'm going to end up with a kind of richer but brighter female voice, right? OK, so now I'm going to start right in the middle of the female average.  And then I'm going to try and do a linear transform to mail and back.  OK, so this means I'll move across both axes equally.  So here I am. And then I'm just going to slowly start to make the voice bigger until I'm here. And then I'm slowly just going to start to undo the exact same until I'm like back up here.  OK.  Um, and now I'm gonna go from like a really bright feminine sound all the way to like a really, really dark and heavy sound. Um, something to take note of is that if I keep my voice very dark, but I just start to go up in pitch like this, I actually don't really pass, which is a wonderful example of why pitch is not the element that gets you gendered. In fact, now what I'm gonna do is show how if I'm very, very high pitched but very dark, and then I just go across the chair all the way on the other end if I'm very, very low, but I'm very, very bright, I'll still sound female. So what we can obtain from this is that what matters a lot more is the resonance, okay?  And you can see the way that the colors are orientated on this where the purple androgynous zone is.  It's not equal.  Resonance strongly controls the perception of the voice.  And the ability to change your resonance mid-speech without actually changing your pitch is an incredibly useful tool.  A lot more useful than learning to change your pitch without changing your resonance. um, yeah, and now I'm actually, now I'm actually gonna speak in, like, an actual, like, true, kind of true androgynous zone, like, right here, right, and then I'm just gonna slowly start to bring the pitch up a little bit right there, okay, and then now we start to get in something that sounds a bit female, and now I'm gonna go back to the actual true androgyny sound right here, right, and then I'm just gonna sort of start to bring the pitch down, and then I'll bring the resonance, and then I'll bring the resonance down here, which will kind of be in this section here, and then I'm just gonna start to do a completely linear transformation up into the slightly higher female average over here.  And then I'm just going to start to bend the resonance a little bit darker until I'm over here, and then I'm going to go ahead and make it brighter again over here.  And yeah, heat from fire.  Like now I'm like all the way up here in this like super, super, super bright area.  Right. And then I'm just going to slowly start to bring it across the chart until I'm back to here. And I'm actually like back into like a true androgynous area, which is sort of a neutral pitch zone with like not dark, but actually I'm more like right here, which is kind of bright. OK, so here I am like a little bit higher than the female average. Yeah.  Now I'm like definitely like in the female average.  OK.  And then I'm just going to kind of darken this up even more.  But I'm going to try and stay female.  Right.  And then I'm going to kind of keep going with that.  And then I'll end up in kind of like a true androgyny zone where I'm not like that dark or that high. and then I'm going to slowly start to go a little bit a little bit darker with it right and then I'm going to just keep broadening up and also moving the pitch down a little bit until I'm like all the way down here.  okay so this is like a very heavy section here and I'm right here and then I'm just going to slowly start to bring the pitch and the resonance up on this one until I'm back into like a sort of lower sort of lower female average area right here right now if you're looking for those kind of if you're looking if you're looking for those kind of All right, so now if you're looking, so if I start in the middle of the female average, if you're looking for those sort of dark, rich female voices, what you're gonna do is you're gonna, ah, you're just gonna bring the pitch down, right?  Until you're sort of on the outer boundaries of where you would typically see like voices.  This is sort of a more like kind of butch female kind of sound, right?  My pitch is pretty low, but I'm still bright.  The lower I go in order to stay female, I'll need to get brighter and brighter and brighter until like here I'm at the very lowest pitch I can produce, but I'm like as bright as I can possibly be, right? Now this section over here is very interesting.  This is like a really, really high-pitched voice, but it's quite... So this is like a really interesting section.  It's like a high-pitched voice, but it's very dark, right? And then I'm just gonna slowly start to write in the resonance until I'm actually, um, yeah, actually I'm maybe like a little bit more feminine than the female average, right? And then I'm just gonna slowly start to bring the pitch down over time until I'm back to here, right? I want you to understand that there are essentially four or five primary sounds you need to get in your ear.  You need to get the female average in your ear. You need to get like the male average in your ear.  You need to get the dark resonance, but a high pitch. And you need to get that bright resonance, but a low pitch in your ear. Those four sounds are so crucial and you can troubleshoot a lot about your voice depending on how you compare it to those sounds.  If you start to change your voice and you feel like you sound boyish or sort of boyish and kind of fake, well, that would probably mean you need your resonance to go brighter and your pitch is fine.  If you sound too brassy and buzzy, that might indicate that your pitch needs to go up.  Thank you.  OK, so I hope you enjoyed that.  The big takeaways from this, you should start viewing your voice as a two-dimensional thing.  In reality, though, it's like an eight-dimensional thing, or maybe even more.  I don't know.  I'm still trying to figure out how many dimensions we could map it to.  But you want to learn how to separate your resonance from your pitch, OK?  They are entirely different elements.  And I hope you can use these recordings to help you hear that and further develop that capability.  If you have any questions whatsoever, please leave a comment below.

He also notes that pitch is not the primary element that gets you gendered, and that resonance plays a much larger role.\n\nZ then demonstrates how to move between different zones, including the female average, androgynous zone, and male average. He shows how to change pitch and resonance to create different sounds, such as a bright and feminine voice, a dark and heavy sound, and a true androgynous zone.\n\nThe key takeaways from this video are to view your voice as a two-dimensional thing, separate your resonance from your pitch, and understand how to change resonance mid-speech without changing pitch. Z also encourages viewers to listen to the recordings and develop their ability to hear and control their voice.\n\nTo troubleshoot voice issues, Z suggests comparing your voice to four primary sounds: the female average, male average, dark resonance with high pitch, and bright resonance with low pitch.

It might not have been their whole life, but this is what they call home.  Just learning from them about their experiences of whether it be transitioning and going through that gender reassignment process whether it be about feeling included or integrated within your own local community.  unfortunately experiences of hate crime and experiences of being misgendered within their own communities and by professionals and a really important part is capturing their hopes and expectations connected to aging what they want to see an older life look like for them as trans individuals and connected to that how they want to be treated by health and social care professionals. Right from the beginning, we said this project is going to include trans people being properly involved, upskilling trans people to do the work.  And the researchers all working together, where the work and the management are shared. What I found, we listen and mould our ideas around the trans community.  I've been meeting people, people who have the grace and the warmth to explain to me things that I didn't understand, that I couldn't understand being cis.  People have been very generous towards me in ways that I've been thinking that have not been quite appropriate.  I felt that I was in a safe environment and I think that's interesting.  It was me being the cis person saying I feel I'm in a protected space. An important element of this was recruiting researchers who are part of the trans community. Yes, that was essential.  It seems to me strange that I've hardly read any research where that's been the case. Surveying the knowledge and the attitudes of people who are working within health and social care to see... how they may provide better care and what the levels of knowledge might be now. Because we have seen evidence in the past of mistreatment, people being laughed at because their bodies don't fit the expectations of the care workers.  And particularly I've seen occasionally if people are discriminated against by their peers in social care environments, then the health workers tend to go the same way.  Because our generation were people who more or less did what they were told to do, doctor knows best, we're not good at fighting for our rights.  And unless you're somebody who is already confident and out there, there's some evidence of people from our community being marginalized.  And I think that's really sad. The other area that we've done is an online survey.  with health and social care professionals.  There's quite a number of different survey questions that other people have used about attitudes towards trans people and sort of, if you like, measures of transphobia.  We've used some of those, but others are more tailored to.  what experiences might you have.  if you're working in health and social care, of working with people who identify as trans.  We've gone through different networks, GPs, local authorities to include social work, care homes, networks, just to give some examples. Using a trans person as the lead in the interviewing, is making the interviewee more comfortable.  It's partly about shared experiences and you upskill them, you really involve them.  Their confidence improves and afterwards they're able to go and do things that previously they'd never even thought of doing. There were people who were, I suppose you might say, late developers.  Most people kind of had always had some, or from quite an early age, aware of something different about them and the commonality in the non-acceptance.  That sort of struck me. If I as an older trans person had to go into care because I was starting to get Alzheimer's, would they see my trans status as confusion?  Or would I get to a point where I suddenly think, why is my body like this?  I'm not supposed to be out. We know very little about older trans people's experiences of aging, their expectations around aging, how earlier pivotal life events and moments in their biography have shaped and informed how they see themselves now and how they relate to other people now. We really haven't studied what it's like for somebody to be on cross-sex hormones for 40 or 50 years.  How early surgeries down in the 70s and 80s are performing now.  And the care workers have no concept.  Even of what that's about.  And my family doesn't talk to me in the main.  my granddaughter does but the rest of my family doesn't.  I look to the trans community for my support and when I go into care I don't want my family interfering because it probably wouldn't be in a positive way. and growing up in our era where information was television, newspaper and old books, you weren't going to find out about being trans, but with the internet you can just Google it, you know, I'm a boy who should be a girl.  Ooh, I'm not the only one. Yeah, exactly.  It's not only the information, but the feeling of I'm not the only one. So at the end of this project we're bringing together trans community members and small groups of health and social care professionals.  There's a series of workshops across Wales where we're going to present some of our initial findings and then use that as a basis to having a shared conversation together about Or what do we need to do in terms of developing some good practice guidelines? Getting the richness of people's stories out there is really important for health and social care professionals themselves, but for other community members and broader than that as well.  And showing the areas where there might be things in common, commonalities, showing the breadth of people's life experiences. And I think it's really important that as well as informing and providing resources for the health professionals, we also inform and train the trans community. I think at the end of the day, we want to ensure that Wales is a good place to be trans and to grow older.  And I hope that this research could inform that and be part of that bigger story.","channel.id":"clxmi0mat00v7cdvio57tdapf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCsDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA","channel.name":"My Genderation","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/g864bFMBAXso_fkzd73ZmSXVmy9E2HHX__MiClzVA-IEppDPNVUpMVC4-dH8_O59GaGahuLOLg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The project aimed to capture the life stories and experiences of older trans people in Wales, focusing on their experiences of transitioning, inclusion, hate crime, and aging.

Family game night!  Don't worry, I brought Twister.  Hey, Rosa.  This scene makes me cry every time I watch it.  Without any context, it's just some friends coming over to Rosa's house for a game night, which isn't that emotional.  But with the context from earlier in the episode, it's a beautiful moment about chosen family, acceptance, solidarity, and love.  In this video, I want to examine what makes this episode and this scene in particular work so well.  Because as we start to see more queer representation in mainstream media, we're seeing more and more coming out stories, and some are definitely told better than others.  So I want to look at this storyline with Rosa Diaz from Brooklyn Nine-Nine and talk about why.  I think it's an amazing example of how to tell a coming out story.  So, first off, let's look at Rosa's coming out arc as a whole and see how it affects her character moving forward.  In Season 5, Episode 9, titled 99, Rosa is dating someone and won't tell Charles who it is, even though he's determined to find out.  That's pretty typical for her character, who is known for being quiet and secretive.  And Charles' nosiness is also a well-established part of his character, since he always wants to be involved in everything that's happening.  Part of the way through the episode, Charles brings Rosa a glass of water and overhears her talking on the phone to a woman who calls her babe.  So he asks her what's going on, and she says, I'm dating a woman.  I'm bi.  Charles starts to say something about how he supports her, but she cuts him off and leaves the room.  It's a very Rosa-esque coming out, and that's important for making it work well and seem natural, because you could just toss a generic coming out story onto any character, but the ones that work the best are the ones that make sense for that character, because no two coming out stories are the same.  People come out in different ways, and a lot of factors can play a role in that, like how comfortable they are communicating their feelings and what kind of relationship they have with their family.  So a coming out story has to be tailor-made to fit the character and can't just be shoehorned in haphazardly.  Also for this story, it makes sense that Charles would be the one to pry this information out of Rosa, because that fits what we know about his character.  Telling a good coming-out story means just telling a genuinely good story with the characters you have, while also incorporating an authentic, relatable experience.  If the focus of your story is the drama and sensationalism of the coming out, and not the characters themselves, it will fall flat.  Characters make the story, and their desires and motivations should drive it, even in the case of a coming out story.  Like, it wouldn't make sense for Rose's character to open up to everyone emotionally without somehow being prompted to, because she almost never offers up information about her life until it's relevant.  So I love that the writers chose to have Charles kind of get that information out of her.  I mean, he doesn't out her, which would be very bad.  He just kind of stumbles upon the information and puts Rosa in a situation where it makes more sense for her to tell him than to keep hiding it from him.  Having one character intentionally out another is extremely malicious and hurtful and wouldn't really fit Brooklyn Nine-Nine's vibe.  So I think the Charles being nosy plot that they came up with to have her come out worked really well for the tone of the show.  In the next episode, titled Game Night, the main plotline follows Rosa as she tries to come out to her parents with Jake's help.  One thing I really like about this episode is that right off the bat, it addresses coming out as not a singular moment.  It's not like you come out and then you're done.  You come out to different people at different times in different ways, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine doesn't shy away from that.  There's also this incredible bye joke where Charles is trying to say goodbye to Rosa and keeps getting tripped up.  Bye, Rosa.  I mean, not bye, but bye!  I mean, see ya!  I mean, I had fun only having sex with men, just banging dudes left and right!  Rosa comes out to her friends in a very Rosa way, making a quick announcement and then leaving.  It's a very nonchalant coming out, and something that was really nice to see, since coming out can often be a negative experience.  In fact, another thing I like about this story is how it shows a wide range of reactions to Rosa's coming out.  There's Charles being awkward but supportive, her coworkers being pretty chill, and her parents being decidedly less chill.  It's not all good, and it's not all bad.  It shows the complexities of coming out, and the mixed emotions that someone can have when coming out to some people goes well while coming out to others doesn't go as well.  So later in the episode, we find out that Rosa's parents would rather Jake be cheating on his fianc\u00e9e with Rosa than for Rosa to not be straight.  Later, she finds out they're not mad, and they invite her to game night.  So she attends with Jake, only to find out that the only reason they're not mad is because they don't actually believe she's bi, and they think she'll end up with a man anyway.  So she storms off again.  When she sees her dad next, he apologizes to her and says he loves her no matter what, but he tells her that her mom needs some more time.  And so they put Game Night on hold.  It's a bittersweet ending that does really well to encapsulate the actual messiness of coming out.  Sometimes parents disagree.  Sometimes one might accept you while one won't.  Sometimes your parents might take some time and get over their prejudices because they love you, and other times they'll want to hold on to their prejudices.  It's never as easy or as simple as we'd like it to be, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine puts that messiness on display with Rosa's coming out story.  The other heartwarming part of this story is Jake and Rosa's friendship and the support that he gives her.  I love Jake and Rosa's relationship.  I feel like there's not enough examples of close platonic relationships between men and women in mainstream media.  But Jake and Rosa are so cute, and their dynamic is super funny.  So at the start of this episode, I was happy to see that Jake was going to be there helping Rosa, and the episode did not disappoint.  They covered a lot of ground and set a good example for what someone should do if they find themselves in a position where their friend has just come out.  Like, when they're first talking, Jake asks Rosa how coming out to her parents went, and she says that she hasn't told them yet.  And Jake's reply isn't like, well, why not?  Or, you need to tell them.  Instead, it's very understanding.  I haven't told him yet.  Really?  I mean, of course you don't have to, but I just thought you guys were getting closer since prison.  No, I mean, we are.  It's just, I don't know how I would say something like that.  Eventually, Jake gets roped into dinner with Rosa and her parents when she's planning to come out.  But when Rosa gets too nervous, Jake doesn't pressure her to come out or anything.  In fact, he agrees to lie to her parents about the two of them being in a relationship together so that they can get through the night.  It's important when you're coming out to have a friend who's understanding and will stick with you no matter what, and that's exactly what Jake is to Rosa.  Later, after Jake has been to family game night with Rosa and her parents, and her parents have said some pretty hurtful stuff to her, Jake and Rosa meet on the roof to talk about it.  Rosa says she's glad she told them, even if they didn't take it well, and Jake says this.  Yeah.  Still sucks, though.  Still sucks.  Now, that's not a huge, deep conversation, but it's a meaningful few words.  As a friend to someone who's just had a not-so-great coming out experience with their parents, you're not gonna be able to fix everything.  And while sometimes it's definitely helpful to tell people that things get better, sometimes you just need someone to recognize how bad your situation is and empathize with you.  That's what Jake does.  He doesn't try offering solutions.  He doesn't try fixing everything.  He doesn't reassure her that everything will be fine, because he doesn't know that it will be.  Instead, he just acknowledges Rosa's feelings and is there for her.  Sometimes, you just need someone to sit with you in the hurt.  And that's not a thing we get a lot of in TV shows, but it's something that's really important for life in general.  And then we get to the final scene in the episode.  Knowing that Rosa no longer has game night with her parents, Jake gathers together all their friends and brings them over to Rosa's place for a game night.  And honestly, I cannot think of a better way, plot-wise, to so clearly draw out the concept of a chosen family.  A chosen family is the people you choose to surround yourself with, either in place of or in addition to your related-by-blood family.  It's like a group of really close friends who you consider your family.  Anybody can have a chosen family, but it's a big thing in queer communities because so many queer people have been tossed aside by their families.  Chosen family is the kind of thing that surface-level stories about queer people almost never mention.  So to see chosen family be such a large theme in this episode makes the story feel incredibly authentic.  In this episode, Rosa's family is kind of represented by game night.  Game night is a recurring thing where the people that care about her take time out of their schedules to spend time with her because they love her.  At the beginning of the episode, that's her mom and dad.  But when they no longer want to have game night, Rosa feels relatively cut off from her family, even if her dad otherwise said some nice things to her.  She relies on game night for that emotional connection, even if she's too tough to admit it.  So with no game night, Rosa feels family-less.  That's why, when Jake and all of her friends rock up for game night, it's such an emotional moment.  It's not about the game.  It's about the fact that Rosa still has a family, even without her parents.  Her chosen family will always be there for her, will always offer her that support and emotional connection.  She does have a family, just not the same one she thought she had at the beginning of the episode.  And so I was already sobbing when everyone showed up at the door.  But then Holt comes over and talks to Rosa, and my tear response went through the roof.  Queer characters are rare, and multiple queer characters in the same show are even more rare.  But in this episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, we have an older gay man who came out decades ago having a conversation with a young bisexual woman who just came out.  That warms my heart so much, simply because these two characters get to exist in the same show.  But then, because Holt has been through this, he's able to say just the right things to Rosa.  Yeah, you should be very proud of yourself.  I know things aren't exactly the way you want to be right now, but I promise you they will improve.  Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place.  So, thank you.  Any character could have said this stuff to Rosa, but it's powerful coming from Holt.  Because you know he wishes.  that's what someone had said to him when he came out.  You can hear the emotion in his voice.  He wants to support her and reassure her without discounting how crappy it is to have her mom not accept her.  And when he says that things will get better, he's not speaking out of idealistic hope, but from experience.  This is one generation of queer people welcoming in the next generation of queer people.  I honestly kind of want to cry just thinking about it.  It's a beautiful moment, and I'm so proud of this show for giving these two incredible queer characters this moment.  And so that's how the episode ends.  From then on, Rosa's bisexuality, like most of the things in her personal life, isn't mentioned much.  There are some really cute scenes in the final episode of season five where Terry is trying to be supportive.  But you never know when you're gonna find your dream person.  Anyone on the street could be them.  All right, it feels like you googled how to talk to your bisexual friends.  Yeah.  And then Terry encourages Rosa to ask out their cab driver, a girl who Rosa is clearly captivated by.  It was just very cute, and I love this little look that they share at the end.  It was everything.  Later in season 6, we even get to meet Rosa's girlfriend, Jocelyn, in episode 11, and then she comes back in episode 14 when Rosa has to make some important relationship decisions.  Rosa's mom even makes a return for them to try and patch things up.  The great thing about how the show continues to handle her bisexuality is that it isn't her whole character, but it also isn't ignored.  It's a part of who she is, it affects her and it comes up sometimes, but it's not her only defining trait.  It's a perfect balance and one that I think other shows should aim to emulate with their queer characters.  So that's how Brooklyn Nine-Nine pulled off, in my opinion, one of the best coming out stories on TV.  They worked it into the story in a believable way, spread it out over the course of a couple episodes, tied in important queer themes, showed positive and negative reactions, and then allowed it to be a normal part of Rosa's life going forward.  That's how you tell a coming out story.  Anyway, that's all I had for you today.  If you'd like to support the production of more videos like this one, you can visit my Patreon.

This video is one that's been in the works for a long time, I've mentioned it before in other videos, and honestly, it's been difficult to approach.  Not simply due to the topic, but the seemingly unfeeling nature of the presenter.  The video comes from the Catholic podcast channel Wretched and is titled, though part of me can't quite believe that I'm saying this, How to Spank a Traumatized Child.  And I can't stress the content warning on this one enough.  If domestic abuse or violence against children is something that you find triggering, then please click away from this video.  My goal here is to educate as to the inherently abusive nature of Christianity.  I have no desire to cause anyone any undue harm in watching the following materials.  So with that stated, play the video. This is a good question, writes Joe.  Can you direct me to any resources, written or wretched, that can help us understand how to discipline a 7 to 12-year-old that have unfortunately gone through any type of trauma, abuse, or abuse earlier in their life?  I am really glad you're asking the question, Joe, because this is a tough one.  I suspect, I think that Joe and his wife are fostering kids.  They're maybe thinking about adopting kids.  And they want to be biblical.  They want to discipline the kids.  But here's the problem.  When a kid is traumatized, we think, and rightly so, that if we spank a child, the child is going to separate from us.  And that is indeed a consideration. If your main concern when physically hurting a child at any level, because that's what corporal punishment is, is how they will likely distance themselves from you, then you're not fit to be a parent or talk on the topic.  Corporal punishment is fundamentally abusive and cannot be administrated in any correct way to avoid said abuse.  And that's the sick irony here.  You pretend as if corporal punishment is something that can be considered as separate to abuse.  But it isn't.  It never has been.  It never will be.  Now I'd argue that whoever sent this letter in, given the context and understanding lended to said words by Todd Friel, should have any children currently under their guardianship taken away and should be barred from all forms of adoption or fostering.  Not because of some arbitrary quality of their persons, but because they are displaying the desire to adopt, only to actively abuse said children.  When you beat a child, you teach them two things.  First of all, you teach them that physical violence can be loving.  Second, you teach them that said violence is an effective means of controlling people.  It's a small step from physically hurting a child to teach them a lesson, to them physically hurting their future partner to teach them a lesson.  Nothing good has ever come from child abuse. Remember, traumatized kids, whether you want to call it RAD or not, reactive attachment disorder, there's also failure to thrive, post-traumatic, I think they're calling it infantile post-traumatic stress disorder.  Kids who were put up for adoption, they were in foster homes, they were mistreated and abused, they were traumatized as a child.  And they don't trust adults.  They don't bond to adults because they fear.  if they do that, then those people can break their heart the way that it was shattered into a million pieces when they were in a crib.  That is the core of the issue.  That a child who has been abused... is hoping, longing, wanting mommy and daddy to answer their cries, to hold and to snuggle and to console and to soothe and to feed and to change.  They're longing, longing, longing for it.  It doesn't happen.  And they are absolutely devastated.  Now, innately, they think, if I desire that type of relationship again, I'm going to experience the same pain again.  They cannot articulate this.  When you ask one of these kids who has RAD, what do you think?  I don't know.  And they don't.  Why do you do that?  I don't know.  And they don't.  They don't know.  They can't articulate it.  Maybe years later they can.  There is hope.  I saw the story again of a young lady.  She was wicked awful.  Woo!  If I recall the details, she was a foster kid, and this girl was just flat out.  Today she's a nurse, and she's trying to help our AD kids.  there's hope, but it is very difficult because of the bonding issue.  They fear, profoundly fear that if I desire to be loved again, consider the implications for that.  If I desire to be loved again, I'm going to feel that pain again.  So the last thing I'm going to do is desire to be loved.  So what does this child do?  They seek to do everything to separate themselves from their new adoptive parents, their foster parents.  and they will destruct, they will disrupt, they will do anything necessary to push them away.  They do not want that parenting bond because they're horrified of it.  Enter the Christian parent.  They want to be biblical and do what the Bible says without caveats.  There are no caveats in the Bible.  The corporal punishment is, I should say, corporal discipline is a more precise word, is biblical, and it's replete throughout the Proverbs, and there's no caveat that says, unless, of course, this. Actually, the Bible is very clear that capital punishment is the proper punishment.  Leviticus chapter 20 verse 9 reads as quote, A sentiment repeated in Proverbs.  chapter 20 verse 20 with the poetic flair in quote, If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.  End quote.  But just in case that left any doubt, we have Jesus himself apparently speaking in Matthew chapter 15 verses 4 to 11, which read as quote, \"'For God said, Honor your father and mother, and anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to  death.'.  But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is devoted to God, they are not to honor their father or mother with  it?'.  Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.  You hypocrites!  Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you.  These people honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.  They worship me in vain.  Their teachings are merely human rules.  Jesus called the crowd to him and said, Listen and understand, what goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles  them.\".  End quote.  So you're not only trying to trivialise your support of child abuse by changing corporal punishment to corporal discipline, softening the term for the listener, but you've already chosen to ignore the fact that the Bible very clearly lays out capital punishment for troubled children, whilst fighting adamantly for corporal punishment.  So if you've already ignored one part, why not ignore the other part?  It seems a little selective to stick by one whilst pretending the other doesn't exist.  It seems to suggest that deep down you lack the desire or conviction to stand with Biblical teaching, instead you want to use religion as an excuse to abuse children.  Which is fucking sick.  I don't get how else to describe it.  So, sick will have to do for now.  But trust me, it's going to get a whole lot worse as the video progresses. So you have the challenge, Joe, or you if you have adopted or foster a child, to rightly initiate corporal discipline.  Now, there are some things to be remembered here when you're dealing with the adopted kid or the foster kid.  If you spank them, they are like, oh good, I'm safe from them.  Why would they get that impression?  Is it because of the paddle or is it because of the paddler?  And I would suggest to you.  it's the latter.  If you're not applying discipline, which is discipleship, lovingly, calmly, rightly, and never in anger, They aren't going to get that sense that you're being cruel to them and that they are successfully disrupting the potential bond between the two of you.  They won't get that if you're doing it rightly.  So the only advice that I'm aware of, I haven't seen anybody that's written anything on this.  I suspect I might be.  Maybe I've got a bunch of stuff in the queue, but I would like to get to this someday.  I'm not aware of anything.  that is out there that deals with this issue in any helpful sort of way in enduring and understanding it.  So I can't recommend anything, but I recommend this.  Set up the rules for your corporal discipline.  Explain it to your foster or adopted children lovingly, Here's why we're doing this.  Here are the lines.  Don't let them be arbitrary.  One day it's this, the next day it's that.  Stick to your own rules, explain it to them in advance, and then carrying it out when you are calm and not furious.  If you do it in anger, if you don't do it lovingly, then you are indeed giving the child exactly what they're looking for, and that is separation from you.  But if you love on them, hold them, hug them, Maybe cry with them, although a lot of RAD kids won't cry.  They don't feel the pain sometimes.  But if you are sensitive and loving in that instance, then you've got to do what the Bible says you've got to do.  Just follow the rules. There's no such thing as a loving way to beat your child.  And this is a problem at the very core of the Christian doctrine, the idea that violence can be an act of love towards the victim.  It can't.  It doesn't matter whether it's eternal torture, caning a child, or giving your wife a black eye.  These are all fundamental symptoms of the same warped perspective of love.  Abuse is not love, and it's sick of you to even suggest that.  All you will do by pretending that your violence is love is create future abusers.  There is no excuse for this.  The destructive impact that this will have on any child, let alone a child with prior history of abuse, is massive, and I know what's coming, oh well, I grew up with corporal punishment and it never did me any harm.  You forgot the fact that you think beating a child is okay.  This is why sexual and domestic violence is so rampant.  It's beaten into us, rather literally in some cases, that this is a normal avenue for love.  It's not, it's sick, it's wrong, and all of those involved need to face prosecution.  This show has 184,000 subscribers, and its host is openly promoting child abuse, and no one's calling him out on it. And by the way, quite honestly, those rules apply even if your child isn't adopted.  That's just the way you've got to do it.  You've got to do it that way.  Now, there's some people who've got even more unique challenges.  If you've got a child who has special needs, well, now what do you do?  Well, it needs to be communicated at that level where they can understand it.  But even then, some sort of corporal discipline should be happening.  Please keep in mind, for some kids it's more than others.  And I do believe, and this is a careful biblical counseling consideration, sometimes We can look at a situation and consider extenuating circumstances to potentially moderate our response.  For instance, your child is very, very, very sensitive and gets very distraught and sometimes angry if they see violent things.  Okay, so your kid comes home from school and he's being really naughty.  What's up, son?  Well, it turns out that during the day in one of their classes, as far too many teachers do these days, they show them movies.  So they showed the kid Saving Private Ryan and it agitated him.  Now he comes home and he's sinning all over the place because of it.  What do you do?  Well, it depends on what your rules are in advance, but the sin is still his.  And yet you go, but I understand why.  And it can moderate your response to that.  And the same thing is true with a special needs child.  You can moderate your response because it could be their organic problem and challenge that is causing that.  Nevertheless, they're still responsible for it.  So moderate, think about the correct response, do it lovingly without yelling, no matter what sort of child you have.  Doesn't matter, IQ or otherwise, behavioral issue or otherwise, be super loving about it.  And remember, some of them, it doesn't take much.  It could just be a scowl, frankly, that wilts them.  and apply it biblically and lovingly because it is commanded and it is a part, not of discipline per se, but discipleship.  You don't do your kid a favor when you never do that. I'm fucking done.  Like, what can I say to that?  This guy is not only supporting child abuse for the previously abused, but disabled children.  What can I say to that outside of reiterating my utter disgust at the fact that people like this not only exist, but they're incredibly popular in Christian circles?  Todd is not only warping the definition of love to include physical violence, but is willing to do mental backflips to shirk God's responsibility if they do exist.  Oh yes, it's the disabled child's sin, ignoring the fact that according to the Christian doctrine, their disability is entirely God's decision.  So any impact this has on their behaviour is by proxy God's choice.  And I honestly don't know what's worse here, the fact that they support corporal punishment, or the fact that they're remaining incredibly vague about what it encompasses.  He's very clearly taking active steps to avoid noting what corporal punishment is.  It's physically harming someone in order to try and teach them a lesson, very often via beating.  But there are also other means to do so, each one more abhorrent than the last.  We've had countless children die as a result of so-called biblical parenting.  And this man is supporting the system which allows for that.  Sure, he says moderate, don't do it out of anger, he says do it out of love.  But who decides what is moderate and what isn't?  Who decides what's anger and what's self-righteousness?  Who decides what is love and what's abuse?  The vagueness in his talking points not only prevents a detailed critique, it jeopardises the child of every Christian parent listening in.  So how do you properly beat your child?  Don't.  How do you properly beat your previously abused or disabled child?  Don't you fucking dare.  And there's not a whole lot more I can say on the matter, to be honest.  Though, what do you guys think?  Should people forwarding corporal punishment be held responsible for the dead children at their door?  Is there anything that I missed that you picked up on?

Well, it's been nine months since I posted a video, so if you're watching this, thanks for not giving up on me.  Thanks for being interested when you were notified that I'm making a video.  So, if you watched maybe the last couple of videos, you'll probably not be surprised to hear that the main reason I haven't made videos for a while now is because my daughter was a senior in high school.  And then now she's starting college next month.  You know, it just was a lot.  It was a lot to... um, go through as a parent and to go through with her and to be supportive and try to be able to, uh, I guess just stay on top of everything that needs to be stayed on top of.  Um, maybe some of you have been on one side of that.  Some of you on the other, some of you have been through both of those as a parent and a child.  And, um, So good news, though, she did graduate totally fine, did really well.  Well, she like grades and stuff like that is important to to her.  And she knows that from her parents.  that she can go to school or college or not go to college or, you know, like trying not to hyper focus on the achievement part of things.  But she enjoys achieving and also knows that it should not be at the sacrifice of her health and wellness and her social life and things like that.  So I think she's found starting to find a good balance for all of that.  She's going to go to a school in Boston.  and is nervous and excited which i am also nervous and excited for her.  so uh but however she doesn't go for another month or so and i thought well i won't make videos until she gets out there but that's silly.  i think i just needed to sit down get this one video out real quick just to get myself back into the habit of talking to you and sharing things.  so this video is just going to be this me letting you know that.  um I've missed talking to you.  I've missed our connection and I want to be able to pick that up again.  So I'm going to do videos that aren't going to be highly edited because I want to be able to like record them and pretty much just post them the same day that I record them.  I still have a very full client schedule.  And so it's hard for me to sometimes fit in things like this, but it's going to be a big priority for me to do that.  And then once my daughter goes to school, I think I'm going to really work on having a new schedule so that I can be able to do this more often.  And then I think I still will put together videos that are edited, but it's kind of like Shane Dawson comes out with edited videos every few months.  Mine won't be as extensive or long as Shane Dawson's, but I think it's fun.  I think it's a great creative outlet.  Maybe I'll put together stories about my own upbringing and then me being a non-binary person.  elder and realizing that later in life and things like that, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  I'll talk about that later.  I just wanted to say hi.  I just wanted to make myself sit down before I start my client day to let you know that I missed you and I'm going to start posting videos again.

But we're all alone in here.  It's not very big. It's a chapel. So we thought, since we're the only ones in here, we would talk about Detective Pikachu for a little bit. Which we saw yesterday. Before we move on to the next section of the museum.  Why not?  I'm not at all a hardcore Pokemon fan.  I wouldn't even really consider myself a fan of Pokemon.  I've only played one game.  It was the Nintendo DS game Pokemon Pearl, and I did really enjoy it, but I haven't played it for many, many years, and I never really watched the show.  I have a little bit of knowledge of it. I've played Pokemon Black, and I like Smash Bros, and I'm a Nintendo fangirl, so I have some knowledge.  My favorite Pokemon is Audino. And Audino is in... A movie.  Just in the background.  Yep.  It's a good film.  It was good! We went and saw it on a whim yesterday.  We didn't really plan it. And that was just after Sarah coming in from a long flight.  So I'm impressed that neither of us fell asleep. I actually watched a ton of films yesterday because I was on the plane.  Basically for those I had been kind of checking to see how much time has passed.  Detective Pikachu, I wasn't doing that, and obviously, like, because there's not a duration. You can't just touch the cinema screen and see how long the film has left. Yeah, even still, like, I was really engaged pretty much immediately. It was very interesting. Yeah, it was. I do want to point out that there is a wheelchair-using character who uses... A lot of ableist language. Like, confined to, restricted by language, which isn't great.  And I certainly felt like my enjoyment of the film was improved by knowing about the character beforehand, but a little spoiled by the character, by those tropes existing.  But it also didn't ruin my whole enjoyment of the film. Definitely.  I mean that and I think the fact that there was one Japanese character in the whole movie. It continues the strange tradition of stories and adaptations that originated in Japan having a very low number of Japanese people.  Japanese people involved.  Yeah. There was one character played by Ken Watanabe.  He was really amazing.  I'm not saying that he wasn't, but just because he was the only Japanese person in the film, his role in it did feel a little bit more like a wise Japanese person. He was a cop.  He was fairly grounded, but he was still somewhat tokenistic. And just the knowledge that he had to offer Justice Smith, the main character, kind of put him in there, especially because he was the only one.  But it was so good.  And I also just didn't know what to expect because, like I said, I'm not a Pokemon fan.  But it was so much fun.  Yeah.  There were quite a few good jokes. And I felt like it balanced genuine humor and genuine emotion pretty well without either puncturing the other.  Justice Smith was great. Justice Smith was so, so good in this movie.  And I've liked him since I saw him in Paper Towns and I've kind of been following him and he was just really great.  Like the other character that's his age, her name is Lucy.  I don't remember what her name is, but... Her actress's name, no.  Yeah.  But she was very... She was great.  I didn't think she was in it enough. No, I agree. There was a lot of emotion in this story. Yeah.  Like I said, it was very well balanced. It was well balanced between humor, but also allowing space for there to be real like emotional weight to any given scene. Whenever Detective Pikachu was speaking, outside of, like, sad moments, it was always hilarious. It was!  I didn't know what to expect with Ryan Reynolds doing the voice of Pikachu, but he was very fun.  Yes.  And I definitely feel like\u2014there I go again with the glasses.  And I definitely feel like it worked. Do you want some glasses?  Stop it! You know, if they continue to do movies in this series, like, I would definitely see sequels of this movie.  Like, that's how much I enjoyed it. They really nailed the idea of showing Pokemon and humans together in the photorealistic manner, which we have seen in the anime and in the games, but it was nice to see it in the photorealistic manner.  And something we talked about was that the furry Pokemon looked a bit better than the skin Pokemon. Yeah, the furry Pokemon looked really good.  skin sort of Pokemon like the Bulbasaurs and I literally know none of the others. Anything with smooth skin. I mean the Charizard looked really good because they were trying to obviously emulate like lizard-like skin. Yeah.  Pikachu looked really good. And they clearly put the most time into animating Pikachu, which I think was a really good call.  Some of them, it really depends. It's not a spoiler because Mewtwo is in the trailer, but Mewtwo looks... Pretty good. Looks decent, yeah. Like, could look a bit more photorealistic, but everything Mewtwo does is cool. But they also, like, I think they do a good job of explaining, like, why Mewtwo could actually have a little bit of room to look different than the rest of them.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well written the story was and actually a pretty compelling mystery.  Not that like you can't see where it's going or anything, but like there were actually a lot of kind of moving components of it that did pleasantly surprise me.  Like when they finally did come together, I actually thought like, oh, okay.  I mean, a mark of a good mystery I think is that as it's getting closer to the ending, you can see where it's going and then you're like, oh, all of that makes so much sense.  I thought it was really good. I agree. I mean, it's not, like, the most mind-boggling mystery that, like, ever has been conceived.  I would definitely say go see it. Yeah. If you're not sure that you're gonna enjoy it because, like, you're not, like, a hardcore Pok\u00e9mon fan, if you're immersed in nerd culture, if you're, like, my age, you have probably learned enough about Pok\u00e9mon, like, just through playing Pok\u00e9mon Go or just... knowing other people who like it to understand the things that would best help you.  And I think one of the biggest things that this movie has going for it is that you didn't need to know all that stuff.  You didn't need to be a hardcore Pokemon fan to enjoy this movie because it was a good movie. Yeah.  But if you are a fan, there are some nice treats, mostly in the form of visual. Definitely. Spotting your favorite Pokemon in the background. Yeah. But also nice little bits like nods to the background of some Pokemon.  Stuff like that. Most definitely. Yeah, go see it.  I think it's worth seeing. It was fun.  If you're waffling on whether or not to go and see it, go see it. It's worth it.  I think that's all we can really say about that. Yeah, I definitely don't want to spoil anything. And since we're not on script, I'm taking responsibility for making us wrap up. If you've seen Detective Pikachu, let me know what you think in the comments.  We had a really great time, and I'm sure that you would too if you go and see it, and you should. It was nice to join you to talk about it. Yeah, thank you for being here.  Thank you for joining me for this very casual review on my smartphone in a different location than usual.

So for those of you who don't know me, my name is Luke and I am a 22 year old trans guy living in Melbourne.  My family is originally from Adelaide in South Australia, but I grew up in Hong Kong and that's where my family currently live.  So I kind of don't really feel very Australian, but I also don't really feel like I'm from Hong Kong.  I kind of just feel like I'm from nowhere really.  That's just sort of... how that has turned out for me.  As for what I'm doing, I've just recently graduated from my Bachelor of Science.  I majored in Physiology and Developmental Biology.  This year, I'm taking a year off studying.  Next year, I'm going to be doing honors for my Bachelor of Science.  I'm really keen to do it in the field of disorders of sex development, and then hopefully, hopefully, fingers crossed, I'm aiming to get into medicine.  I'm applying for med school.  I'm doing the GAMSAT this year, and hopefully, I'll get into med in 2021.  If I don't, then I don't, and I'll work it out then, but that's in the next couple couple years of my life that I've kind of planned out so far.  I realized I was trans when I was about 14 years old and I started social transitioning when I was probably about 16 or 15.  I was very much still in the closet with my family and since I went to boarding school I was able to kind of almost have two different lives which was definitely very intense.  but it was great that I was able to have that space to kind of be myself and kind of explore my identity without having to worry about the consequences of people not liking it.  Everyone at school kind of already knew that I was either gay or just not straight cis girl.  I had really short hair and I started going by a variation of my birth name.  that was like more gender neutral.  So pretty much everyone knew but it wasn't really official and I wasn't officially out and I wasn't officially transitioning until I was about 17 or 18.  I was on testosterone on October 7th in 2014.  So I just turned 18.  I turned 18 that July.  I legally changed my name around the same time as then.  I came out to my parents for probably I think maybe the third or fourth time.  And once I started testosterone, my experience with my family completely changed.  They used to be quite unsupportive and very confused about my gender.  And they definitely were processing a lot of their own personal feelings about it.  I'm really grateful to say that after I started transitioning medically with testosterone, my parents completely did a 180 and now they're my biggest supporters.  I had my top surgery in July of 2015.  I had periareolar with Dr.  Steve Martin, very, very happy with that.  I had a hysterectomy last year in September of 2018.  I don't know when this video is going up, I'm filming this way in advance, but I will most likely currently be recovering from first stage of radiopharm phalloplasty with Dr.  Gozin in Brisbane, Australia.  If I am not posting in the next couple of weeks, that's probably why I'm still recovering.  Thank you to everyone who's already, you know, given me some kind words and support.  It's been pretty difficult in the lead up to this and I've been pretty stressed about it, but you know, I know that this is the right decision for me and I'm really, really happy that I'm able to have the surgery and also be able to show other people that it's possible.  all really from me.  this video is going to be super super quick.  i'm going to leave you in the very capable hands of everyone else until i can kind of get back on my feet.  i don't know when that will be but hopefully i'm thinking i'll be back probably end of february so i will see you guys.  then if you guys have any questions or anything you want to ask me feel free to leave them down in the comments.  i'm very very keen to be engaged with comments.  i traditionally have been.  i love that aspect of transvestite that sort of community that we're able to kind of build and that I'm able to talk to people and they're able to talk to me and, you know, it's not just me filming videos and then me putting them up.  I like that.  there's sort of that human interaction there.  I really enjoy that about this channel.  But yeah, that's all from me.  I will see you guys when I see you next time.

My name is Adam.  I look like a mess.  I need to shower.  I'm not binding, but this is me.  Deal with it.  So the thing is, today we're gonna be talking and asking the question of do all trans people that are famous have to be activists and have to speak up for trans rights?  so the thing about it is I have quite like two opinions.  I think it's so nice to have social responsibility.  I think it's so nice to talk about the rights of people that cannot speak for themselves whether they are in dangerous situations or whatever.  just by you speaking up their parents might see it.  you might change a lot of people's perspectives on this and you're gonna help them.  but do I realistically think that everyone has social responsibility?  I do not think so.  Also, it gets a little bit tricky in a sense of like, I don't like the idea that trans people, all of them have to be like politically woke or politically liberal or just all trans people having to belong to one thing.  You know, that is the... kind of thought that I always try to argue with.  I do not agree.  I think trans people come in all shapes and forms.  I always say this.  If you are conservative and you're trans, you are still trans.  You are not less trans.  I don't like the idea of Trans people, like when you say trans people, you imagine them all to be androgynous or you imagine them all to be passive.  These are the two extremes.  I don't agree with neither.  I think we can be anything.  I think it takes a lot to get to this.  quite like open-minded mindset, if that makes sense.  Literally, trans people are just like anyone else.  They just happen to be trans.  That is the idea that I personally adopt, but I feel like being trans became more than being trans with time.  It became more.  It's, I don't know, I feel like it took one specific stereotype.  Again, I don't like that.  I think trans people can be religious and cannot be religious, can be passing, cannot be passing, can be activists, cannot be activists, can be smart, cannot be smart, can be good looking, cannot be good looking.  Exactly.  That is the point.  They are like anyone else.  a lot of trans people kind of want to set us, or trans activists want to set us quite apart from the rest.  We are trans, we are not like everyone else in a lot of senses, but yeah, we do have experiences that are not like others, but we are just going through life like anyone else, and we have our struggles that are not necessarily trans-related.  I get that being trans is very important in our journey.  I mean, who are you talking to?  I flew the world for being trans, technically, and it's a very important part.  It's like if I don't mention me being trans, talking about my past is going to be a little mysterious.  I think there is a new trans movement that agrees with me, which is good.  And there is a trans movement that is the opposite of what I think and that just wants to make us all look like one thing.  I don't agree, that's all.  I don't think anybody can or should be an activist or politically involved if they don't have the intellectual knowledge that comes with it, you know?  Anyway, thank you guys for watching this video, and let me know, do you think all trans people that are famous have to be activists and have to speak up about all of these issues?  I'm curious to know, and I hope I'm not the only one that thinks whatever the hell I'm thinking.  And it's okay.  if you don't agree with me, just let me know.  I'll see you in another video.

So I posted a video and I was talking about my, you know, hormones and things like that.  And I referred to myself as a non-binary elder.  And this is a phrase I've been using for, I think, a couple of years now.  And, you know, these things just kind of pop in your head and It seems like it maybe is a good idea and it fits right and it conveys a message and maybe also conveys like a feeling of sorts.  And so, so far it seems like most folks have been, they connect with it.  Like other people who are non-binary are able to, it helps designate that I am older than people who are non-binary and realizing this at younger ages.  and a lot of people like hearing from people who are older.  So here's the question I have for you is that I shared that, video on Instagram and somebody had mentioned that they didn't think I should use that.  Now, here's the thing I think is confusing.  They said you shouldn't use the word elderly to describe yourself because I think of that more as people who are older than you are, Dara.  And so the thing is that I definitely was not using the word elderly.  I agreed that that would not be accurate.  And so sorry about that.  Um, what I am wondering, even though that wasn't the word that I was using, I did kind of take a step back and think about the word elder.  And I wanted to see if I want to see what you think of that.  I guess I think of it in a way where somebody who is elder sometimes is just older than somebody else.  Maybe it's not like in terms of indicating that somebody is much, much older or a certain age group or second decade of age.  I have a friend who calls themselves an elder and they're only 35 years old and I'm 45 years old, but they are still older in terms of growing up as a teenager, not knowing that being non-binary was an option.  So, but I want to be sensitive.

Hello Cinnamon Bun!  I know it's been kind of a while since we've done like one of these type of videos rather than one of the vlogs because I've been super busy and trying to get my life together and the vlogs are a lot easier to do kind of on the go, run and gun, instead of setting up and preparing and doing like a different type of video like this.  So The reaction in the comments to this video is going to be interesting because some of you are going to be like, yes, Rachel, we know, duh.  And some people are going to be like, what the hell is she talking about?  So we'll see how that goes.  So hello, little update, something you may or may not have known about me.  I'm a witch.  I've been a practicing witch for years, a long time actually.  I first sort of got into it in 2000 and, oh my god, when would that have been?  2011?  12?  I want to say.  Was into it big time for a while and then kind of just fell away from it for a few years.  Kind of took a break.  Wasn't really... Yeah, I had some complicated feelings about it.  But a few years back, I got back into it again and have been, yeah, practicing witch for... what is time i want to say like at least three years now like since i've come back to it.  so it's been a thing in my life for a while now and i'm not gonna go into a ton of details about like my history as a witch and like what kind of witch i am and like my beliefs and all that kind of stuff and If you are interested in that stuff then I can do a Q&A about it.  so let me know in the comments below if that is something that you would like me to do.  but I'm not going to spend a big chunk of this video going over that because I could talk about it forever.  The only thing I do want to note I guess is that I am a witch but I'm not a Wiccan if that is something that anyone cares about.  So obviously this is not something that has been super prominent I guess on my YouTube channel for the entire time that I've had the channel.  So for the most part I've kept my witchy side and yeah the craft and magic and all of that separate from YouTube and writing and everything else that I do on YouTube.  What even is this channel anymore?  I just like to make videos about things that I'm interested in and that I think are helpful or useful.  So why did I do that?  Why did I kind of like segregate this one area of my life away from YouTube?  I mean obviously I don't share everything on YouTube.  I'm not like a daily vlogger or something where you're seeing all the different parts of my life.  But I do share a lot of my life on YouTube in my videos either through the vlogs or just talking about my experiences when I'm chatting in other videos.  But yeah, so the witchcraft question has been hanging around and kind of haunting me a little bit for quite a while now.  And my channel is known for writing and storytelling.  That is what I started making videos about.  That is what I teach for my job in terms of how I make the money and not just like making videos for fun.  That is what most people would call my niche on YouTube.  And if you're trying to be like really businessy and to use YouTube as a marketing tool and not just an expressive outlet, people definitely recommend that you niche down as much as you can.  And while I do use YouTube for my business, that is a big truck, I don't want that to be all I use it for.  I want to still enjoy creating for YouTube for its own sake, because otherwise, why am I doing this?  So I've had ideas for videos and things I would like to talk about when it comes to witchcraft, magic, ritual, all of that kind of stuff for a long time and I've always, oops, sorry, just whacked my mic there.  I've never been sure if that is a good idea because I don't really want to split my audience or I didn't want to split my audience because obviously there's going to be people who are interested in the writing stuff and there's going to be people who are interested in the witchcraft stuff and there's probably going to be people that are interested in both.  but there's also going to be a lot of people who aren't and it's it's becoming a lot more of a thing now.  it's becoming a lot more common and people are a lot more open and stuff about it.  ooh a magpie two magpies.  thanks guys what was i saying?  but the people who aren't into it and maybe don't know anything about it can be put off by it and I guess I was worried about that.  I was worried that people were gonna judge me.  I have probably an unhealthy amount of my like self-esteem and self-worth as like tied up with like my intelligence and logic and analysis and all that stuff.  I studied philosophy and and so yeah there's like these like long standing kind of like shadows and baggage and stuff around like being open about this side of myself which is a big part of me.  so those are some of the reasons I wanted to keep YouTube and my witchy side separate but I don't want to anymore.  I've decided I don't want to anymore because First of all, I'm tired of like kind of trying to keep these things separate when like it's all just me.  It's all part of me.  This is like a big part of my life and it affects the way that I come to things.  And it's also, it also provides me with tools that are really useful that I would like to share with the people who are interested in that.  And also, I think I've just realized that the kind of people that I want to work with in terms of, yes, my business-y side and stuff, the kind of people that I want to work with are the kind of people that aren't put off by that and who are interested in it as well.  Like, I am a witch.  That's the perspective that I come to a lot of subjects with and I want to work with other people who also have that perspective and who also look at things in that way and use that paradigm.  So why am I telling you all of this?  What does this mean for my channel?  Are things changing?  And if so, how are they changing?  Yeah, so my channel is changing a little bit and this video is kind of a bit of an update on that, kind of let you guys know what is coming.  I'm bringing witchcraft and magic and ritual and all that kind of stuff to my channel.  It's not changing the entire direction of my channel.  I'm not like no longer going to speak about writing and suddenly I'm only talking about witchy stuff or doing the vlogs or whatever.  It's just going to be an addition to what is already on the channel.  So when I'm talking about writing, I may mention things that are related to witchcraft or magic if it's relevant to what I'm talking about in the video.  I used to censor that stuff.  I used to clip that stuff out of my scripts.  even when it made sense to me to talk about it because it was helpful for understanding what I was talking about I used to kind of just clip all that out to keep it more mainstream and more secular.  I'm not going to do that anymore.  so you might hear mentions of this kind of stuff in my regular writing videos and I'm going to be making videos about witchcraft and magic and that kind of topic and those kinds of things by themselves.  So I am actually filming this because I am putting out, it should already be out I guess by the time you watch this, a spell video.  My first spell video.  It's a spell for bright ideas and story solutions and getting unstuck with creative endeavours.  in my case, writing and then probably in yours as well.  But it works for all sorts of creative endeavors.  So I'm really excited about this video.  It's so good.  I absolutely love this spell.  And that's part of the reason I wanted to upload this as well and to just kind of let you know what the deal is with that.  So yeah, so there's going to be now like dedicated witchcraft content on my channel, but it's not going to be the only thing.  I'm still going to talk about writing.  I'm still going to make the other kinds of videos that I already make.  So I already know that even though I've not been, you know, super forthright and upfront about the fact that I am a witch, it's a thing I do.  I still manage to attract a lot of witches or people who are interested in magic and witchcraft and that kind of thing.  So I know that a lot of you or a lot of people are gonna absolutely love this change and they're gonna be really excited about it and they're gonna be like, this is like another kind of content that I'm really excited about from you and some people are just not going to be that into it and that's okay.  If you like my videos on writing and my content about that but you're not interested in any of this witchy stuff at all that's totally fine.  I have not changed, like.  this is not a new thing for me.  like I said I have been a witch for a long time.  so it's still the same person making these writing videos which may mention witchcraft and that made all those other writing videos that you like.  So this isn't, like, my perspective hasn't changed in a drastic way, you're just getting a fuller picture of where I'm coming from and the kinds of tools that I like to use.  If even mentions of magic or spirituality and stuff in my videos about writing is too much for you and you're just like, no, I don't like it, it's not for me, then there are plenty of other secular videos about writing out there and I wish you all the best and you are not obligated by any means to watch my videos.  You don't have to, it's fine.  For those of you who are into it and are excited about it, You can expect, like I said, like mentions maybe of tools and things which go along with writing topics and the writing craft stuff which are maybe more magical in my regular videos.  You can expect spell videos like the one that I have just put out.  It feels weird to say that because I haven't actually shot it yet but it should be out by the time you're watching this.  And like coffee ramble videos where I just chat about, you know, a particular topic in witchcraft or spirituality or whatever.  And I do still want to keep the focus on writing and creativity, so I will always prioritise videos about witchcraft which are related to writing, which kind of cover that intersection of writing or creativity and magic.  Those are the things that I am most interested in, although I might delve a bit further, a bit more of a tangent out from that sometimes, if that makes sense.  Okay, does that about cover it?  I think so.  I'm very interested to hear what you guys are going to think of this.  If you are interested in a Q&A on my witchhood, that's an interesting phrase, about my history with witchcraft and what kind of witch I am and maybe some of my beliefs and things.  or just anything about that stuff, I guess.  Then please do let me know in the comments if you would like to do a Q&A about that, because I can do that.  But I just didn't want to spend this video trying to justify things.  because first of all I don't have to justify anything to you and also y'all don't need that in this video.  so I will leave it at that.  you can check out my first spell video.  like I said it's going to be the bright ideas spell so it's for getting unblocked when it comes to your creativity or writing.  if you've got a big stack of things that you know you need to figure out for a particular project or story then it's really good for that.  I'm using it right now and I can't wait to share it with you.  So go and check that out.  It will be... I'll try and do the card thing, if that works.  But it will definitely be in the description.  And yeah, that's about it.  I'll speak to you soon.  And take care, cinnamon bun.  Wow, you're really not great at the words yet.  We need to get some more of this into my body.  Oh fuck, I wanted some incense, didn't I?  I can't be asked.  See I have this thing where every time I sit down to make a video I want to sit down with like a fresh cup of like coffee or tea or whatever.  If I'm making like a proper coffee and sitting down with that to make a video then it means that I don't have any caffeine in my system for setting up the entire video which is not ideal because it can be quite frustrating as a process.  I'm going to have to rethink that in future, I think.","channel.id":"clxmi0r7004awcdvi35jusdms","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCXjda70KpggxCpmrLpxdHuw","channel.name":"Rachael Stephen","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/np6OxA__VgCJbk5OIlCijDSyBJv5-JmLOOcSZaTlE69txJqSDb4AyF2v4d3P8KgdD5IVi3i7=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, I'm excited to share a personal update with you all.

Imagine spending the rest of your life revising this one story.  Hello, Cinnamon Bun.  If you are feeling a little bit overwhelmed with where to start revising your story, good God, you are not alone.  That's why in this video, I want to give you some clarity and focus on where to begin with your revision.  how to go about it and how not to go about it.  By the end of this video, yes, you will still have a lot of work ahead of you, but hopefully you will have a path instead of feeling like you're surrounded by noveling wilderness with no idea which direction you're gonna go.  When I started trying to revise my first novel, it was completely ineffectual and basically everything that I did there, I did not keep into further revisions.  10 years later though, I feel like I have complete clarity about the revision process.  That doesn't mean it's always easy, but no matter what happens, I always know what my next step is.  And that can be such a relief.  Offering practical and procedural solutions to writing problems is kind of my thing.  And it's why the majority of writers that I work with in one-to-one Skype sessions end up becoming repeat clients.  So today let's apply that to revision.  I have seven guiding principles to share with you.  Number one is to let it rest.  You cannot revise a story that you have just finished writing.  You have to let it rest a little while before you come back to it.  How long exactly you let it rest for is up to you and how much time you have.  But unless you're on a publishing deadline, I would aim for getting at least a month away from it.  This fallow time is really, really important.  And I know that you are desperate to start getting in there and fixing all the stuff that you know is wrong with it.  But trust me, really try to enjoy this break from your story.  You could spend it not writing at all, taking a break completely.  You could spend it working on a different project, or you could even spend it kind of developing your skills as a writer, you know, doing and writing exercises or challenges and kind of getting experimental.  All of these are worthwhile ways to spend that time away from your story.  when you come back to it.  The next thing to remember is substance before style.  This one is so important that I would like to have it engraved on a gold plaque and hung on my front door.  It's a motto that you might have heard me use before.  Take any part of your story, take a paragraph or scene, a whole chapter or even a whole subplot, there is absolutely no point in polishing that up to read beautifully if you don't know yet if it deserves to be in this story.  There's no pain worse than working really hard on polishing up, say, three chapters, making them sound absolutely amazing, and then realising that they actually all need to go in the bin.  You've already put your time and effort and brainpower into writing the first draft of this scene.  You do not want to add any more to that before establishing that this really is a crucial part of the story and it's going to be in the final version.  You fix the story, what is actually happening to the characters, before you spend one minute making anything stylish or beautiful or read well.  That means even before fixing typos too.  There is no point beautifully reupholstering a sofa in silk when the frame has been eaten by termites and the second anyone sits on it, it's gonna come crashing down.  So here's a tip for determining if what you're working on is substance or style.  Substance is the raw material of what happens in the story and why, what it means.  Style is everything about the way that you present that raw material.  Substance is character motives, conflict, plot, resolutions, world building, all the things that would stay if your story was going to be adapted into another medium.  Prose The individual sentences that you use to convey these things, word choice, spelling, grammar, imagery, all that stuff, that is all style.  So remember, always revise to fix substance before style.  A third piece of advice is to go in with a system or a plan.  A system plan.  A plan system, if you will.  A plan of attack.  Writing a first draft obviously has its own struggles, but one great thing about it is that most of us know that when you get to the end of the story, you have finished the first draft.  Revision, on the other hand, is a potentially infinite activity.  If a first draft is like a journey through the woods of novelling wilderness from A to B, revision is more like stepping out of the airlock in your spacesuit.  You could quite easily just float into the abyss and be stuck there forever.  Your plan, your system, your workflow, that is your tether.  That is that cord connecting you back to the airlock where you just came from to ensure that you don't float off into space and die out there.  That tether will allow you to navigate, to move around, to eventually find your way back home, to make sure that this spacewalk has an end.  I'm going to wrap up this point with a prime piece of grandmother-level scaremongering.  Here's a horror story for you.  Imagine spending the rest of your life revising this one story.  Let that horrifying idea be your motivation to go into revision with a plan and a system.  And following along from that, a revision outline is going to be your best friend.  Everybody's different.  I'm going to quote my friend, Nick Marino, there are no right ways to write, but there are effective ways to write.  When it comes to first drafts, whatever you got to do to get to the end of that draft is the right thing to do.  However much planning or pantsing that might be.  whatever works for you is the most effective thing to do.  But I'm gonna plant a flag in the sand here, so bear with me.  When it comes to revision, I don't think that an outline is optional anymore.  To make this a good story as a whole, a good novel as a whole, not just on a sentence level, you kinda need to be able to see the beams that are holding it up, to be able to smack them with your hand and go, yeah, that's stable.  You need to know and be able to understand that everything is working together to create that wonderful journey for the reader that you initially envisioned.  That's why one of the most important and helpful things you can do for your vision to start with is creating an outline of the books that you want to have to guide you as you make those changes from what you've got, which is probably not something you're particularly happy with, to what you want.  Yes, everyone's different.  different things work for different people but when I see people saying that they don't need a revision during any stage of the writing process it's kind of like seeing someone trying to dig a tunnel with a spoon and you offer them a shovel and they're like no I do it my own way.  okay everyone's different and you're like sure hun but like don't?  you want this shovel?  the outline is the shovel.  use the shovel.  The next thing you're going to want to do is to change the format and if possible, even work on paper.  Trying to revise a story in the exact same format that you wrote it in is a little bit of a recipe for disaster.  It's going to be 10 times harder.  The reason that you let it rest is because you need a fresh perspective on this beast and The next best way to get that fresh perspective is to change the way it physically looks.  You want to be able to see it in a new light, with some new distance.  I highly recommend working on paper to revise most of the time.  You just see things on paper that you wouldn't on a screen for some reason.  I can't explain why, it's just true.  It's easier to catch things for some reason.  It's a bigger change in how it looks from changing what it looks like on a screen to it being on the screen and then being in your hands.  And I really valuable that analog experience of being able to hold it in my hand of being able to shuffle the pages around.  And one of the hardest things about revision is feeling like you're actually making progress through what seems like an endless process and having that stack of pages that are to do and pages that are done really helps with that.  It actually lets you see your progress physically.  And if you are squirming at the idea of using paper, if you are leaning towards like wanting to keep everything digital because you don't want to use paper, commit to recycling it.  Paper personally is the only thing that I recycle.  I'm a writer and my work requires paper and I've accepted that.  And so I commit to recycling it.  In fact, that's why my desk bin is literally only for paper recycling.  It's not a bin I use for anything else because I know I go through quite a lot of paper.  Don't shortchange your story or your novel out of fear of using paper, out of fear of using the tools that you need to use.  Just commit and recycle it and don't feel guilty.  When it comes to printing your manuscript, you want it to look different than it looked when you were writing it.  And you also want it to be double spaced.  You need that double spacing because you need to be able to write in between the lines.  It's really important to actually have the space to revise on the page.  So you want to change the font.  possibly even the size of the text and the margins, anything to make it look different enough that it looks unfamiliar to you.  Keep tweaking it until you're happy with it.  If you typed double spaced, then you're going to have to change more of the other things to make it look different enough.  But if you typed your first draft in single spaced, then it's going to be a lot easier for it to look much more different in manuscript form.  For your first read-through, as you're preparing to revise, you can even export it to your Kindle or e-reader.  That's a really good way to make it feel unfamiliar as you read it.  Let's talk about keeping track of your drafts.  I think all of us as writers should be aiming for as few drafts as possible.  If you're on your first few stories or your first few novels, as few drafts as possible might still be 10 drafts.  That's fine.  But I think it makes sense for us to all be working towards getting more efficient with our revisions and working down to, like for me, it would ideally be one or two drafts max.  I'm not there yet, but working on it.  How do you keep track of your drafts?  Number them.  This may sound very simple.  It's a tip actually from Scarlett Thomas's book, Monkeys with Typewriters, which has helped me enormously.  Don't kid yourself with file titles like novel, final revision, novel, final, final revision, last revision of this novel, really this time.  If you have to go back into your files to find something, it's impossible.  And a lot of the time, you don't actually decide if this is the last draft or not.  Sometimes it's your novel.  And often you only realise or can discern if this is the last draft after the draft is done.  So it doesn't really make sense to try and name it beforehand.  Have you done this before?  Write final, final draft in the comments if you have done this with your files, because I know I have.  Stick to draft one, draft two, and continue from there and save yourself the headache.  It will make it so much easier to navigate.  You still get to aim for making draft three the last one, but then if it turns out actually you need a little draft four as well, then you're still gonna be able to do that easily.  I guess aim for every draft to be the last draft, but be prepared for it to not be.  And finally, how to know when the revision is done.  Let's go back to that terrifying concept of infinity again.  If you can, in theory, keep revising, Forever.  How the hell do you ever know that you're done?  Sometimes you do just know.  You're like, I know that this is done.  I can feel it.  But a lot of the time, it's not really about feeling like it's done.  It's about deciding that it's done.  And sometimes it's about just being so fucking done that you never want to look at the thing again.  Been there.  Keep in mind that it is never your aim to write a perfect book.  You are never going to do that.  There is no such thing.  Your aim then is to write the best book that you are capable of right now, and then to move on to the next project armed with whatever it taught you.  The next thing is always going to be better.  So have you told the story that you set out to tell?  Are you now just making it different instead of better?  Is this the best version of the story that you are capable of right now?  Do whatever you have to do to make peace with the fact that this story will be flawed and finished at the same time.  All of them will be.  Everything you do will be.  So don't ask, is it flawed?  Or is there stuff that could be done better?  Is it perfect?  Ask, is it flawed but finished?  If it is, then you're done.  And if at any point you are kind of stuck in this like deciding if it's finished kind of phase, you're unsure, then I would recommend getting a bit of perspective on that by either watching or re-watching my video on perfectionism.  That will help you out.  And that's how you get started with revision.

And if you are serious about revising your novel or your story, don't forget to pick up the story revision starter guide that I created to go along with this video.  It'll really help you put this into practice instead of it just becoming another, like, oh, I should do that kind of thing that haunts the back of your mind.  Okay, love you, bye!

In this video I'd like to discuss the 8 most common transvoice mistakes I see across the internet and in my own private practice. If you are making any of these mistakes, hopefully this video can help set you on the right path.\n\n1. Speaking in falsetto. Simply put, this is the wrong behavior of the vocal folds and it generates an incorrect source tone to feminize. Don't do this!\n\n2. Misunderstanding resonance. Many people get stuck in time sinks which involve a mythical understanding of resonance. Resonance is an objective and empirical fact of our universe and it's simple to manipulate.\n\n3. Hyperfocusing on the pitch ceiling. The ceiling is the highest comfortable speaking pitch that occurs during speech. Many students seem to tunnel vision on how high they can go. It's more important to focus on how low you -dont- go.\n\n4. Releasing resonance after it's been dialed in. Often when doing mechanical exercises that require a student to \"dial\" their resonance in then speak, students will release the resonance when starting the speech and be confused about why the voice isn't changing. Pay attention to if you release any muscular holds when you go to speak!\n\n5. Too breathy or too closed. People often crutch on breathiness. People often strain when doing new exercises which squeezes the folds hard. Both are sounds we don't want.\n\n6. Overthinking\/Hypermanaging muscles. Your muscles don't work based on direct control. They work based on thinking about the function you want to perform then executing a command to fulfill the function. If you try and directly manipulate the muscles of your tongue when first beginning, you will most likely move the wrong parts of the tongue. Defer to sound to learn the correct muscles, then practice those.\n\n7. Not listening. Y'all know how I feel about this. Open those ears!\n\n8. Harsh and destructive self criticism. Feedback is important and evaluating your sound is a key component to doing anything with voice. We must make our self criticisms constructive and conducive to growth, not destructive or rooted in self hate\/anxiety.\n\nI hope this is helpful for many of you out there! There are certainly more common mistakes and more specialized issues people struggle with but I hope this can solve some problems.

One, using falsetto as a foundation.  Like a house, a voice requires a strong foundation.  Now, when we talk about a foundation, we're really talking about our source tone and all of the elements that control that.  So that would include our pitch, that would include the way that we use our vocal folds, that would include our airflow and our glottal quotient and these sort of factors.  Now, everybody has essentially four primary ways that we can use the vocal folds.  you may have come across the word vocal registers.  right.  well that's what these are essentially.  there are four of them and we use three of them commonly.  so the first one is your fry register.  It's that kind of sound where it's very croaky, right?  Our next register is our modal voice.  And, you know, that's this area.  That's this area.  All of this is in my modal voice.  It just basically means that I'm using most of my vocal folds.  And then this is what a falsetto sounds like.  So this is our other register.  And this is the one that you want to avoid for using in a feminine voice.  We do not want to construct the foundation out of our voice in falsetto.  It's very difficult to create the proper resonance to sound naturally female if you are in falsetto.  I accidentally stumble into this because they try and emulate a feminine voice without knowing what they're doing, and well, that's a pretty natural way to try and do it at first.  So make sure you're not doing this.  Try to avoid it.  And if you are doing that, it'll typically sound, it'll typically sound like this, right?  or something like this, or you'll have like kind of this stuff.  We don't want any of that, okay?  Number two, an incorrect understanding of resonance.  I see so many people thinking resonance is something in your head or in your chest or something that you're just supposed to magically understand.  It is not these things, okay?  So you'll notice that if I start talking into my hands, my sound starts to change.  That is resonance.  And if I use a smaller container and then I talk into it, it will sound brighter.  That's what's going on inside male and female bodies, which cause them to be different in terms of sound.  Now, that's what we have to understand resonance as, not as a place, not as a magical sensation, not as teeth buzz or anything like that, okay?  Resonance is simply how space and the shape of that space influences the sound that is inside of it, okay?  This is all about shape and contorting shape.  By being able to understand what resonance actually is, we can understand how we can actually control it.  We control resonance by moving around muscles which change the cavity size and the cavity dimensions, right?  Three, hyper focus on the pitch ceiling.  Now pitch is probably the most obvious difference between a male and female voice.  And so many people start to hyper focus on this, but in particular, they hyper focus on getting higher and higher and higher.  Don't make the mistake of focusing on the highest point of your speech.  Focus on the lowest point of your speech.  It doesn't matter how high you can go.  It only matters how low you are not going.  So you are trying to behaviorally delete an entire zone out of your vocal range where you speak, okay?  And that is what you have to do for pitch.  Yes, we want our average to be around 200, 220, you know, 190, whatever you want to cut it at.  But it's very important that our floor be around 150.  Four, releasing the resonance when you go to speak.  So a lot of the exercises that I employ in my practice involve having a student dial in their resonance with a few different basic sounds that allow us to hear resonance better, like your breath or like noise.  and then once their resonance has been dialed in properly, they freeze their body in that position, they try and produce pitch with that resonance, and then they try and produce pitch with that resonance, and then they try and talk and use that resonance.  Most exercises follow a similar behavior.  Now I see so many people who don't catch themselves letting go of their resonance.  So for instance, in this larynx raising exercise, we use the breath, as a way to monitor where our resonance is going.  And then once we set it to the right place, we have to create pitch.  And then we have to talk with it.  Now, a lot of people do something like this.  Do you hear that fall at the beginning?  That is your resonance literally dropping, okay?  And many people don't catch themselves doing this.  And there's a lot of exercises where this kind of behavior occurs.  So you need to make sure that when you have your resonance dialed into the right place, that you don't let go of it, okay?  Five, too breathy or too closed?  This one's simple.  So when we make sound, our vocal folds essentially do this behavior.  The longer that they are closed for, the tighter and more choked off the sound becomes.  And the longer that they're open for, the softer and lighter the sound becomes, commonly associated with breathiness.  People really seem to be on this whole.  female voices are breathier and softer thing.  And so oftentimes I see people who over exaggerate that and they open the vocal folds too much and they sound so like breathy and airy.  We don't want that.  That's not good.  You know, conversely, when people do exercises involving brighter resonance, sometimes they choke the vocal folds.  They choke themselves with their vocal folds.  They close the vocal folds too hard because there's all this excess tension going on when they're doing the exercise.  And then it creates this very nasty croaking sound.  So try and find the Goldilocks zone for your vocal folds.  Not too choked, not too breathy.  Pay attention if you are tensing up too hard during your exercises, because it could be altering that closure here in the neck at the vocal folds, and it could be completely ruining your sound, okay?  So not too breathy, not too closed.  Just right.  Number six, overthinking.  Now, I see people who completely paralyze their progress because they overthink what they're doing instead of just listening and reacting or just listening, evaluating, and moving on.  Instead, they get stuck in this cycle of hyperthinking every little muscle that they're doing in here or trying to sort of hypercontrol their muscles.  We are not very good at hypercontrolling our muscles.  Try and isolate a single muscle on your face and just move that one.  It's very difficult.  And it's because that's not how we think about muscles.  We think about muscles in relation to what function they're trying to perform.  So we think about sound, then we do that sound, and that teaches us the muscular function we're trying to do.  Then we learn from that.  We do not try and top down control everything in our body and think about it all.  Otherwise it becomes so scary and so overwhelming so quickly.  Also, I encourage you not to hyper focus on any individual element.  I encourage every person learning on their own to survey the field and see what techniques are out there, then pick a few techniques and work on them.  Sometimes if you're just focusing on one thing, you can really just get stuck in a rut doing something that may not be the most beneficial for you.  Where if you change ideas and you get to a different practice technique, you might have a breakthrough on that one, okay?  So don't limit your practice to just one thing.  Explore what's out there, try everything, see what works for you, see what doesn't, and play into what does work for you.  It's obviously very important to understand and have information about the process, but we have to draw on that information in a valuable way and not let it control or dominate the process.  Sometimes you just have to get out of your own way.  Number seven, not listening.  If there is a cardinal sin that breaks my little heart more than anything else, it's when you don't use your ears when you practice.  This is about sound, and you have to use your ears and listen to that sound.  Sound is the key to this entire process.  You may think that, oh, well, I don't have a musical background, I can't hear very well, all these different things, but look, you learned an entire language or languages.  Nobody taught you how to speak your language.  You sat in a crib and you listened to your family talk around you all day as a kid and you literally taught yourself through mimicry.  Mimicry is the single most natural form of human education.  And when we do these kind of voice exercises and we do these voice things, it's especially true.  The ability to learn the voice through mimicry is hard coded into you as an individual.  Otherwise you would not be able to speak and you would not be able to think in the way that you do now.  So take advantage of that and play into the fact that you are a biomechanical sound processing unit.  The only way to grow is to notice.  You have to listen and you have to notice.  How is this different?  How is this similar?  How has it changed since last time?  And if your ears aren't very good at first, that's okay.  They get better by actively listening.  Many people do not have Many people do not have a well-developed critical ear, but you can start developing it today.  Just start listening to yourself and asking, how is this different?  How has this changed?  How is it similar than before?  And start dissecting the sound with your ears.  Don't just ask yourself, does this sound male or female?  Ask yourself, what about the sound is wrong?  What about the sound is good?  Can you describe the sound with textures or colors or shapes or geometry or different ideas?  Try to abstractly identify and describe the experience that you're hearing.  And always trust your ear.  I see so many people who are afraid to trust their intuition.  Your ear got you this far in your life.  You've learned the language that you speak now simply through mimicry.  And I think you can learn how to change your voice simply through mimicry too.  Take advantage of the most natural form of human learning.  Just open your ears, reflect, notice, and I promise that you will progress.  Number eight, harshly judging oneself mid-process.  Okay, look, I understand this is an important thing for us, and I understand that it's entangled with our dysphoria, but if we jump to criticizing ourself before we've even started the process, will go nowhere.  okay you have to fail a lot before you can succeed and that is true with anything.  okay honestly please go easy on yourself.  if you're doing an exercise that is about pitch that should be what you're critiquing.  it shouldn't be whether you sound male or female.  it shouldn't be about if you're valid or not.  and look if you need somebody to say it.  Your voice does not determine your validity, okay?  Your identity is valid regardless of what your voice sounds like.  Our voices are nothing more a statement about our identity than chewing our fingernails.  It is literally a behavioral habit.  You just flop your jaw and your tongue in a certain way, and that's the way that you learned when you were a kid, okay?  It's not a statement about who you are in any deeper sense than that.  And that's very important.  I see so many girls with amazing and beautiful voices progressing quickly who just get completely frozen because the moment they open their mouth, they just immediately a wave of self-doubt and a wave of self-criticism take over them.  That is not the way you do this.  Imagine it like this.  You wouldn't try and go learn piano and then sit at the piano and expect to just be able to play Chopin your first day.  You have to build fundamental skills.  And early in this process, when you're building those fundamental skills, you have to be evaluating whether those are growing, not whether you sound male or female.  Yes, it's good to keep sight on the endings.  but you have to look at each lap's progress as well.  You can't just rush straight to the finish line.  This one's incredibly personal for me because I spent probably nine months of my life not progressing with my voice because the moment I opened my mouth, I immediately criticized it as if I was submitting the final example, right?  It wasn't until I realized that my voice is so fluid and I can play with it however I want and it's not that big of a deal was I able to then start spending a lot of time changing it.

I wanted to share with you something that I did recently that actually was pretty cool.  It was one of those things where, you know, the older I get and the more I understand who I am and the more I like who I am, the more I want to kind of like fix things or, make things right from the past.  And so great example of this has to do with a high school reunion that is attempting to be organized.  Regardless if I go to the reunion or not, this has to do with the Facebook group that was created for it.  So I went to an army high school, Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  I graduated in 1992 and it's really hard to organize reunions because people who are as some of you probably know, like if you're an army brat or a military brat, it's hard to keep track of everybody after they leave.  But Facebook makes it kind of easy to be able to try to find everyone.  So this reunion would be for those who graduated from the late eighties through the nineties.  But this group, you know, people are starting to reconnect and share what they've been up to.  And there's a lot of, as I'm sure you can imagine, pictures from then and then here's me now kind of stuff going on.  Um, I thought about it for a little bit if I wanted to do that or not, because, you know, doing something like that in my situation is basically like a way of coming out.  Um, I wanted to make it clear that like, this is who I thought it was back then, but guess what?  It turns out this is who I am.  Um, so I'm going to show you the picture that I posted.  So on the left is me in high school.  on the right is a picture of me just from a couple months ago and I purposely chose this shirt that I wore because I feel like it really conveys the fact that at the very least I'm somewhere underneath the queer umbrella and so I posted it and I was nervous because really like I was coming out I'm coming out to people I went to high school with.  some of them are people.  maybe I didn't even know or I didn't even know if they remembered me but I. So I'm coming out to some people who were my friends, some people who were strangers, but it's this big coming out and I'm happy to report that it went good.  People liked it and loved it.  There was like a lot of comments on it.  People were just like, Hey, it's great to see you again.  Um, you look great.  Like I love your shirt.  People were being very conversational.  I didn't even know or remember a lot of the people who were commenting on it, which was very interesting.  And it just felt really good.  It felt like something that my younger self, like you kind of wish.  you could go back in time and tell your younger self, like, guess what?  I know, like you don't even know.  You don't know stuff about yourself when it comes to your sexuality, when it comes to your gender identities.  There's all this stuff you're going to learn as you get older.  And guess what?  You're going to tell these high schoolers about it and people are going to be cool.  In fact, some people are going to be like supportive and celebrating this about you.  It's good psychologically to reconcile things with your younger self.  And I've been working really hard on that in the last couple of years of doing things that I think my younger self needed me to do, needed me to tell them, like to help heal that relationship.  So even though I'm going like this and I'm gesturing towards a person in the past, that person is inside of me.  That younger version of Dara has been with me all along.  And so you really do some healing work.  when in this case, um, putting something out there about yourself that maybe in the past would have been shameful and it would have been scary, but it turns out it goes good.  Um, it just one more, one more time to take a deep breath and say, Ooh, Like, all right, this is really worth it for me to have discovered who I am and to share it with the world.  So I just wanted to share that with you because, I don't know, it was pretty cool.  And I wonder if that could give you ideas about things either that you could be doing, depending on where you're at in your journey, or if there's things you could be doing for, like I said, your younger self that's inside that still needs some healing and repairing and that kind of stuff.  So if you have anything about that that you want to share, the comments.

Laziness is characterized by unwillingness; limitations are not equivalent to laziness, however, people rarely take the time to consider the difference. In my experiences as a chronically ill person, I've been called lazy literally for being chronically ill. People assume laziness of young people with disabilities, hence this overwhelming prejudice and assumption that mobility aid or not, if a young person is using accessible resources they MUST be lazy and deserving of scorn. Then comes the impact on how this hatred for laziness ignites people to create campaigns to ban or discontinue products that are accessible resources for disabled people, denying them accessibility, followed by the more blatant imagery I think I've ever seen wherein the commercial for an accessible item... a powerchair was used as a symbol for laziness.

If you see my dog here, or me reaching my hand down for her, it's because she's a little nervous about the thunderstorm that's happening right now.  But I do have to make this video while I have the energy to do it.  So I've been thinking about the word lazy.  If you are one of those people who laughs at, scoffs at, condescends, or mocks products for being lazy, then you, more often than not, are neglecting to consider accessibility.  As a society, people hate lazy.  So passionately, I don't fully understand it.  I've seen people get more angry about people they assume are being lazy than people who have committed literal, horrible acts of violence.  Is lazy really the worst thing a person can be?  In my early 20s, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome started to really impact my health, my pain levels, and my abilities.  And someone I care about very much and who cares about me, ultimately, had a hard time accepting what was happening.  So she would call me lazy for being in bed all day or not maintaining the cleanliness of my spaces or being able to keep up with my responsibilities.  This was hurtful for me.  as someone who was losing so many parts of my life and my abilities I was and am in a state of mourning a body and a life that I once knew I was and am constantly learning what other parts of my body, what other abilities I'm losing, and how I can attempt to adapt.  My room is not messy because I'm lazy.  My room is messy because my joints in my feet and ankles and knees are no longer supporting me without tremendous pain.  My fingers and my shoulders, they risk dislocation when I try to hang things high up in my closet.  As an able-bodied person, you don't really consider how heavy a sweater on a hanger can be.  Standing too long to clean the high spaces makes me dizzy, makes my heart race, and can cause me to faint.  The dust that lifts when cleaning can also cause an allergic reaction.  Lazy is used against disabled young people who use the disabled seating on the bus.  People assume young means able.  You're young, you're strong, you have energy.  These seats are not for you, but there are so many disabilities that will not be apparent to you.  There are young people with chronic pain, with heart conditions, with lung conditions, and they need that seat.  They need that parking space.  The absence of a mobility aid does not mean able-bodied.  Even wheelchairs!  People see ambulatory wheelchair users like myself that can get up and walk around a little and think, I bought this really expensive power chair just to be lazy.  I've seen people get angry the most specifically at theme parks and to repeat myself for the millionth time even if someone walks or runs out of their wheelchair doesn't mean they are not disabled.  It means they cannot be mobile or standing upright for long periods because it's too painful or their heart becomes irregular, or their lungs cannot handle the distance, et cetera.  But some people just wanna skip the lines.  Listen, even if you would bet your life that someone is faking their need of a wheelchair, it's not worth the risk.  It's not worth the risk that you're harassing a person who fought with all their might just for the confidence to be in public with their wheelchair, which is something that happens a lot.  So leave it alone.  Funny how this intense aggression and anger about laziness so easily turns into a conversation about people harassing people with invisible disabilities.  Hmm.  Almost like the two are related.  The word lazy is used against products that make certain activities accessible to people who would be unable to perform them otherwise.  This includes things like pre-cut foods like avocados and oranges.  Google it if you don't believe me.  It was quite the scandal and made friggin' headlines.  You know what?  In the name of accessibility, I'm gonna go ahead and get those links and I'm gonna put them in the description.  There was this juice ad I saw once, actually.  After Backlash, they did edit out the more ableist aspects from it, so I appreciate that, but I'd still like to unpack where they went wrong and what we can all learn from it.  So this was a commercial for powdered green juice.  Green juice if you don't know what that is is one where you would typically have to purchase and handle several pieces of fruit and vegetables cut them up and then put them through juicer to make a very nutritional beverage For this kind of product.  I actually anticipated an audience response filled with, oh my God, that's so lazy.  Just do the work yourself.  Just handle all the fruits and cut them and go to the market and do it yourself.  A similar response that they have had for products like pre-cut oranges and avocados, et cetera.  Links in the description.  The problem with that is, When people become so furious about these products that make something easier for people, they get so angry about the idea of someone being too lazy to do something.  They are not taking the time to consider that this is, in fact, something that makes this activity, say it with me, accessible to someone who may not be able to do it independently.  I'm a good example of that.  Because of my disabilities, I quite often have trouble with my hands.  They can be in a lot of pain.  The joints in my hands, my fingers and my wrists are very lax and do not withstand well to pressure, which makes cutting foods very difficult.  And they can also cramp up and they can easily get injured.  So stuff like pre-cut food, is amazing for me and allows me to prepare myself a healthy meal independently, on my own, without the help of somebody else.  And this powder thing would actually benefit me from having to do the physical labor of preparing green juice on my own or collecting all the food items at the market.  It would have been great.  So I'm the target market, actually.  But instead of considering the fact that a person and people like me exist, this commercial went two very strange directions.  First, they paint the typical person who juices as hyper and overeager, and honestly, in general, I'm exhausted with shaming people in order to get them to buy things.  It's so weird to me.  It's an outdated marketing tactic.  Get it out of here.  But then we are introduced to a health unconscious junk food junkie.  Okay, in contrast to the hyper, over the top, healthy woman, which is over the top because she works out and juices, oh my God, so over the top, the health unconscious junk food junkie is a power chair user with a giant jug of cheesy puffs and holding a large soft drink.  Way to perpetuate that.  power chair users are just lazy.  Particularly young women power chair users.  Because, God forbid, I use my power chair and maybe have some junk food in my hand or a drink at the same time.  My bad.  Assumed laziness of disabled people makes me feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone.  I'm one of the most driven, and determined people I know.  I push myself beyond my limits all the time, every day.  Every day that I live is survival.  My sheer will to get things done is some kind of adrenaline magic that pushes against my body's limitations until I just can't anymore.  But this is a fight that no one sees.  They just see me using my wheelchair or see me passed out in my bed or see me lying in bed and reading off of my phone and assume laziness.  And all the hard work I do, all the pain, all the effort, all the fighting and pushing goes completely unnoticed.  It's the most bizarre, social, cultural gaslighting I think I've ever experienced.  Because these messages come from every direction.  That no matter how hard we push ourselves, as long as we are disabled, as long as there are things we cannot do, we have not done enough.  We are not enough.  It's hard not to feel hopeless and worthless in the face of that.  That commercial participated in reinforcing an ableist concept that feels like forever years old.  That tools used to make life easier for people are not for disabled people, oh no, they are for lazy people.  And lazy people are not worthy of respect.  People use their burning hatred for laziness as a veil over their ableism.  It's such a sneaky and powerful form of gaslighting because when you are a disabled person who pushes yourself beyond your limits all the time, who struggles and fights for every breath you get.  And then the world turns to you and points their fingers and tells you that you're far this point, the limit that you have reached, and sometimes beyond what you should have done, that limit wasn't far enough.  Or they tell you that you didn't even try.  And on top of that, make furious campaigns to take away the things that help you.  Like pre-cut foods at the market so you can feed yourself independently.  I don't know.  If you're watching this and you get it because you've been called lazy because of your disabilities, you're not.  I believe you.  I know you're trying your best.  For anyone else watching, I hope you'll consider the unconscious bias you might have about laziness and pause to consider the assumptions you're making about someone when you call them that or think that they're lazy.  Also, Maybe not get so angry next time you come across a product that you are too privileged to understand how and who.  this could be helpful for.  I will see you eventually.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0nm001s2cdvisg8sn8uk","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCznS4Pk3VcTIfDUuWrQtdzQ","channel.name":"Annie Elainey","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUMs5MgxX-swWUepaOvpmQ-tl21N33UNC7s5nHJRg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2011-11-04T03:43:54.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the stigma surrounding the word \"lazy\" and how it's often used to belittle people with disabilities.

The film was developed through a theatre project with Youth Cymru and Mess up the Mess, and is based on a theatre play, written by Kelly Jones. \n\nAn audience preview was screened at the annual Trans Pride Film Night, and won an award for best film of the evening, which was judged by an independent panel of judges. \n\nTo accompany the film, we have had a lesson plan developed for students aged 12-18 to help an understanding of trans people\u2019s lived experiences, including non-binary identities. \n\nWe created this lesson plan to help teachers approach the topic of trans issues, as there is a real need for information and material on transgender issues for schools. The lesson plan is created by teacher Hayle Chalke-Davies.

I love you too. I'm excited to spend my life with you.  Okay.  Oh, you're so precious. Okay, so here's the deal.  So she completely surprised me.  I was really confident that she wasn't gonna be able to surprise me because I was like, oh, I'll pick up on it.  I'll know when she's like planning the thing and taking us out to a nice place and all of that.  But she had pointed all of these little things that I thought were true because I'm a trusting person, but it turns out, They were lies.  So like she has a friend who I knew was gonna help her with the engagement, but she told me that he was out of town.  So in my head, I was like, oh, he's out of town.  It won't happen during this time period.  And then I feel like there were several other lies as well.  But the main one was that she told me she had like a job interview and that she wanted to take photos for her website afterwards.  So I needed to go meet her at this park after she was done with her interview and we'd take some photos.  And so I was like, okay, I can do that.  And it seems like a very normal Fiona thing.  out of the ordinary and all of the hints I had said that it wasn't going to be happening because like these things weren't lined up.  but then we get there and there's like a huge tree and she had set up stuff behind the tree and I couldn't see it.  and so as we walk around oh yeah for days before this she'd been going like will you like jokingly like she was going to propose but it was always a joke and she was just like doing it in a funny tone.  and so as we walked past the tree she does that again and I was like Fiona come on I know you're not proposing right now.  And then she like shows me like the area behind the tree and I see that there's a little blanket set up and some little fake flowers and champagne glasses and her friend is filming.  and I was like, oh shit, it's actually happening right now.  And it was so cute.  and I was like, oh my God, she actually got me.  Oh my God, I'm not ready for this.  And so we like walked down to the little area and she gave a cute little speech.  She told me afterwards that she like blacked out for it.  It was so precious.  She was like shaking and she gave this really sweet speech about how much she loves me and wants to marry me and stuff.  And yeah, then she got down on one knee and took out the ring and did a little proposal.  It was so cute.  And it actually, it fits really well.  I was worried about it because I have weird bony hands.  But I actually really like it and it's like comfy and fits well.  And like Fiona said earlier, I'm not much of a jewelry person, like I don't generally like the feeling of rings, but I like it a lot.  And I feel like people are gonna comment on this, but I have it on my right hand, just because it's more comfortable for me.  There's no law that says you have to wear it on the left hand, so I'm gonna put it on my right hand.  My left hand is weirdly bony, and it's just hard to get it over the knuckle, and like it rubs against my other fingers the wrong way, and like, I don't know.  I'm just more comfortable with it on my right hand.  So that's what happened.  I thought it was really cute, and it was such a pretty area, it was such a beautiful day.  And then we just got to chill there and like drink sparkling apple cider.  Because I don't drink, so there wasn't like actual champagne, there was just like fancy sparkling apple cider.  And it was really cute and nice, and she actually really surprised me.  As far as wedding stuff goes, we'll let you know in the future at some point.  But until then, we are... betrothed.  And obviously because we're gays we like had a lot of thinking and talking and planning about this before.  Like this wasn't a total surprise.  I wasn't like, oh my god Fiona.  we've never talked about marriage before.  I mean we've been together for like three years now and we've talked about our future together and like we both know that this is what we want.  But even with that it was really sweet and nice and still caught me off guard somehow.  And I know it's all cheesy and romantic stuff but I really like it.  So that's basically everything.  Me and Fiona are engaged now.  And yeah, sorry for the filming setup today, I'm sure the audio quality is not as great.  But I didn't want to make this like a whole video thing, you know?  It's just like, that happened yesterday, and it was really nice and lovely, and I wanted to tell you all about it really quickly, so I figured I'd just do like a quick little phone video.  Because our engagement is for us, it's not for the internet, you know?  But obviously I do want you all to know about it, so here I am.  I'll put some pictures up here on the screen, you can also go to like my Instagram or Twitter to see some of them.  Because obviously Fiona had her friend use like a really fancy camera to take some really nice photos of us.  So we've got some nice fancy photos because obviously that's what Fiona would do.  She's so into photography and stuff.  But yeah, sorry, this video doesn't have like the video of Fiona proposing and all of that because we didn't want it to be all that like YouTube stuff.  We wanted it to be just for us, which I really like.  But also I don't see any harm in just like talking about it in a little video, you know?  Because I want you all to be able to share in this lovely queer love we have.  So I think that's about all I have for you.  I'm gonna put this video out pretty soon after it happened, but Fiona's pretty busy so she might do another video about it a few days from now.  So I'll link her channel in the description and you can go follow that if you wanna see a more detailed video about all her behind-the-scenes stuff.  And in the meantime, you can see more about it on both of our, like, Instagram and Twitters and stuff.  But yeah, just know that I am very happy.  Both of us are really happy and excited and good things are happening.  And I'm just very lucky and fortunate to be where I am right now.  Okay, alright, that's all for now.  I'll see y'all next time.  Bye! Hey everyone!  So we're doing a phone video today.  Probably much worse audio quality than video quality.  Sorry about that.  I just want to make a video really quick because yesterday someone proposed to me. I love how you're just starting this while I'm still trying to put some mascara on so I look a little human. I mean, I don't have any makeup on.  I'm a mess.  Anyways, obviously, it's Fiona.  She's right off screen.  I was like, someone proposed!  Someone proposed!  I wonder who! I wonder who it could be!  I'm on my chair.  Maybe, let me sit on my lap.  I'll sit on your chair.  Oh, shit, I moved the mirror. That's better.  Is this how we're gonna do it?  You don't need to lean that far back!  I'm out of the screen right now!  Anyways, yeah, this isn't clickbait.  We're actually engaged.  Yeah!  I'm really excited.  Oh, I don't have the ring on because I just woke up.  What?!  You got it yesterday!  I wasn't wearing it sleeping! She hasn't, like, she's not a jewelry girl.  Oh my god, she's so much taller than me.  How do I get this up?  She's not a jewelry girl, so it took a lot of convincing to, like, make her wear a ring, full stop. So yes, this is my ring.  I am betrothed. You are betrothed!  That's my favorite thing.  Everyone's like, we call each other fianc\u00e9.  I'm like, no, but she'll be my betrothed. I'm still gonna call you my girlfriend.  Fianc\u00e9 is just a weird word. Yeah.  Do you want to tell them how it happened? I do.  Can I sit back in my chair normally to do that? Elsa, I'm not in this video. You're not in this part. So I propose to you and then you're like, you're done. No, I'm like, I want you to be in the beginning of the video so everyone can see your beautiful face.  But then this is not a comfortable way for me to sit.  So I would like to do the rest of the thing by myself. Also, FYI, because I was the one doing the proposing, I was filming a little bit of like my scheming behind the scenes. So I'll be doing a video later when I have better makeup on.  So you can watch Fiona's video later for more details on her side of the story.  Yeah.  For now, I will just tell you mine. Sounds good.  I love you. I love you. My betrothed.  Be well.","channel.id":"clxmi0m7i00t1cdvi0a5yca5r","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCVF8SAGEQnBA-yKM4iQNqfw","channel.name":"Riley J.

I'm not having the best morning of my life.  It's already super late.  It's like quarter to twelve or later.  I slept in and I woke up and I have things that I'm meant to be doing today.  I'm meant to be creating assignment PDFs for the Story Magic Academy for this week's lesson.  I'm meant to be working on the script for next week's lesson.  so like I have this whole week scheduled out where like you know I need to finish these things so that I have time to shoot it and then I have time to edit it and I'm just tired and kind of burnt out and I've just woken up with like absolutely zero motivation to do anything.  I find myself getting like stuck in this kind of like limbo I guess, like this like paralysis where I'm like I'm so unmotivated that I don't know what to do with myself like i don't know how to like actually start doing things for the day.  um i meant to be going to like.  so i started this new like kickbox gym thing which i mean like and i was going to go today because i couldn't go yesterday but i woke up like maybe the start of like a head cold so like kind of sniffly and headachy and scratchy throat and i meant to go pick up some coffee that i ordered today which is like a bit of a walk and i'm kind of paying that off as well.  and it just feels like a lot to do today and i don't know how i'm gonna start to even get any of it done.  it's already so late i wasted so much time.  i need to shower I need to wash my hair.  I want to dye my hair again at some point.  It all just feels like a lot.  I think as well, like I always like get stuck in these little kind of like loops and like I feel like I've learned this lesson like a few times and I still like need to like keep reminding myself of it and keep learning it over and over again but like I need to stop trying to like make decisions and like plan out what I'm going to do for the rest of the day.  If I wake up feeling like shit in the morning, if I have a headache, if I'm in pain or something, I'm always like, what am I going to do?  I don't feel like doing anything.  And the real solution to that is to stop and do what you need to do to feel better.  So eat, take painkillers, have some water, have a cup of coffee.  and then like yeah work on feeling better and then once you feel a bit better then figure out what you're going to do with the rest of the day.  but I keep like trying to skip that part.  so I think what feels manageable to me right now is like getting up getting a shower.  still kind of dread the idea of washing my hair because I have to blow dry it and diffuse it and stuff and it's like a whole thing or whatever.  no it needs done like it needs to not feel gross.  So I'm going to do that.  And I think I'm going to tidy up the house a little bit.  Everything's a bit of a mess.  And I think that might make me feel better and make me feel a bit more centered and maybe ready to deal with some other stuff.  okay it is now jesus christ it is 20 past one kind of hungry now and there's not a lot of food in the house.  so i think that's going to kind of push me out of the house.  i also would like a smoothie because god I need to eat some fruit and veg because I have not been doing groceries and I've been cooking and I've been eating out all the time because work's been so busy and I feel like I might get scurvy soon.  so let's try and rectify that with some like orange juice or smoothie or something today.  let's give the living room a quick tidy up and then figure out where we're gonna go.  There is not lunch in the house so I'm gonna head out.  I don't know where.  Oh, Ross is in town today.  He's been working on music stuff so like part of me is tempted to just go and find out wherever he is and just go and sit and work there with him.  I also don't want to like derail his day.  I also just don't really want to go and work somewhere by myself all day either.  I don't think I'm picking up that coffee today.  So we're gonna leave that for another day.  Let me get my journal.  Okay, let's fucking... plan this.  Okay, I really need to get these assignments done.  I really do.  Okay.  That's... Tuesday.  My gym stuff, like my kickboxing stuff, is in town at the studio where I work.  So if I want to go then I can, like that stuff is there and I can just pick it up and go.  I can't really be asked or like.  I just don't know if I should... I should definitely eat first if I'm going to go at all.  I don't really know if I can be asked but I also know that I'm not in a great mood and it would probably help me feel better.  did go.  so okay we're gonna head into town because that's where all the stuff is and i will figure out where i'm gonna go on the way.  and if worse comes to worse or if i can't figure out i can i?  i can.  i know i can get food there and i can just go to the studio and work there.  um or i can see if ross is around.  Okay, well I made it.  I'm actually holding this against the wall and my hands are still shaking.  Oh my God.  Yeah, I did five rounds, which is my max so far has been six and I did five last time.  So I think that's pretty good.  I had a good time, but I think I'm definitely done now.  So it's time for a shower and to get changed.  So I've just had a little bit of like a bummer of a business email.  um as you do when you do what i do so that's dampened my mood somewhat which is why i maybe don't seem incredibly uh high energy right now.  um i did the work that i had to do today.  um i had some stuff that i would have liked to get done which i didn't but I finished the assignment stuff, the assignment PDF and everything for lesson six of the academy, week six.  But I think all in all, considering how the day started, which was not good, it actually turned out pretty good.  But yeah, like this morning I couldn't imagine doing anything and I did.  We ended up bumping into Ross's brother and his girlfriend, Lou.  And so we had some drinks in Brewdog and they were heading to a gig after.  So I decided to just come home because I was very tired and have a quiet kind of rest of my evening.  I'm going to change into my pyjamas.  It's going to be lovely.  I'm going to try and not think about business stuff.  I'm going to try and just chill.  And maybe I'll read.  I think I'll probably read in bed.  Thank you for joining me on my slightly difficult day and coming along with me.  I know this is something a bit new for my channel, like I've not really done any kind of vlog type stuff.  apart from during NaNoWriMo.  But I'm very interested in the kind of storytelling aspect of it.  Yeah, like picking out stories in my life to share with you in this format.  Seems like it might be fun and it might actually allow me to get videos up more frequently when I can't always be pumping out my normal type of videos, which is like, scripted and planned.  and let me know if you enjoyed this and if you would like to see more kind of vlog style videos from me and just kind of like dropping in for little stories from my life because how you guys react to this and stuff will definitely help me decide if it's something that I want to do more of.  and don't try and make decisions about what you're going to do with your day or your life when you feel like shit.  Feel better first, do things first, and then make decisions.

Oh, crap, that sun is bright. Also, did you guys get the metaphor about the idea of being pickled and Rick's drinking problem?  Because I definitely did not.  So if you just got that, write pickled in the comments below. Plot point two, Beth takes the syringe of antidote with her to therapy, leaving him as a helpless pickle.  He needs to get it back to return himself to human form.  This is his motive goal for the episode.  Get the antidote. You don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation.  How's that going to help? I'm a pickle!  I'm a pickle! Dan Harmon created Rick and Morty.  You may or may not know that he also created the plot embryo, Hallowed Be the Universal Pattern, linked in our descriptions and our hearts, which is the story creation tool that he and his writers use to craft every single episode.  If you just watch my videos every once in a while and you haven't been to my website or you don't really know me off of YouTube, you might not know that making videos about the plot embryo for fun isn't all I do.  Teaching the plot embryo and helping writers get amazing results with it is actually my full-time day job.  The plot embryo is a crazy powerful storytelling tool but it can be a little tricky to get the hang of in the beginning.  so let's break down an episode of Rick and Morty so you can see how the plot embryo works in action.  and because I want those sweet sweet clicks we're gonna do the episode where Rick gets himself into a little bit of a pickle.  And spoiler warning, I'm about to spoil the shit out of this entire episode because that's the whole point of this video.  So consider yourself warned, dumdums. For the comfort zone of this plot embryo, I had life as part of a family.  For the conflict zone, I had.  the world is dangerous for a pickle.  For Rick's before estate, I had dishonesty and the belief that therapy is for dweebs.  For Rick's after-state, I had honesty.  And the realisation that I am a dweeb.  At plot point one, we have the backstory that Rick and Beth are both dysfunctional, closed off, and resistant to change.  Rick turns himself into a pickle, ostensibly to avoid therapy, but lies about it to the rest of the family. Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?  Morty!  It's okay, Beth.  I understand Morty's suspicion.  I've misled him before.  Morty, I assure you, I would never find a way to get out of family therapy.  I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes. At plot point three, he's washed into the sewer and must survive very real dangers as an apparently helpless pickle.  At plot point four, Rick makes himself a body, fights off rats and other dangers of the sewer.  He emerges eventually into a Russian embassy and is attacked by agents.  He beats them and escapes with Jaguar.  And at plot point five, he gets to the therapy session to retrieve the antidote and is forced to admit that he lied, that he did turn himself into a pickle to avoid therapy, to get the antidote before his wounds kill him. I've sustained a lot of damage.  I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent. By changing you from a pickle to a human. Yes. Rick, why did you lie to your daughter? At plot point six, he pays the price for that.  He endures Dr.  Wong's perfect analysis of him.  meeting it with a cynical glare.  The therapy session ends.  At plot point seven, we have them driving home in the car.  And finally, at Plot Point 8, Rick apologises for lying.  It's not enough, but it's something.  Rick and Beth seem to refuse to accept Dr Wong's insights, but Summer and Marty see their family's problems a lot more clearly now. Let's talk about Rick's arc in Pickle Rick.  So Dan Harmon uses this one eight-part structure for all of his stories and episodes, whereas I personally use both the eight-part structure, which I call the heroic plot embryo because it tends to get a happy or satisfying ending, and I also use a six-part version called the tragic plot embryo because not all stories get that triumphant ending.  Rick's plot embryo is heroic in structure.  He succeeds at what he sets out to do, but he's definitely not a traditional hero.  Pickle Rick is a great example of an anti-hero's heroic plot embryo.  He essentially brings all of the conflict on himself and his apology at the end is really just a tiny concession.  It seems for the most part he hasn't taken Dr Wong's analysis very seriously.  He certainly hasn't undergone a huge transformation.  But at the beginning of the episode he absolutely refused to be honest and he would never have apologised for that.  So it still hits our plot point eight.  And that is how Pickle Rick's plot embryo works.  Now, of course, I don't have access to the original plot embryo used to create this episode.  So consider this my best interpretation, kind of reverse engineered from the finished episode.  Tell me in the comments what episode you would like to see me break down next.  As someone who specialises in helping people with their story structure and crafting plots, I often hear writers worry that using a structure like the plot embryo will make their stories formulaic, it will tie their hands behind their back, it will stop them from being as creative and essentially result in these kind of lacklustre formulaic stories.  And I think the perfect example of why that's not true is the fact that every single episode of Rick and Morty is created using the plot embryo structure.  And I would defy anyone to watch a season of Rick and Morty and tell me that it's formulaic or derivative or predictable or uncreative.  If you're a writer struggling with crafting your stories, if you find that they never turn out how you had imagined or hoped, I created the Story Magic Academy for you.  In it, I share my complete system from generating that first seed of a story idea all the way to turning that into a complete plot embryo ready to be written.  It's where I've put all my best secrets and tips for getting the most out of the plot embryo framework and making the story creation process clear, practical, and gratifying.  So here's what to do next.  If you're watching this video pretty soon after I released it, the enrollment for the Story Magic Academy is open now for a limited time.  If you're watching this sometime in the future, the Academy might already be in session.  But don't worry, you can also follow that link and join the waiting list, and you'll be notified the next time.  enrollment is open.  Okay, I'm done hawking my wares now.

I post bi-weekly so make sure to tune in.  Today I'm going to be talking about pros and cons on medical transition and mostly about my personal experience.  So let's get into it.  Mind you, I have not had any surgery yet so I only am on T. So, you know, medically transitioning and, like, having surgery would be fucking heaven.  Like, that is a pro, but I don't have that yet.  So everything I talk about is mainly, like, just T-related.  The biggest pro, I think, in medical transitioning is, to me, passing.  Because once I started to pass, I started having male privilege, and I started even being more comfortable with myself.  You know, that I don't always need to prove anything to anyone, and I'm just fucking, like, left alone to live my life.  And that was something that it may sound very easy, but I fought so hard to just be left alone.  I don't think I have much cons from medically transitioning.  Like it was mainly acne.  Freaking acne is pretty annoying, especially the first months of transition.  I still get acne at times, but when I first started hormones and like the first months overall, It was not cute and I really like had to get myself on a whole skincare system to get my skin together.  And it's partially worked, I guess.  So now like I kind of know how it works dealing with my skin.  One of the obvious pros, the voice change.  Okay, so I talked about how I finally feel comfortable, but it's one of them.  I feel like finally I can talk how much I want, as much as I want.  And I talk a lot, let me tell you.  Because before, I wasn't that comfortable with my voice so much that I let people talk over me all the damn time.  And I bet a lot of guys, like trans guys, relate to this.  Another con would be losing hair or receding hairline.  Now, I'm scared to lose my hair as hell.  That's why I'm like now just wildly experimenting with it overall.  And I'm not afraid to go short now.  Because before I only liked my hair medium length.  But now I'm like, I need to be mentally prepared to lose my hair.  Because it's kind of genetic.  There is 30% chance that I'm not gonna lose my hair.  Okay.  But regardless, my hairline did, you know, mature.  Like, did go back a little bit.  Freaks me out.  Hair loss is a thing that a lot of trans guys deal with.  But then again, it depends on your family.  So, you know, you don't have to, like, feel like shit or something.  Like, look at your dad.  Look at... other guys around you in the family and see how their hair is doing.  I would say that my experience transitioning is very positive you know in general.  yeah the only complaint I had was acne hair loss.  potentially that didn't happen yet.  otherwise I'm satisfied about everything T did to me.  I really Can't think of anything that I really hate about it.  I love everything.  I love the voice changes.  I wish it could change and get even lower.  You know, the facial hair.  I don't like, I'm not a fan of body hair in general, but now at least like I don't care.  Like I don't feel the pressure to like shave it or anything.  whatever.  but i bet not everyone's experience is like mine.  so i'd like to know about yours.  i could give you i mean like the pros and cons of tea but you could literally research that and it's everywhere.  uh otherwise i wanted to put up my own experience.  uh because that's something i'm familiar with.  i hope you guys like this video and i'll see you in another one bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0r9304c8cdvi01ikhd87","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCzf3yeHqRcDmvA5r2mMxWXg","channel.name":"Transtastic","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.95,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXbNxUhgOCFMsFFmKByCnPKFonz56O1MAnZYg_wxw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2010-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, I'm Adam from Transtastic. Today, I'm sharing my personal experience with medical transition, focusing on the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). As I'm not yet undergone surgery, my experience is limited to HRT. The biggest pro for me is passing, which has brought male privilege and increased comfort in my own skin. I no longer feel the need to prove myself to others, and I'm left alone to live my life.\n\nOther pros include the voice change, which has allowed me to express myself more freely, and the ability to grow facial hair. However, I'm not a fan of body hair. Cons include acne, which was a significant issue in the first few months of transition, and hair loss, which is a concern for many trans men. I've had to adapt to a skincare system to manage my acne, and I'm experimenting with different hairstyles to prepare for potential hair loss.\n\nOverall, my experience with HRT has been very positive, with the only complaints being acne and hair loss. I'm satisfied with the changes I've experienced, including the voice change and facial hair growth. I'd love to hear about your experiences and share my own in this video.","responses":"[1] Disability: Mentions medical transition and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for individuals with disabilities.\n[1] Health: Mentions hormone replacement therapy (HRT), acne, hair loss, and skincare system.\n[1] Personal Development: Mentions personal experience, pros and cons, and self-expression.\n[1] Relationships: Mentions male privilege and increased comfort in one's own skin.\n[1] Social Life: Mentions living life freely and being left alone.\n[1] Identity: Mentions medical transition and personal experience with HRT.\n[1] Personal Growth: Mentions adapting to a skincare system and experimenting with hairstyles.\n[1] Community: Mentions sharing personal experiences and hearing about others' experiences."}

To me now, I would say it was like living in a war zone.  And it really came home to me.  I really understood it when people started speaking about the civil war in Syria and the use of snipers.  And that's the analogy I use.  Like a sniper would hit me every day, multiple times, from name calling to sexual violence.  All of that happened all the time.  When I became an adult, when I began to think a lot more practically and seriously about my transition, it was empowering to have grown up in a country where there is a recognition of the third gender or, you know, of the non-binary in a sense.  A trans person I identified with, I don't think I ever met one.  I didn't have any resources.  I didn't know where to go.  And then I remember I chanced upon this article.  A journalist had written an article about how they had set up a helpline for trans people.  So I went to meet this journalist, and then they put me in touch with the local government hospital psychiatric unit, which is a complete nightmare, where this guy essentially told me, I don't believe you're trans because you would have insisted to go to a girl's school.  Why did you go to a boy's school?  And all this sort of shit.  I was like, you know, I'm trans, I'm not stupid.  But eventually I found some doctors elsewhere in a different city, but it was so expensive.  And, you know, like trying to find a job and keep a job was a challenge.  So when I was 17, 18, and I made a decision after a failed suicide attempt, I wanted to thrive.  I just didn't want to, you know, manage.  So I think coming to that decision was very transformative.  I just said to people, you know, this is who I am, take it or leave it.  I got two gifts.  One was that I grew up in a household where my parents, not in any everyday way, ever told me not to be who I was, this effeminate child.  But also I grew up into spiritual outlooks that don't have a concept of guilt in the same way.  I think that has been the biggest gift.  Like, I don't know what it feels to be guilty or ashamed of who you are.  I have been lucky somehow to find myself in places where I was able to influence.  And I think it is therefore important if you have been given this opportunity by fate to use that effectively.  It's a responsibility to be your honest and true self at all times.  I have the gift of being the eternal minority from growing up in a mixed faith background, you know, to being a trans woman, to being a person of color here, a migrant.  What is important to me, therefore, in doing this work is to try and do something to make sure that others who come after me can come on their own merit.  But I think like what is most important right now is for more diverse voices to be heard, whether it is the voices of survivors of sexual violence or my colleagues who do a lot better work than I do.  I need to make sure that my colleagues who I manage here that their ideas really come to fruition.  I mean, that is the most important reason why I do this work.  What I'm really interested in is to make sure that everyone who goes through here feels that they have an opportunity to express what is really going on for them.  That's why it's important because this movement, particularly the women's movement, the feminist women's movement that is built on the history of so many women who've transformed.  One of the dangers of being this movement sometimes is that we don't know when to let more people sit on the table.  And I think I do.  know the importance of it because I just don't want to be the token trans VME woman in Scotland for many things in many spaces.  Hopefully that will not be forever and hopefully people won't call me to speak at events anymore because I think that that is important too.  We have to become redundant.  That's why it's important.  Thank you. I'm here in Stirling in Scotland to meet Mriddle, who's a trans woman who also runs a rape crisis centre.  Let's go say hello. I am Mridul Wadhwa.  I am trans and a Piscean, a mother, a wife, half Zoroastrian, half Hindu.  I'm an immigrant.  I run a rape crisis center.  I'm a feminist.  I'm a boss.  And I speak my mind, even when I shouldn't. So Mridul, tell me a bit about where we are and how you came about to work here. So this is the Fourth Valley Rape Crisis Center, and I am the manager.  So the center works with anyone over the age of 13 who's experienced sexual violence and anyone who's affected by it.  The center is part of the rape crisis movement, so we are a women-only space in the sense that only women work in the center, although we work with anyone who's been affected irrespective of gender identity.  I think some of the key things that I'm really proud of that has happened in this movement is the increased awareness about forced marriage in Scotland and how we worked pretty hard to make sure that the law was implemented effectively.  Most of our services, violence against women's services, largely cater to white cis women, but there are others who don't naturally come to our spaces.  You can't expect people to know that you are inclusive if you're not explicit of your inclusion.  So I think our journey around inclusion as a Violence Against Women's movement is we're getting there, but I think there are some key things that we have to do and consistently because equality is so fragile.  I spend most of my life thinking about the status of minority ethnic women and migrant women in particular.  Any minority who experiences oppression, you expect to be treated badly wherever you go.  And so you steal yourself up for that.  So when you say we are inclusive, well, you have to show how, what are you doing not to treat people badly?  Can you connect with people's humanity?  For me, it is an investment in attitude.  Like we need to expose ourselves to difference so that the difference is normal.  We just tend not to think of ourselves as different. Is there a personal reason for getting into this line of work? Staying on has been personal because it was pretty clear to me that I was the only trans woman in the women's aid movement.  And I wasn't even sure whether I would have been hired if they had known that I was trans.  When I came out individually to various colleagues, there was this disbelief, oh, you can't be trans.  Like, you know, what does a trans person look like?  What does a cis woman look like?  How do we know?  Over a period of time, it became more and more important within my work in this movement to be a trans woman.  My activism wasn't around trans activism because really what mattered to me more was my status as an immigrant woman and the women I worked with who came from immigrant backgrounds.  I had the opportunity to deliver trainings across this country and so invariably I would come out in all of my trainings.  Not just for people to change their perception of what an immigrant woman looks like or is or who she is, but also what a trans person looks like, you know?  So I think staying in it has become a personal thing. So tell me what it was like growing up for a year and who was the first trans person that you met?","channel.id":"clxmi0mat00v7cdvio57tdapf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCsDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA","channel.name":"My Genderation","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/g864bFMBAXso_fkzd73ZmSXVmy9E2HHX__MiClzVA-IEppDPNVUpMVC4-dH8_O59GaGahuLOLg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker grew up in India, where they experienced daily name-calling and sexual violence, comparing it to living in a war zone.

In my previous video, I talked about how the hatred for laziness can be interwoven with ableism.  neglecting to consider accessibility needs, and often turning that hatred and anger into action that denies accessibility to those who need it.  If you haven't watched it yet, I hope you'll check it out because today I'm going to be reacting to comments beneath the ads for products that have been deemed lazy and unnecessary and sharing with you just how and who these products benefit as an accessibility tool.  Warning for ableism and fat antagonism ahead.  Bed desks.  Keep the bedroom for sleeping and sex.  The only activities going on in that sacred space should be positions, sleeping, etc.  Sad face.  Wow, this is absolutely terrible.  This thing is practically promoting people to never leave their rooms slash house.  Like, I have no idea why anyone would ever want this.  Honestly, this is something for people who weigh literally more than 800 pounds.  First off, this comment is a great example for how ableism and fat antagonism consistently weave into themselves.  Cut that out.  Some people cannot often leave their rooms slash house, and more specifically, their bed, due to chronic illness and other disabilities, including chronic fatigue, chronic pain, dysautonomia, and beyond.  Desks over one's bed make work accessible, crafts, dining.  I personally have a portable bed desk as well as one that rolls over my bed and I keep that one against the wall for days when I'm able to sit in my chair for longer than I need to be laying down.  Fold-a-mate.  It's too slow.  I'd be done with three loads of folding baskets by the time one is done with that machine.  She could have folded the next item in the amount of time it took your noisy machine to fold it.  If I have to stand there waiting for a machine to fold my laundry, I'd rather just do it myself for free.  Some people cannot fold their own laundry for free.  They have to pay for that.  Lots of things that abled people do for free disabled people have to pay extra for.  A walk around your block is free, right?  Not for me.  I had to save up and pay thousands of dollars for my wheelchair for the privilege of getting around my block.  And when you think about it, due to job inequality and sometimes inability to work, disabled people are among the most low-income communities to then have to pay extra for things that abled people can do for free.  Does that sound fair?  I don't think so, but that's the way it is.  Anyway, right, folding clothes may not be possible or it is extenuating for people with limited mobility, fragility of skin, joints, or muscles, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, etc.  Snuggie.  Tries to blanket properly accidentally detonate... Wait, hold on, I read that wrong.  Tries to detonate... Wait, what?  Tries to blanket properly.  Accidentally detonates thermonuclear weapon.  There has to be an easier way.  Tired of using blankets like this asshole?  Do they somehow destroy your heating bill?  Are mundane tasks like answering the phone now impossibly difficult?  The design of Snuggies enables people to take their apparel on and off without having to lift themselves from their seating position or reclining position.  So this goes for people who are ill in bed, people who are wheelchair users.  Also, they are just comfy.  Why are y'all no fun?  Sock slider.  People are lazy enough and now we are making them even more lazy.  Wow, must be so difficult to bend over and put your socks on.  Cry laughing emoji.  Not talking about the people who really need it.  We are really becoming so lazy that someone had to create a device to assist with socks?  I get that it may help someone who is either elderly or unable to bend over, but the people in the video are young.  Can I respond to the fact that A couple of these comments actually acknowledge that disabled people could use them, but then they follow that up with, all the people in the ad are young.  I'm a person who could use assistance with getting my socks on and off, both for grip reasons as well as back pain when bending over.  Also, bending over is a POTS trigger.  I'm young and disabled.  I could be in that commercial.  Disability doesn't have a look or an age.  Also, when it comes to marketing specific disability items like mobility aids or medical alert necklaces, et cetera, it is always elderly actors and that reinforces the misconception that young disabled people don't exist and discourages young disabled buyers by reinforcing the stigma.  So much so that responses like this happen.  Easy egg cracker.  That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Don't even bother trying to turn on the stove.  Really, people?  Just do the work or get out of the kitchen.  I am not that lazy.  This is so silly.  Cracking an egg is, well, like the most basic thing to do in a kitchen.  If you need a ridiculous gadget to do it for you, you should probably just go to Denny's for your breakfast.  With what money, Laura?  Some people can't crack eggs.  I don't know what to tell you.  You don't have to be a dick about it.  As I've mentioned before, mobility disabilities, coordination disabilities, and as of very recently, there was someone in my comments who said that this device would make cracking eggs accessible to them as someone who had difficulty with the texture due to a sensory processing disorder.  Metal straws.  Where are people going with their minds?  How about just drinking from the cup?  How about drinking out of a cup like a big boy or girl?  Why don't just straight, what?  Why don't just drink straight from the cup?  Why do you need a straw when I believe all Malaysians grew up drinking from the cup, glass, or even bottle?  That's a very peculiar boast.  And um, definitely not accurate as disabled Malaysians exist.  Ban all plastic items which are not biodegradable.  Every country should ban it.  This is an example where outrage succeeded in creating obstacles for disabled people and their needs.  In my previous video, I got to talk a little bit about how the outrage over pre-cut and pre-peeled fruits and vegetables got discontinued because of said outrage.  But don't worry about us.  We'll survive on the dollar menu.  Just kidding.  That's a weird joke.  We, some of us, cannot.  And also, why would you want that for us?  Disabilities that require straws for access to drinking and eating include Those with difficulty with grip, those with mobility disabilities, those with digestive disabilities, swallowing, disabilities where they must be horizontal, particularly while very much needing to stay hydrated, like with pots.  Bending straws that can reach them where they lay are necessary.  The original use for straws was for patients in hospitals, specifically plastic bendable straws.  The plastic could handle all temperatures.  It withstood chewing without harming the patients.  Patients who had spasms or seizures didn't risk being harmed by the material.  Those who were immunocompromised had a safe, sterile, one-time-use straw.  Although these were responses to metal straws, I do have to state that plastic alternatives, including metal straws, will simply not be an option for everyone.  And legal bans against plastic straws, among any other plastic medical tools, are dangerous for disabled people.  Straws definitely deserve a bigger spotlight, so that's actually going to be my next video, so subscribe and stay tuned for that.  Obviously I couldn't mention every single accessibility use for every single item, so leave me a comment and let me know what are some accessibility tools or aids that you can think of that people often neglect to consider.

Here is another installment of Trans Voice Technology! In this video we will discuss a solution for the cough. While there are many paths and strategies to feminize a cough, here is perhaps the simplest. \n\nThe human ear has a tendency to hear the \"attack\" of a sound as more important than the other parts of the \"envelope\". By manipulating the attack of our coughs, we can reprogram the way people hear our cough. Regardless of how masculine the actual coughing sound, if it is started by a feminine attack, the cough will be heard feminine.\n\nExecuting this is quite simple. First, start with a high pitched and bright \"ehh\" sound. Work on creating the sound easily and consistently. Make the sound, then gently cough after it. After being able to perform the two in sequence, work on reducing the space between them until it is heard as one individual sound. If done properly, the feminine attack will \"wash out\" the masculine cough. \n\nI hope this short little tip helps everyone! I'll be releasing another major video soon! :D\n\nwarmly,\nAmelia Zheanna H.\n\nLove my videos? Consider supporting me on patreon!

It's ya girl, Zee, from transvoicelessons.com.  And in this short video, I'm gonna teach you how to feminize a cough.  Now, first off, you have to understand that the human brain interacts with sound in three dimensions.  Time, amplitude, and frequency.  In fact, every sound that you've ever heard in your entire life can be perfectly recreated with some values of time, amplitude, or frequency.  Now, when your brain hears a sound, it quickly decomposes and deconstructs that sound into a few key events.  The attack, the decay, the sustain, and the release.  We call this an envelope, okay?  Now, each sound has a slightly different behavior throughout all of these variables.  but your brain weighs the attack of a sound much heavier, which means it's much more important than the rest of the sound, okay?  And you can feminize your coughs very easily by simply replacing the attack on your coughs with a short burst of high pitch, like so.  And then you just put that in front of a cough.  Do you hear it?  Yeah, it doesn't matter how I cough.  If the attack of it sounds cute and feminine, then the rest of the cough will be rendered in a way that sounds cute and feminine to the ear because the brain weighs the attack of a sound so heavily, okay?  So here's a simple way that you can start doing this.  First, let's just take a very high-pitched kind of sound and just go eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Now, then do that and then cough very gently after it, eh.  And then slowly work on decreasing the time between the two so that the sounds are one.  Now that was a bit over exaggerated, of course, right?  Like I'm not going to be coughing like that in person, but even with just the softest amount of alteration to the attack of a cough, you can quickly reprogram the person's brain who hears you into understanding that your cough is feminine and cute and wonderful.

In this video, I'll teach you how to feminize a cough by manipulating sound.  The human brain processes sound in three dimensions: time, amplitude, and frequency.  When hearing a sound, the brain breaks it down into attack, decay, sustain, and release.  The attack is the most important part, weighing heavily on how the sound is perceived.  To feminize a cough, replace the attack with a short high-pitched sound, like \"eh, eh, eh.\"  Then, gently cough after it, and gradually decrease the time between the two sounds.  Even slight alterations to the attack can reprogram the listener's brain to perceive the cough as feminine and cute.  This technique can be applied to any sound, not just coughs.  I hope this helps, and if you have any questions, please let me know in the comments.","responses":"[1] Communication: Mentions the application of the technique to convey a message.\n[1] Learning: Mentions the teaching of the technique in a video.\n[1] Cough: Mentions the specific sound being manipulated.\n[1] Femininity: Mentions the concept of feminizing a sound.\n[1] Sound: Mentions the manipulation and processing of sound.\n[1] Brain: Mentions the processing of sound in the brain.\n[1] Perception: Mentions how the brain perceives sound."}

Today I want to talk about accessibility in parking lots.  Whether you're abled or disabled, these are some things you may want to consider.  I am an ambulatory wheelchair user with a disability parking placard, but I do not have an accessible vehicle currently.  What I do have is a foldable power chair that I keep in the trunk of my car.  So the first thing I want to talk about is the striped lines on either side of the accessible parking space.  These in particular say no parking, but even if they didn't, you never park on these.  You never obstruct them, period.  Not with your car, with your motorcycle, with your bike, with your shopping carts, with your pretzel carts, with your snow piles, with your trash, nothing.  These are access aisles and they're meant to be clear at all times.  Their purpose is to have enough room and level ground for disabled people to exit and enter their vehicles safely or at all, particularly in the cases of those who are enter and exiting their vehicles with their mobility aid or those who have wheelchair accessible vehicles where the ramp deploys on either side.  And did you know, in those cases, if someone needs that extra space in order to safely exit and enter their vehicle and they cannot find an accessible spot, or maybe they don't have their placard yet, they may need to take up two parking spaces in order to do so.  Think about that the next time you get upset about someone parking like a jerk, because that might be the case.  Because my wheelchair comes out of the trunk of my car and I'm able to walk over to it most of the time, if there is a space available close to the accessible parking spaces, Then I will park here instead in consideration of those who need the access aisles in order to take their mobility devices out or to deploy their rents.  I still need to be close enough to the accessible parking spaces though because I do need the access aisles typically to lead me to the access lane to then lead me to the accessible entrance into a location.  There are a couple of different ways I use accessible spaces.  If I am not using my wheelchair, I may or may not be using my cane, then I need the space that is closest to my destination because my ability to walk is very limited.  Side note, just like I consider disabled folks who might need the access aisles when I'm parking, I hope able-bodied people might consider that if they are able to walk a little bit further, or aren't necessarily in any time crunch, maybe leave the closer parking spaces available for someone who might really need it as well.  The other times I use accessible spaces, I am using my wheelchair, and in case you never noticed, most wheelchairs leave you rather short, which can make parking lots a much more dangerous place.  Attempting to pass by cars that may not see you as they back out due to your height is So.  for that and many other disabilities, the access aisles typically lead to an access lane, which is a marked accessible path where one does not have to cross a vehicular lane or attempt to get in between cars in order to get to their destination.  Also, just to add, because it's here and I love mentioning it, this is what I think all sidewalks should look like.  Smooth, level, and with a ramp or curb cut on the side of the level ground.  When the sidewalk itself dips, it makes it incredibly difficult to not roll off into the street.  This is a great sidewalk for bipeds and wheelchair users alike.  And that's all I have for you today.  I have to go run my errands, but if you appreciated this video, please consider becoming a Patreon patron.  It is how I keep these videos coming, and as I mentioned before, I'm trying to save enough money for an accessible vehicle for myself.  Also, subscribe if you haven't, and I will see you eventually.

It stars Daniel Kaluuya, Alison Williams, Bradley Winford, and Katherine Keener, as well as Lakeith Stanfield.  It's a very good movie. It was Jordan Peele's directorial debut.  A lot of people didn't really know what to expect because... We all knew him from Key and Peele.  Yeah, that's really it.  And I mean, it's interesting to go back, of course, and watch this now, like having had Us just come out and the Twilight Zone has just come out with him hosting that.  And of course, he's also going to be with Keegan-Michael Key in Toy Story 4. Right.  I forgot. I have never seen Get Out.  Paige hasn't seen it since she saw it in theaters. What happens when you keep your friends informed of your whereabouts when you go to a strange country home?  You survive.  You're about to find out on this episode of the PNS Watch Series.  Well, it's been a while since we did one of these.  Not for lack of trying. Yeah, I took my brother to see it because I just didn't want to be alone in the theater.  But he really enjoyed it, and I wasn't sure that he was going to, given the subject matter and the fact that he's, you know, a white boy in America.  But he liked it! Since it has been two years since this movie was released, we do know what happens.  We do know the basic premise.  Let's just start the movie. For the love of God, Universal, let me watch your movies. I don't care if we don't get money from the Wicker Man.  I really just wish that people could watch us. Watch the Wicker Man! Is that LaPiece Stanfield?  It is. A good portion of the movie makes a lot more sense. That car just turned around to follow him. Yes, it did. He's dead.  but probably not because he was right after the four major characters on the building, so he's probably not dead. It's very hard to respond to that without... It's okay.  You don't have to tell me.  It's okay.  Oh, he's a photographer. Yes, he is.  That is integral to the whole movie. I know enough about the movie to not trust her!  Yeah.  There's already a level to which I'm not going to be able to watch it as Jordan Peele intended for me to watch it the first time because I know that Alison Williams' character turns out to be in Right.  And is evil. That's fair. Do they know I'm black? No.  Like, considering if I should count how many times she lies. That's what I'm looking at to say this weekend.  Remember, no human food.  He's got IBS. He's got IBS.  He's a good dog parent.  It's a ride. What the f- It was a deer. That's all?  It's also interesting of him to decide to go and look for it. The cop stops them.  And she puts on this performative, woke performance.  But she does it.  because she doesn't want a paper trail following him.  The cop may be looking for his ID because he sees a black man.  He's in an area where black men have been disappearing. And then if he happened to disappear in that area, he could be like, hmm, I saw that guy.  Yeah.  I don't know where this is, but like, people have big houses. Her dad's a brain surgeon. Of course he is.  We actually had a deer.  She made it sound like it was like, oh, this chill thing.  We saw some deer on the side of the road and then we hit one.  Catherine Keener, who of course was in The Incredibles 2 as... Evil Endeavor. As Evelyn Devor.  Her name... Literally, it's evil endeavor. What's her brother's name? Lars. I think his name is Businesson.  This house has a color theme and it's yellow.  And brown. The garbage goes under the sink. He says things really weird. To be fair, white suburban dads will do that. White family, black servants.  total cliche. i've never had a maid or a cook.  so servant sounds so weird now in the 21st century. i would have voted for obama for a third term if i could. oh my god she didn't warn him. what is he mowing? They have candles!  I've gotta say, this is a white experience I do not really recognize.  You know, if I had ever done something like this, the last thing I would ever do is tell my parents this as a funny story.  Me just being like, Southern, I'm like, do you have any idea how much trouble I would be in as an adult if I spoke to my parents this way?  Since we've gotten here, it's very, very yellow.  And like the only things that are not like yellow and do not blend into the house are Chris and his girlfriend.  I mean, what's interesting is also that like the predominant color in his apartment was blue.  This boy looks like he hasn't brushed his hair a day in his life.  Another thing, my parents would not tolerate a dinner. Oh my god, and then my dad was my man stuff. I don't think he's ever heard that or said it. I mean, so this is a good teaching moment, even though we know that, like, she is evil.  In instances like that where your family might do or say something that is either blatantly or subtly bigoted to your marginalized... Partner, I would strongly recommend not making it about you. Since I'm rewatching this, I'm finding that there are no superfluous details.  I'm like, yep, that comes back.  Put a pin in it.  Put a pin in it.  Put a pin in it.  It was just Georgina.  Do you remember what Bradley Whitford said about his dad?  What was it about his dad? My dad's claim to fame was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936. It's interesting how like you have this contrast between like blue and black and then brown and yellow.  Even when he was just outside and that really weird thing just happened like It's when yellow breaks into the picture that there's danger.  Even that flashback is blue.  And there's a blue light on him now. There's a blue light coming in from behind, but the light on his face is yellow. Maybe blue is like familiar and maybe yellow is the unfamiliar.  Earlier I thought he didn't have the strap on the camera and I was like, this boy is braver than I am!  He's wearing a green shirt, a green hat, and green pants. I didn't get to... meet you actually up close.  i'm chris.  i know who you are. there's something very interesting about the way both of them talk.  there is indeed and not just the dialogue the accent yep i've hit on things right.  yep okay you definitely have what's walter's deal?  maybe he likes you. he has every right to think that.  yeah because i know what the mystery is what the answer is.  i'm like chris.  you're like way off.  You're gonna be in so much trouble if you don't figure it out, friend.  They do show up as if they're coming to a funeral and they all come in black. I do know Tiger. Is he talking about Tiger Woods? He is. Like he knows Tiger Woods? Yes. Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here. This is so well acted and I am stressed. Is this guy even really blind? Yes.  Well, I don't know about the actor, but the character, yes. Are they playing badminton? Looks like it.  They all immediately stop talking when he goes upstairs. Oh, great.  Well, now his phone's dead. Like I said, there are no unused details.  Yeah. So you are so sexy that people are just unplugging your phone? She's so good at what she does, and it is terrible. Look, bruh, all I'm doing is connecting the dots. Rod would survive an actual... Scary movie. He's like, I know all the tropes.  Yeah. Oh my god, it's his granddad.  That's why they're running. Okay.  It's her grandfather. Yep. And she's the grandmother.  I have been holding that in almost the whole movie, waiting for you to figure that out. Because I didn't want to ruin it.  Oh man, dude. Left the flash on and everything.  He's a photographer.  He should know better.  Yes, he should.  Are they auctioning for him?  Yes. And can you guess which one of them wins? Oh, no!  No! The art dealer?  Because Chris is a photographer. Yeah!  God damn it!  It's like a murder mystery.  Like, you know a murder's gonna happen, and now, like, you can figure it out.  Like, I am enjoying it for that aspect. I'm not gonna leave you without you.  I'm not gonna manage you again. She doesn't deserve it!  Her name should have been Evil Endeavor in this movie, too. What's his name?  Evan?  Or... The brother?  Yeah, we're really not gonna remember.  Jeremy. No, no, no.  We're... Exactly. Rod.  I mean, Rod's not technically wrong. Let me go get my bag.  Okay. He shouldn't let her out of sight. I don't like this frame.  She's gonna come back and whack him in the head with something.  She's not gonna do that? She's worse? Chris, no.  No, no.  Why would she print some of these out?  Yeah, I wouldn't date white women either.  Thank God.  He was communicating with someone this whole time. What is your purpose? This feels like a loaded question.  They made a promotional video. We could both be part of something greater. Nothing that you could possibly be doing would make what you're doing okay. Something perfect.  Listen, friend, it's not perfect.  He watched both Georgiana and Logan break. My boy Chris has been missing for two days.  He left on Friday with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.  So I do all my research, you know, because as a TSA agent, you know, you guys are detectives. That's the same training. All I know is they already got two brothers.  we know. That's the thing that saves Chris is that they know Dre. He's like, great, more movies. So you won't be gone. You'll live in a certain place.  So they're not dead.  They can be brought back. Yes, they're just not ever going to be. You know, I could give a shit what color you are. He still participated in this extremely racist auction.  The grandfather started this and they choose black people specifically because he was beaten by Jesse Owens.  I mean, there's also the implication of the stereotype that black people are bigger, stronger, better at athletic activities. And now it's blue.  It's interesting. The other reason this procedure really isn't perfect is because not only are they only leaving a certain part of the host brain, but they're only taking a part of another brain.  They're not just gonna fuse.  Yeah, exactly. Candles?  Why?  It's for the aesthetic. Yeah.  The house is much more coolly lit.  It is night time out, but it's very noticeably less yellow.  You know, I just realized... Okay, where's Rose?  Ah, oh my god!  Peele tells stories about, like, what lengths people will go to to survive.  The wrangling method!  Oh my god! He's that guy at the beginning.  Because earlier I was thinking, like, what did he mean by... Jeremy's wrangling method sounds way less pleasant. Because I was thinking, like, he just goes out and finds people.  I loved that anecdote of, like, this has some hidden meaning.  He's like, yeah, the meaning is that she's weird. Those pictures weren't up there before. Oh, God.  Oh, it's just a wrangle.  I mean, what's the point, honey?  This thing's over. Well, they can't let him escape.  He knows what they did. I know, I know.  Nice.  Let me do it. His voice isn't the same.  So it's stupid that she let him have it. Yeah.  I'm so sorry.  No, you're not.  Shut up.  Yeah, when I saw this in theaters, I was like, ugh.  He's like, great. But it's just Rod. Were you going to say Rod? I mean, I told you not to go in that house. Oh, my God.  Rod would survive in a horror film. I'm T.S. Mother may consider this situation. This is not what the TSA do as a job. No. Both of his movies end with the same kind of shot.  The main character looking at a car window pondering what has happened. What happens now to Dre? Dre is the only one not immediately in the family that we see but Rose has pictures with many people.  And it's not like that family is keeping files.  They don't want people finding the host bodies, you know? That was very, very good. Yeah.  Jordan Peele is really good at writing stories about things that could never possibly happen in real life, but he convinces you that that kind of science is real in this world. Yeah. Because, like, brain transplants aren't a thing that we just can do. It is very kind of Twilight Zone-y.  Yeah.  It has, like, those kind of very core like Twilight Zone elements of being a very political message and having this very like real world.","channel.id":"clxmi0rat04ddcdvirb8sizkf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCtilV9LOwqBXw_xMQTk0JZA","channel.name":"The Princess and the Scrivener","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU1VX7kdvHkZuasrBhRHr5_O6BHGwcn3650cdFxbg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The video discusses the 2017 movie Get Out, written and directed by Jordan Peele.

So if you'd like to try out that $5 starter set, you can go to dollarshaveclub.com.  slash riley.  Alright, let's go explore Thailand! The sun's going down as I try to make my way through the crowd. So, we just had some food but I forgot to film it.  So Fiona's gonna pretend to drink from this empty boba.  Wow!  Oh my god!  Why don't you drink it? I keep choking on it. We've taken so many photos where she's just been, like, gagging on ice while we're trying to take them.  Whoa!  Oh my god!  Authentic Thailand experience!  We've been trying to get some Instagram shots here.  I think we might have one.  It's a cute little setup.  It's so cute!  The empty spinach container is there.  You're so cute. me got one summer so let's make it count.  you make me feel like everything's all right.  let's dance our problems away in the night.  love being right next to you.  you'll be on my mind. i'll be dreaming about this till the end of time.  we are young we are free.  I didn't know that Ditto opened its own tea shop.  Good for you, Ditto.  We're so proud of you. Good for her. We got some fancy drinks.  We got a pretty girl and a beautiful view.  This is the gingeriest ginger beer I've ever had.  It's so... It hits so hard.  It feels like there's, like, alcohol in it.  It's powerful.  I love it.  So it started pouring rain, so we couldn't sit near the edge anymore.  So now I have a pretty girl and a different view.  Can I show... I want to show them.  Okay, show them the view. Look at... Oh, my God.  It's so beautiful.  It is so beautiful.  Look at you.  So we went to this vegetarian food court type thing and got a ton of food for 150 baht.  Which is like seven Australian dollars.  And it's like five US dollars.  And it's a lot of delicious veggie food.  And I'm really excited.  I don't know how we're going to eat all this, but then I remember we do have Riley.  I'll take care of it. Since I met you, I feel unbreakable.  Since I met you, I feel unbreakable.  Since I met you, I feel unbreakable. Thankfully, I managed to find a place that had tofu pad thai, and then I got iced Thai milk tea, so I'm feeling really good right now.  Good morning to this penguin and nobody else. I feel unbreakable.  Oh, what is happening to me? I'm breaking free.  I'm breaking free.  Absolutely living for these lads.  Little zebra on the mic.  We got a giraffe and a little deer pan.  Also, the roundest zebra that's ever existed.  Some creepy things, a unicorn, and some adorable ones.  Obligatory Pokemon Go session in every country we visit. My, oh my. My, oh my.  The kids.  How do I look?  Great.  I think I can pull it off.  So cute.  I feel unbreakable. I feel unbreakable.  I feel unbreakable. You're too tall for Thailand, Riley. Sorry.  Thank you. We got some coconut ice cream.  I'm so excited.  Yum.  It's tough.  You're so cute.  Yeah?  Nice.  Okay, my turn.  I want to try some.  Alright, well that's everything I had for our Bangkok trip.  Thank you for watching this video.  That's been our last couple weeks here.  When we first got here, Fiona got pretty sick, so we were spending some time inside.  But she's feeling better now, we've had a good time.  And we've spent some time just inside working, which would be boring to see.  But it's been a really good trip.  You have a good time, babe?  I've had a great time.  Nice.  But yeah, that's about it for this one.  I'll be making some more travel stuff as we hop around to some other places, but thanks for sticking around for this one.  And I'll see you next time.  Bye! He's gonna break the bone.  Oh, I can take it all.","channel.id":"clxmi0m7i00t1cdvi0a5yca5r","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCVF8SAGEQnBA-yKM4iQNqfw","channel.name":"Riley J.

Please look up, make all women safe, sign our petition and help us. Thank you. A really great thing about Trans Pride Brighton is that it's still a protest rather than a corporate shill.  Perhaps a pride march is a metaphor for transition.  We seem to wait forever for it to start.  And then no matter how much anybody we pass might disapprove of us or even hurl abuse at us, we keep going with our heads held high.  It's still magical seeing trans people taking their first hesitant steps in public at this event.  And if that's you, we welcome and value you.  Thank you very much, everybody, and have a great day. And we're here to celebrate everything that the trans community has achieved since then, but also to recommit ourselves to challenging the hatred and the stigma and the discrimination that still exists. Because we will not accept people being attacked simply for being who we are.  We will not accept a media that all too often is still so divisive and damaging and destructive when it comes to the portrayal of trans people. Tolerance is not enough. Trans rights are human rights. Thank you for being here in all of your glorious beauty to celebrate who you are.  Thank you.  How excited are you to be at Trans Pride right now?  We should never have to hide who we really are.  We have every right to be proud of our identities, whether that's where we work, where we study, where we go to school, where we play sport, anywhere.  I truly believe that visibility is the key to creating real change, real positive change in the world.  And that's why we're here today.  Because every one of you is having an impact through being here together, being your true, authentic self.  Today is about celebrating our right to be who we are.  Not just to be accepted, but to live our lives without limitation.  If you have a dream, go out there and get it.  Believe it's yours for the taking.  Trans men are men!  Trans women are women!

I'm like, Carol!  My mom had no clue who Carol was.  About a week before Captain Marvel came out, we were watching a Captain Marvel trailer, and I was like, that's Carol.  And she was like, that's Carol?  I was like, yes.  Hello everybody, it's the Princess, and I saw Captain Marvel.  Funny story about this shirt.  Sarah and I went to Disney with some of our queer friends, and I got, hmm, not terribly sunburnt, but sunburnt enough that I only had a tank top for the next day and didn't want to exacerbate the problem.  So we went to Disney Springs, and this was the only shirt that I even marginally like.  You can't see the bottom of it, but there's a little red patch that I like a lot.  So I bought this and then sat through the rest of Saturday having people ask me time and time again if I had seen the movie yet.  Every cast member that had already seen it pretty much said the exact same thing, where they were all telling me that you get some backstory about some of the characters from earlier Marvel movies and it was pretty good, they all really liked it.  So I went into the movie pretty optimistic.  I've been optimistic about this movie since they announced that it was going to be made.  My review has been split into pros and cons.  I made a list.  We're going to start with A couple pros go into the cons, and I think I'm going to try to end with a couple more pros, just so that it ends nicely.  I will admit that I was one of those people that was like, I don't know so much about Brie Larson, and I regret thinking that at the very beginning, but, you know, you live and you learn.  And now having seen the movie, I, um... love Brie Larson.  I just haven't appreciated her correctly and I want to make up- I want to make reparations for that because she's great!  I like her a lot!  I'm not saying that I'm attracted to her, but I'm kind of attracted to her.  The costume designer of Captain Marvel probably didn't, but hopefully, recognizes that queer women and queer people that are attracted to Brie Larson don't need her in the earlier Captain Marvel, Miss Marvel costumes.  You put her on screen, you make her kick Jude Law's ass, and we fall in love with her.  Wouldn't you know it?  I saw somebody on my Instagram feed talking about not really knowing who Carol is and that's like a problem for them.  My counter to that is that Carol doesn't really know who Carol is.  I'm not bothered by the identity crisis because Carol has a lot of figuring things out to do.  I thought the writing was pretty solid.  There were like, you know, maybe a few little mishaps here and there, nothing that immediately comes to mind specifically because I don't remember things very well, but I didn't really have a problem with most of the writing and thought it was, you know, pretty good storytelling.  Not like fantastic, perfect storytelling and writing or anything, but I also don't think it needs to be.  It's a superhero movie and even people that don't particularly know who Carol is or care about Ms.  Marvel or Captain Marvel, they're gonna go see it because it's a Marvel movie.  That just happens.  If you have seen my video about Still Star-Crossed, you know how I feel about Lashana Lynch.  I love Lashana Lynch.  There wasn't enough of her for me in this movie, and that's not really even like a critique or a judgment.  I personally just wanted more Lashana Lynch.  So, you know, there's a lot of talk about Captain Marvel being, like, military propaganda and it's this weird gray area that I don't completely understand for reasons.  And I don't think I necessarily went into the movie with that mindset.  I tried not to because I'm trying to judge Captain Marvel the way I would judge literally any other Marvel movie rather than hold it to a higher standard.  And the movie itself really is not very heavy in the military propaganda.  It really actually doesn't have a lot of good things to say about the military.  The whole point of Captain Marvel is that Carol rejects the imperialistic group that she's been brainwashed into thinking that she's a part of, and that makes her more powerful.  Even the things that it has to say about the Air Force are not great.  I kept forgetting that Ben Mendelsohn was in this movie and then all of a sudden he just shows up and I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, that guy!  Director Krennic!  Right!  He's in this!  I very much appreciated his Australian accent.  I liked that a lot.  And I think he did a really good job with this character.  I wasn't expecting the twist with the character and I did really like it.  I think the only reason that I have any kind of hesitation to say that is because Disney as a company has kind of been leaning towards this kind of twist, but specifically with their villains.  The character that Ben Mendelsohn plays kind of plays with that trope, but doesn't do the same thing that Hans does, so... I'm good with it.  Coulson was there.  I love Coulson.  I love Phil Coulson.  I watched Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  for probably like two or three seasons before.  I probably went to England and forgot about it, but I watched because I loved Coulson so much, and so seeing Coulson alive in the MCU again was great.  And spinning off of that, Fury was an actual human being.  I like Nick Fury.  He's great.  I think especially like in The Winter Soldier.  He's like a major part of that movie, and it's fascinating.  And I also think that for the most part, Marvel movies do not treat Nick Fury as a human being.  He is just the director of S.H.I.E.L.D He's kind of a shadowy figure, and that works for some of the Marvel movies.  But I like that.  this movie humanizes him and gives him maybe not a fully fleshed background, because he is still a very secretive person, but the fact that he like sort of almost gives little details about himself, definitely makes him more of a real person and not just a shadow and a spy.  And where he gets the name for the Avengers, I cried a little bit.  So here are my cons list.  There was already an issue of people wanting Monica in the movie as Captain Marvel because she was Captain Marvel before Carol, and I kind of know why they didn't do that.  And I kind of know why they gave Maria a daughter named Monica, but I kind of also think that Maria could have been Monica.  I'm not angry that she wasn't, and I'm not angry that Monica was a child, because that means that Monica eventually grows up.  Monica is probably only a couple years older than me at the most.  It's a complicated feeling.  So the thing is that this movie does not focus on romance.  Sarah makes the point that the movie does not point in any direction as to who Carol is sexually or romantically attracted to, because she's not.  And I think a big part of that is the fact that Carol has no idea who Carol was.  I mean, she's like dropped on an alien planet alien to her.  She's dropped on an alien planet that she can't remember ever being on, doesn't know anybody, can't remember any of her past except for like the little flashes that she gets in dreams, but she doesn't have any way to make sense of those things.  Since Carol isn't really focused on who Carol is going to kiss, the movie isn't either.  And I recognize that.  There were a few times in the movie where I was like, this woman is queer, 100%.  There are just a lot of things that I think people could pick up on, whether or not it is something that the movie necessarily wants you to focus on, and I hesitate at that point to say that it's, like, baity, because if the movie really isn't about any of that, is it really baity?  It just almost feels like it is because I... maybe I'm projecting and that's okay.  If I recognize that I'm projecting, it's not the fault of the movie.  I think most of where I'm coming from as far as the movie possibly being a little baity is the fact that I know Marvel and Disney and that they rely very heavily on the Chinese film market, and so they will never really say whether or not Carol was queer.  I will give the movie the credit that it is due in the fact that, like, it really does not focus at all on any kind of romantic or sexual relationship with Carol, and a lot of that has to do with the fact, again, that Carol doesn't know who Carol is.  So for years people have been complaining about color grading and lighting in Marvel movies and how a lot of Marvel movies tend to be very dull on the color scale.  I think Captain Marvel kind of falls back into the more dull color scale and I think I am almost positive that the like the set designer or anybody that was doing like lighting work was probably white.  And I say that because there was at least one point for every single dark-skinned actor in this movie that I just could not see them.  They were not lit very well.  There is a scene where Lashana Lynch, who is very dark-skinned, and Brie Larson are sitting at a table in front of a window in New Orleans, and I honestly cannot tell you what happened in that conversation because all I could see was the foliage outside behind them.  So the thing about living in the South is that you very quickly recognize that the sun is bright.  What you really shouldn't do, especially when you have somebody so dark-skinned, is film it in front of a window that becomes overexposed, because then all you can see is the white light from outside and the foliage around them, and you can't really see the actress, at all.  You can only see the white actress sitting right across from her, and that is distracting, and I think kind of an oversight.  Jaiman Hunsu also is in this movie, and he plays a character that he played in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie.  There were also times where the scene was so dark that I could not see him standing next to Jude Law at all.  There's no reason for them to be that dark.  I should be able to see Jaiman Hunsu if you're gonna put him in the movie.  I really didn't follow or care about Jude Law's character very much.  He was there.  Ronan.  Let's get into Ronan.  For the love of God, Marvel, just find a good use for Lee Pace, please.  Lee Pace is such a lovely man, and then they do this to him, and I'm just like, you don't make me care about him, and that is a travesty.  So in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, Ronan is the main villain, and I don't know if you remember that because he's completely forgettable.  Ronan definitely fell very far into the deep cavern of forgettable Marvel villains, and once again kind of does.  And it's a shame because Lee Pace plays Ronan!  I think Ronan actually fits better into the narrative of Captain Marvel than he did into the narrative of Guardians of the Galaxy, but I still think that he didn't really do anything.  I think more so than Jaiman Hansu's character, Ronan just kind of felt weaseled in to be like, hey look, he intersects with another Marvel movie!  Let's put Lee Pace in this movie!  And I can get with that sentiment, but not so much the idea that like he's just kind of there.  Back to the rest of my pros.  Got a new character out of Gemma Chan.  I quite liked her character, even though I wasn't supposed to like her.  Here's the thing about that.  I like Gemma Chan.  I kind of already complained about this, but wow, Carol is pretty queer.  Maybe Carol doesn't even know that she's queer, but I do, and that's kind of what's important.  I really liked the music choice.  I mean, we had Nirvana and, no doubt, 90s music that I really like.  Goose is the true star of the movie.  Everybody loves Goose.  Everybody loved Goose, like, before the movie came out, and now that the movie's out, everybody really, really loves Goose.  The fact Carol is the most powerful when she denies that her power was given to her and takes control of it for herself.  Yeah, two thumbs up from me on that.  Also this is very little to do with Captain Marvel, but the endgame scene.  the day before this trailer came out I had tweeted that like I wasn't ready to relive all of Thor's trauma and then Marvel gives me I like this one.  You got the protector of the lesbians and the goddess of the lesbians and they are Best friends forever.  I really, really enjoyed the movie.  I would definitely go see it again.  I really, genuinely love Carol.  Those are all of my thoughts on Captain Marvel, I think.  Thank you so much for watching this video.

Given that they have to eat rotten food on this island, I really doubt that they... The same time as Star Wars, it's fine.  Hi everybody! Princess and Scrivener here. It's almost been a year since we talked about this, which is surprising given how often you guys ask us to talk about this. have Pac-Man in their arcade.  Uma's so pretty! Oh, when do you think the Muppets are gonna come into the Descendants movies? But Descendants has released another look at the next movie, which is coming out this summer.  We are actually hoping that we will be able to get a guest to watch the third one with us. We're not, like, in cahoots with Disney for this or anything.  It's not like Doug Cameron is gonna come and watch it with us.  It's just one of our friends, probably. So a teaser was released a couple days ago for Descendants 3.  This is also after we have finally seen some official pictures for Cheyenne Jackson playing Hades. I guess we're gonna start there.  Obviously they went with, like, the leather and the chains and stuff because that's what they do for all of the characters.  That's fine.  I don't really care so much in context and everything.  It's really, like, the hair.  So they're gonna confirm, I guess, that, like, Hades and Maleficent hooked up. I don't want that, though.  No.  It's one of the last things I want out of this series. It kind of is almost that plot on Once Upon a Time when they went to Hades and he was like, I'm in love with Zelina. And I'm like, but why?  We don't talk about Once Upon a Time anymore. Stop it.  Y'all really want us to. Itta!  It's okay.  It's fine.  It certainly is consistent with how the rest of them look. Yeah. I'm not surprised by this interpretation.  It's what I've come to expect from this series. His hair looks like cotton candy. It's not very menacing. No. But I mean, that's kind of the thing about Descendants.  Like, none of the villains are really meant to be very scary.  I just really don't want Hades to be Maleficent's Baby daddy.  Yeah.  Of all of the Disney villains that you could possibly hook up with.  Yeah.  Out of all of them.  Hades.  You could do worse, but you could also do a lot better.  Yeah.  All right, we ready? Yeah.  I have seen it before. I haven't. I watched it like three times in a row, because I was like, I need to see everything.  We had the spindle and some crown.  That was Ben with a mustache. It was really bad.  For real? Did I miss that?  Yeah.  Oh god. Oh god!  Oh my god.  Oh my god. I saw this three times and missed that every single time.  and now that I know that that's Ben, I know what happens later in this teaser and I am terrified.  He's so boring.  Giving him a beard doesn't make him interesting. Oh my god, that's such a bad look.  It looks like they taped it onto his face.  They might have.  You cannot tell who is who from the back. She's wearing a crown.  That's my daughter Evie. Okay, that's fair. Okay, that's the thing that I saw before. No!  Why?  Didn't I make a joke about... Literally yesterday.  Literally yesterday I made a joke about, like, what if Ben, like, starts turning into the Beast because of the thing that happened at the end of the last movie?  And I said nothing because I wasn't sure if Ben was in this trailer.  Also, that's Gil and Harry.  I'm very confused.  He's wearing black lipstick and eyeliner.  Look at that cat eye!  I'm glad I told you to wear that color lipstick because you match.  I'm devastated that you just insinuated that I would look anything like that.  Oh, excuse you.  It looks exactly... Dark lipstick and a cat eye right now. And that is the look that he is sporting here in this cat... Look at this budget cat's look. Oh my god.  And then anything that we don't get out of this trailer or out of the movie itself, somebody is going to be like, oh, it was explained in this book that you have to buy and read.  Wow.  Boo Boo Stewart, though. It's just art.  It's very, very pretty.  It just gets better every year.  Yes.  Facilier's Voodoo Arcade.  Do you think Facilier has Pac-Man? He has a bullseye. Oh yes, the classic game bullseye. I'm glad that they kept her braids.  At least, like, the top.  She's got, like, a half-braid, half-relaxed thing going.  Because, like, the braids and the fringe on her outfit was always supposed to mimic, like, both waves and tentacles, because her mom is Ursula.  And I really liked that part of her, like, aesthetic.  So I'm really glad that she gets to keep parts of. They're all fighting together.  I don't want Harry to be here or exist. Unless they're gonna be like, Gil and Harry are actually boyfriends.  And then I'll be like, oh, okay.  Yeah, that's fine.  Okay.  That'd be fine.  So then stop making Harry weirdly predatory about the girls in the movie. It'd be great if he could stop doing that. Yeah.  Oh, my daughter.  My girl Evie. Oh, that little card was cool.  I like that. I'm pretty sure they're gonna actually bring in Facilier.  Like, they're not just gonna give us this teaser card and not actually do something with Facilier. With Facilier.  Yeah.  Ooh, look, the three is flaming.  Woohoo! Woohoo!  Boo Boo Stewart is always beautiful. That's very true.  He is still very, like, exceptionally good looking. Every time they give him a bun, I'm like, he's just more of that. There's a bun in the trailer, so... It's good stuff.  Yeah.  I still don't know why his color scheme is, like, blue and red and yellow.  They just seem like random colors that they chose from, like, a generic Aladdin color palette.  Because everybody else is very clearly, like, their color palette matches their parent.  But, like, Jafar really only has black and red. I guess, like, black and red is not really dynamic enough. And it doesn't- it also clashes with Carlos, who's black and white and red because of Cruella. Yeah. Which is fine, but then they just chose blue and red and yellow. They're like, damn it, we shouldn't have designed all of these villains to have the same color scheme!  It's like, if only we'd known that we were gonna make a Disney Channel cinematic universe with our kids, we would've totally given someone pink. The daughter of one of them is just pink because Mal is purple.  They can't both be purple.  That's the plot of Descendants 24. I made a tweet where I was like, I can't wait to see my daughter wielding a sword! And then a day later I realized that she's already done it. So all of the kids change their looks each movie.  Except for Evie, because they're just like, Evie's perfect, we nailed it the first time, we just give her a different shirt this time. You know who I don't miss?  Chad. Like this video.  if you want shirts that say, don't do this, Chad. Don't do this, Chad. Don't.  Oh my god.  Who wants an enamel pen? I do, though.  I actually kind of do now that I've said it out loud.  Just put it next to my nobody-survives-the-industrial-revolution shirt. We'll add it to our merch list.  Yeah.  I find it really funny how many people I see trash talk the Disney Channel kind of campy, garish aesthetic.  because we have that aesthetic because of the success of High School Musical.  We have High School Musical looking quite different than really any other DCOM that came before it.  It had this very synthetic, produced, preppy, bright-colored look to it, and we all loved it.  It was a huge hit. Well, I was thinking about this the other day, and I was calling it the Kenny Ortega camp factor, because that's really what it is. That's a very good way to describe it. I would go so far as to go back to Hocus Pocus.  You can make connections to the type of films that Kenny Ortega makes. Yeah, and I would say that what the Sanderson sisters wear is no more tacky-looking than anything that anybody in Descendants wears. Even though that's not the same costume designer, it still has a very Kenny Ortega movie feel to the costume. Like, that is just something that Disney Channel tried and it was incredibly successful and so they have continued to do it.  It makes Halloween costumes really, really easy.  I think that about does it.  Yeah.  We're looking forward to seeing the movie in the summer.  Thank you guys so much for watching.

The term pinkwashing has a long history.  Originally, it was coined in reference to companies that produced products decorated with pink ribbons, signifying a support for breast cancer awareness.  When in reality, many of these companies did nothing to actually contribute to breast cancer related causes.  Many of them even produced products containing ingredients linked to a higher risk of breast cancer.  In effect, pinkwashing was used to describe a corporation's hypocrisy, profiting from the outward appearance of social awareness while ignoring or even exacerbating the problem itself.  The term is also used in the context of LGBT activism in a very similar way.  Even if a company turns its logo rainbow-colored for Pride Month and pays lip service to the queer community, that doesn't necessarily mean that the company actually does anything to actually help LGBT people.  In fact, they may even play an active role in harming them.  Enter YouTube, the proverbial hand that feeds me.  There's a good chance you're already aware of this situation to some degree, but here it is in a nutshell.  Carlos Maza is the host and producer of StrikeThru, a video series for Vox.com that explores the challenges faced by modern news media.  For the past couple years, conservative commentator Steven Crowder has produced a series of videos ostensibly debunking Maza's work, but mostly acting as a vehicle for homophobic insults. Okay, so the little queer could eat his chips all nonchalantly.  It's code for rape, Mr.  Queer Eating Chips on the Vox channel. Mm-hmm, chip, chip, chip, chip, bet you can eat just one. Like dicks.  This is what Mr.  Gay Vox wants to do.  Mr.  Lispy Queer from Vox.  He just sashays across without, like, just, ah! The Gay Vox Sprite is wrong! Now he could be a tranny, Your Honor!  I don't know how many Lispy Angry Sprites and Vox sashay across your screen and try and tell you otherwise. Since Crowder has spent years cultivating the type of audience that responds positively to this, each of these new videos he releases incites a new torrent of online harassment aimed at Mazza.  This is a very common tactic in this corner of YouTube.  Build an audience of bigots through demagoguery, mention a marginalized person in an unfavorable light, deny all culpability when that person is mobbed with harassment.  It gives the instigator the perfect alibi.  I didn't tell my audience to harass anyone.  How am I responsible for what people in my audience decide to do?  It's also worth mentioning that many people aren't fully aware of the sheer volume of harassment we're talking about here.  I have a fairly thick skin.  So one person calling me a slur one time, it sucks, but hey, it happens.  Not that big of a deal, right?  Now imagine hundreds of people calling you slurs every day for years on end.  That's the level of dogpiling that some targets have to deal with.  Some critics will respond with, well, then just don't go online.  And this is the crux of the problem.  This is what people mean when they say that letting hate speech go unchecked is a greater threat to free speech than censoring it.  The aim of hate speech is to shut down the speech of others.  So when people targeted with hate speech just don't go online anymore, that means the person spouting the hate speech has gotten exactly what they want.  They've seized control of the dialogue and chased away opposing points of view.  Carlos Maza compiled a montage of Crowder's hate speech and tweeted about it.  YouTube responded by saying they would look into it and five days later they came back saying they would do basically nothing.  They demonetized Crowder's channel with the caveat that they would remonetize it if Crowder removed links to his t-shirt store where he sells shirts that say, socialism is for f**ks.  Merchandise that probably earns him a whole lot more than ad revenue would anyway.  It's also worth noting that YouTube has a well-documented history of demonetizing videos that contain the word transgender or discuss other LGBT-related topics.  In effect, they seem to be treating pro-LGBT content that doesn't violate YouTube's terms of service as being equal to anti-LGBT content that does.  Crowder's actions are infuriating, but the larger issue here is that YouTube has willfully failed to enforce its own stated policies.  In their own words, YouTube claims that while Crowder's videos clearly contain hurtful language, they do not violate YouTube's policies regarding harassment and hate speech.  a policy which ostensibly includes hurtful comments and content promoting hatred against individuals based on sexual orientation.  If calling someone a lispy queer for two years while wearing a t-shirt that says socialism is for f**ks doesn't fall under the category of harassment or hate speech based on sexual orientation, Then what does?  Why would YouTube allow all this to happen?  Why would a company that turns its logo into a rainbow and supposedly celebrates LGBT voices so completely and utterly fail to protect its users from homophobic harassment?  The answer to that is very simple.  Hate speech is profitable.  At the end of the day, what is a hate mob other than a large group of people unified around a common cause?  Very easy to mobilize and very quick to engage with new content that appeals to their hatred.  Hate speech generates engagement, and engagement is YouTube's bottom line.  This is why YouTube's algorithms and recommended videos inevitably seem to lead people towards the most extreme, sensationalist content.  YouTube's UpNext recommendation system is responsible for over 70% of all time spent on YouTube.  It's not simply designed to recommend content you might be interested in, it's designed to keep you on YouTube.  Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, said the following regarding YouTube's algorithms.  There's a spectrum on YouTube between the Calm section, the Walter Cronkite, Carl Sagan part, and Crazy Town, where the extreme stuff is.  If I'm YouTube and I want you to watch more, I'm always going to steer you toward crazy town.  Whenever these types of conversations come up, there inevitably come protests of, so you're just trying to silence everyone who disagrees with you.  As if what Crowder and his ilk are doing amounts to a simple difference of opinion.  As if calling a gay Cuban-American a lispy queer Mexican for two years was some sort of debatable viewpoint that's supposed to be politely refuted.  There's this myth perpetuated by a lot of right-wing news outlets that social platforms go out of their way to disproportionately silence conservative voices.  I think that's at least part of why YouTube has refused to take action here, because they're afraid of being accused of having a liberal bias.  But the fact of the matter is that harassment and hate speech from the right wing are given incredible amounts of latitude by these platforms.  Anyone who spends any extended period of time on social media will tell you that these platforms, especially YouTube, are teeming with far-right extremists whose behavior goes largely unchecked.  A study from Bellingcat that examined 75 fascist activists found that right-wing personalities on YouTube were the most common entry point into white nationalism and the alt-right.  The only time that high-profile harassers do seem to get banned from these platforms is when the negative press of their actions is judged to have outweighed the engagement that they generate.  Milo Yiannopoulos wasn't banned from Twitter for being conservative.  If that were the case, he'd have been banned well before 2016 when he'd already violated Twitter's terms of service multiple times.  Instead, he got banned after he inspired a wave of racist harassment aimed at actress Leslie Jones.  Twitter only intervened after Ianopoulos targeted a high-profile celebrity, and the bad press outweighed the engagement.  But Rantasmo, you might ask, if YouTube is so full of awful people and does such a bad job protecting its queer user base, then why are you still on YouTube?  And to be perfectly honest, that's kind of a good question.  This situation has me kind of at a loss as to the best course of action.  Do I continue publishing videos to YouTube, tacitly endorsing the platform and its negligence and exploitation of queer creators?  Or do I boycott YouTube and take my videos to a different platform, one where I probably won't get nearly as large of an audience, in effect deplatforming my own voice and making barely any dent in YouTube's income in the first place?  there's not really an easy answer here.  So right now, my strategy, the best strategy I can think of, is to use my platform, modest as it is, to try to put pressure on YouTube to enforce their stated policies with regard to harassment and hate speech, and to encourage other creators to do the same.  Because here's the thing.  It's going to get so much worse now.  YouTube has essentially provided harassers with a guidebook to bullying people with no repercussions.  They've basically come out and said, hey, you want to harass someone?  You want to call someone slurs for two years?  You want to amass a throng of bloodthirsty followers that you can sic on anyone you deem worthy of your ire?  Here's how to do it and not suffer any real consequences.  YouTube has created a monster that it's afraid to do anything about, and it's time to let them know that this isn't acceptable anymore.  If they want to brand themselves as celebrating LGBT pride, if they want to capitalize on the work of queer people, if they want to wear that rainbow with any amount of credibility, they need to start doing better.  Because our time, the time that queer creators spend making content, my time, is worth something.  And daddy has things to do.","channel.id":"clxmi0maa00uucdvikem5m222","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC8MYk8ZpcIZeO7Z2ljBAj3g","channel.name":"rantasmo","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/IA4C5gtxOxvsJnNAVbo4em0yQrKyKcqFEvA8x97BoZK-C4rmJ2Y5_ClB6u9YFDQaY4Lrf_2apg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2010-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The term \"pinkwashing\" refers to companies that claim to support social causes while ignoring or exacerbating the problem.

I wanted to make sure that you are aware of a really neat video that is out there.  Yes, I'm in the video, but there are also some other amazing people.  in this video and it's on Ash Hardell's YouTube channel.  If you haven't heard of Ash, Ash is a very well-known non-binary YouTuber.  So this is somebody whose channel you definitely need to follow.  I'm going to make sure I put links to their channel as well as this video I'm going to talk to you about.  But I guess this was a collaboration, which a lot of people have asked me in the past, like, are you ever going to collaborate?  With Ash Hardell.  So I was really excited when it finally happened.  Basically, Ash put out kind of a call a few months ago asking if there are people who are non-binary and over the age of 30, I think, who would like to maybe... be a part of a video.  And I didn't see that Ash posted that, but a bunch of people wrote down my name as an idea of somebody to contact.  And so since then, Ash and I have become kind of friends through the process, which is really cool.  But the video, back to the video, it's called It's Not Just a Phase, The Experiences of Non-Binary Folks Ages 30 to 70.  I'm 45, and so I'm the second oldest person in the video, I think.  Jeffrey Marsh.  Nope, Jeffrey Marsh was born on 7-7-77.  I remember that.  And so I'm older than Jeffrey Marsh.  Kate Bornstein is the person who's 70 years old in the video.  But anyway, this video is amazing.  It has, I just checked, it has over 100,000 views and right now 1,387 comments on it.  There are so many people of all ages who watched this video who found it to be really, really helpful.  And like I said, I'm just one of the people who's highlighted in the video.  I'm going to tell you who else is in this.  Vesper is a black, queer, non-binary, asexual vlogger and blogger, also known as Queer as Cat on Tumblr and YouTube.  Renee Yoxen is a queer, non-binary, and disabled singer, songwriter, and pianist.  Jeffrey Marsh was the first openly non-binary activist to appear on national television.  Kate Bornstein, since 1989, trans trailblazer.  And Jess, who has worked with human services field with vulnerable youth and families for 14 years, who also educates about gender and sexuality, diversity and inclusion.  And Pidgin, Pidgin Pangones has staked out a place at the fore of debates on intersectionality, excuse me, intersexuality and otherness, producing informational videos that go viral on BuzzFeed, writing for Everyday Feminism, and appearing on the cover of National Geographic Gender Revolution Special Issue.  Something in particular that was really cool about this video is that Kate Bornstein is somebody who I admire for some time.  Kate is okay with the use of she, her pronouns.  Kate actually said any pronoun is fine with her.  But Kate wrote a book called My Gender Workbook, and there's also a follow-up to it.  And that is the original workbook.  when it comes to exploring your gender identity.  My book, You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery, is something I wrote later.  And I wrote a message to Kate on Twitter back before I wrote the book to ask kind of like for her blessing to make sure like she thought it was a good idea I was writing this book, especially because she already had written one.  And she said she thought that'd be fantastic and encouraged me to do it.  So To have Kate, like we didn't obviously like meet each other in the video, but it was really neat to be a part of a project with Kate.  Great to work with Ash through this project as well.  And I really wish I could meet the other people.  Maybe I will one day meet the other folks who are in this video.  So I really encourage you to watch it.  Like I said, it ended up just having this effect on a lot of people.  that I think was really, really surprising to all of us who were a part of making it.  So I'll put the link in the notes and be sure to check it out.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker is excited to share a video on Ash Hardell's YouTube channel, featuring non-binary individuals over 30, including themselves.

How are you doing?  I'm good, you? Yeah, really good, thanks.  Shall we go for a little walk? Yeah, let's do it.  All right, perfect.  I've just started doing, like, Instagram and doing all the makeup spots and all that stuff.  Like, I want to help people feel as confident as they can because being a makeup artist, my favourite thing is when they finally see the whole thing and their face just lights up and they see I'm much more confident and see it build up in them straight away like that.  I love it.  It's amazing. Tell me a little bit about what happened when you were younger. I used to get physically bullied.  I used to get like pushed downstairs and I had my nose broken.  They felt that I was too feminine and because I never come out as gay or anything, because I didn't feel gay, I got ridiculed really bad for it and I had no friends at all.  I was so insecure and self-conscious and so shy that I wouldn't have said anything back.  I didn't fight back at all.  I've been called every name under the sun and I've had everything done, you know.  I've been physically assaulted.  I don't get scared of bullies anymore.  Now that I'm who I am, I'm so confident now.  If they don't like it, don't look.  It was bad at times, like, you know, I came home and cried a lot.  But, after I came out and dealt with, you know, moving schools and everything like that, I don't take shit anymore, you know?  You can't be doing that nowadays.  If someone was to try and say to me what they'd say back then, I'd be like, You're jealous.  See you later. That's the only way, isn't it? Nowadays, I feel people, even though they can struggle with it, they need to try and have as much self-love as they can.  Especially for a trans person, we work so hard to be who we are and to express the way we are. Yeah, just to feel comfortable in our own skin. Yeah, and I think if we work so hard to do something, we should be proud of the work that we've done.  Let's be real, you know? Yeah, too right, Paige.  Tell me a little bit about what's happened in the past year or so for you. A lot.  I had weight loss surgery.  Yeah, I've lost 12 stones since then. Wow, so like in a year and two months, you've lost 12 stones? Not even in two months, like it's just a year. Wow.  So what's that been like for you? I don't know, it's just like another journey.  I've been through worse. Why did you have that surgery? I wouldn't have been able to have my bottom surgery if I was that big.  So the hospital said to me, look, we need to get your weight down so that we can complete your transition. The idea of people having to have weight loss surgery is a bit flawed in a way because it's based on this idea that skinny people are healthy when actually that's not necessarily the case. You know, I might look a bit chunky if bit I'm actually like really healthy now.  so that's that's a good improvement.  that's good yeah but I feel like a lot of women feel like skinny skinny skinny like.  they find it upsetting that that's what the media is kind of made. it's like their idea of beauty idealized like a skinny stick woman.  all body types as long as you're happy healthy that's all that really matters isn't it?  and that there are so many different types of bodies. yeah i went through like some bad stuff after my weight loss surgery.  you know i no longer feel hunger or have an appetite.  so because i didn't feel the need to eat or i wasn't hungry and i didn't have an appetite I thought, what's the point of it?  And then I ended up getting like a really bad vitamin deficiency that I'm working through now.  I wasn't supposed to lose it as fast as I did.  I think being as big as you are, I've finally seen the scales go down.  I was kind of obsessed.  Oh, there's another three pounds, there's a stone gone, there's that, blah, blah, blah.  But now it's like, I'm happy where I'm at, but everything nowadays is body image.  You know, you've got Instagram, Facebook, YouTube.  Everything's how to look better, how to look better, how to look better, not how to be you.  I don't care if you're huge, I don't care if you're small, I don't care if you're tall, I don't care if you're short, I don't care if you're struggling, I just want to help, you know?  I just want you to be happy, you know? So I have a bit of a surprise for you.  Okay.  So all you have to do is just turn around and... Oh my god!  Charlie!  Hi!  Hi baby!  How are you?  I'm good, I've missed you so much!  I've missed you too. Thought we could have like a nail session or something?  Yeah!  Alright.  So Paige, you started your transition about 12, didn't you? Yeah. So what happened with you in the school?  Did you end up leaving the school? I left the school because I was transitioning really, really privately, just at home.  We were at a family friend's and we were going to ASDA and a girl saw me from that school and started throwing stuff at me and I just called my mum.  I was like, nope, not going back. And I think the saddest thing is like hearing your story now is that so much of it is like a reflection of my story.  And I went to school like 10 years before you.  And what makes me so sad is that people think like everything's fine now for like LGBT people in schools.  And like, it's really not.  Yeah.  It's still a taboo.  It's so bad how it's still happening.  And this is in England in 2019.  I went to a Catholic school as well where they were just like, they didn't actually want to help.  They didn't want to know about it.  And they didn't actually care.  It's not in their interest to help because they don't actually believe in LGBT rights themselves. You're living proof basically that trans people can have blockers at the right time they need it, surgeries hopefully around the right time that they want it.  Have you got a message for anyone about... Stick with it.  I know that sounds weird but I've been friends with a lot of trans people that feel like it's too tough.  The waiting time's too long but try and stick with it because you'll be so much happier in the long run.  I would say I'm quite lucky as in like I did come out really young and I did start medically transitioning really young.  There are other people that aren't so lucky, and I haven't had it half as hard as some people.  And that sounds weird, but I don't want to be what people look to see as a trans person.  Yeah, I am trans, and yeah, I appreciate who I am, but I'm not going to be known for being trans.  I don't want to be known for being trans. Yeah, because you're so much more than that. Yeah. So exactly, you don't want to be just trans, you want to just be you.  There's so much more to us as people.  It's a physical transition, nothing else changes.  It's an alignment of the inside and the outside. That's a good way of putting it, yeah.  I think that's why me and you get on so well, you know, because we have been through a lot of the same things and we did come out at similar times.  I think we both want to spread a message.  I think you're doing it the best way that you possibly could.  I love it so much. You are my inspiration, Paige.  You're a big reason.  I do what I do.  Meeting you so early on in my own transition, I was just like, the fact that I heard about what you were going through, I was like, it's so bad that this is still happening.  And I was like, we need to be talking about this as a society.  We need to be having these conversations because this should not be happening in our country in 2019.  So you're my inspiration.

How are you doing? So I can see that in these paintings that you're wearing some sort of giant dress. The artists that wanted me to actually wear a wedding dress for this project, and we wanted to do something like a lunatic and femininity.  I went and did my jeans and my big boots underneath the dress.  I was very So.  that's how uncomfortable I actually felt in the dress, and I couldn't wait to get out of it. So you're kind of pushing yourself outside your comfort zone for the sake of art.  I mean, as we both know, a dress doesn't make a man or a woman, it's just clothing, but it's funny how certain items can make us feel more like ourselves. I'm here in Ipswich today to meet a friend of mine, Leo.  I know Leo from an acting course that we were on a few years ago.  So, let's go say hi to Leo, shall we? Hey!  Nice to see you!  It's so good to see you!  I'm Leo.  I'm trans and have several palsy.  I'm gay.  I'm a diversity trainer.  I'm a model.  I'm a dog lover.  And I'm a farmer. Leo, you're a life model.  You're a speaker.  You're the subject of all of this art in this gallery space. And I can see over here that you also do poetry. So tell me a bit about that. I've been working with an artist called Annabelle Menzies for about two years and we created this sort of body of work.  It was the name that made the description.  It kind of shows that my disability and also my gender identity.  The poetry that comes always being something quite private for me and I tend to only be able to write when I'm singing a very short emotion.  But when I worked with Annabel, I felt I wanted to add some of my poetry to some of her artwork.  So on this, these two pairs of books, these two were actually back to back and we based the idea on the King's Outlaw You keep seeing ladies.  Do you mind if I read it?  Yeah. I am your target.  The social constraints you normally have fail you.  I pose as a desire.  A high-pitched, patronising voice.  I am not a dog.  I feel obliged to let you touch me.  The social interaction from which I am absent lasts a period of time before the need you feel wears and you leave. That is about how strangers tend to come up to me and talk to me just because I have a disability and they feel like, is that okay?  they'd come and talk to me and for some reason they talked to me in a high-pitched voice. Like your dad. For me, it's very much about heaven.  being in charge of what I wore and not having it dictated by someone else.  And also, you're you now.  I began my training in 2012.  I feel a lot more comfortable with my body, like, inside and out.  So I can sit nowadays.  It doesn't matter so much what I wear.  The two on the right-hand side, she actually did one sitting each.  But what the one on the far right of my back is like, quite significant for me.  It was before I had my surgery and I had always been quite ashamed of my back and how it looked and that wasn't the first time I allowed someone to photograph it or something positive. That's the beauty of this art.  It's about turning difficult situations into beautiful things.  There's a huge amount of trust that you have to put into something like this, and a lot of work. It seems like a really nice collaboration.  I add gin and water to her house every week.  When I was sitting with her, all I would do was chat to her.  So I really think the work is so significant because she grew to know me quite well. So tell me, this work that you do as a life model, it's pretty intimate stuff.  What made you want to get into this line of work? In my early 20s, I modelled for the Welcome to Australia Disability Awareness campaign.  I've also modelled at the Save All Queer Now.  So Leo, why do you think it's important that someone who's queer and trans should be doing this kind of work, life modelling?  A lot of people always Don't really think.  about disabled people having much of a body image and a sexuality to do.  and put my work through writing it and also diversity speaking I hope to change people's views a bit and people with cerebral palsy can be out of their bodies And the fact that I am trans gets kind of another layer on that story.

Well, listen, we need your help.  Great.  Who are we killing? First up, we're going to talk about character jokes.  Now what I mean is that these jokes are jokes that are only funny because of the personality of the character telling the joke.  As an audience, we find them funny because they're so on-brand for that character and because the actor or actress for that role is so great at portraying that character.  Jake Peralta is a perfect example of this.  He's essentially the main character of the show, and a lot of the jokes are built around Andy Samberg's comedic talent and hilarious facial expressions.  Say it.  Say, my favorite movie is Failure to Launch.  Jake's character is immature, stubborn, and headstrong, but also brave, kind-hearted, and selfless.  A lot of his jokes revolve around his inability to function like a normal adult. What I was referring to is the fact that your mom brought her own hand towels?  As if my mom wouldn't have washed hers knowing they had guests coming over?  Did she? No! You don't have to!  They're only touched by freshly cleaned hands!  They never get dirty!  Wow. Or his childish drive to be an action hero like the character from his favorite movie, Die Hard. It's perfectly safe.  See you in hell, kiddo.  What?  Yeah!  Bars, bars, bars!  Oh, are there bars on the window? Yeah, there are bars on the window.  And these jokes work because they're well established as a part of who Jake is.  You know that when he has the chance to do some ridiculous diehard thing that he's going to do it, and it'll be funny.  And you know that he's not great at adulting and will make mistakes that are hilarious and clash with the people around him. Well, I hope you like sharing my one gray towel.  Was it gray when you bought it?  I didn't buy it.  It was in the apartment when I moved in. Amy Santiago is the exact opposite.  Very mature, organized, professional, but also awkward and anxious. What are you up to? Just jamming.  Jam on.  Jam on. Okay, never mind.  Peralta, come into my office, please. Sorry, baby, but... Do you think it was the jam on thing?  Yeah, I think it was the jam on thing. Her jokes usually come from her being a huge nerd or from her failing to communicate well with people.  And again, it's funny because you expect that from her.  You shake your head and laugh and go, oh, typical Amy.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine can make you feel like you really know these characters and you relate to them through their humor. I was president of the stenographers club in high school for a reason. Was the reason because you were the only member? Yes.  Captain Raymond Holt is probably my favorite character on the show.  His deadpan expressions combined with his intense passion for certain things leads to all kinds of hilarity. I was also a model train enthusiast as a child.  Those miniature tracks provided me with some of my happiest memories. All aboard!  The train will be departing in 45 minutes.  Lots of his jokes involve simply being in ridiculous situations because of the contrast with his emotionless demeanor. Watch as I do a dance to your name. Everyone's type of humor is different, and everyone's going to have a different favorite character, but these jokes kill me every time.  It's just so pure to see someone usually so uptight be regularly confronted by situations that force him to loosen up.  The full bullpen!  Rosa Diaz is by far the coolest of any of the characters on the show.  She's aggressive and secretive, but also fiercely protective of her friends.  So what are you gonna do?  Slash his tires?  You shouldn't do that, but just out of curiosity, what kind of car does he drive and where does he park it?  Plus, Stephanie Beatrice is an incredible actress who can do so many flawless different voices.  So, Nikki, I always want to get my hair cut here.  Everyone says you're the best.  Rosa, as the quiet, angry one, doesn't have as many jokes, per se, as the rest of the cast, but she makes a great foil for all of them. You dosed my water? You just drank 960 cups of coffee. Oh, that explains why I know talk better.  Me having stirk?  Ha ha! Good luck solving that case.  The jokes she does get tend to be based around either how badass she is.  Are they gonna be looking in our desks?  Also unrelated, someone left a bunch of swords on my desk.  Or how she's actually softer than most of them realize. March 12th, still not sure where Rosa was. And you never will be. Okay, reminder, privacy is cool, but if you don't tell us, we're gonna go to jail for a very long time. Fine.  I was at a La La Land sing-along.  Really?  Enough.  Just move on to the next pearl.  Yeah.  Gina Linetti, often referred to as the human form of the 100 emoji, is confident, talented, and quite the prankster. What is that?  Some mint!  You just drank some mint! Her jokes tend to come from how over-the-top her character is because of her flair for the dramatic. You are on fire, Gina.  You do not have the upper hand in this situation. I always have the upper hand. I want two kids. Especially when there's flames shooting out of my butt!  Charles Boyle is Jake's best friend, and his jokes tend to come from his love for unusual foods. Warning, it will be delicious and highly erotic. Your menu is not gonna involve animal genitalia, is it? No, I was gonna make... not that. His eccentric genuineness. I've never been a bad influence on anyone.  Should I bring my leather jacket?  It's ankle-length and fitted.  I'm gonna bring it.  It's too nice. And his ability to turn anything into a sexual innuendo. I told you, Jake, I'll do anything to perk up my little man.  You gotta know how gross that sounds in your underwear. As a character, he's loyal and compassionate, but will often let people walk all over him.  You know that in any scene he's in, he'll manage to keep the conversation interesting. And also, hence, we're gonna drive around in the coolest undercover car on the impound lot.  Herbie from Herbie Fully Loaded.  What?  No.  You really think Herbie Fully Loaded was on the impound lot? Without a doubt.  And lastly, Terry Jeffords.  He's a loving, emotional father, super strong, and loves yogurt. The vulture's the worst.  My mango yogurt.  Yes, you already mentioned the yogurt. Because it's important!  His jokes tend to revolve around how much stronger he is than everyone else, how passionate he is, or how fun-loving he is, which leads to some phenomenal interactions with other characters. This is a direct order.  Stop. The next category after characters is a very simple one, and it's what I'm going to call crude jokes.  That's the kind of thing that's funny just because it or its subtext are about something not generally discussed so casually in public.  Like poop or sex, basically. You left me to do everything while I thought you were pooping.  I wish you were pooping. I wish to God! But I only did it because I wanted you to enjoy it. That ruins it.  I mean, it's supposed to be good for both of us. It was good!  Just because I didn't get angry doesn't mean I didn't get anything out of it! Yeah, but the whole point is for you to get angry. After that, we have the category of simply funny situations.  That's when the characters manage to get themselves into a situation that is just weird and unusual, which the audience finds funny because normally these characters exist in a world very similar to our own, where you wouldn't expect that kind of stuff to happen. Okay, the tree has been contained. Wait, we left a man behind. Jake!  Well, Terry's trapped in the break room forever.  Only thing we can do now is move on with our lives.  It's what Terry would have wanted. Next, we have a very broad category that actually has a lot of overlap with pretty much every other category.  It's called defying expectations.  This is the basis of so many jokes, not just in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but like, in everywhere else, too.  People generally find it really funny when they think they know where a sentence or situation is going, and then suddenly it takes a turn and surprises them with unexpected information.  For an example, here's probably my favorite joke in this entire series. The first time I met Kevin's parents, I called Brahms, Funka Sangha, Opus 106. when it is obviously Opus 104.  They haven't spoken to me since. Really?  Just for that? Yes.  Also because they're huge homophobes who think that I made Kevin gay with my magic genitalia. See?  It defies your expectations, and it's funny.  Because you think it's going one way, and then suddenly it swerves another way.  Like I said, these aren't distinct categories.  You could easily have crude jokes that also defy expectations, and the basis of the funny situation jokes is that they're defying our expectations for what happens in a normal world.  These categories are just rough estimates of how you could try sorting the jokes in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and I think this category would kind of get the leftovers that didn't fit neatly into any of the other categories. That's a rule.  But that rule is negotiable if the kid's a dick.  No, babe. We don't want you to kill anyone. What? Really?  The next category is pretty niche, and there are only a few jokes made about it throughout the course of the series, but I still thought it deserved its own category simply because of how refreshing it was.  This category I'm calling the positive relationship jokes.  When it comes to relationships in comedies, they tend to be handled one of two ways.  Either there's a lot of, ugh, I'm going to be tied down now kind of jokes, or the show takes on a more serious tone around the relationship.  Now, Brooklyn Nine-Nine definitely takes on a more serious tone at times in regards to Jake and Amy's relationship, but it never stoops to the level of having Jake complain about his relationship for laughs, like so many other shows would do.  In fact, it does the opposite.  Jake is made better by his relationship, and the show makes that funny, either by laughing at how inept he used to be, You think that because you love me and love has made you dumb? I disagree.  If anything, love has made me smarter.  Remember last week when I boiled that egg?  That was big.  I was really proud of you. Or by showing how silly and excited the two of them get together when they take an interest in each other's interests. I guess you could say he's the golden snitch.  Wait, was that a Harry Potter reference?  It most definitely was.  I started reading them because you love them so much.  And?  You were right.  They're incredible.  Remember when I called in sick the other day?  I was at home reading Order of the Phoenix.  Oh, this makes me so happy.  How sad is it when Cedric dies?  I was crushed.  Literally crying on the toilet. These are some of the most wholesome jokes, and while you could easily argue they're just character jokes for Jake and Amy, I think there's something about the combination of the two of them making these jokes together that deserves its own category.  It would be really easy for the show to go for the, uh, the old ball and chain is dragging me down jokes, but it doesn't, and I think that can be a model for how other comedies should look to get laughs out of a relationship without putting anyone down.  Speaking of which, Brooklyn Nine-Nine has a pretty good habit in general of punching up, not down.  If you haven't heard of that phrase before, it basically means that in comedy, you want to be punching up at the people in charge, the oppressors, the people with power.  You don't want to be punching down at the marginalized people, the people without power.  When you punch up at the powerful, you challenge the status quo.  You make people think about things in a way they may not have before.  When you punch down at the powerless, you're simply doing what the powerful have been doing for a long time.  You become a part of the status quo, reinforcing old stereotypes and prejudices.  Good comedy knows how to punch up.  Bad comedy continues to punch down.  That doesn't mean your comedy has to be political.  Lots of people go to comedy to get away from the misery of day-to-day politics.  But it does mean that your jokes exist in this current world, and you need to be aware of the environment you're saying them in, and the effect they will have on people.  Punching down ends up being just as political as punching up.  You're just swinging at the wrong people.  And Brooklyn Nine-Nine, for the most part, seems to recognize that.  For an example, let's talk about the three times trans people have been mentioned in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  In the beginning of season 4, when Jake and Holt are stuck in witness protection in Florida, they're trying to track down someone who got an embarrassing video of them and could potentially blow their cover.  When Jake shows the local tattoo artist the photo they have of the person they're looking for, the tattoo artist says that the person is wearing a ring from San Marino High, and mentions that their mascot was the pet detectives from Ace Ventura.  So Jake says this. Classic film, one of my childhood favorites, and it only gets overtly transphobic at the very end, so, a win.  Anyway, thank you very much, you've been very helpful. I thought this was hilarious, and a good way to handle the situation in general.  It doesn't become a big serious argument.  Jake just makes a comment, the tattoo artist looks confused, and then they move on.  It's a funny moment because you don't expect him to say that, and you can tell even the tattoo artist didn't expect it.  It defies your expectations, but at the same time it stands up for trans people.  Trans people aren't the butt of the joke here, like they are on so many other shows.  Jake's right, the end of Ace Ventura is extremely transphobic, and that one little line about it is both funny and a perfect example of punching up.  The butt of the joke here is transphobes, or that one piece of transphobic media.  This joke challenges the status quo.  Later, there's an episode where Jake and Amy are trying to babysit Terry's kids and failing because the kids keep asking hard questions like, did their dad get in trouble with the police just because he's black?  Eventually, Amy tries to explain things to them and this is what happens. You know how it's tougher in this world to be a woman?  It is?  No, no, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. Then I don't want to be a woman.  Me neither.  You don't have to be if that's who you are.  You know what?  That's a whole other conversation. This isn't really a joke, it's a line of dialogue in between jokes.  It's one of the sincere moments of the show tucked into an episode on racial profiling in the NYPD.  But it's meaningful, because this was an opening for all kinds of transphobic, or at least cisnormative, jokes.  Any other show would have taken that opening and run with it.  Trust me, I'm pretty much used to having to put up with at least a few transphobic jokes in most forms of media.  But instead of taking a cheap jab at trans people, Brooklyn Nine-Nine used it as a really thoughtful moment to tell people that actually, their gender can be whatever they experience it as.  That wasn't the focus of the episode, and they pivot away from the topic immediately, but it's a really nice thing to say, and I was really proud of Brooklyn Nine-Nine for doing that.  And lastly, in the fifth season, there's an episode where Jake is in prison and talking to the warden about possibly becoming a snitch for him.  Initially, he doesn't want to, and this is what happens. I've always wanted a man on the inside.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  The only people less popular in here than cops are snitches.  Let's be honest, it's not great in here for trans people.  That is so true.  I have a hard time.  It's a problem.  Regardless, I won't snitch. This joke breaks the flow of the conversation they were having and, again, defies your expectations.  They're having a heated, fast-paced back-and-forth where they can't agree, and then suddenly both of them slow down and recognize how hard it is in prison for trans people.  Then they resume their discussion.  It's funny because of how it breaks up their conversation, but it's also funny in like a morbid, oh sh**, that's right kind of way.  Trans people being in jail isn't the butt of the joke.  The system that put them there is.  Again, it's a small thing, but any other show would have used this opportunity to make some terrible joke about trans people in prison.  And Brooklyn Nine-Nine not only avoided that, but also pointed out how our society has failed trans people in that regard.  That being said, while Brooklyn Nine-Nine does typically punch up, it definitely doesn't always do that, and with a couple of characters, it pretty consistently punches down.  You may have noticed I didn't talk about Scully and Hitchcock in the beginning with the other characters, and there was a reason for that.  Both of these characters' jokes are pretty consistently not great.  I'm gonna put a content warning here for fatphobia and sexual harassment, and if you'd like to skip this section, I'd suggest pausing right now.  And I'll put timestamps in the description so you can go past this part.  I think it's important to talk about this stuff, but I also understand if you can't right now.  So, with Scully, the joke is almost always that he's fat.  There are countless jokes about his health issues because, haha, he's fat and unhealthy?  Type 3 and type 9 and 12 and 13.  Those are all the diabeteses I  have.\".  Like, what the f*** even is this joke?  It's funny because he's listing off multiple kinds of diabetes he has?  And that's funny because he's fat?  I genuinely don't get where the humor is supposed to be in this.  Why punch down at people with diabetes or fat people?  What does that achieve besides reinforcing the status quo?  And the show has countless Scully jokes just like this one, where they conflate being fat with being unhealthy and consistently make him the butt of the joke.  Fat people deserve respect and kindness, just like anyone else.  And I'm so tired of seeing ha ha it's funny because they eat food and they're fat jokes.  They're tired.  They've been done for decades.  Find better jokes.  Let fat people be in roles where they aren't constantly the butt of the joke.  Despite how much I love Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I feel like it has really messed up in this department, and I think that's worth acknowledging and asking them to do better.  Then there's Hitchcock.  His jokes are basically one of three things.  He's bleeding for no reason, he's tasting something he shouldn't be tasting, or he's sexually harassing women. Amy's not in the break room. Or the evidence room.  Or the ladies' bathroom. You know what? I'll check again.  I've never seen him walk with such purpose.  What a wretched man.  What part of that is funny?  It's funny that all of these characters just tolerate a coworker who consistently harasses his female coworkers and makes inappropriate comments about them.  And Brooklyn Nine-Nine knows that he's that kind of character, because when they did a Me Too episode, they literally wrote him out of the entire episode.  Holt just told him to go home.  And the thing is, I liked that episode, but I think it's a tad hypocritical to have an episode revolve around Me Too while ignoring the character in your main cast who really should have been fired by now.  There's even a scene where Rosa spikes Jake's water with caffeine when they're both competing to get a spot on Hawkins' team.  During that cutaway, Hitchcock looks over and winks at her.  Given how Hitchcock's entire character is based around sexually harassing women, what are we as an audience supposed to gleam from that moment?  Because the only thing I can think of is that it's implying that Hitchcock himself has drugged and assaulted someone, or he's at least happy about the prospect of other people doing that.  Because he doesn't know she's lacing it with caffeine.  With everything we know about his character, I can't think of a less vile explanation for that wink.  Honestly, if you took Scully and Hitchcock out of the show entirely, you'd solve a lot of its problems really quickly.  Unfortunately, it seems like they're around to stay.  And while that sucks, I'm going to continue watching and loving Brooklyn Nine-Nine, because there are so many other positive aspects to it.  If I refused to watch any show that had hurtful jokes or storylines in it, I would literally never watch anything.  All the media we consume has both good and bad in it, and I think we can appreciate the good while also criticizing the bad.  The point of this video is not that Brooklyn Nine-Nine is perfect or terrible.  I think Brooklyn Nine-Nine can be an amazing show and have some very bad aspects to it.  The point of this video is that, aside from a couple exceptions, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is generally really good at making jokes, and I wanted to analyze what made it so funny in the first place.  To recap, there are character jokes built around solid acting and good, contrasting character traits.  Then there are your usual crude jokes and funny situation jokes.  Then there are jokes that defy your expectations but don't neatly fit into any of the other categories.  Then there's the positive relationship jokes, where relationships are joked about in a positive manner rather than a negative one.  And lastly, we have jokes that punch up and jokes that punch down.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine tells jokes in all of these ways, but it's the first six categories that make it such a hilarious show.  By the time this video goes live, Brooklyn Nine-Nine will just be wrapping up its sixth season, but it has been renewed by NBC for a seventh season, which I'm super thankful for.  I'm excited to see where the Nine-Nine is headed for the next season.  Thanks so much for watching this video.

The host identifies six categories of jokes: character jokes, crude jokes, funny situation jokes, jokes that defy expectations, positive relationship jokes, and jokes that punch up or down. \n\nCharacter jokes rely on the personality and traits of the characters, such as Jake Peralta's immaturity and Amy Santiago's awkwardness. Crude jokes are about topics like poop or sex, while funny situation jokes involve characters getting into unusual situations. Jokes that defy expectations subvert the audience's expectations, often with unexpected twists or turns.\n\nPositive relationship jokes focus on the positive aspects of relationships, such as Jake and Amy's romance. The show is praised for its ability to punch up, challenging the status quo and making people think about issues in a new way. However, the host criticizes the show for punching down, making jokes at the expense of marginalized groups, particularly fat people and trans people.\n\nThe host specifically targets Scully and Hitchcock, two characters who consistently make hurtful jokes and are problematic. The host argues that these characters' jokes are not funny and reinforce negative stereotypes.

Like, obviously Korra is great, but this series does a phenomenal job of showcasing other amazing female characters, too.  It's by no means a one-woman show, and that's a part of what makes it so special.  There's no token female character, which means the women in the show have the chance to be varied, diverse, and unique.  Each one of them doesn't have to represent all women.  They can just exist for themselves.  Because sometimes, even shows or movies that have one outstanding female character fall flat when it comes to the rest of the cast.  But diversity doesn't mean chucking in one physically strong, emotionally stunted woman into a story full of men and calling it a day.  Finding something that really represents the diverse experiences and personalities of women is unfortunately relatively rare.  But I think that The Legend of Korra does a fantastic job, so today I want to talk about some of the incredible women from this series and go through why I love them all so much.  I'll mostly be focusing on Book 4 for a few reasons.  It's my favorite book in the series, it's the only book where the main villain is a woman, and a lot of other female characters have plotlines that build up into the fourth book and come to a resolution there.  Book 3 definitely had some great female villains, like Plea, Ming Hua, and the Earth Queen, but Book 4 is just on another level.  So let's start off with some of the main characters, and then work our way down to the characters that get a bit less screentime.  First up is Korra.  She's the main character of the series, and has trouble controlling her temper.  I liked her contrast with the last Avatar, Aang.  Where Aang would try to find a diplomatic, peaceful solution, Korra just likes to punch her way through her problems.  She's fierce and strong, and goes through a lot over the course of the series.  She's a flawed but brilliant character who is doing her best to live up to the title of Avatar, even when she doesn't really know what she's doing.  And, as I've covered in a previous video, she ends up dating Asami by the end of the show, which was just a beautiful, beautiful moment.  Asami is in some ways a foil to Korra's brute force approach, but not in the same way as Aang.  She's more technology-minded, and can often engineer a solution that might still involve fighting her way out, but is a bit more clever and thought out.  She's the brain to Korra's brawn, essentially, though she can definitely hold her own in a fight.  She has her own hardships throughout the series.  In particular, she struggles to reconnect with her dad after he betrayed her, and ultimately she sees him sacrifice himself.  She's the rich kid who learns to run an entire business by herself, and as a result has a vast wealth of knowledge around various industries.  Kuvira is the main antagonist of the fourth book, but she wasn't always a villain.  Throughout Book 3, she was on Korra's side, and it's not until Book 4 when her desire to reunite the Earth Kingdom by any means necessary puts her at odds with Korra and her friends.  fascinating villain not only because she was on the protagonist's side, but because it's her ambition and drive, the very things that she was applauded for, that lead to her becoming a villain in Book 4.  It's not like she had a change of heart and decided that she suddenly hates the protagonists.  She just believes that she's doing what they wanted all along, and it's wrong that they're now standing in her way.  Reuniting the Earth Kingdom was what Korra and company wanted, but eventually they start to realize that Kuvira's method for doing so is unethical.  She crushes all dissent, forces cities to join her under threat of violence, employs slave labor, and sends dissenters to reeducation camps.  Plus, on top of it all, she considers Republic City to be land stolen from the Earth Kingdom, and wants to reclaim it by force.  But behind it all, she's a villain who evokes sympathy from the viewer because of how similar she is to Korra.  Korra is also known to take a fight-first-and-ask-questions-later kind of approach.  Korra is also very driven and ambitious, often to a point where she has to be reeled back in by people like Tenzin.  Her similarities to Kuvira are unavoidable, and so it leads to a classic we're-not-so-different-you-and-I kind of situation.  Next is Jinora, who is one of my favorite characters in the series.  She's the oldest of Tenzin's kids, but still quite young compared to most of the other characters.  In the first two books, she's kind of just one of the kids, but in book three really starts to develop her own skills and identity away from her siblings.  She realizes that she has an affinity for communicating with spirits and entering the spirit world.  And she becomes a kind of spiritual guide for Korra.  And all of her growth and knowledge comes in spite of the fact that her dad and those around her still think that she's just a helpless kid.  She has to prove herself time and time again before she's recognized as an airbending master, and is allowed to get the tattoos to prove it.  Because she's a young girl, she was discounted and overlooked.  But she's incredibly talented, and as far as we see in the show, the only person who can perform spiritual projection.  essentially being able to leave her body and travel to faraway places in spirit form.  She's the excited youth, the next generation, ready to take over and be involved, but constantly doubted and left behind.  Iki is Jinora's younger sister, and as such, her airbending skills haven't had quite as much time to develop as Jinora's.  She's hyper and talkative, unlike the quiet and comparatively chill Jinora.  but just as determined and hardworking as her older sister.  She's annoyed by her siblings, but by talking things out with her dad, who is in a similar situation, she learns to accept them.  She's smart and able to talk her way out of most situations.  By the end of the series, she's a talented airbender who's a valuable part of the team, and she even saves Jinora's life when she's knocked out of the sky.  Next, I want to talk about a few characters together, Toph, Lin, and Suyin Beifong.  Toph is the mother of Lin and Suyin, and she only has a brief role in The Legend of Korra.  After being poisoned at the end of Book 3, Korra goes to train with her, and we find that she's the same cranky, tough person we all remember from Avatar The Last Airbender.  Lots of stories have an old, wise man who guides the main character, like a Dumbledore or a Gandalf.  And, to some extent, Korra does have that in Tenzin, but it was nice to see that Korra's old, wise mentor figure later on was a woman.  Toph is able to help Korra work through her PTSD and remove the final bits of poison out of her system, and it's an emotional and turbulent time for Korra.  Lin and Suyin, as Toph's daughters, don't have the best relationship with each other.  Lin is grouchy and cranky and mean, while Suyin can be more nurturing and gentle.  And it should come as no surprise to anyone that Toph wasn't the most loving and affectionate mother, so it seems like they never felt that close of a connection to each other.  Then there was an incident where Lin was working with the police while Suyin was involved in a gang.  And when Lin tried to arrest Suyin, Suyin broke the metal whip that Lin had grabbed her with, and it recoiled and scarred Lin's face.  That incident haunted them for the rest of their lives, until in Book 4, when the two women are finally forced to confront their feelings about each other.  An entire episode revolves around their complex relationship.  Why they hate each other, what they could have done differently, what they want to happen now.  It's a messy, messy relationship, but that's what makes it interesting.  The women of The Legend of Korra aren't great because they're all perfect.  They're great because they're allowed to be flawed and complex.  And I love that.  The Legend of Korra gives them the space to work through their troubles together, instead of simplifying things or making every woman too good to ever make a mistake.  Next, I want to talk about Opal, Suyin's daughter.  When Opal is introduced, it's quickly hinted at that.  she's Bolin's love interest, but the series allows her to be much more than that.  She's a new airbender, and Korra starts to teach her the basics before she leaves for the Northern Air Temple to continue her training.  In Book 4, Opal is working with the other airbenders to protect various cities and states within the Earth Kingdom.  She's dating Bolin, but he's working for Kuvira, who Opal doesn't like, and so they have a big fight.  Then, Opal and Jinora are forced to attack Kuvira to stop her from killing Korra, before holding off an entire army until Milo and Ikki arrive on a flying bison to help them escape.  In the aftermath, Bolin leaves Kuvira's side, but Opal is slow to forgive him.  She's an independent, intelligent person who sticks strong to her ideals and always does what she believes is best.  There's also Katara, who helps Korra begin her lengthy healing process at the beginning of Book 4.  She was one of the main characters in The Last Airbender, but in this series, her role is a lot smaller.  She's an extremely compassionate person, willing to do anything she can to help Korra, and an immensely talented healer and waterbender.  Now let's talk about Kaya.  She's one of Aang's kids, and a sister to Tenzin and Bumi.  She does a lot throughout the series, and even plays a role in the graphic novels that came after the show, where we learn that she is romantically attracted to women.  On top of that, she's a skilled waterbender and fighter, and loves to spend time with her nieces and nephews.  She has a tough relationship with her brothers, but in the end is fiercely loyal.  Next is Zhu Li.  She starts off just as Varric's assistant, but by the end of the series, she's his equal.  She's incredibly skilled at using a mecha suit, and is super smart.  When she's imprisoned and then escapes, she feigns loyalty to Kuvira and gets her to trust her.  While developing the Spirit Energy Cannon, she begins to sabotage it, slowing Kuvira's progress.  Eventually, she's discovered, and she has no problem telling Kuvira off.  She then played a role in fighting back against Kuvira's attack on Republic City, and at the end of the series, she gets married to Varric.  In the official graphic novels that follow the series, she even becomes the president of Republic City.  And finally, there's Pema, Tenzin's wife.  She's not really much of a fighter.  She's a non-bender, and most of the time we see her either pregnant or with her newly born baby.  Her thing is being a good stay-at-home mom, and I love that.  One misinterpretation of women's empowerment that I see sometimes is people saying that no woman should be a stay-at-home mom, that every woman needs to have a career and be fully independent, and all of that.  And I think it's definitely important to question your motivations for why you might feel compelled to be a stay-at-home mom, even if that's not really what you want to do.  And a lot of women do find empowerment by overcoming that stereotype and breaking out of it.  But empowerment for women doesn't mean we stop forcing women to do one thing and start forcing them to do another.  It means giving women the ability to choose what they want to do.  And that includes choosing to be a stay-at-home mom if that's what they really want.  So I like the inclusion of Pema in this series because it shows the diversity of experiences for women.  While lots of women can be badass fighters like Korra, Asami, or Lin, they can also be chill non-fighters like Pema.  If this show was almost entirely about men, and Pema was the only woman or one of only a few women in the show, that would probably be pretty sexist, because then the show would be perpetuating the stereotype that women only exist as stay-at-home moms while men do everything else.  But because there are so many other women doing so many other things in The Legend of Korra, Pema's inclusion makes perfect sense.  She no longer has to represent all women.  She can just be herself and represent one aspect of what women can be.  And that's why, in general, it's amazing to have so many women on a show.  It's not just about the number of women on a show, it's about allowing women to have the diversity of experience that men are generally afforded on TV and in movies.  In Korra, instead of just having one woman who's a love interest or a mom, we have women from all walks of life.  There are goofy kids, spiritual leaders, law enforcement officers, politicians, mothers, tough women, smart women, and so much more.  And none of them have to just be that one thing.  They can be all kinds of things, and they can make mistakes, and they can be villains, and they can be heroes, and they can just be so many different kinds of people that anyone and everyone can relate to them.  That's what's so incredible about all of the women on this show, and a part of the reason why I love it so much.  So many shots in The Legend of Korra feature only women, or at least mostly women.  And that's a refreshing change of pace.  This show smashes the Bechdel test to pieces and is just at an entirely different level, one which other shows and movies should aim to get to as well.

It is minus three degrees today.  Celsius.  So today is my first day writing for quite a while, quite a break away from it while I've been focusing on paying the bills and launching the Story Magic Academy and all those and lots of other things.  So it's a little bit intimidating, definitely, to come back to North of the End after quite a while away from it.  But I'm also kind of excited because I've been wanting to get back to this for a while and I'm really excited to get it finished.  I don't have a deadline as such because that's something that I figured out kind of last NaNoWriMo that I did is that you can't actually rush revision in the same way that you can drafting and I was trying to rush it and it was just not working and I was just making more work for myself further on down the line.  So I don't have a deadline, I just have this kind of deal I've made with myself that my first burst of work of the day, so I work in these 15 minute bursts.  at the moment, with 15 minute breaks, my first work session of the day is always on my novel.  And then the rest of the day, obviously I'd like to get more than that done, but there may be other things that come up.  So that's the plan.  I'm feeling a bit nauseous actually today, this morning.  I think it's just that me and Ross have been not getting up as early as this for quite a while now.  And yeah, I'm up earlier than normal and I immediately had like a bacon sandwich for breakfast.  So probably just eating a bit too early.  I'm feeling a little bit sick, but I'm hoping that a combination of some water on my journey into the studio and maybe some fresh air is going to help.  Like I said, it's minus three degrees today, so I think the studio is going to be really cold.  The heating isn't great in there, so I'm wearing a nice thick jumper.  I'm wearing double socks because my feet get really, really cold.  I have really bad circulation.  I'm gonna take my gloves, my scarf, maybe I'll wear a hat and I've also got a hot water bottle with me and Ross also suggested that I go and buy some like thermal socks and a hoodie because I don't own a hoodie anymore and that's like a super cozy thing maybe something with those gloves.  so we're thinking about how to keep warm and because yeah this it's like late November And it's already gotten super cold.  November to me is still autumn.  December is like the first month of winter.  So I'm like, oh, winter's come early.  But I realise that not everyone kind of quantifies the seasons in that way.  So yeah, so that's the plan for today.  I'm going to start out with a burst of writing.  I've got a bunch of other things in my journal that I'd like to get done and we'll see how much more writing I can get done as well as those things and kind of just start to get back into the rhythm of working on North of the End on this revision.  Wish me luck and let's see how the day goes.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Cause I know it's gonna be nice.  I'm impressioning.  Girl, I'm gonna let some get out.  Hey, I found a little girl.  What's the world I've been waiting for?  Yes, I know she can go.  And I'll take her for the winter.  Good evening.  I have arrived home.  I'm making some dinner.  It's a kind of fajita chicken stir-fry thing and some rice, which is bubbling away there in the background.  All in all, I think, pretty good day.  Yeah, I'm now going to chill out and have some food.  I'm very, very hungry and take it easy.  And back to work tomorrow.  Good night.  So I basically, yeah, so I did like writing for basically a whole morning.  Yeah, basically re-acquainting myself, read over the last chapter that I revised, but I basically had a bunch of, I had the like kind of thematic changes that I'd started kind of figuring out how to make one.  that was like the last thing I was working on.  So I basically started getting to that as well, like figuring out like okay well how do I need to change these plot embryos?  and then I'll be translating that into the outline and then going back to actual like word for word.  Yeah it was good.  and then basically like editing the last vlog I had to do.","channel.id":"clxmi0r7004awcdvi35jusdms","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCXjda70KpggxCpmrLpxdHuw","channel.name":"Rachael Stephen","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/np6OxA__VgCJbk5OIlCijDSyBJv5-JmLOOcSZaTlE69txJqSDb4AyF2v4d3P8KgdD5IVi3i7=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Good morning, I'm back to writing after a break.

There are a lot of small things I really love talking about but I don't see how they will fit into a big video. So I'm making this series to allow myself to have a place to make short videos that can teach some of my transvoice \"technology\" while I work on bigger videos.\n\nToday's topic is the Mantra Phrase. I first starting using a technique like this three years ago when I began changing my voice. Using a small, familiar phrase can open up amazing doors for your vocal development.\n\nHere are a few of the uses covered:\n1. Serves as a consistent ruler to measure your progress against.\n2. Utilizes a limited amount of sounds to allow focusing on details\n3. Anchors the voice as muscle memory to a phrase\n4. Can operate as a safety net if worried about the voice not coming out correctly.\n5. Doesn't overwhelm since it's a short bite sized phrase.\n\nI think everyone practicing voice should have a mantra phrase! There are even more benefits than I have listed. When selecting a phrase, try to choose something that is 4-8 words long. These phonemes are most important to include: \/h\/, \/r\/, \/i\/, \/s\/, \/f\/. Try to pick a phrase that feels REALLY comfortable when you say it. Some students report certain words and phrases being easier to feminize than others. Find the words you synergize with most and integrate them into your practice model.\n\nwarmly,\nA. Z.\n\nLove my videos? Consider supporting me on patreon!

And today I want to talk to you about a very useful technique that I would encourage all of you to utilize.  And this is the idea of a mantra phrase.  Okay.  So what I have found useful in my few years of practicing this is that if you use a very short, simple phrase or group of words, it can help you practice your voice in a lot of different ways.  So my phrase is eat from fire, fire from heat, right?  And I've probably said that phrase over 15, 20, 30,000 times at this point, okay?  And there's a few key uses for this.  Essentially, when you're reading a bigger passage to practice your voice, like the rainbow passage, there are so many micro movements that are occurring that you cannot control for all the variables.  It makes it very difficult to actually test and modify your voice in real time, okay?  This, however, has a very few set of relationships that are occurring that you can get really good at and then work on transferring to other parts of your voice.  Additionally, a mantra phrase allows you to sort of get your voice dialed in or tuned before you use it, right?  So like if I'm about to go talk or something and I'm worried, I can say heat from fire, fire from heat, right?  And then I can try and like swing into my other voice, right?  And I can just continue that sound.  This is something that a lot of people find really useful if they're trying to practice online like video games and stuff like that, right?  To have a little mantra phrase, say it before you push to talk, push to talk and talk, you know?  So I have a few different mantra phrases that I like and I'll offer them to you if you'd like to use them.  So one, fear doth love, love doth fear.  Two, heat from fire, fire from heat.  Three, never have I ever.  Four, pee, pit, pet, pat, part.  Okay, and these are awesome because not only do they let you feminize your voice and start to anchor the correct sensation to a sort of phrase, but it also lets you sort of play with other modifications if you want, like . pe, pe, pe, pa, pa, po, po, po, et cetera, right? So I can use these as vehicles to drive my practice and to always return and reset to something familiar despite doing new experimental practice, okay? Here are a few uses of a mantra phrase.  One, it serves as a consistent ruler to measure your progress against.  So you can record files, right?  And over the course of weeks and so forth, you can always compare it to a consistent thing.  Two, it uses a limited amount of sounds.  Like I described before, if you're using big paragraphs, there's too many things going on.  So this allows you to sort of focus more microscopically.  Three, it anchors muscle memory to the phrase, which makes it ideal so the voice can be recalled effortlessly.  Four, it can alleviate worries about sounding bad by having like a safe word, like a safety net.  So, you know, if you're about to talk on a video game or in a discord call, you can just test with your phrase and then continue, right?  Five, it's not overwhelming like paragraphs or improvised speeches.  So it really allows you to think about what you're doing over and over. So I hope this is helpful for you all.

Scorched earth is a military strategy used by various powers throughout history.  What it involves is the destruction of assets as one retreats, giving up the land to an invading force whilst denying them any resources and infrastructure that may have originally been found in that area.  This forces the invading group to set up supply lines, which of course drains power and resources.  Not to mention, it means you can target said lines.  Russia stands out as a prolific user of the strategy.  They utilise it during the 1708 Swedish invasion, the 1812 Napoleonic invasion, and of course the Nazi invasion during the Second World War.  In a stretched-out conflict, scorched earth is often an effective strategy, not simply because it denies your perceived opponent resources, but because of its psychological effect.  To spend years of blood, sweat and tears fighting for ground which offers nothing can have a cripplingly demoralising effect, and this element of said strategy can be used in other forms of conflict outside of the most obvious being war.  Social justice is often an atrocious affair in which two fronts do everything they can to move social progress in opposite directions.  I was 18 years of age when the UK passed the Marriage Act of 2013.  I was in my second year of college, part of my first LGBT plus support group, And we were watching things with great intensity.  But one of the things I remember seeing as time went on was how many of the voices who'd fought against marriage equality on the basis that it defiled the so-called sanctity of marriage began switching tact.  They began to argue that marriage as an institution was morally wrong.  Now, I need to be absolutely clear here.  There are people out there who, in all good faith, view marriage to be wrong.  They view it to be an outdated institution that offers a privileged position to a specific social relationship.  and whilst I disagree with them, I don't want to misconstrue said people as homophobic bigots.  They're not.  But there's a difference between people who have genuinely reached the conclusion that marriage is bad, and those who simply say it as a last-ditch attempt to deny same-gender couples access to said institution.  I just want to make that as clear as possible, as it's an important distinction for later.  The people who spent years arguing that same-gender marriage would destroy the sanctity of marriage only to switch to marriage being inherently evil were clearly only saying that as a means to stop marriage equality.  or at least a major step towards marriage equality since there are still issues with the current system in place specifically for trans and disabled individuals, not to mention individuals marrying citizens of other nations.  Now of course this failed.  Marriage as an institution was not abolished in UK society, same-gender couples were given the right to marry under certain circumstances, and in general it has become part of British society.  But let's just think about an alternative timeline in which that had happened.  Marriage equality had been on the books for decades.  For example, the Civil Partnership Act of 2004 was an attempt to stall that by giving same-gender couples an equal-but-separate institution, which by the way, wasn't equal in many regards, just to be clear on that.  So, there'd been countless protests over the issue, whilst many LGB people saw the absence of marriage equality as a sign of how devalued they were, that they were second-class citizens.  Make no mistake, whilst not directly, people have died indirectly as a result of being denied the right to equal representation under the law.  So imagine all of that has still happened.  And just as they were on the cusp of winning, they had the rug pulled out from under them, that the government had done away with marriage altogether.  Could you imagine how soul-crushing that would be?  How insulting that would be to everyone who died indirectly by the government's legal discrimination against same-gender couples?  Even though straight people would also lose out in that equation, This wouldn't be a loss at the end of decades of suffering and toil.  That's the key difference here.  Straight people would have lost something they'd never earned.  Gay and bisexual people would have been denied that right that they'd bled for.  It's a calculated move which seeks to do as little damage to those in power, whilst doing as much damage as possible to the marginalised.  and its impact on all future social justice would have been significant.  The drop in morale as marginalised people question why they should keep fighting for science if those in power will destroy it before they can get there would have resulted in many people abandoning the fight.  After all, if there's nothing to be gained, I may as well spend my time making the best of what I currently have.  It destroys the very hope of a better tomorrow.  So should we do away with gender and sports?  It's a question I've been receiving from the very moment I posted my response video to Stephen Woodford, better known by his YouTube handle, Rationality Rules, on the subject of trans athletes.  And whilst at first I responded to these questions in good faith, Eventually I had to start removing them since they took up a disproportionate amount of the comments and I was tired of responding to the same question over and over again.  Don't worry, you weren't blocked, I just thought it'd be better to go ahead and address this question in a future video.  So, I hope you can understand that.  Now, whilst many people ask this question, Very often the way they asked it differed.  I got a general sense that there were three groups.  Those who were generally curious about my opinions, and those who were trying to use said questions as a means to attack me, and those I couldn't fit into either group.  Very interestingly, Stephen Woodford recently came out and stated the following on Twitter.  Quote, End quote.  He'd later go on to add in a further tweet that, quote, Of course, this assumes that Woodford has justification for excluding some trans women from women's sport.  He doesn't, something I've rather effectively shown with evidence by this point.  All Woodford does have is his personal opinion and several studies he knowingly lied about in relation to their contents.  Also, he keeps using the dog whistle of male puberty.  That's not fooling anyone.  So what is Woodford actually setting about doing here?  Well, now that he's been thoroughly demonstrated to have no justification for his transphobic position on the matter, Woof is setting out to utilise the same scorched earth approach to the topic of trans people in sports, and seen previously with marriage equality.  He knows that his game is up, that his invalid assertions can't stand forever and that trans women are going to become part of women's sports eventually.  The consensus is entirely against him, so what's there left to do?  Well, he can pretend like the very system of sports is wrong in the existence of gendered categories.  Which again, just like the prospect of marriage, there are people who generally hold the belief that gendered sports is a bad thing, and I'm really happy to have a conversation with you about that since I do have my doubts about the way that sports is currently handled.  But I can also see through the transparent bullshit that people such as Woodford and those who approached me with the question in a hostile manner are utilising.  Pretty much, they're trying to change the game we've been playing up till now, which has them defending why they believe a group of women should be excluded from women's sports, to something entirely different.  Now, unlike marriage, Woodford wants to keep the two-category system.  He just wants to change the words associated with those categories in a manner that won't impact cis people, but considering the effort put in by trans people, would be cripplingly demoralising.  Woodford is not setting out to improve sport, he's setting out to maximise the amount of harm he can cause trans people.  That's his one and only goal with this act.  something which should remove any lingering doubt one may have had as to his transphobic nature, just in case his attempts to get the attention of fellow transphobe Joe Rogan wasn't enough. Because when Woodford set out to make statements such as these\u2026 And I'm convinced that unless quickly rectified, this will kill women's sport.  I don't want to see the day when women's athletics is dominated by Y chromosomes, but without a change in policy, that is precisely what's going to happen. He didn't seem to believe gender sports was a problem.  It only became a problem after he'd fairly lost his fight to strip trans women of the numerous human rights which are violated when one excludes trans women from women's sports.  For those not aware of the right said action would violate, they include the right to equality and non-discrimination, the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to sexual and reproductive health, the right to work and to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work, the right to privacy, the right to freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and harmful practices, and full respect for the dignity, bodily integrity and bodily autonomy of the person.  Just a quick note, this list comes from the United Nations Human Rights Council report discussing the rights violated when an intersex cis women such as Kassa Semenya are excluded from women's sport.  I use said list since it can't be claimed to be charged with the trans agenda, and yet intersex cis women and trans women face much the same body policing and forced medicalisation.  Another difference in all this is that unlike the earlier marriage example, there's no cost involved for Woodford.  He has nothing riding on this at all.  outside of his desire to hurt trans women, regardless of how he's also hurting cis women, intersex cis women, cis women of colour, and lesbian cis women in particular, in the process.  So to fix my opening analogy, it's less like the Russians setting fire to their own farmland as they retreat, and more like the British denial policy in the Second World War.  But none of this of course gets over the main flaw of my analogy, which is of course the fact that in spite of Woodford's claims, trans women are not some invading force taking over women's sports.  cis women's lives are also not here to deem expendable.  He, as with those making this argument in bad faith, are merely looking for some way to scratch their bigoted itch, a way to hurt trans people and avoid being called out on it.  But with that made clear, how does this relate to the question itself?  Surely people's reasons for making this proposition are irrelevant to the proposal itself?  Well, not always.  When perception becomes part of the issue, when, how and why we do something can be relevant.  As already noted, there are consequences for those who have struggled to gain the same protections that those in power have benefited from extensively if said benefits are suddenly withdrawn.  But there's also optics at play here.  If Woodford Gott is renaming of what have traditionally been called men's and women's sports, The people alive now aren't going to forget what these divisions were originally called.  No matter what you call these groups, people are still going to see trans women's.  exclusion from whichever category was originally women's sports as evidence that trans women are not real women.  Meanwhile, if you get rid of the whole idea of gendered sports, how will that look?  Sure, trans women will be allowed to play with other women, which is great.  But to an outsider, it would look like the only way we could achieve this is to give it a gendered sport, rather than recognise trans women as the gender they are, once more reinforcing the idea that trans women are not real women.  Let's also not forget the real danger here in how trans people would likely take the blame for any of the problems that emerge as a result of said action, whether or not said trans people supported the move to abolish gender sports.  It would certainly offer feminism appropriators a new battle cry to rally behind, increasing the abuse trans people suffer as a result.  And there are genuine reasons to keep the sport segregated for the moment.  Rape culture, a social phenomenon, is still very much prevalent in society today.  Many cis men still hold a lot of toxic ideas surrounding masculinity that I can't just ignore.  Then we have to consider the differences in sponsorship and sponsorship preferences.  Now, you might say that the same could be said about trans women.  Except, there's a lot of social hostility towards trans women that doesn't exist with cis men, and as women, they have as much right to sponsorships as other women.  Note that these are not arguments to indefinitely suspend the idea.  I think it has a lot of potential, but I don't see a benefit right now that surpasses all of these issues.  So, I've come up with a potentially third solution to consider.  First off the bat, keep gender sports whilst allowing trans women to compete as women, and trans men to compete as men.  That's important since it separates this current trans debate from the next stage, introducing mixed gender sports.  Note that this is very different to the proposal to create an open category in which trans women could compete, since said proposal always comes with the exclusion of trans women from women's sport, even though they have no basis for that exclusion.  The way I'm presenting, it's an option created after we've accepted trans women are women and trans men are men to see whether athletes are interested.  And in fact, there are sports already doing this, there are mixed gender martial arts for example.  This would also allow us to test the water for a potential third phase, hopefully by which point the issues mentioned prior have been mostly resolved, in which we can start dismantling the gender categories altogether.  I see this as a way to secure trans people their rights and offer active representation in gendered sports, to test mixed sports without risking what we currently have, and to give us time to tackle various issues already mentioned, or ones which may become apparent over time.  Also, it'd hopefully do away with this bullshit notion that your average Joe can stand up to a professional women's athlete, as one in eight men apparently believe.  Or we could just test things and find out that no, gender sports is still very much necessary, in which case, trans women still maintain the right to compete as women, and vice versa for trans men.  Beyond that, there are some really interesting avenues to possibly pursue, but it's all theoretical.  But I hope this has explained my position on that somewhat.  It's not exactly been a detailed breakdown, but I hope you can sort of get why.  I'm a little busy with helping efforts to secure trans people their human rights and allowing them to compete in the sport aligning with their gender.

When people read through these passages in the Old Testament, it's no wonder they think that God is, in fact, a cruel and violent monster. Well, it's not just the Old Testament.  The New Testament has its own share of equally violent and monstrous things, but I'll save that for another video I'm working on.  One thing that always bugs me about these conversations, however, is the way in which the butchering of the civilian Midianite captives and the rape of the virgin girls is always left out.  Like, they never include that.  I wonder if that's because it's too hard to bullshit away with the pretense that this is all about warfare rather than genocide.  But I guess we'll find out.  So yes, today's video is a response to Jason Jimenez's video titled, Is God a Cruel Monster?  Let's get down to business. Now, these events clearly did happen. Citation needed, since no way do you go on to verify this assertion in your video, nor is there any reference offered in the description of said video.  But I just want to give a disclaimer here.  None of the events discussed in this video have any historic basis.  Most of these atrocities centre around the mythical figure of Moses and the apparent exodus from Egypt, and the clearing of the Promised Land by Moses and his descendants.  Fact is, no historian has ever supplied evidence that said people were in Egypt at that time, or that any of the subsequent claims have merit.  So I'm not responding to this topic as a fact of matter, but rather as a thought experiment. So to understand why and how they happen, we need to make sure proper precaution and examination of the context is taken before drawing any conclusions. Only if one asserts that things such as genocide and conquest rape can be carried out in a just fashion in any context.  I don't.  That's why I literally wrote the shirt on it.  Genocide and conquest rape, or any rape for that matter, have no place in ethics outside of being classed as a crime against humanity.  So if you're going to argue for these things through context, you've already lost and your argument is dead out of the door.  And what's to follow is just the nail in the coffin. To do this, I'm going to give you three proper steps of interpretation that will help make better sense of these troubling passages on warfare.  First, we must understand that there is a standard of justice.  Otherwise, everything is simply relative to a certain place, time, and event.  The Bible declares that God is a merciful, loving, and perfectly just God.  He would never commit an unjust or brutal act.  It's against his very nature as a God of love.  However, God's holiness and his justice does require that those who do perpetrate evil will be punished.  So when God does enact judgment, it's for a good reason. This is just circular reasoning.  You defend your conclusion that God is just by asserting that they are just.  Mr.  Jim\u00e9nez, what you've brought forward as evidence that the God of the Bible as written is not a monster is the very assertion you are in want of evidence to defend.  I mean, could you imagine trying this in court, attempting to define, not show, but define the defendant as a law-abiding citizen and thus conclude that the evidence to the contrary may be ignored?  That wouldn't stand up in court, so why would it work for God?  I expect better, quite literally, from an all-knowing, all-powerful being. The second step of interpretation is to understand just how evil and corrupt these tribes or these enemies of Israel were in the ancient Near East.  The Canaanites, for example, were incestuous people.  Many believed that their god Baal wanted them to rape people as a form of worship.  They also sacrificed the children to Moloch and fire.  And when you take a closer look into the culture of the Amalekites, What you find is a group of murderous people who refused for 400 years.  Think about that, 400 years.  They chose not to repent and they continued down the path feeding off of their grotesque sins.  Many of these cultures that God permitted to be destroyed were so completely corrupt that there was no hope for the next generation. So let's just get this straight.  Your God's solution for a society in which you assert without basis, I must add, performed ritualised rape and child sacrifice was to butcher every male child and rape every virgin girl with God's blessing.  Because that's what happened to the aforementioned Midianites.  The civilians, mostly women, infant boys and virgin girls, were successfully captured during the battle.  To stress, these people were non-combatant civilians taken as the spoils of war.  So what does Moses do?  He orders every non-Virgin girl along with every infant boy to be slaughtered in captivity, to be butchered, before he then goes on to tell his men that they may take and rape the Virgin girls as a reward for their services to the God you are defending.  And this rape at captives is such a large part of Hebrew and Israelite society that Deuteronomy lays down the law about how one may go about raping said captive Virgin girls.  Remember, said virgin girls are the only ones typically spared.  Why?  Well, it's all part of genocide for the Hebrews.  You see, the Hebrews believed that only the father side was inherited.  Therefore, to kill a people, you only needed to kill all the men and the women who were not virgins in case they'd just conceived before they were captured.  Can you say hypocrite?  Also, the claim that nobody could be spared sort of fucks over your God in another way, since any argument that God couldn't have resolved the issue without violating their free will that sort of goes out the window.  If these people couldn't be saved, period, where's the free will in that?  Well done in shooting yourself in the foot there. And thirdly, we have to understand the tactics of warfare.  You see, it was customary for Israeli rules of engagement to warn of coming invasion, giving women and children the opportunity to flee prior to war coming. Oh great, nice victim blaming.  It's your fault that you didn't flee from our rape-fueled genocide.  You know, I don't think that defence works as well as you'd hoped.  Also, citation needed on the whole given warning thing, because that right there seems to be something that you've just invented, you just pulled from your arse.  Not that it actually changes anything. Another thing to point out when you're dealing with this context of warfare is something that Dr.  Paul Koppen and Clay Jones mentioned in their writings.  And it has to do with the level of hyperbole that is occasionally used in some Old Testament passages of warfare.  Phrases like, utterly destroyer, wipe out everyone, or the land was completely destroyed.  These are not to be taken literally.  It's like a form of speech, like a figure of graphic speech that carries on a level of exaggeration to describe military conquest.  Just like, you know, when you think of a team that says they slaughtered their opponent or they smoked them or we destroyed or we annihilated them.  We know that they're not to be taken literally. Except in the example we use, we're not talking about an all-knowing, all-powerful, all-just deity who'd know how this looks centuries down the line.  Also, what does the claim that this style of exaggeration was used suggest?  For one, it tells us that clearly, God cannot be all-powerful.  for you see, an all-powerful God would not require exaggeration.  Why have stars appear like twinkling diamonds when you could have twinkling diamonds with all the same attributes of stars?  And the fact that the Hebrews could verbally one-up God, that shows a limit to God's power.  It also tells us what said God thinks is an impressive boast of their power, something that is equally fucked up when we acknowledge the fact that we're talking about an apparently perfect entity. I mean, if you think about it, if in fact these Old Testament passages are actually to be taken literally, then why do we still see years later that the Canaanites are still alive and they're still living in the land of the book of Joshua? Because the Bible is an incoherent, factually illiterate mess?  I mean, I thought that was just obvious. The truth of the matter is, God isn't cruel.  He isn't evil.  He's perfect.  He's omnibenevolent.  The real evil in all of this is the nations who were relentless in their attempts to murder off the people of Israel.  Yet, of course, you don't hear a lot of people, especially the new atheist people, complaining about that.  I mean, if you think about it, what kind of God would he be if he abandoned his promises to Israel and he allowed these wicked people to kill them off?  My friends, what we actually see in the pages of scripture is a God using his people Israel as a model of his great love and showing great mercy to the nations who were flaunting their incestuous and sick, twisted, murderous behavior.  And yet after periods of time, this ample time to repent, they chose to refuse and reject God.  And tragically, that's when God's righteous judgment did fall upon them. We don't talk about it because you just pulled that out of your ass.  Even the Bible acknowledges the fact that Moses and the Hebrews were the invading force according to the story it tells.  They're the ones who were invaded on their path from Egypt, partaking in what can only be described as ethnic cleansing of indigenous populations settled in that region.  It was the promised land, not the land we currently have.  The fact that said people use God or His promise as a justification for their genocide doesn't suddenly stop said act from being atrocious.  That's a basic principle you don't seem capable of comprehending.  Simply asserting God or God's promise doesn't magic away the problem being discussed.  quite the opposite.  God could have made it so that nobody settled in that region whilst the Hebrews were away.  They could have done so either directly or indirectly.  In popular media involving magic, there are often spells which make people walk in the opposite direction.  God could have enacted such barriers, or failing to do that, why not dry up every water source in that area?  People require water to live.  No water, no people.  Nobody would settle in such a place, and God could have dried things up slow enough that anyone there prior to that point moved out of said land out of necessity in search of new pastures.  Then when Moses and the Hebrews arrive there, bring back the rains.  I mean, it worked for Paul Atreides in that campus-fucked Dune movie, so why not Moses?  Are the imaginative powers of David Lynch so much more powerful than Those Are Your God?  I'm sorry, but that's a simple fucking solution that would allow God to avoid the genocide and conquest rape.  Another one which is based on one of God's powers in the official canon?  would be closing the womb of every woman in that region a good three to four generations prior to Exodus.  We know God can do so since we see this in Genesis chapter 30 with Jacob and the drooling vaginas.  So yeah, your video amounts to a big place of nothing.  But what do you guys think?  Is there any context, real or hypothetical, in which genocide or rape can be considered just?  What do you think about my proposed solutions to avoid bloodshed, reasonable or unreasonable?

And I want to share things with you that are a little more personal.  So here's what's going on.  It has to do with my story of hormones.  Let's start with when I went through puberty, which was in the late 80s is when that happened.  I didn't know it at the time, but I had elevated testosterone, which just naturally elevated testosterone, which makes a lot of sense and explains a lot of things about when I was younger, especially hair growth.  Like I had my hair on my legs so hairy and dark.  My arms, I was like growing it on my knuckles.  and uh on like my face and things like that and I was very very ashamed of it.  at the time I didn't know what was going on.  why was I so weird and different?  um I also had irregular periods and so I ended up getting on birth control very young and nowadays we know that that is probably an indicator of PCOS but back then I don't know.  maybe it just wasn't paid attention to.  so Let's fast forward and go into my early adulthood, early twenties and whatnot.  I did eventually stop birth control, but if you think about it, it turns out I'm non-binary.  It turns out that my hormones, my balance of hormones is really important.  So the fact that me and none of my medical health practitioners, we didn't know that.  I was on birth control, which increased the amount of estrogen I had in me.  So it's almost like I got the opposite HRT.  that would feel right for me, but I didn't know it.  So it makes sense, I think, that I started to really struggle with PMS during that time.  Like during the premenstrual time, I would just... It turns out that later in life I got diagnosed with having PMDD, which is premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  In fact, just as early as this spring, I got a psychological evaluation and that's the number one thing that came up.  So let's just then say for the course of my lifetime, I've had issues with hormones and for the longest time we blamed it on PMS, PMDD, just being very specific about that when it comes to it being more so me relating to it as a female.  And then once I realized I was non-binary, I was able to be more open with my practitioners, but it still has taken a few years for us to figure out how do we approach it?  Because not only was I experiencing PMS symptoms, but I was experiencing gender dysphoria while I had PMS at the same time.  So that was just a really big aha moment for me.  It helped explain a lot because during times of stress for myself, my anxiety sky high.  And so that's why I got a psychological exam this past spring.  There was a lot going on in my life.  I've told you about my daughter getting ready for college and we went on a lot of college tours and we did a lot of exploring and things like that.  And just so my routine was off and I was experiencing stress, which is fine.  That happens, except then you mix it in with my hormone issues, blah.  So it was really helpful to get that psychological evaluation.  Later, I will tell you a little bit more about what the evaluation also said about me, which I wasn't necessarily surprised, but I haven't shared that publicly yet as well.  But let's stick with the hormones for now.  So what I decided to do was start seeing a physician here in town who I know specializes in working with trans clients and hormones.  And so I know it sounds strange.  Why wasn't I working with somebody before like that?  You know, I tried and either they weren't taking my insurance or I think I just was okay with the fact that I had a naturopath, which has been really, really helpful to me over the years.  But when I went to this doctor and she tested my blood levels, you know, the new one that I'm seeing, it turns out for one my testosterone is below normal female range.  you know what i mean.  um so and my doctor is really good about saying we don't really let's forget about like what's the normal range for females.  you know what feels good or bad for you and the fact that i was explaining about feeling low energy and the tendency to experience stress Um, and not be able to handle it mood swings.  So she's like, this makes sense.  Your testosterone is way low.  And so that's why I'm starting to use the gel.  I am not using much of this.  I am bad at numbers and things like that.  Like if you asked me how many milligrams are you using or grams or how much tea is in it?  I don't know.  I just squeeze it and it ends up being like a size of a chickpea.  is what my doctor told me.  And I use just two of those a day.  That's all.  Because I'm not trying to masculinize to the point of let's say some other people When it's their goals, what they use testosterone gel, I'm just starting a little bit at a time.  And I think potentially it might be microdosing.  when, you know, when you think about it, maybe that's, I would say that's what I'm doing.  My main goal is to get to a normal range, but what's my normal?  What feels good for me?  My doctor's like, let's just try out.  See how it goes.  So for a few months, I'm gonna stay with that amount.  And then towards November or so, if everything's going good, I'm gonna increase it.  See how that feels.  Not to try to confuse you more, but I'm also taking progesterone.  This isn't a pill form.  That's strange, you might say.  That's what a lot of times people who are wanting to feminize more will take.  Well, for one, maybe it's also strange because I'm non-binary.  So it's like masculinize, feminize.  But the progesterone is actually the goal is to trick my body into thinking it's pregnant.  So I will not have my monthly cycle anymore.  That should help me with my mood swings as well.  So I wanted to update you and tell you about this.  And there's a couple of reasons for that.  For one, I've been open with you about my non-binary.  journey and this is a big part of it.  I would say.  for two I think it's just a mental health check-in in general that I think anybody whether you're cis whether you're trans or anywhere in between hormones are really important.  if you don't have the right balance of what feels right to you it can really really mess things up.  one reason my testosterone started to tank is because I'm probably entering perimenopause.  This is going to be like this next time of my life, 10 years or whatever.  I'm going to have to pay really close attention to my hormones because things are going to start changing and they want to be sure I'm staying on top of it because I'm so sensitive to those changes.  And a lot of people are sensitive to that.  So perhaps this is something that you've been thinking about, whether it has to do with transition or just in general, if you're just feeling off, if you're able to.  And again, I'm very... privilege that I do have the ability to afford health insurance.  And my health insurance does cover my visits with my doctor and it helps to pay partially for the medications.  If you're able to get your blood work done, because that also would be a cost to see if your insurance covers the blood work, specifically ask to have your hormones tested.  And then it's less about what's the normal range for male or female.  And it's more about, huh, tell me again how you're not feeling well.  And then you know, your doctor takes notes and says, hmm, this might make sense since your estrogen is low or your progesterone is too high or your testosterone is too low or too high.  It's, I don't know, I just can't say enough about how important it is to be sure not to forget to look at hormones in general, besides the fact, like even if you're transitioning and things start to feel weird or off or you're not sure what's going on, get your hormones tested.  And a lot of you already are doing that or you will be doing that if that's the path you're going on because it's important to get those check-ins.  but sometimes that's really one of the biggest answers for it.  so well that's my update on how i'm doing about all of that.  uh i enjoy talking to you on this more personal level from time to time for sure.  i'm actually at my apartment right now just sitting outside on the porch and i was just thinking you know i think i'd like to share this uh with everyone.  So, like I said, feel free to leave any comments about your experiences with this.  Let me know if you have any questions.

My question is, you know how God knows everything before it happens?  what will happen?  Yes.  He always gives people a chance to choose if they want to go with him in heaven or hell. I don't understand why he makes people if he already knows if they're going to choose to go to hell and just throw it away. I think we're out of time.  That is a great question.  It's a great question.  Why would God create a people who would go to hell?  Right?  That's basically the question.  Well, a couple of things we might say about that.  First of all, when God elects to create this universe, he knows how it's going to turn out.  Because he's outside of time, he knows the end from the beginning.  But the people that believe and the people that don't believe in this universe are freely doing so.  So somebody like, say, Billy Graham, who was a great evangelist for many years, God knew when he created the universe, Billy Graham would believe.  He also knew that somebody like Richard Dawkins wouldn't believe.  But he didn't force them to believe or not to believe.  He allowed them to make their own choice. All Frank Turek has done here is assert his internally contradictory position without actually offering explanation as to how it's possible.  And the way he does this is by reducing the definition of God down to the attribute of omniscience, ignoring the attribute of omnipotence given to him by Christianity.  God is not merely an observer who knows the outcome like a person watching a movie created before they were born for the second time.  God is in fact the writer, director and producer rolled into one.  As an omnipotent being, they had control over every aspect of creation.  On that basis, they knew the result that every choice would have on the later actions of people.  That removes the possibility of free will in its entirety.  The universe simply became a set of predetermined outcomes, chosen by God at the very start, during creation.  It's like one of those coin drop machines you get at the seaside where there are rows of pins that the coins hit as they go down, and it'll go one way or the other.  Now, there's an element of randomness for us because there's too many variables for us to account for.  But if we built a machine with 100% accuracy that knew the outcome of each layer before it put the coin in, the results would cease to be random.  they'd be predetermined.  In effect, if God, the supposed creator of the universe, is both omnipotent and omniscient, Billy Graham and Richard Dawkins did not choose anything, let alone beliefs which I'd argue are still not a choice either way.  But the point is, God chose what they do and apparently will torture one of them for eternity because of said choice.  So how is that just? Now, is it possible God could have created a universe where everyone believed?  Yes, it's possible, but probably not logically... It's logically possible, but probably not actually achievable.  Because if God has truly given people free will, then they're going to make their own choice.  And I don't know about you, but I don't always choose God.  Maybe you do.  You're so innocent.  But I don't always choose God.  And... I would have fallen just like Adam fell if it was just me.  So I think people inevitably will fall away from God.  But some people don't want to be redeemed by God. The fact that people can be predisposed either towards or away from God suggests, at least to some degree, that people's beliefs are predetermined.  Also, if God is omnipotent, they should be able to create a universe in which people have free will, but ultimately come to realise that God exists through the evidence around them.  But we don't have that.  Instead, religions have to spend trillions of dollars annually to indoctrinate each generation.  Why?  Well, they're finding it difficult to compete with improving educational standards and greater scientific and philosophical vigour.  The statement, logically possible but not actually achievable, is okay for a non-omnipotent entity such as human beings.  It is not okay for an omnipotent entity such as God.  Therefore, you either have to give up omnipotence or omniscience. The second thing we might say about that is that God still gets his free will done through people who don't believe in him, or his will done through people who don't believe in him.  How?  Richard Dawkins, for example, writes a book.  A Christian reads a book and goes, wow, I never thought of that argument.  I better go get an answer to it.  It forces the Christian to actually become closer to God by reading what atheists write.  In fact, the more I read atheists, the more I'm convinced that Christianity is true.  because I think their arguments are so  poor.\". Coming from the man avoiding the questions of a small child, that's not exactly troubling.  All it really does is show us that the Dunning-Kruger effect is alive and well in Mr.  Turek.  Fact is, point two, as with point one, doesn't actually deal with the question being asked, at least not in a way that Christians would likely be happy with.  The girl was asking why, if God only knew the outcome, did he bother creating the universe knowing full well that a number of people would, through God's choices at the start of the universe, be forced into denying their existence and, ultimately, be tortured for eternity because of God's choices.  In response to this, Turek goes, well because it makes Christians stronger in their faith.  A statement made without basis, but I'll accept it as a hypothetical.  What Turek is effectively telling the girl is that God would torture countless people if it helped a few Christians keep to their faith, instead of designing a system in which nobody was tortured because they became Christian of their own volition, which is not exactly the image of God most Christians like to forward. Thirdly, none of us would be here if it wasn't for atheists.  Why?  Because not everybody in my bloodline is a Christian.  Right?  I maybe had grandfathers or great-grandfathers or grandmothers or whatever in my bloodline.  I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for atheists. Again, Frank Turek dodges the actual question.  If atheists didn't exist, procreation wouldn't cease to happen.  Christian couples would still have children, who in turn would have children of their own, and so on and so forth.  Only in this scenario, people wouldn't be tortured for eternity as a result of choices made by God when they created the universe.  Now one may argue that Turok is referring to himself and the people that exist today specifically.  And if that is the case, what this reveals is a level of inflated ego.  That would mean that Turok believes his existence is worth countless people being tortured for all eternity.  Which it isn't.  Nobody's existence is worth that.  However, this once again raises a problem with God's supposed omnipotence.  It says God couldn't create a world in which everyone was Christian.  and yet Frank Turek exists in some form, something which puts a clear limitation on God's power.  God's either all-powerful and all-knowing, or he isn't.  And yet all three of Turek's arguments rely on ignoring at least one of these traits in order to avoid what the girl is actually getting at with her question.  i.e.  is it moral to create people and force them to walk down a path which, thanks to God's design, will result in them being tortured for eternity?  Because that's a question Turek can't actually answer in an honest fashion. So there's a lot of reasons why God would have allowed people to freely choose not to trust in him.  If he forced people to trust in him, then they wouldn't really be free creatures, and this wouldn't be a moral universe to begin with, would it? Except you fail to show how people have the ability to freely choose in a universe in which God, the creator of the universe, is all-knowing and all-powerful.  And what's more is, I think this girl realizes that from her reaction as Turg finishes up.  This isn't the nod of understanding, merited or not.  This girl seems genuinely disappointed that she didn't receive an honest answer from Mr.  Turek.  Whilst the congregation applauds him, I can't help but feel that this girl sees through the bullshit.  And if she can hold onto that seed of scepticism, I have very little doubt that she'll shed her parents' religious beliefs.  And Mr.  Turek will have played a key part in extinguishing her misplaced faith in God.

The girl asks why God creates people knowing they will choose to go to hell, and Turek responds by asserting his position without providing a clear explanation. \n\nTurek reduces God's attributes to omniscience, ignoring omnipotence, which contradicts the Christian view of God. This results in a predetermined universe where people's choices are not truly free. The girl's question highlights the problem of God's supposed omnipotence and omniscience, as it implies that God could have created a universe where everyone believes, but instead chooses to create a world where people are tortured for eternity.\n\nTurek's responses to the girl's question are criticized for dodging the actual issue and failing to provide a satisfactory answer. His arguments rely on ignoring at least one of God's traits, either omnipotence or omniscience, to avoid addressing the moral implications of creating people who will be tortured for eternity.\n\nThe video concludes that Turek's responses fail to provide an honest answer to the girl's question, and that she seems to see through the lack of sincerity. The author suggests that this experience may lead the girl to shed her faith in God, and that Turek's actions may have inadvertently contributed to this outcome.","responses":"[1] Philosophy: Mentions the discussion of God's attributes, omnipotence, and omniscience, and the moral implications of creating people who will be tortured for eternity.\n[1] Ethics: Mentions the moral implications of God's actions and the criticism of Turek's responses.\n[1] Morality: Mentions the moral implications of God's actions and the criticism of Turek's responses.\n[1] Debate: Mentions the discussion and criticism of Turek's responses.\n[1] Justice: Mentions the moral implications of God's actions and the criticism of Turek's responses.\n[1] Interpretation: Mentions the discussion of God's attributes and the moral implications of creating people who will be tortured for eternity.\n[1] Religion: Mentions the discussion of God's attributes and the moral implications of creating people who will be tortured for eternity.\n[1] Morals: Mentions the moral implications of God's actions and the criticism of Turek's responses.\n[1] History: Mentions the discussion of God's attributes and the moral implications of creating people who will be tortured for eternity.\n[1] Personal Growth: Mentions the potential outcome of the girl's experience and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Personal Development: Mentions the potential outcome of the girl's experience and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Personal Experience: Mentions the girl's question and her potential outcome.\n[1] Identity: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Social Life: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Community: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Relationships: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Family: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Personal Skills: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Development: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Growth: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Character Development: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in God.\n[1] Accessibility: Mentions the girl's potential outcome and her shedding of faith in"}

Welcome back to Video for the Day.  This is Sankarshan Das speaking to you from Iskcon, Austin, Texas, USA. And this is Peter slash Ethel, talking to you from New Delhi, India.  Which is kind of funny considering how you're the Hare Krishna and yet you live in the US.  But here I am, the British atheist living in India with his ex-Hindu Brahmin fianc\u00e9.  I even attended a wedding last Friday, and funnily enough, it was the wedding of an atheist friend.  Both myself and Udita met at one of our Atheist, Feminist and Three Fingers meets we used to organise.  That was until they became the fortnightly Dungeons & Dragons sessions I currently run.  So anyway, today's video is a response to Shankar Shandas and his videos titled, Atheism is Blind Faith Dogmatism and Atheists Have Got It All Wrong.  Now I know some other people have already responded to the second video since I found it and downloaded it, but I still wanted to do them myself.  There's not a whole lot of concise Hindu content here on YouTube.  Though I am stretching the word concise here, as you're likely already aware.  So yeah, let's get down to business.  Starting with atheism is blind faith dogmatism. Right now I'm having a debate on the internet with an atheist.  He says in the beginning there is hydrogen.  Somehow it was just there and from hydrogen everything has come. Well, all molecules were originally hydrogen, though they have since gone through the process of nuclear fusion at the cores of stars.  This process, known as nucleosynthesis, varies from star to star.  Small stars can turn hydrogen into helium, medium stars can do the same, but can also turn helium into carbon and oxygen.  Huge stars also have this trait, but can go a step further and can form neon, sodium, magnesium, sulfur, and silicon, as well as calcium, iron, nickel, chromium, copper, and many, many more.  As for the idea that said hydrogen was just there, that's not really accurate.  We've got observable evidence of an event known as the Big Bang, the expansion of all matter from a point of singularity to the current universal state.  And it's something that's still going on.  Beyond said singularity, we don't know much.  But we are trying to find out, and there are various naturalistic hypotheses currently being tested.  But nowhere is God even mentioned amongst said explanations.  Now why do you think that is? But here I am sitting in this room right here.  A light bulb is up there illuminating the room.  But electrical energy is there illuminating that light bulb.  So what is more reasonable, to assume the electrical energy is just there or to assume there's actually a powerhouse from which the energy is coming?  And to understand that there's an engineer behind the powerhouse.  What's more reasonable? Well, since we have an evidence-based understanding of how light bulbs operate, it's reasonable to base that conclusion off our evidence understanding.  We do not have the same knowledge about the universe and its origins.  Again, it's something we're working on.  And whilst we don't have all the answers, everything we've written so far has been purely naturalistic.  So that's the evidence we do have.  Purely naturalistic processes.  Is it then reasonable to assume some unnatural event or entity?  played some role?  No!  That's the very antithesis of reason, inventing stuff in the absence of knowledge, stuff which can't be tested or verified in a peer-reviewed fashion.  So your analogy is bogus.  A better yet still not perfect one would be looking at a bioluminescent fish and you arguing that this must have a human origin due to our understanding of light and electricity.  even though there's actually no electricity present, and we have prior knowledge of non-electrical light sources. These atheists, actually, they are blind faith dogmatists.  The energy is just there, it has no origin, it has no engineer behind it, you see.  They accuse us, theists, as being dogmatists, but actually they are the true dogmatists.  We have all reason and logic behind our theistic viewpoint.  They have simply blind faith behind their atheistic philosophy.  So don't be befooled or misled or confused by these atheists.  They're simply blind faith dogmatists. Right then, well could you possibly supply said reason and logic, not to mention evidence that supports the existence of the supernatural?  I'm not even asking for evidence of God, especially not your God in particular.  The supernatural is a hurdle enough, I feel.  So if you could show that first, we'll take that and process that before moving on to the next step.  Oh.  That's the whole video, apparently.  So, uh, no.  You don't have all reason and logic on your side.  You have the assertion that you do.  But nothing to show for said assertion.  And that's a little disappointing, but... Oh well, I'll live I guess.  I've also seen no evidence of atheistic dogmatism in the rejection of your assertion that a god exists.  Since you, as with every other theist out there, has failed to supply evidence of god, that's actually the only philosophically honest position to maintain at current.  I am fully open to accepting evidence of god.  if it's evidence that stands to scrutiny.  If you simply go, well, we don't understand process X, Y, or Z, therefore God, that's not an actual argument.  This is simply the God of the Gaps argument and appeal to ignorance, which is not that impressive.  All it does is show that you don't know your shit.  Anyway, I feel we've got time for another short spout.  So, Shankar Shandas, please lead the way with Atheists.  Have Got It All Wrong. I've been having some dialogue on the internet with an atheist.  He says, there is no proof of the existence of God.  Any argument you give him, he says, oh, it's no good.  He doesn't accept any arguments, any logical arguments. That's the thing.  What do you mean by logical arguments?  You seem to believe that the previous video I responded to to be a logical argument, but it isn't.  It wasn't.  It never will be.  In fact, it was quite the opposite, an entirely fallacious argument.  So if you're referring to arguments like that, No wonder they reject your conclusions.  Making an argument is not enough.  Said argument must stand to repeated scrutiny, it must be testable, and by proxy, it must also be falsifiable in theory.  Otherwise, there's no point to having this conversation whatsoever. But Krishna very clearly says in the Gita, Mrityu sarvaharashaham, I am all-devouring death.  So our atheist friends, They might accept God's existence, but they will experience God directly at the time of death.  Krishna will come and take away everything from them, you see.  So they will not bow down to God voluntarily, but they will bow down to God by force at the time of death. It is written, as surely as I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow before me, every tongue will acknowledge, end quote.  Yes, we've heard this all before with Christianity and Islam.  Seems there's going to be somewhat of a queue when I die.  When you have to resort to threatening an atheist with a threat they do not believe exists, it's pretty obvious that you've got nothing of substance.  This is just mental masturbation designed to make yourself feel secure in your faith-based belief, even though you have no reason to be. So we are more intelligent than that. Citation needed. Why should I experience God as death when I'm experiencing him as an ocean of unlimited mercy and unlimited bliss?  That all-powerful, all-beautiful, all-renounced, all-wealthy, all-famous and wisest person who's emanating unlimited universes from himself at every minute.  he's bestowing unlimited mercy at every minute upon his devotees.  He shone his devotees with an ocean of unlimited bliss, unlimited mercy. Isn't it rather funny the way in which unlimited bliss and mercy is defined by complete absence of said deity's presence?  You're not experiencing anything supernatural, no more than Christians or Muslims or Jews or any other ideology centered around the supernatural.  You have the simple habit of taking the mundane and re-imagining it as something more than it really is.  which is not that impressive.  It's a rather common trait seen across all religions and is something I myself once experienced with Christianity. Why not experience God in that way?  That's called intelligence.  Why be a fool and take God only as death when you can have him as the sweetest companion who's giving you unlimited happiness at every minute? There's nothing smart in believing in that which lacks evidence that it even exists.  That is the complete suspension of intelligence and the acceptance of blind, ignorant gullibility.  Why don't we accept your God?  Well, because you haven't demonstrated your God even exists, let alone that they are worthy of praise.  It really is that simple. Sorry, atheist friends.  You got it all wrong.  I hope you see the light.  I don't like to see anybody suffering.  I don't like to see your suffering condition.  It pains my heart.  I want that all these atheists to now understand who is Krishna and give themselves to Krishna and thus relish the sweetest happiness at every minute. And I'll do that when you actually supply valid argument supported by evidence, because so far you may as well be talking about the symbolic imagery of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  What you said across these two videos fails to even start to support the case for Krishna, let alone effectively demonstrate it.  It may be different gods, but it's the same abysmal assertions as always.  So what do you lot think?  Do you lot find Shankar Shandas's arguments to be all convincing?  Was there something that I missed that you lot spotted?  If so, be sure to drop me a line down in the comments.

It's been a while.  Welcome to me, to this channel.  So this week we are doing reintroductions.  I just want to bring up some things that I think might be relevant in, like, the things that I'm gonna be talking about in the future.  So I'm gonna try to be quick because my battery's about to run out.  I have some notes here on my phone of what I'm going to say, in case I'm looking down, that's why.  I'm not looking at my huge penis.  My name is Emil.  A lot of non-Scandinavian people I find don't really know how to pronounce that, and that's okay.  You can call me Emil.  It's a lot easier to say in English.  So I'm non-binary, and you can use he or they pronouns for me.  Most people use he.  I've been on T for three years.  and I had top surgery about two and a half years ago, which feels unreal.  But yeah, I live in Stockholm, in Sweden, in an apartment with three other trans people and two cats and a dog.  I work in a stable, and I pretty recently started working there, and I have some other animal-related jobs that I might probably start working at in case everything works out.  I have like two big passions in life and that's dogs and music.  I'm obsessed with dogs and specifically like dog training and dog sports.  Right now I just have one dog, a five month old Chihuahua.  Here she is, her name is Elle and she is going to be competing in nose work in case she likes it, but I think so.  She's really good at using her nose and right now I'm planning for my next dog that I'm gonna get at some point in the relatively near future, which is gonna be like my proper sport dog, and we're gonna do obedience, we're probably gonna do agility, like different nose work tracking type of stuff and then like.  I don't think it's called mushing in English because I think mushing is specifically like with a sled but like bike-uring.  I think it's called or canicross like when your dog is pulling you when you're on a bike or when you're jogging or when you're on some different type of like kick bike or something like that.  Haven't decided on the breed yet, haven't decided on the breeder but I'm looking and I'm really excited.  As I said we also have two cats and they are called Elphaba and Fiyero and I will insert some clips of them here.  As I said before, my other big passion besides dogs or animals is music and I take singing lessons where I mostly sing songs from musicals and I like to write my own songs and play my own songs.  and I'm by no means the best, like.  I'm very much an amateur but I really enjoy it and I've gotten a lot better since starting to take singing lessons and I hope to, in the future, work part-time with dogs in some way and part-time with musical theater or with, like, my own music.  It's a long road and it's a difficult industry, but I think that it's important to pursue your dreams.  Chase those passions.  Since I started doing that more and paying more attention to what I truly enjoy and what makes me feel happy, I've just started feeling so much better.  So when it comes to listening to music, I listen to a lot of, like, 70s folk rock and punk and rock and pop music and indie music.  Basically, I listen to everything.  But those are my main genres.  And musicals, of course.  I also really enjoy, like, Scandinavian folk music.  I also like cosplaying, but I really don't do it a lot because making your own cosplays or even just buying them, like, it requires money.  And I spend my money on singing lessons and animals, so I don't have a lot left.  because I don't earn that much.  And like a lot of other people, I have had huge issues with my mental health.  And my biggest issue has been anxiety, which I have lived with since I was about 10, 11 years old.  I had huge issues in school because of the environment.  There was a lot of noise.  I'm very sensitive to noise and to sensory input.  And I have had to learn pretty much by myself how to handle that.  I had a lot of family support, so I was really lucky in that aspect.  It's only just recently that I've really gotten better at managing my anxiety, and a lot of that has been due to me actively working hard and taking steps to shape my life in such a way that my anxiety can manage it.  It's gotten a lot better, and I'm really excited to talk more about that on my own channel as well, which I'll link below.  and on this channel as well, mental health and anxiety and how to handle that because it really changes your life once you learn how to... how to live with the way that your brain works and how to work with that flow instead of against it.  I have like this big thing with loving this TV show called MASH which is an old American show.  My biggest role model in life is Alan Alda who played one of the main characters in that show.  It saved my life, it changed my life and I love it so much.  The last thing I'm gonna bring up here is that I am a pretty spiritual person, but I also consider myself pretty down-to-earth.  I follow, like, the old Scandinavian path thingy, I guess you could say, but also, like, in a more modern way.  So a lot of people know that belief as, um, Asatru.  I think it's the way it's pronounced in English.  But I follow, like, a more, I don't know if you'd call it a specific path, but there's an organization called Funsed Sverige.  We're just Fonset, which means like ancient custom.  Fonset Sverige is ancient custom Sweden, which is like the organization.  I'll link their website below.  You can go check it out.  I don't know if there's like a translate feature or an English page, but hopefully there is.  I see the gods as like forces of nature and concepts that we put together in our minds, like several different concepts that we put into one, into one bigger concept that means something to us.  I consider my spiritual beliefs very down to earth and very like rational and I'm definitely not anti-science or anything like that.  So that's all I really had to say.  I'm really glad that my battery lasted this long.  I'm surprised.  We're at like nine and a half minutes now.  So yeah, I look forward to seeing you more here in the future and I hope that you will like what we are doing with rebranding the channel and like really trying to make it more organized.  And yeah, we'll see how it turns out.  I think it's going to be good.  Have a nice day.  I'll see you later.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0r9304c8cdvi01ikhd87","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCzf3yeHqRcDmvA5r2mMxWXg","channel.name":"Transtastic","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.95,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXbNxUhgOCFMsFFmKByCnPKFonz56O1MAnZYg_wxw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2010-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel.

My name is Riley, and today we're talking about H.R.  1, the For the People Act.  It's a bill that Democrats introduced to the House of Representatives early in January as their first official piece of legislation.  It's a massive reform bill meant to fight corruption and improve voting rights.  Unsurprisingly, Republicans are opposed to it.  But why would they be opposed to something that's supposed to end corruption and make it easier for Americans to vote?  To answer that, we need to look at what H.R.  1 does.  It has three major sections, anti-corruption, voting rights, and ethics.  First, let's go over the anti-corruption goals.  They include a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United.  If you remember, Citizens United is the Supreme Court case that essentially decided that corporations can donate as much as they want to political action committees or PACs.  The court essentially said that extremely wealthy corporations have free speech, and that restricting their ability to donate would be restricting free speech.  However, the problem is, corporations aren't people!  So this decision essentially gave massive corporations way more sway over our elected officials than the actual people they're supposed to be representing.  Repealing Citizens United would mean restoring free speech to the actual human beings who live in this country, because, again, corporations aren't people!  HR1 would also require super PACs to make all their donors public, and it would make Facebook and Twitter disclose who's purchasing political ads on their sites.  It would also create public financing of campaigns, where the government would match small donations up to $200 at a rate of 6 to 1.  That means that if you donate $10 to a political campaign, the government would donate $60 to that candidate.  That would make it easier for candidates with grassroots support by real people to finance their campaigns.  as opposed to the system we have now, where politicians have to get support from huge wealthy corporations that then expect favorable legislation in return.  The anti-corruption goals of this bill are all intended to make our political process more representative of what real people want, because right now it's clear that that's not happening.  Next up, the voting rights section.  This would create a system for national automatic voter registration.  So if you're eligible to vote, you're automatically registered.  That's it.  No more arbitrary deadlines before elections, no more needing to remember to register.  You just are registered.  I actually cannot believe this hasn't been done already, because it's such a common sense thing.  People have a right to vote, so they should have a right to be automatically registered to vote.  It would make the whole process so much easier.  H.R.  1 would also make Election Day a holiday, meaning federal employees would get the day off, and other businesses would be encouraged to do the same.  Which, again, is a super common sense reform.  If you have to work all day on election day because you're poor and can't afford to miss work, that's taking away your right to vote.  That's only empowering rich people who can afford to take a day off work.  Election day absolutely needs to be a holiday.  And HR1 proposes other changes, like prohibiting gerrymandering, prohibiting voter roll purging, and requiring that the government recruit and train more poll workers to reduce voting lines.  And finally, the ethics section.  This part is basically directed right at Trump.  It says that the president and vice president, and any candidates for those positions, would need to disclose their last 10 years of tax returns.  And as I'm sure you're well aware, Trump still hasn't released his.  H.R.  1 would stop members of Congress from using taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment cases, because yes, that is actually a thing that really happens in the current system.  And it would put in place an ethical code for the Supreme Court so that justices are held to some kind of a standard.  At the end of the day, HR1 is mostly symbolic.  If House Democrats pass it, there's no way it'd pass the Senate or be signed by Trump.  Mitch McConnell has already said he's opposed to it, and his reasons are pretty unbelievable.  Republicans are trying to spin it as a Democrat power grab, saying that Democrats want to enact these rules so that they can get elected and stay elected.  And like, look, if restoring people's voting rights and taking money out of politics gets more Democrats elected, then maybe they're doing something right.  That doesn't mean they're cheating the system.  Giving Americans their right to vote, and making sure that vote matters more than money from some huge corporation, that's objectively a good thing.  If it gets more Democrats elected, then that means Democrats' ideals are more aligned with what the American people actually want.  And that's basically the goal of H.R.  1 right now, since it won't be passed anytime soon.  It's forcing Republicans to take an anti-anti-corruption stance.  It's forcing people to see that Republicans want money to stay in politics because it benefits them.  Democrats know that H.R.  1 won't pass, but they also know that a majority of Americans support passing anti-corruption legislation.  And when Republicans oppose that, it makes them look really bad.  But still, this bill has a long way to go simply because it has to be passed in a system that is so severely rigged against it.  The corporations that are donating huge amounts of money to politicians right now to get them elected or keep them elected, they're gonna want to make sure this bill doesn't pass.  Because even though it might be good for the American people, it won't be good for those huge corporations' financial interests.  And so I'm not sure where this will go.  Hopefully it can be used to show everyone how Republicans are devoted to supporting corruption and suppressing the vote.  And that could lead to more Democrats getting elected in 2020, which could lead to some actual change.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  Anyway, that's all I had for you today.

So I know it's kind of silly to do a 2018 review when we're three months into the new year, but I still wanted to do one, because a lot happened this year.  For the channel and for me.  The biggest thing is that we gained around 28,000 subscribers, which is a lot.  We had two older videos get really big all of a sudden at the beginning of 2018, and we got a lot of new subscribers from it.  We didn't make videos as consistently because we got a little burnt out, but we started making better videos.  There is a definite shift in our production quality.  I finally started making video essays, and I mean, they're pretty good.  Like, I'm really proud of them.  I've played around with a bit of a redesign, we started doing some things to help the channel in the long run, I finally started to understand how to use the lighting setup, and wow, wouldn't you know it, suddenly my videos looked a lot better.  I also started playing around with Apple Motion, so that's how we got some of the cool little customized effects that you saw in the Shape of Ableism and the Burtonmas series videos.  Unfortunately, we filmed two separate P&S Watch videos with our friends, and the footage was either corrupted or it disappeared entirely, which really sucks, but I can't say that we didn't learn anything from those experiences.  We might even end up filming them again.  For me personally, 2018 was a year of huge growth and change.  I worked through a lot of emotional stuff that I've been holding onto from a past abusive relationship.  I got to a point where I sort of realized how inadequate I felt all the time.  How?  I didn't feel like I could really trust anyone to be my entire self around.  And I eventually just sort of hit this point where I didn't want to be that way anymore, and I didn't want to feel that way anymore.  The girlfriend and I started doing what we called intimacy exercises, using this 20 pack of cards from the School of Life.  The School of Life is a great channel and online store that I recommend checking out.  Their videos are very thoughtful.  This relationship reboot thing we used has a topic, and then mini-essays that are meant to help start and guide conversations about vulnerability.  Doing these exercises hasn't just strengthened my relationship, which it absolutely has, but it's also impacted my relationships with other people, and more than that, it's made me a lot more honest with myself.  As I was doing these exercises, I found that the hours or days I would spend feeling anxious and unsure of myself dramatically decreased.  Not that I never feel anxious anymore or never feel insecure, but I kind of just got in the habit of not feeling like I had to constantly punish myself for not being perfect at every single moment.  And that sounds very magical, but it was months of practicing and learning how to be more honest with others and me on a daily basis.  It was unpacking why I had become so reliant on deflecting emotional conversations with jokes, which I've already done a couple times in this video.  And I'm glad I had my girlfriend who was supportive, who I knew I could trust, But it was still really hard.  And I don't know how you might do these exercises if you don't have a person like that to do them with, but I don't think it has to be a romantic partner.  Paige and I are actually going to do these this year.  Some of them had to be adjusted, but ultimately these are meant to facilitate better communication and emotional honesty in a relationship, whether romantic or not.  It was a really big thing for me to do this year.  It was heavy and scary, and I felt very, very fragile.  but I was kind of expecting that after reading Jennifer Lewis's book The Mother of Black Hollywood because in that book she talks a lot about how therapy and doing that emotional labor is really hard and it takes time but it's worth it.  And I can honestly say that I feel the most stable and content that I've ever felt since becoming an adult.  One of the things that I got a lot better at was not taking it so personally when someone I knew didn't respond to a private message.  I have a much healthier sense of self, and a much more realistic sense that everybody's got their own thing going on, and that sometimes I take a while to respond to messages, and that it's okay.  It's not a reflection on me, and it doesn't mean they hate me all of a sudden.  And if they do, that's unreasonable of them.  I've gotten a lot better about asking my friends for reassurance when I need it, even if I know logically that the thing I'm freaking out about doesn't require it, even if that reassurance is really small.  Things don't really get bottled up anymore because when I want to say something, now I usually just say it.  And I realize that not everything has to destroy me.  Not everything is catastrophic.  I don't think I'm perfect.  There are things I still need to work on, but I no longer feel like the only way I can survive is lying to myself or hating myself.  I also recognize that a lot of the emotional issues and baggage that I had was clustered around this one thing.  It was... I had a MacGuffin.  And I know that this isn't going to be the case for everyone.  I might have some garden variety anxiety or I could have something else entirely or maybe I don't have anything.  What worked for me might not work for you.  I'm just saying that it did work for me and it might for you too.  And if by chance you need permission or encouragement from someone to start being more honest and kinder to yourself, then that's me.  Then I'm telling you.  It's okay to think about that.  And it's scary, but it's okay to want to be more honest and to be happier.  And I believe in you.  What else?  I went to VidCon.  Paige did not go with me, unfortunately, and I missed her a lot.  I hung out with and met people I admire, and there are even people who are doing truly amazing things on YouTube who I would confidently consider friends.  I've gotten a lot better about talking to people I don't know, even people I find very impressive.  Because I'm proud of the videos we make, and I just realized even more so than when we went in 2017 that these people are people.  Just like me.  Just like us.  And more than that, that we are peers.  And I've started really to not think of myself as an unworthy imposter, but as a worthy colleague.  And again, like with the intimacy exercises, it comes down to practice because I used to be a lot more anxious about talking to people on the phone or in person, especially people that I thought I didn't really have any business talking to because they were just so cool and successful and I wasn't.  But I feel like I'm starting to become the person that can accomplish the things that I want to accomplish in my life.  It's not a huge thing, but I started to really find the style that I feel most comfortable in, that feels like me.  I started wearing earrings, and it turns out, I really like earrings.  I strengthened a lot of friendships in 2018.  I made a lot of new friends.  I got a lot more confident.  I read some great things, and I made some great things.  So what about this year?  What are the goals?  It's 2019.  This October, Paige and I will have been making videos for five years.  And look at what we've built.  We've gotten so much better at this thing, and it feels like we're just getting started.  It's such a cliche, but it feels true.  So this is a goal, and it's a big thing, and it might not happen, but who knows?  Let's just put it out there.  I want to get to 50,000 subscribers this year.  Five years, 50,000.  That makes sense.  And that means making more videos.  We get more subscribers when we make videos, so that's what we'll do.  I already have a list of video essays I want to get done, and I'm not sure which one I'm going to get started on once I'm done with this video, but I'll figure it out.  Personally, I'd like to aim for making at least two videos a month.  I feel like that is a reasonable, forgiving goal, especially because this is something Paige and I do for fun.  It's not our primary jobs.  I'd also like to collaborate with other people and other channels.  In 2018, Paige and I did our first podcast appearance, and I want to do that again this year.  We've actually already got one scheduled to record relatively soon, it's for a show called Setting the Record Queer, and I'm very excited for that.  By the way, if there's a podcast or channel you want us on, let us and them know.  Politely.  Of course.  If we make something that you think your friends would like, share it with them.  Another big thing I want is The Princess and the Scrivener to be invited to VidCon 2019.  I want Paige and I to be featured creators.  Paige won't be able to go if at least part of the trip isn't paid for because Otherwise, she's doing D23.  She's busy.  I don't know if I'll go if we don't get invited.  I'm just not sure yet.  But I hope I don't have to make that choice, especially because I got to meet some of you this past summer at VidCon, and it was awesome.  I would love for Paige to be with me for that.  I've filled out the applications and everything for us to be considered, but VidCon asks stuff on Twitter about who you want to see at VidCon all the time, so if you're on Twitter, let them know you want us there.  We're planning a redesign with a small business, and I'm very excited for that.  One of the reasons we haven't done a P&S launch in a while is because of the corrupted and lost footage, definitely, but it's also because we want to have a logo and intro for that series, so the sooner we can get some of that done, the better.  Very excited about that.  Paige is also saving up for a new laptop this year.  This will mean she can edit more videos and bigger projects, like PNS Watch Series videos.  So money from Patreon is always helpful for that.  Even if you just make a one-time donation.  So yeah, those are some big things.  Big things this year.  Now what about me?  I want to participate in NaNoWriMo this year.  I've never done that before.  But I wanna try.  I wanna write something fiction.  We'll see how that goes.  There's a lot to look forward to this year, but I'm really proud of what we accomplished last year.  What I accomplished last year.  And I have a good feeling about 2019.  So I hope you all stick around.  Thanks for watching, and one of us will see you real soon.","channel.id":"clxmi0rat04ddcdvirb8sizkf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCtilV9LOwqBXw_xMQTk0JZA","channel.name":"The Princess and the Scrivener","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU1VX7kdvHkZuasrBhRHr5_O6BHGwcn3650cdFxbg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, I'm Scrivener.

Our word choice is not ideal, and we acknowledge that, but we also want to make this clear: This movie never once considers Syd, it's main character, to be disabled or an addict. The film never views abuse of any kind as anything beyond a personality trait, and that is not acceptable.\n\nWe saw this movie itself as a source of stigma, and we should have been clearer in constructing that message. We also know that we could and should have been more sensitive when choosing our words on certain topics.\n\nThat being said:\n\nIf you want a master class in what NOT to do while making a film, watch London (2005)!\n\nAngel and I can't even say the WORD \"London\" anymore.

Did you know that? That could have been the scene. Yeah.  It didn't have to be that long. It was really boring. What they could have done is they have that one scene with Louis CK, by the way. Another con. Chris's shirt is too small, and normally I wouldn't complain about that, but Sid doesn't deserve it.  The dumb title sequence was dumb.  And it's like the impact font that everyone uses.  So Sid receives a phone call about the going away party, and he just starts destroying stuff in his apartment, including the fish tank.  that they never talk about again.  But he's a fish killer.  Sid is obsessed with London.  He asks every single character that they both know if London has said anything about him because he's ridiculously insecure in this movie.  Hey, is London here yet?  Um, no, I don't think so. It doesn't just stop in like the first part.  It goes through the entire entire movie. I don't care about that because I'm not told why I should care. But here's Angel, and today I made her suffer through London with me.  And suffer we did.  I had seen London before, and so I knew it was going to be a slow ride through a deep, dark trench. It was worse than that. But I had to watch it.  The things we do for love.  All right, Jamie.  London was released in 2005 and it was directed by Hunter Richards, who also wrote it.  Hunter Richards never did anything else except for a movie called Free the Nipple and I don't trust it, just based on what I know about London.  He was probably blackballed after it.  because it's so bad.  It's just so bad.  I'm surprised the rest of the cast wasn't.  I would say that they give all to this performance, but it's really just that like they're running through acting 101, you know, like Roger Ebert says.  So London is about a young man named Sid who's a junkie and really not good for, like, anything.  And he scores some drugs from Jason Statham playing a character named Bateman.  Sid takes Bateman to a party for Sid's ex-girlfriend London, even though throughout the movie he consistently says that she's still his girlfriend, which is not the case.  And for most of the movie, Sid and Bateman stay in the bathroom at this party and just get high and drunk to the point where, realistically, they should have, like, been dead on the floor.  This is the second movie in this series in Chris Evans' filmography where he also worked with Jessica Biel and Jason Statham, you'll remember from Cellular, which I actually really liked.  What happened?  Somebody let Hunter Richards take the wheel.  Our pros and cons list is mostly a cons list.  Do you want to read our pros since you are a much more optimistic person than I am? Generic New York City opening shot? I kind of liked it.  It was fine. Jessica Biel's arm muscles were pretty great.  Jason Statham's wig, which is much better than Chris Evans' wig.  Isla Fisher was in it.  She was actually one of the only likable characters, I think.  She did not love Sid.  Maya is honest, even though Sid doesn't want her to be. He's like an attractive guy. If you were my friend, you would have lied.  That's not how friendship works. I don't think so. Kat Dennings was in it. Did she even like do anything?  How old are you?  Um, 18.  She was there for like two seconds. The last thing, which I don't know if it's a spoiler alert or whatever, but don't watch the movie anyway, but London still leaves.  I don't know where she's going. LA.  She's moving to LA.  So now we're on the cons.  And it's a never-ending list of\u2014I mean, it does end, but it feels like it's a never-ending list of cons.  Angel's very first con was, get your life together, Sid, because he's just in his apartment, sad and alone and getting high, being a big baby about it.  It's one thing if a character has depression, and another if a character is just upset that he mistreated his girlfriend so badly that she finally left him six months before this.  There's a sex scene at the opening that is very long.  There are lots of flashbacks throughout this movie and they're all way too long.  Chris's orgasm face is the one that's like, jiffed all the time, but it's not worth it. Sid's just like going off on the therapist and was like, nothing you're doing is helping me.  I'm so miserable. He gaslights his therapist. And I'm like, what they could have done is like use the therapy scene to delve into why he's insecure and why he's like this rather than just another scene where he is. He's just verbally abusing somebody else.  Sid has to be the smartest person in the room at all times about everything, and if he's not, he cries about it.  They refer to women as chicks, which is indicative of it being released in 2005 and written by a white guy.  Sid is the worst.  I probably wrote that at least four times.  Maya is too young to be around the other people.  I think they say she's 17.  She has the glass of wine when she goes to the bathroom.  Yeah. Who gave her wine?  The adults should have been more responsible. Oh yeah.  Becca thinking.  Becca's the adult hosting this party and yet she's giving 17 year olds wine and then still complaining when she's like, you're doing blow in my bathroom, as being a hypocrite.  Sid's avoidance of commitment is exactly why London leaves him in the first place.  He entirely frames their breakup as like her fault.  In every instance, every flashback, they show that he's the asshole telling her that all of these things that she thinks and believes and feels are bullshit.  That's called gaslighting and she's not in the wrong for wanting to leave him for that.  They use the term as a derogatory term.  Just maybe don't use homophobia to say bad things about other people.  Sid's depression sweatpants.  It's cool if you have depression sweatpants, but maybe don't wear them to a going-away party for your ex-girlfriend, especially if you know you're gonna be in trouble anyway for doing blow in the bathroom when you know that she doesn't like you doing that and you're there specifically to try to talk to her about getting back together, Sid.  I don't think he would be classified as having depression.  I think he's just an addict and strung out and lazy. He seems much more manic than just straight depressive, because he talks about like having these highs and lows and not knowing how to like deal with his emotions, but it doesn't seem like it's, you know, handled well in a clinical sense. There wasn't a lot of mental health talked on, so I think it could be just assumed that it's just like his lazy sweatpants and he doesn't want to make the effort.  He talks so much about her not liking him doing drugs. And continues to do drugs. And continues to do it at the party.  And he's like, oh, I hope she doesn't see me like this.  And we're like, well, stop doing it. He wasn't even invited. And he shows up super early.  And then does drugs.  And... he still thinks that she owes him a conversation. Yeah, that's a big problem.  Like, you weren't even invited!  He thinks that she, like, owes him because he's God's greatest gift or something, even though he repeatedly says that, like, God is bullshit and he doesn't believe in God, and nobody else should.  Like, he continuously judges people to believe in God, yet he seems to think that he is the only gift from God.  They have continuously and increasingly pretentious conversations about pain, about misery, about humiliation, and they really just kind of go in circles.  They're really not actually making any points.  Those are just like the themes that they bring up. In a movie, each scene should like move the plot forward.  That does not happen in this movie. These conversations... It's not even really a plot-heavy movie, but even still, those conversations aren't driving the story or the character growth forward.  They don't add anything. It's like you said, it just keeps circling back, and we're like, you're still awful, you're not making any progress. Yeah.  Maya just... pees and talks about rabbits.  It's so weird!  You can tell that not only was the director and the writer a man, but also the cinematographer, the director of photography, was also a man.  This is definitely filmed with, like, a man's point of view in mind. A lot of the shots, I felt, were dehumanizing to women and, like, kind of derogatory, and it's uncomfortable, and, like, you don't see that happen with the guys. Yeah, this is what in the film world we call the male gaze.  The captions, which there are captions, are full of random pound signs and like misspellings, a random period and letters at the end of words. This was from 2005.  We've had time to perfect them. Yeah.  Amazon.  Wanna talk about the editing? Ugh.  I would have edited this for free. I think editing would have changed it a little bit. It could have made it actually a little bit better and, like, not insufferable.  For sure.  But it was so bad, there are so many jump cuts that are very unnecessary. The problem with that is that the editor was a woman.  Wow.  If she's using clips that are entirely from the male perspective, it means that there are no other clips.  That's true. She did what she could with what she was given, but the thing about the jump cuts is that it would happen and the scene hasn't changed. London is talking to a character that Dane Cook plays that they never mention his name.  He, like, restarts their conversation, like, four times.  And we only think that he restarts it because they're jump cuts in the middle of this conversation that they're having.  So it feels like four completely separate starts to a conversation rather than just him being awkward and saying four separate things that have nothing to do with each other.  And I really don't know which one is worse. Yeah.  It also reeked of reality TV angles that it would, like, pan from one person to the next. If you wanted, like, an artsy independent movie about a moody guy, maybe don't shoot it like it's a reality television show. And there were a lot of zooms, which were, like, kind of weird.  Yeah. There were a lot of times where Syd and London would be arguing in a flashback, and the camera is zoomed in so close to Syd's face that you see nothing but Syd, even though London is the one that's talking and having a reaction to whatever Syd, whatever bullshit Syd has just spewed at her.  I don't... care about what Sid's face looks like.  He gets very angry when she, like, has lunch with a guy that she knows. For absolutely no reason, because it's not like he found proof that she was cheating, it's just she spoke to a man.  Yeah. She, you know, throws back at him that she would never even think of sleeping with this guy, and his initial reaction to that is, whoever should anything about this time.  And Lyndon's like, you implied it.  You heavily implied that that was what I was thinking about doing. The flashbacks in general i did not love.  they came in at random moments and didn't tell me anything i didn't already know. it may really makes me feel like hunter richards never took any kind of writing class.  he never went to film school.  the pacing is bad.  the scenes are not efficient in what they're trying to do.  they could be so much shorter yeah and then you could maybe flesh out the characters a little bit.  I'm sorry, but saying that somebody's impotent is not fleshing them out.  I'm an impotent man!  So Roger Ebert talks about in their review that the bathroom that they're in has dual mirrors, and we know that pretty much only because whenever Sid turns away from the mirror facing away from the camera and looks towards the camera, you can still see his face in the reflection behind him.  But you never see the cameraman.  Don't know how.  Did they put, like, a nanny cam in the bathroom and, like, miked everybody? They were trying to be artistic and edgy and cool, but it just gave me a headache. Bateman and Sid talk about sleeping with minors, and Bateman says something about going to Paris because, like, people sleep with, like, 16-year-olds there, and it's like, that doesn't make it okay. They made it so light, and I'm like, this is really uncomfortable. And then like they kept bringing it back with like how young Maya is and how young Kat Dennings' character is.  It's gross is what it is.  Yeah.  Bateman goes too long into too much detail about his S&M fantasies, but they're really not fantasies because they're like a reality for him.  It's not interesting. And they show the flashbacks for it and I'm like, I don't care. Just the way that Bateman talks about it and the way that the writing seems to view it really is not good. The director has a checklist of, like, controversial, edgy, fun things I want to include, and is like, sleeping with minors, check, and impotent, divorce, check, and S&M, check. Sid can't believe he wasn't invited to the party for his ex-girlfriend who he abused for, I assume, years. And he casually dropped in their conversation that they'd known each other since they were 10, which we hadn't learned until the end of the movie. It was not established until the end of the movie. So if he's treating her that way now, I mean, who knows how he had treated her for so many years before. The F word, which I'm only censoring now because I just don't want to put in the bleep.  It's gratuitous.  Yeah.  Are you crazy?  That was Mallory.  The F word does not make your movie edgy.  Again, check. Yeah.  Sid doesn't deserve Chris's arms.  They end an argument in a flashback with sex, and that's how we know that this was written by a guy.  Saying I hate you and then immediately kissing isn't cute.  That's uncomfortable. Like, yeah.  She didn't... want that. you can tell oh. and then he writes on her shoulder in a different flashback. he would not say the words i love you to her and she would say it frequently and she's like why can't you say it back to me?  it's eight letters.  he writes it on her shoulder while they're in bed. She can't even read it!  It's on her shoulder!  All the women that get high with Sid then lie to Becca about it for no good reason.  Why didn't she go up there to check?  That's a good question.  Because a dude wrote this movie!  Like, isn't that pretty normal?  Was that the only bathroom? Did no one else have to go to the bathroom?  I have a lot of questions. Bateman equates sex with self-worth and the will to live.  If you can't hack it, you are shit, my friend.  There are so many other things you could do in bed to pleasure a woman, and if your only option is penetration, then you're boring, you're basic, you're vanilla.  To some extent, somebody could make the argument that this is like the story of an addict from an addict's perspective, but that doesn't make it a good movie. There was, like, no redemption, and I always try to look for some redeeming quality in characters and humans, but... And the only one that's redeemed is London, and it's- she's only redeemed-.  the only reason she even needs to be redeemed is because Sid eventually does come out of the bathroom and asks her to, like, leave with him to go talk.  He makes a big enough scene that he basically coerces her into leaving with him because that's not abusive or bad.  and they have this like what is supposed to be emotional and heartfelt conversation in his car about how difficult it is to move on from each other because they just loved each other for so long even though he's never said it ever to her.  he takes her to the airport and she does go to LA like she has been planning to do all along.  And that's the only redemption arc that we get in this movie. I would have hated it a lot more if she did today. Oh yeah.  Those are all the cons.  Way more cons.  Our arbitrary rank was whether or not we liked the side characters and whether or not they redeemed the story.  Nothing redeemed the story except for London leaving.  There really weren't many characters in the No, and I think that's why it feels so long because it's taken up by so few people doing the same things with the same results and expecting different ones. You know what they call that? Yeah, I do.  Insanity.  Yeah.  I liked Becca.  And that was it. And we really didn't even see that much of her. The IMDb score was a 6.6.  I'm shocked.  Yeah, right?  Out of 10.  Who gave it that?  The Rotten Tomatoes score is a 3.28. Even that's too generous. Yeah, really, truly is.  This one's getting a 1.  There's nothing redeemable about this.  What's your score? A 1.  It's not good. No, it's not.  And the total cumulative score for London is 11.88.  And it actually is not the lowest one.  I'm so glad we rented this because I never, ever want to own this movie.  Ever. Not even worth the $4 that it cost to rent it. No.  Don't ever watch this movie if you love yourself.  Don't ever watch this movie even if you don't.  TMNT is next.  We're just getting into the comic book movies.  It's finally happening.  I want to watch The Nanny Diaries so badly, but it's so far away.

In case you missed it, ambulatory wheelchair users exist.  An ambulatory wheelchair user, sometimes called a part-time wheelchair user, is a wheelchair user with a limited ability to walk, or run, or dance, or climb, among so many other possible things.  As an ambulatory wheelchair user myself, I'm often asked, why would you use a wheelchair if you can walk?  The fact is, wheelchairs are not just for people with no mobility in their legs.  Wheelchairs are mobility aids for a variety of different disabilities.  People may need to use a wheelchair, whether manual or electric, due to chronic pain, fainting spells, lack of stability, dizziness, chronic fatigue, muscle, joint, or skin fragility.  Some people have occasional periods of paralysis.  They might have lung or heart conditions, and the list goes on.  Wheelchairs can also be used preventatively.  to prevent flare-ups or worsening symptoms.  A wheelchair user's abilities and limitations can vary greatly as well.  There can be time limitations, distance limitations, speed limitations.  It can depend on the type of activity.  Like, for example, some people may not have a problem at all walking but cannot stand still without triggering their symptoms.  And some people, vice versa.  That being said, being able to walk without a mobility aid does not equate to being able-bodied.  A personal example would be... If I needed to go out and didn't have my wheelchair, I would still need to park in the disabled parking space because maybe I can make it the 15 steps into a location and have a seat right away, but I wouldn't be able to make it any further than that.  My disability is a figurative timer on my legs.  So just because I may be able to walk a few feet into a location does not mean that I'm not disabled.  This misconception and lack of awareness for ambulatory wheelchair users largely comes from media representation and harmful tropes like the fake disability trope.  You know the one.  You've seen it numerous times where a wheelchair user gets out of a chair to reveal they were faking it all along.  But how many times in media have you seen a wheelchair user get out of their wheelchair and it be treated as a casual thing?  I promise you, not nearly as many times.  As rare as it is to see a disabled character in media, we see even less of the diversity of the disability community, and that is severely needed.  You can be an ally to ambulatory wheelchair users by confronting the falsehood when seen and rejecting stereotypical and harmful tropes.  If you see someone accusing or harassing someone for faking their disability because they got out of a wheelchair, don't be a bystander.  Ask them if they need help.  But most of all, don't be that person.  Don't harass disabled people just because you think they might be faking.  You are very likely to be wrong.  There's so much that the average person doesn't know about disability, and you risk harassing and traumatizing the very people that you claim to be protective of.  Thank you so much for listening.

I'm here in the Midlands, in the countryside, and I'm just about to visit Charlie Martin, who is an inspirational woman in sport.  She does surfing, she does snowboarding, but most importantly, she's really killing it in motorsports right now. I'm Charlie Martin.  I'm trans and racing driver, Virgo, ambidextrous, cat owner, graphic designer, pansexual, travel lover, ninja warrior, explorer. Hello.  Hey Al, how are you doing?  Good, how are you?  Yeah, you just come at the right time. Oh, good. You want to give me a hand? Sure, I'll just take off my glove. For sure, I've got a sponge for you.  Oh, perfect. What's going on with you at the moment then, Charlene, in terms of motorsports and race car driving? I'm just starting a... a really big moment in my career.  The journey to try and compete at Le Mans is something that I've been dreaming about for a long time.  That's going to be the focus of my life, I think, for the next three years.  So a lot of hard work, but it's great. Probably about 23.  I mean, I started my racing career quite late compared to a lot of people.  The year I finished university is actually the year that I bought my first race car. What was it that sort of drove you to begin racing? One of my best friends at school, his dad used to race and we'd go away at the weekends and we'd be camping, be right in the paddock.  And even just the smells of being that up close to the cars.  I think when you see racing on TV, it's one thing, but when you're actually there up close and you are surrounded by it, you're so immersed in that experience.  The light goes green, you build up your revs, you're all ready, drop the clutch, you're off.  There's nothing quite like it. You know, I think what makes motorsport more unique to some sport is that there's no gender division. Fundamentally, whether you're a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.  Women are achieving amazing things in motorsport.  You had Flick Haig, who made history last year, winning the British GT Championship.  It's the first woman to ever achieve an overall win. Flick Hay and Johnny Adam, they won the big British GT race in the Optimum Racing Aston Martin Vantage V12.  Fabulous win for both of them.  And what a day for the women in the United Kingdom.  Jamie Chadwick and Flick Hay showing that they can take it to the men. Women are proving quite clearly that they can compete on the same level as the guys.  It's really amazing to see and I think it's very inspiring for younger generations of drivers as well to see that. I think you mentioned that only about 10 to 15 percent of drivers are women. You have Drivers coming in at young ages, competing in karting, things like that.  I mean, really, the further you go up this pyramid, the fewer people you've got because people run out of money, people run out of backing.  It becomes harder to forge a career at those kinds of levels.  You're going to have fewer and fewer women.  If it is 10% to 15%, then, you know, let's try and get that 20%, 30%, 40%.  And then as you go up, you're naturally going to have it.  a higher proliferation of female drivers. Gender shouldn't really be an issue in motorsport, but as a trans woman, how has that affected your career? I nearly gave up motorsport altogether coming into transition, purely because I couldn't see any other role models.  I couldn't see anybody who looked like me in the sport, and I had no idea how I was going to be treated.  and that's really scary.  literally my career split midway with transition and prior to that my results were.  you know they were okay but if you look at everything that's happened since transition the confidence the self-belief that's just come from being able to be me and then you actually look at that in terms of physical results and successes.  i'm gonna i'll go and show you we're gonna have a look at the trophies because it kind of speaks volumes really. So this is quite an impressive collection I have to say and quite massive trophies as well. This shelf is pretty much everything that I won pre-transition.  When you just compare this It's like the most visual representation really of how transitioning has really unlocked my whole performance as an athlete.  The last six years have just been me taking control of my life.  And the way that's manifested itself in my career has just been nothing short of groundbreaking. Have you seen the video of the American woman at the petrol station in a Tesla? No.  It's like so amazing because there's some people behind videoing her and they're just absolutely pissing themselves laughing.  She gets out, I don't know, because like she's just, I don't know, I guess it's saying like the battery's low or something. I remember there being a very particular moment in my life where I had to sort of take the plunge and transition.  What was your catalyst in deciding to transition? I ended up in a really dark place where I really just lost all sense of my own identity.  I look in the mirror and I just think, I don't know who the hell I am anymore.  I got so depressed.  I was having a nervous breakdown and I was suicidal.  And to such an extent, I really was going to take my own life because I just couldn't see any way.  that I could resolve this.  that wasn't going to end in a lot of pain.  Thankfully I didn't.  I just realised actually there's only really one way out of this and that's transition.  Because I want to carry on living and To do anything else would have been crazy.  I'm very good at applying myself to something and if they say this is what I'm going to do, whatever that thing is, if it's a half marathon, a race, I'll do it and I'll just push myself to whatever limit I have to do to achieve that.  And I think once I'd said, okay, this is it, this is the only way forward, I'm doing this.  it did feel like a positive step.  I'd been running away from something my whole life and suddenly I was running towards the thing that I knew was the thing that I had to do.  And that in itself is a positive thing.","channel.id":"clxmi0mat00v7cdvio57tdapf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCsDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA","channel.name":"My Genderation","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/g864bFMBAXso_fkzd73ZmSXVmy9E2HHX__MiClzVA-IEppDPNVUpMVC4-dH8_O59GaGahuLOLg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Alastair Campbell is interviewing Charlie Martin, a trans racing driver, about her career and experiences in motorsports.

I played around with this idea for a while and I actually filmed a few different videos and it just didn't feel right.

Two, I'll be offering sort of voice or audio feedback.  You can send me recordings and I can give you feedback in the form of text or an audio file.  So for those of you who don't want to take private lessons, but still want feedback on how their voice is developing or where their voice is at, that would be perfect for you.  Three, I'm going to be having Patreon only live streams.  So I'll be playing piano and different instruments and taking questions and hanging out and demonstrating concepts on private streams for my supporters.  Four, this is super exciting.  I'm gonna offer a limited amount of people the freedom to have a 30 minute discussion with me about anything.  There's a private discussion.  We can discuss politics, religion, and we can discuss philosophy or voice or music or literally anything.  Okay.  So I look forward to that.  You can come and debate me or argue with me or hang out with me or anything.  Okay.  Um, and then lastly, something else I'm very excited for.  I'm going to offer people the ability to have a piece of music composed for them.  Okay.  And of course, lots of other really exciting things that I'm looking forward to.

In this video I demonstrate what you should expect to see when looking in the mouth during voice feminization. Hopefully this will help many individuals out there who are visual and kinesthetic learners rather than aural and verbal which most feminization content is geared towards.\n\nI am demonstrating the primary mechanics which elevate and raise your first resonance (R1). R1 is crucial to determining and expressing the sex of a voice. The male throat is significantly larger meaning it produces a lower R1. The female throat is smaller which produces a higher R1. In these techniques, the goal is to reduce the space in the throat and rear oral chamber.\n\nKey things to look for: 1) oropharyngeal closure, where the sides of the throat close inwards. 2) tongue alteration, where the root retracts, the middle-rear elevates, and the jaw slightly closes.\n\nWarning: this video is slightly weird and shows up close video of the inside of my mouth. Please don't be a creep. This was created for the sole purpose of educating and empowering individuals wishing to alter their voice.

This is something that I feel will be really beneficial for a lot of you out there who aren't so interested in the information but who still want to feminize their voice.  So let's take a look.  Alright, so first off, to feminize the voice, you have to raise your first resonance.  The first resonance is inversely related to the size of the throat.  So if the throat is very big, then the value of it will be very low in your sound.  And if the space of the throat is very tiny, then the R1 goes higher.  Now, in order to raise R1, we do several things.  We retract the root of the tongue, we elevate the root of the tongue, we squeeze the oropharynx and the larynx also raises, okay?  So I'm gonna show you now what that looks like when it occurs.  The two biggest things that you need to look for are one, the walls of my throat doing this, okay?  That is your oropharyngeal closure and it's very important to sounding female.  And then you'll also see that once I add the rest of the technique, the tongue actually elevates and comes back like that, okay?  So let's go ahead and look.  Ah, ah, heat from fire.  Now here's what it looks like when I do oropharyngeal closure by itself.  Oh, ah, oh, ah.  Now notice how the tongue then elevates after that.  Ah, heat from fire.  All right, so in full, voice feminization should look kind of like this.  Ah, ah, heat from fire.  And then I sound like that, okay?  And all I'm doing is maintaining something similar to that in the back of my mouth while I'm talking.  And that's what makes you sound female, because that space back there is being decreased by all of these techniques.  And as the space decreases, the resonances climb higher, which make you sound female, okay?  I hope this video is helpful for you all.

Superhero shows tend to have one of two tones.  They're either super gritty, dark, and serious. You missed me. Or they're still kind of serious, but the main hero has lots of quippy one-liners. I know Zoom sent you here to kill me.  Good news. You don't have to do that.  There's nothing wrong with either of these two tones.  Both of them can make for great shows.  But there's something that most superhero shows aren't doing, and that's allowing themselves to be as weird and fun as they can possibly be.  The exception to this is the CW show Legends of Tomorrow.  Using time travel as a key plot driver, Legends of Tomorrow is able to put its characters through some truly bizarre situations, like Vikings worshiping an Elmo-like toy called Bebo, or a unicorn murdering people at Woodstock.  And it's that weirdness that makes Legends of Tomorrow so great, especially because it acknowledges that weirdness and embraces it. We are all happy that there was only one dragon, right?  We don't want to be fighting werewolves in the Alamo.  Well, it would be good for our ratings. That's my mom.  And that's me.  We lived in D.C.  in 2018 before my brother was born.  Be so easy, Ray.  Just walk over there and tell her to get her family and go to Canada before everything changes.  Before this country that she worked so hard to become a citizen of betrays her.  Look at her, Ray.  How could anyone be afraid of her? Where's my  nipple?!  Because it's one thing for a show to be ridiculous and not be aware of it.  That's just painfully awkward for the viewer.  But Legends of Tomorrow knows that its strength is in its weirdness.  It's running with it and that gives it an edge that no other superhero show has.  However, it did take Legends of Tomorrow a couple seasons for it to find the right balance for that edge.  In the beginning, it was trying to be more like its sibling shows on the CW, Arrow, The Flash, and Supergirl.  It had humor, for sure, but it was more serious, more intense, and hadn't really found its groove yet. I'm from East London.  Oh.  And the future. The basic premise of the first season is that a guy by the name of Rip Hunter shows up in 2016 on his time ship and recruits a bunch of superheroes to help him save the world.  Rip says he's from the future and that someone called Vandal Savage is going to take over the world in 2166 unless they can stop him.  But the catch is the reason he chooses the initial eight heroes. I chose you all because a hundred years from now, your lives have a minimal effect on the recorded timeline. I'm sure you've heard of the butterfly effect?  Well, that's what Rip is trying to avoid.  Presumably, he's run some calculations and found that the timeline stays basically the same even without those eight people, which makes the title of the show, Legends of Tomorrow, kind of a jab at the characters themselves.  They're not legends.  In fact, they're basically the opposite of legends, because the timeline wouldn't even notice their absence.  Obviously, since they've gotten four seasons out of it, the main crew do end up having a pretty substantial impact on the timeline.  But the basic premise of the show, baked into the title itself, is that these aren't your typical superheroes.  They are nobodies who are trying to be legends, and that allows the show to go in a direction that wouldn't necessarily work for other superhero shows.  No one expects the Legends to be intense, crime-fighting superheroes, because that's not what they've ever been.  They're some people with interesting abilities trying to fix the timeline.  And in that way, it almost has a Doctor Who kind of vibe to it.  Obviously they're very different shows, but they both involve a leader with time in their title. I'm the Doctor.  I'm a Time Lord.  He's a Time Master of long standing. Who recruits people to join them on their time ship. It's called the TARDIS.  It can travel anywhere in time and space.  And it's mine.  It's called the Wave Rider.  It's been my ship for over a decade. So that they can go to different points in time and fix what's wrong. Still got a couple of floors to go, and if I know my history, that makes the date somewhere around... November 1st, 1930.  What do you guys say?  we get out of 1942? All the while cracking some jokes.  I don't think people really expect that kind of a tone from a superhero show, but that's what Legends of Tomorrow is, or at least what it started off as.  By season three, Rip is basically out of the picture working at the time bureau while Sarah Lance becomes the captain of the Wave Rider, and that season is where Legends of Tomorrow starts to play around with its plot and find its sweet spot.  A few other characters have left, and a few new ones have taken their places.  And the premise of this season is that the Legends are working under the Time Bureau to hunt down what they call anachronisms, basically errors in the timeline, and fix them.  This includes things like getting Caesar out of Aruba, getting Helen of Troy out of 1930s Hollywood, and preventing a telepathic gorilla named Grodd from killing the President.  Twice. Clearly you have some grievances.  Well, perhaps we can look for a common ground. In the end, the big finale fight is between Malice, the demon, and Bebo, the Elmo Furby toy of this universe.  Season 3 seemed like a testing ground for how weird they could get, and apparently it was a success, because Season 4 gets even weirder.  In this season, Rip is completely gone, and the show gets straight-up paranormal.  The plot for this season is that a bunch of demons have been released from Hell and scattered through time, and it's the Legends' job to track down these magical fugitives and send them back to Hell.  This plotline brings the legends all over the place, including to Woodstock, where they face off against a killer unicorn, the Salem Witch Trials, where they encounter a fairy godmother, and Paris 1927, where they encounter Ernest Hemingway and hunt down a minotaur. We have to go now!  I'll never surrender! I know all of that sounds like it doesn't fit into the same show, but with Legends, it just does.  They've mastered the art of taking the most out-there concepts and tackling them with humor.  If they tried to keep the gritty superhero archetype with these kinds of plots, it would be a mess.  But the characters know that this stuff is ridiculous and point it out regularly. Hello!  What in the Disney hell is this? Apparently, they're even aware of the crossovers between their show and the other CW superhero shows. Get in!  Any messages while we were gone?  You missed calls from Barry Allen, Oliver Queen, and Kara Zor-El.  Sounds like the annual crossover.  Yeah, that's gonna be a hard pass. They had a plot-based reason for missing the crossover in the fourth season, but I also have to believe that decision was partly made because the show has become so tonally different from Arrow, The Flash, or Supergirl.  While those three shows still have no problem mixing with each other once a season, the Legends at this point might as well be in a different universe.  Arrow, The Flash, and Supergirl tackle legitimately terrifying villains like, oh, nothing major, just the rise of a massive anti-immigrant movement.  that's clearly an allegory for white nationalism.  Meanwhile, the legends are over here at summer camp hunting down a monster called Astriga. Well, today's subject is wilderness survival, which includes tracking and orienteering.  Who's excited?  Well, you will be. And honestly, we need more shows like this.  TV doesn't need to keep getting grittier and grittier to be good.  You can make good things and still have them be funny and silly and wholesome.  I'd even argue that lots of people are in desperate need of that kind of feel-good content, partially because of the overwhelming deluge of dark content out there, but also because the world is a dark place, and we're constantly reminded of every bad aspect of it all day, every day.  Escapism isn't just about entering a fictional world to forget about the real world for a second.  It's also about experiencing joy and happiness in a world that often seems deprived of those things.  Also, it's just hilarious to see a giant blue stuffed animal fight a demon.  Plus, there's just a certain joy in a time travel show like Legends.  In every episode, you don't know what time period they're going to end up in.  And, being the dramatic folks they are, you know they're going to get in costume for that time period.  What? Why are you staring at me?  You know, I'm waiting for you to do the thing you do.  What thing?  You know, you usually send us into the field with a little more pizazz.  All right, legends, put on your Sunday best because we are going to church.  That's pretty good.  Amen.  Well, I hope you're feeling morally superior because we are getting our Puritan Puritan.  That was too much, right? That could be the Wild West in the 1800s, Chicago in the 1920s, London in 2166, North America in the year 1000, the Bahamas in the 1700s, or even the moon in 1970.  You can't get these kinds of dramatically different backdrops from any other kind of show.  That, mixed with the pure goofiness of Legends, means that you get a show that's really unlike any other.  Just don't come to this show hoping for the most coherent, thought-provoking plot.  I mean, their time travel logic itself is seriously broken.  There's an episode where most of the team is in the Bahamas in 1717, while Sarah is in present day 2018 on a date.  When some of them come back to the present, Sarah leaves her date and tells Zari, Zari, get this ship back in fighting shape, because until then... Rory and Amaya are on their own. The only problem is, there is no until then.  Those two events aren't happening at the same time.  Their friends are in the past.  The thing they're rushing to get to already happened.  They could wait ten minutes or ten months, and they could still travel back to the exact same time in 1717.  It would make no difference for Rory and Amaya.  But nope, apparently if they spend three hours in 2018, three hours have passed in 1717.  That makes no sense. For real, we've been going nonstop for the past six months. You don't have to be going nonstop.  You can time travel.  You could wait a hundred years and still time travel to the exact same time period when the aberration happens.  you quite literally have all the time in the world.  for the time travel logic to vaguely make sense, they've kind of introduced a whole new timeline that's separate from the regular universe, just for time travelers.  and from that time traveler timeline, you can affect any time on the regular timeline, but you can't time travel within the time traveler timeline.  This timeline exists within what the show calls the temporal zone, which is just a space where their ship can fly through without being in any particular time period.  And so if someone messes something up in present time on the Time Traveler timeline, but in 1940 on the regular timeline, and that screw-up makes it so that none of the legends are born, they have to act quickly to fix it.  because those changes happened in the present on the Time Traveler timeline, and within a certain amount of time will ripple throughout the temporal zone and erase them from existence.  Are you confused?  Because so am I. Does it make the most sense?  Not really.  But hey, time travel stuff never really makes sense, and these plot devices lend themselves well to the drama of a TV show.  They only have a couple other rules, one of them being that once they've gone back to a specific time, they can't go back again to that exact time and interact with their past selves because it would break the timeline or something.  I guess that helps their actions seem more meaningful because you know they can't really go back and correct any mistakes, but it's not much.  Their other time travel rule, don't try to save your loved ones and change the timeline, is messed with pretty much constantly. But while you were all saving Einstein, Sarah was off on her own secret side mission to kill Laurel's killer in the past.  And I suppose you never thought about saving your fianc\u00e9.  Yeah, of course I did, but I never did it because it's against the rules.  What rules?  We're not Time Masters.  There are no rules. That's not to say that Legends is mindless, though.  I think there's a strength in those kinds of shows as well, when they have so little plot that you can turn off your mind and just relax for a bit.  But while Legends is weird and silly, I wouldn't describe it as mindless or bad.  It's just captivating in a different way.  It makes you care about the characters not because they're brooding and intense, but because they're funny and real.  Legends of Tomorrow does have its touching and emotional moments.  Like Zari teaching Mick about Ramadan.  Or Ava, who is a clone and therefore never had a childhood, getting to transform back into a kid and have her first kiss.  Or Sarah helping a lesbian from the 1950s accept that she's okay just the way she is.  Or Mick coming to terms with his daddy issues.  Or Nate coming to terms with his daddy issues.  Or Amaya reconnecting with her ancestors.  Or Zari realizing that she can't save her family. Legends is the goofier of the Arrowverse shows, but it's genuine and heartfelt too, and it strikes a good balance between those things.  On top of all of that, Legends of Tomorrow isn't afraid of having queer characters, like so many other shows are.  Sarah, the captain in the later seasons, openly has relationships with men and women.  When John Constantine becomes a regular in season 4, we learn that he's also had relationships with men and women.  And in fact, his relationship with a man becomes one of the major plot points because of what he does to try and save the guy he loves. I begged Ez to run.  I knew that Nero would use him against me.  The bloody fool didn't listen. Legends of Tomorrow knows that not everyone in the world is straight, and it's not afraid to have its show depict that.  Ava, Sarah's girlfriend, is obviously attracted to women, and she also makes this iconic U-Hauling in Subaru joke, which is how you know.  this show is nailing the realistic queer representation.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that was stupid. You just got back into town and here I am hitching the old U-Haul to the back of the Subaru.  It was stupid.  No, no.  Hey. And Gary, a side character who's become more of a series regular, is shown to be attracted to men.  One more question.  Are you sure that I'm a virgin? Because that thing we did... Positive, mate. So many major TV shows shy away from having openly queer characters, or they might just have one token gay character.  For Legends to have multiple queer main characters is huge.  There is not a lot of queer representation on TV, especially bisexual representation, and especially not in superhero shows.  Having Sarah and Constantine just be themselves in Legends means the world to a lot of people watching this show.  Especially because the show isn't about their sexuality.  It's not a coming out story, it's just who they are.  Because you don't need a reason for a character to be queer.  Sometimes people just are that way, and yet so many shows don't have the courage to do what Legends does with ease.  It's all of this together that makes Legends of Tomorrow, in my opinion, the best superhero show on TV right now.  It's weird, it's fun, it's entertaining, it's telling stories that nobody else is telling.  What more could you ask for?  And even though the fourth season is coming to an end soon, it's already been renewed for a fifth season, which means there's a whole lot more wackiness still to come.

And once I realized that work had given me first depression and then debilitating anxiety to the tune of not one but two trips to accident and emergency, And constant panic attacks just from getting the bus to work, not even at work.  I realised that I maybe couldn't survive being a barista that much longer.  And so I had a dream.  I had a dream that I would be able to replace zero hour contracts and numb feet with a salaried white collar office job.  As I was applying for all these corporate marketing jobs, I did sometimes think about what 18 year old me would think of that.  she would hate me but at the same time she'd never had to financially support herself fucking snowflake.  I chased my dream for a while and I could not for the life of me get one of those cushy office jobs that I so coveted.  and there's no way of knowing of course what factors went into each individual rejection that I got.  Was it because the job market's just tough and competitive, especially for millennials with no experience?  Or was it that I am a dumb piece of shit and I deserve to be poor?  Like, this isn't the kind of post-interview feedback that most employers are willing to give.  So I continued to do what I was doing, juggling a ton of different part-time things, really precarious barista work, one ridiculously exploitative marketing internship, one four-hour-a-week social media job, and coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee.  And all through that, I was doing a... what do the kids call it?  I was doing a side hustle, so I was writing and making videos, and eventually I started selling things to other writers.  First, my book, How to Book, turned up the heat a little bit, And then my product, the plot embryo, but on a piece of paper.  And then I started selling people phone calls where I yelled at them about theme.  And then I started asking for money from people who would be sad if I died and stopped making videos.  And before I knew it, the combination of all those things had become my entire job.  I was sitting in a boiling pot of, oh shit, I'm a hashtag girl boss, hashtag entrepreneur.  Part two.  Entrepreneurial content.  My work as a self-employed something has been the majority of my work for a handful of years now.  And if you don't count a few months of coffee shifts in between my Creative Scotland funding and launching my Patreon, I've been full-time self-employed running my own business for one or two years now.  And do you want to know what I did as a barista turned entrepreneur living under the poverty line?  I started consuming all the business content for free that I could get my hands on.  I was eating business advice for breakfast, digital course strategy for lunch and YouTube content marketing for dinner.  One thing you'll learn if you study business and marketing online is that there are some real creeps doing some real sleazy shit out there.  Many years ago, I was listening to a business podcast by a guy called David Siteman Garland, who's this big online marketing business guy.  And he was talking about how to attract the right customers and clients.  And he was saying that you don't want to attract people with a scarcity mindset because they're never going to buy from you.  So you want to attract people with an abundance mindset, people who are, who aren't afraid to invest in themselves, in their learning and their development and making more money.  Yeah.  In theory, that makes sense, right?  You don't want to attract people to your business who are never going to buy from you.  But look, Dave, If you want to say market to rich people, then just say that, man.  Like, you can cloak it in this language of money mindset all you want, but the fact is that people's material circumstances affect or even determines their mindset about money.  People in poverty have a scarcity mindset because their resources and money are literally scarce.  They're not making it up.  They're not crazy.  They're not imagining it.  They literally don't have everything they need to survive and to thrive.  And yeah, let's praise people for having an abundance mindset, AKA having grown up with enough money that they've never had to worry about their survival or their resources running out.  Bam!  Nailed it.  Fuck you, Dave.  So he was basically saying market to rich people or to people who started to think like rich people.  So I switched off the podcast and I went and took a shower and I tried to scrub the idea of scarcity mindset off my body.  But I continued to consume business advice and content over the years, and I just started avoiding anything like that, which kind of made me feel gross.  But this idea of money mindset didn't go away.  It actually started showing up in lots of other people's content as well, in much more subtle ways, in ways that actually sounded quite reasonable, and ways that I actually started agreeing with and taking on board.  Part three, money mindset.  I actually do believe in the power of mindset, in the power of beliefs.  It's the core tenet of the plot embryo and I use that structure for all of my story creation, it's what I teach to writers, but I also think that structure applies to how people grow and flourish in real life.  Character development and self-development both come from changes in belief, from Realising and ridding ourselves of false beliefs about ourselves or about the world that are holding us back and replacing those with truths about the world or about ourselves, which can help us navigate unfamiliar situations and flourish.  I really do believe that changing your mindset can change your life.  And all this entrepreneurial business content that I was taking in was telling me that if I wanted to make money, I had to change my negative associations and beliefs about money because they were holding me back.  Here are the types of unhelpful money mindsets that people would bring up.  Money is the root of all evil.  Marketing is just lying for money.  Marketing isn't lying.  It's actually getting your product in front of the people who need it the most.  So it's actually a public service.  It's unfair to charge a lot for our work.  Only greedy people have lots of money.  And because you're not greedy, you'll never have a lot of money.  The rich are lizard people and we should eat them.  And yeah, sure, you can see how these sorts of beliefs would start to affect you as a business owner.  I mean, they would affect everyone.  But when you're in employment, your ability to negotiate for your pay is like pretty limited.  Whereas when you're a business owner, you literally decide the value of your work.  And sure, you can see how if you feel like you don't have enough money and you want to make more, but you have this subconscious belief that money is evil on some level, then that's going to result in a kind of subconscious self-sabotage where it's going to push you to make decisions which actually stop you from achieving what you want, which is more money.  And obviously it's not evil to have enough money to survive or even to be comfortable.  And I can directly see how some of these negative money mindsets have directly affected my own life and business.  If I think that me and my work are worth a teaspoon of dog shit, and I charge people a teaspoon of dog shit, then I end up with a teaspoon of dog shit.  And it's pretty well documented at this point that women and other marginalised groups are much more likely to measure the value of their work in teaspoons of dog shit, and straight white cis men are much more likely to measure the value of their work in, say, solid gold dicks.  Case in point, I was so uncomfortable with the idea of charging money for my work in the beginning that I released my first ever non-fiction book, Pay What You Want, and so tons of people downloaded it for free before I even set a $1 minimum price.  But I also wanted to be paid in solid gold dicks, so I started trying to change my beliefs about money.  Part four.  Things get uncomfortable.  There are lots of different ways to change your mindset and beliefs.  Life experiences that you have will change your mindset.  You can do it consciously through practice and repetition and affirmations, things like that.  And there's this little thing that we like to call reason, logic, arguments, persuasion, and a lot of the arguments that business coaches would use for why It's okay to make a lot of money if that's what you want to do.  It's okay.  We're starting to make me a little bit uncomfortable.  And I couldn't really put my finger on why.  I felt like I had to accept these arguments.  After all, these people were making money and I wasn't, and I wanted to be, so they had to be right, right?  And it seemed like if I didn't take their advice, my business would fail.  My only tangible alternative to that was to go back to being a barista.  And I knew that either I couldn't physically survive that or I really didn't want to do it.  It was one of those two things.  But still, I kept struggling with the ethics of changing my beliefs about money.  on the one hand, really wanted more money, and on the other hand, I really wanted to stick Jeff Bezos into an extra large Amazon, actually not extra large, medium to small Amazon cardboard box and just have him pee into bottles for the rest of his life.  So, you know, cognitive dissonance was happening.  Was the only way to make more money the same reasoning and tactics that rich people used?  Was it okay to use those tactics even if I was just doing it to get myself above the poverty line, to find some stability, to meet my basic needs?  And then what happened once I got there?  Like if I continued to use them after that?  What happened if I started making more money than I actually knew I needed?  At what point did I become one of those bad people I didn't like?  Was the only thing holding me back from financial stability or even success really my mindset?  What about the economy?  What about bad working conditions?  What about zero-hour contracts and stagnating wages?  My mindset wasn't going to change any of those things.  So was my poverty my fault or not?  part 5. and then I met the goddess Peter fucking coffin.  I watched their very important documentary on self-help which is a fucking masterpiece and you should fucking watch it bitch.  if you found anything that I spoke about in this video interesting at all then you will definitely get a lot out of that video so I do recommend checking it out.  it will be in the description below.  Peter was hitting on exactly why I was so uncomfortable training my brain into this new money mindset.  Because every one of these entrepreneurs was making the same underlying assumption in every video, in every podcast, in every blog post.  Unspoken, underneath the surface, but ironclad.  They seemed like they were saying, this is how to succeed in life.  This is how to get what you want.  But what they were actually saying is, This is how to succeed under capitalism.  And that is our only option, you fucking idiot.  And this was a game changer for me.  This was an epiphany.  This was a revelation.  It was a moment.  And being able to separate the techniques, the mindset shifts, the success formulas, the business blueprints from that underlying assumption was key.  Now, every time I come across a piece of business advice saying you gotta do X, I'd be able to preface it in my head with, when living under the hellscape of capitalism, do X. It allowed me to separate my beliefs and ideas about the capitalist system that we live under.  It's bad and you shouldn't do it.  And what I have to do to survive under it for now.  Charge decent fucking money for your labour, you doofus.  And there's no real answer to the question of do I need to run a business to survive under capitalism at the moment.  Sure, to me right now, it feels like my only viable option, but I've no way of objectively verifying that.  I tried to break into other kinds of work, into white collar work, and it felt like it was never really going to happen for me.  But you could just as easily tell me that I didn't try hard enough, or I didn't try for long enough, that I should have just kept trying.  And believe me, members of my family have made those sentiments clear to me.  And for me, stressful, precarious work as a business owner with zero savings and zero buffer is still preferable to stressful, precarious work as a barista with basically no enforced working rights and doing that all for someone else.  So for now, I am a business owner.  I brand myself.  I do content marketing.  I strategise.  I actively try to sell things to make money.  I try to sell things to you, in fact.  And I try to do that as best I can in our current trash system without using business tactics that make me want to throw up in my mouth.  And I'm anti-capitalist.  And here's your ad hominem low blow of the day.  I don't think you need to look further than the avatars of capitalism in 2019.  Trump, Theresa May, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos.  to see that it's a swamp of steaming garbage that will suck us all under if we let it.  I don't think you have to look further than that, but if you do want to look further than that, I have linked a bunch of videos for you in the description below.  And these two interests, being a business owner, being an anti-capitalist, they are in conflict.  If we dismantle capitalism, my business goes with it.  And the idea of relinquishing something that I've put so much of my heart and soul and my labour into is complicated.  And if I was making enough money from my business that I was substantially better off than the average person, I'm sure the emotions around that would be even more complicated.  But I'm ready to give it up.  What I and all of us would gain from an alternative to capitalism cannot be compared to my business.  Literally created under the pressure to survive.  I'm living off my business right now, and I'm going to continue to sell things and to build on that for as long as I have to.  the second that we get off our asses long enough to dismantle our current capitalist dystopia which we can do if we feel like it we can actually do that.  i will be very happy to burn my business with it and that my friends is how i became an anti-capitalist business owner.  to be to.  You fucked it just at the end, Rachel!  On the finish line!  I'm gonna alienate the entire... Right, time for a cake break.  ...online business community.  That's cool.  That's what I like to do.  But look, Dave!  Dave!  Listen!  Maybe if you could just remember the rest of the line, that would be great.  Hashtag work it, girl.  Hashtag let's get this bread.  Hashtag if you can dream it, you can be it.  There's nothing in this cup, Rachel.  It's a prop.  You just tried to drink out of a prop.  Link to a bunch of descriptions in the video below.  Oh my god, why is this so hard?  It's also a real mug.  It doesn't just exist to be a prop.  Yes!  Okay, now we just need a booty.  Fuck you!  First time I get this line right.  There's a fucking siren.  Oh, she's gonna sneeze!  Oh, just fucking sneeze!  This is like ASMR.  Oh, you piece of shit!  Capitalism is bad.  What a funny situation to happen.  And maybe we should not.  We will do our best to reframe.  It's never going to quite be the same, is it?  Just let me hold you.  Yeah, your microphone.  Oh, honey.  Oh, look, I'm up close.

Dan Harmon created Rick and Morty, but you may or may not know that he also created the Plot Embryo, hallowed be the universal pattern linked in our descriptions and our hearts, the story creation tool that he and all his writers use to craft every episode.  If you're new to me and my channel, you might not know that helping writers tell incredible stories using the Plot Embryo is actually my full-time job.  The plot embryo is a crazy powerful storytelling tool but it can be a little bit tricky to get the hang of in the beginning.  So let's break down an episode of Rick and Morty so that you can see how the plot embryo works in action.  And today we're going to analyse Total Rickall.  And as always, spoiler warning, the entire point of this video is to spoil the whole plot of this episode, so you've been warned. So let's take a quick look at the quadrants for this plot embryo.  In the comfort zone, so that familiar realm, we have normal family life.  And in the conflict zone, so the unfamiliar, we have the parasite quarantine.  And if we look at the internal quadrants, so this is where the theme of the story is housed, we have the before states, so we have the Smiths.  don't know who real family is.  And then we have the after, the realisation that real family have ugly memories of each other.  So the protagonist of this episode is really the entire family as a whole.  At plot point one, we have the backstory from a previous episode that Rick's carelessness infects the family with parasites.  We drop in on the family in their comfort zone at a family dinner. If you also didn't notice that Rick was actually the one that brought in the parasites in a previous episode, put space hygiene in the comments. At plot point two, Rick reveals that Uncle Steve is actually an alien parasite who has created fake memories to infiltrate the family and multiply.  They must eliminate the parasites to stop them from taking over the world. I've known him my whole life. No, you haven't, Jerry.  These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories and then they use those to multiply and spread out and take over planets. At plot point three, Rick quarantines the house with blast shields to stop anyone getting in or out. Six, Morty. There's supposed to be six of us.  If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real. At plot point four, the parasites continue to multiply and they have no way of knowing who's real family and who's a parasite.  The parasites gang up on Rick to convince everyone that he's a parasite and they all prepare to kill him. Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?  Maybe. I'm your father. Oh, are you, dad?  Are you? At plot point five, Morty realises that the parasites only create happy, positive memories.  Rick must be real because Morty's memories of him are messy and ugly. You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, we all remember you as a friend.  Oh, really?  Well, I remember you as a whiny little piece of shit, Morty.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah!  I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb little ass and about six of them are pleasant.  The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favour and pull the trigger!  Do it!  Do it, motherfucker!  Pull the fucking trigger!  What the hell?  I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories! I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you! Having realised this, they start killing off the parasites.  Everybody remain calm!  This is gonna take some explaining! We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly! Who's got a bad memory about Mrs Refrigerator? At plot point six, everyone is forced to relive their worst memories of each other to verify that they're real family, and to kill a bunch of fake family that they have fond, happy memories of. Mom, are you driving me to... Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's wet time.  Oh, my God, are you drunk?  Nobody.  my wife, coach. You're what? Oh, God!  Oh, my God, sweetheart, are you okay?  I didn't mean to... I'm gonna have a bruise!  It's picture day!  It's not.  Don't overreact. I can clean up. I want the police to take me! Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem. Thank you, sweetie. Come on, man.  Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip?  Come on, Pencilvester.  Give me anything. Rick, I'm Pencilvester.  Listen to that name. You can't kill me.  You're right.  Kill Pencilvester.  I have a plan.  If we can get to my boat, there's a... No. No! Just send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary.  Whoa!  What the hell? Look out for that homeless guy!  Open the door!  Open the door!  Open the door!  There isn't time!  Just run!  At plot point seven, they've destroyed all the parasites and Rick puts down the blast shields.  At plot point eight, back at dinner, Rick sets some new space hygiene rules. From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space.  That goes for everyone. They have to live together in depressing reality after losing their fake perfect family.  Rick says it's worth it to know that they're real. This is depressing.  We killed every good person in the house.  We're.  what's left?  What a family. At least we're real, Jerry.  We're real.  Rikki-tikki-tavi! Beth shoots Mr.  Poopybutthole, but he turns out to be real somehow and is now part of the family. But what's the deal with Mr.  Poopybuttle?  So the twist ending with Mr.  PBH inspired a tonne of speculation about what it meant.  Is he a parasite?  Is he not?  If not, then how did he insinuate himself into the intro credits of this episode?  How did he appear spontaneously in this episode and create all of these apparently real memories with the family?  The end of this episode, rather than answering questions about Mr.  PBH, actually opens up more of them.  So how does this fit in with the structure of the episode?  There are a few clues throughout the episode, which foreshadow the fact that Mr.  PBH is not just a parasite like the others.  One, he's inserted retroactively into the intro sequence.  Number two, the fake memories that the parasites create can only be negative up until the point where the parasite arrives.  But in this memory, Mr.  PBH is there throughout all of it through the negative part with the family up until cousin Nikki arrives and it becomes positive.  Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, shame me.  At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose. Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine. I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be. Ha-ha!  Somebody call for repairs?  Oh, yeah!  Cousin Nicky!  It's me, Cousin Nicky.  I'm walking here.  So, if he's not just another parasite, what is Mr.  PBH?  How did he end up in the family?  And why, later on, can he directly narrate to the audience, breaking the fourth wall?  Well, here's what Dan Harmon had to say on it in interview.  I'll give you another theory.  How about Mr.  Poopybutthole, just as where there's flies, there's spiders, wherever these parasites start blooming, Mr.  Poopybutthole is a different species who is more benign or more advanced.  He subsists on lives in the way that a hermit crab steals other shells.  Maybe Mr.  Poopybutthole takes advantage of the holes put in your memory and kind of burrows into those pre-existing holes.  So he shows up where these parasites are and he's more of a fourth dimensional phantom species that isn't bound by space and only appears in concentrations of temporal malfunction or misperception and breakdown.  Mr.  Poopybutthole is insinuating himself into the universe regardless of timeline and the same powers that allow him to do that allow him to directly talk with the audience.  So what does all this mean for the structure of the episode?  Does it mean that this episode doesn't have a proper ending or that it doesn't properly fit the plot embryo structure?  Well, no.  Not to me at least.  Mr PBH's storyline is part of its own running subplot rather than part of the main plot of the episode.  Dan has talked about the episodic nature of his work, about how he wants each episode to be fun and satisfying in its own right, even if you haven't seen the rest of the show.  But there are still serialized plot lines which connect between episodes and Mr.  PBH is a great example of that.  So Total Recall tells the complete story of the normal parasites and how the family deals with them, but also starts this new story of Mr.  PBH and his interactions with the family.  And that is how Total Recall's plot embryo works.  Now, of course, I don't have access to the original plot embryo that they used to create this episode, but this is my best interpretation, you might say, kind of reverse engineered from the finished episode.  Let me know in the comments which episode you would like to see broken down next.  Every episode of Rick and Morty really is a testament to the amazing creativity that's possible when telling stories using the plot embryo method.  That's why I personally love the show so much and why I've dedicated years of my life at this point to exploring the depths of the plot embryo and teaching what I've learned to others.  If you find yourself lost and floundering when it comes to trying to shape your own stories, then I created the Story Magic Academy for you.  In it, I share my complete system to generate that first seed of a story idea and turn it all the way into a complete plot embryo.  ready to write.  In it I share all my best secrets and tips for getting the most out of the plot embryo framework and really making the story creation process clear, practical and gratifying.  So here's what to do next.  If you're watching this video pretty soon after I uploaded it then the enrolment for Story Magic Academy is open now.  so follow the link in the description below to join us before enrolment closes really soon.  If you're watching this sometime in the future, the Academy might already be in session, but you can still follow that same link to sign up to be notified the next time enrollment opens.  Okay, that's everything.  Don't forget to rate me five stars as your Uber driver and do the thing that everyone asks you to do at the end of every YouTube video.  And I will leave you with my favorite line from this episode.  Sorry, Jerry.  We're real. I'm a parasite. Yeah, but you're real.  That was all right.  If you're watching this sometime in the future, blah blah blah.  You're fucked.  Last two.  Doo doo.  Isn't this unnecessary?  I kind of just made the point. Yeah, well, you're concluding.  I guess. Concluding is just your summary that you just said, which is a very quick thing.  Yeah, I guess so.  Also, thanks for explaining what concluding means.  This fucking fly just keeps, like, going back through the camera.  Go, my child.  Leave us.  Leave us in peace.  Begone.  Just so you know, there's gonna be spoilers in this video, so get fucked, son.  Was that a sneeze?  Oh my god.  Ah, it's worse.  I'm scared.

The Plot Embryo consists of quadrants: comfort zone, conflict zone, internal quadrants (before and after states), and external quadrants (plot points). \n\nIn the episode \"Total Rickall,\" the comfort zone is normal family life, while the conflict zone is the parasite quarantine. The internal quadrants show the Smith family's before state, unsure of who's real family, and the after state, realizing real family has ugly memories. The protagonist is the entire family.\n\nThe episode's plot points are as follows: \n\n1. Rick's carelessness infects the family with parasites.\n2. Rick reveals Uncle Steve is an alien parasite.\n3. Rick quarantines the house to stop the parasites.\n4. The parasites multiply, and the family prepares to kill Rick.\n5. Morty realizes parasites create happy memories, and Rick must be real.\n6. The family kills off parasites by reliving their worst memories.\n7. They destroy all parasites, and Rick puts down the blast shields.\n8. Rick sets new space hygiene rules.\n\nThe episode's twist ending features Mr. Poopybutthole, who appears to be a parasite but is later revealed to be a different species. His storyline is a running subplot, connecting to future episodes. The Plot Embryo structure is not disrupted by Mr. Poopybutthole's storyline, but rather, it's a part of the episode's serialized plot lines.\n\nThe creator of the Story Magic Academy, a system for generating story ideas and turning them into complete plots, discusses how the Plot Embryo can be used to create engaging stories.

I've spent a lifetime swinging backwards and forwards to what I perceive to be female behaviour and to extreme male behaviour.  And I toyed with the idea in the 80s and the 90s.  I hadn't done anything about it.  I think the key moment was when my identical twin became ill with cancer.  And he said, look, you've got to be yourself.  Otherwise, you're going to drive yourself insane.  Which was quite a revelation at the time, because he was always... ambiguous about me.  It wasn't the fact that he was anti-trans, he knew trans people, it was the fact that when he saw me it was like seeing himself and that sort of psychologically threw him.  I think the major issue in my own life I've been finding ways to cope with being trans all those years.  Especially when I was younger and a different age, you felt like it was perverse and you were doing something wrong.  And that's not right.  It's not right at all.  What has kept me sane throughout my life is my art.  And that has been important to me.  It's provided an avenue, almost a therapy.  My interaction with healthcare professionals have been very, very mixed.  My biggest complaint is the different methods of referral.  For example, one person was referred to an endocrinologist and got prescribed hormones fairly quickly.  Another person I know had a GP, prescribed hormones.  I had to wait, and so I got to Chynecross Gender Identity Clinic which was quite a long time to wait, because I had to see two independent psychiatrists within Wales before they would consider even referring me, and then I waited 12 months.  to get my first appointment at Charing Cross.  When I was finally diagnosed as gender dysphoric and they could see I was serious and had all this medication prescribed.  If you understand NHS Wales, because there's no trans services in Wales, they have to contract the job out, so to speak, to Charing Cross in London, the gender identity clinic.  And I came back with all this medication I was supposed to be having.  I went to see my GP and he turned around and said, oh, you've got to pay for this.  I said, pardon, do you realise that I'm gender dysphoric and I need this medication?  and now you're telling me I've got to pay for this?  Like, it's a choice I've made.  It's not a choice, it's something.  if I don't do it, it's going to drive me insane.  Fortunately, it was a group practice, so I just went in and saw another GP and then he looked at the stuff, looked at my history and said, well, no, that's absolute nonsense.  And I've heard a lot of stories about GPs being obstructive or not helpful or not understanding.  I find not necessarily obstruction, but a lack of understanding and a lack of urgency.  It's like you're not physically unwell, so you can wait, you know.  Once you've paid rent and bills and financial commitments and you're on a minimum wage, to actually try and transition takes some doing, you know.  The time I realised that if I didn't transition then something serious would happen to me and my moods were becoming blacker and blacker and blacker.  I saw a light at the end of the tunnel in being able to transition.  so I'd waited a long time to actually come to that decision and then when I actually came to the decision and wanted to do something about it then I'm waiting longer still to make my experience more positive and more effective.  it would be nice to be listened to straight away and taken seriously straight away and I can understand there's a need for evaluation and there's a need for assessments but my god it needs to happen a lot quicker than it is because the longer it takes the more it's like you're on tenterhooks.  you're waiting on this edge to actually validate yourself.  It's like your whole life is on hold.  It would be unrealistic to expect every GP to know the ins and outs of trans care and trans issues.  But what they need to do is listen to you and take it seriously.","channel.id":"clxmi0mat00v7cdvio57tdapf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCsDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA","channel.name":"My Genderation","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/g864bFMBAXso_fkzd73ZmSXVmy9E2HHX__MiClzVA-IEppDPNVUpMVC4-dH8_O59GaGahuLOLg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I'm Annabel, a 40-year-old artist who identifies as female.

No, I've never seen a whale.  I'm so excited.  Whales are, like, way too big, and it kind of freaks me out, but I'm excited.

Thanks to the tablets, likely.  One kid did get seasick, and they vomited.  Someone puked all over the place.  Everywhere.  And then they get a bucket, and they just put it into the ocean, and thought, we want to bring it back up. Yeah, that's all I had for you guys today.  We went to see some whales.

The position of the larynx can be altered through various muscle groups. When the larynx is raised, the vocal folds are positioned closer to the lips, which shortens the overall vocal tract length and shifts the resonances higher (creates a brighter sound). When the larynx lowers, the vocal tract extends, shifting the resonances lower (darker sound). It\u2019s essential to use a higher larynx position when seeking to pass with a female voice.\n\n-General Ideology\nThere are several ways to approach learning to alter the larynx height. Most of the best solutions all use a variation of Noise + Filter in order to hear the resonance more clearly, then trying to speak or sing using the filter setting. In the video and link there is simple infographics and audio examples to help walk you through it. The goal, at first, should be to gain control of this variable then integrate it into the process of speech once it\u2019s properly heard, controlled, and executed.\n\n-Common Issues:\n1. Flipping into falsetto immediately\n2. Altering towards a more forward tongue position instead of raising the larynx. \n3. Raising too high and getting a choked or \u201cfluttery\u201d sound\n4. Tensing the neck muscles instead of allowing the correct muscles to perform the motion\n5. Squeezing the vocal folds too hard\n6. Not listening\n\n\nI hope this is helpful for many of you out there! I\u2019ve seen so much confusion and struggle relating to the larynx so I hope this can illuminate some confusion. There is a lot more to know, explore, and fully digest but I wanted to keep this first video simple, clear, and easy to follow. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments below. Part 2 will contain advanced info, more ear training, and spectral data!\n\nwarmly,\nAmelia Zheanna H.\n\nLove my videos? Consider supporting me on patreon!

It's Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video we'll be learning all about the larynx.  We'll be discussing it in several parts.  First, basic knowledge, then we'll be listening to it, then I will walk you through it and I'll teach you how to raise your larynx.  We'll go over common issues and then we'll start to wrap up, okay?  I strongly recommend watching the previous Art of Voice Feminization video if you haven't.  It will be a very important primer to this process.  And so, yes, without further ado, let's get started.  The larynx is a muscular mucosal chamber.  in which your vocal folds reside in.  The position of the larynx can be altered through various muscle groups.  When the larynx is raised, the vocal folds are positioned closer to the lips, which shrinks the overall length of the vocal tract, which makes it sound a lot brighter and more feminine.  when the larynx lowers the vocal tract extends and the resonances shift a lot lower and so it sounds a lot more masculine and dark.  okay let's go ahead and listen to some examples of larynx alteration.  um okay so this is like with absolutely nothing going on.  It's a little hard for me to maintain, but this is with nothing. And now I'm going to slowly lower the larynx, right?  And you can hear how it's much darker.  It's kind of puffier.  It's goofy sounding.  It sounds a lot like the typical dunce voice, like, uh, duh. Like that kind of thing, right?  Now let's listen to the sound of a raised larynx.  I'm gonna start here, and then I'm just going to slowly start to raise the larynx until I'm all the way up here.  And you can hear that when I raise the larynx, the sound gets a lot brighter.  It sounds a lot brassier, kind of more metallic and sort of crisper.  Now I'm gonna speak and I'll shift from low to high, low to high. Um, okay, so here I am, I'm speaking, and I'm just going to slowly start to shift the vocal tract resonances, and I'm going to lower the larynx.  And in fact, if you look carefully, you can even see this as I'm slowly doing it, right? And so it's getting brighter and brighter, and then I'm going to, I'm all the way at the top now, and then I'm just going to slowly start to lower it again.  Right, so you can hear that, and you can see that very clearly.  I'll give you another demonstration of it, okay? Um, okay, so... So first off, you have to understand something before we get into this.  And that is every single sound that ever enters your vocal tract gets influenced by your resonance.  It doesn't matter what it is.  Mechanical toothbrush.  If it's noise.  anything that goes in there sound wise gets affected by your resonance.  And that is absolutely true of your breath.  Okay.  So the breath is the easiest way for you to learn how to alter your larynx height, breath or noise, which I would recommend.  So first off, I just want you to mimic me and listen very carefully and do what I do.  Okay.  Okay.  Your turn.  Okay.  Good.  And now try and do this.  Okay.  Did you manage to get that?  I'll do it again.  You can hear it.  kind of sounds like I'm saying ha, right?  That's what you want it to say.  You don't want it to be he or he or none of that.  It must be work up slowly.  okay now what you're hearing there is your actual resonance.  okay because your air is just a flat noise signal and when it gets passed through your resonant chamber you can hear the sound of the chamber better than you can when you're actually producing a pitch.  okay so i want you to try this again.  you know think like a vampire sound like this.  okay That is actually optimal resonance for what you're trying to do.  At least stuff back here.  We can still control and influence a lot with the front of our mouth, but this is controlling the back of the mouth, okay?  And the larynx and the back of the tongue.  So I'll give it to you again.  Okay?  Try that a few times and rewind if you need to.  After you have done that, if you successfully feel like you've got that correct sound, seamlessly turn that air into a singing note like so okay so i'll do the whole thing from the beginning.  heat from fire fire from heat and that's what my voice sounded like if i used that particular resonance that i was testing.  okay now there's a reason why we do this for the overwhelming majority of people i've worked with.  if they try and jump straight to talking after they've raised their larynx they will just immediately drop their larynx and get no effect.  so what we are doing?  First, we use the air sound to hear exactly what our resonance is doing.  Then we take that resonant shape and we simply turn it into a note that we're comfortable with so that we make sure that we're creating sound with the proper resonance.  Then you can try and talk.  So in full, the exercise would look like this.  Ha!  Heat from fire, fire from heat.  Okay?  Good!  Give it a shot and rewind if you need any clarification on this.  And you know, there's lots of variations that you can do with this.  Experiment with your larynx using external noise.  You can take brown noise or white noise, play it on a phone, put it up to your mouth.  Uh, ee, uh, eh, eh, eh.  And you can practice your resonance that way.  In fact, I would argue that that is by far the best way to do it.  So do that if you'd like.  And you can also do that fluid version with your breath too, like so.  Ha!  Heat from fire, fire from heat.  Okay?  Some people find that easy.  Some people find the step easy.  Some people find the noise easier.  You should try all of these and see if one of them sticks for you.  Okay?  Now, after you do that, you'll want to make sure that you avoid a few common issues.  Okay, so the number one common issue is flipping into falsetto when they go to sing the note.  And that would sound like this.  and it doesn't quite sound right, don't go into your falsetto.  I recommend starting with a comfortable pitch for you, not something crazy high.  Typically, I would say anywhere between 160 to 250 hertz when you're doing this exercise.  Otherwise, you can just pick something that feels comfortable for you.  Make sure that you avoid your falsetto.  Two, uh... A lot of people will alter the resonance with their tongue instead of the larynx.  Anytime that you change anything in the vocal tract, it will actually change your resonance.  And so what a lot of people do is they go and they try and do this exercise and their tongue starts coming forward and starts changing that.  So it'll sound like this if that occurs.  And you can hear that it sounds higher.  It sounds like your resonance has gotten brighter because the oral cavity resonance has, but that's not targeting the larynx, which is the goal of this exercise, okay?  So you wanna make sure that you don't go, or h-h-h, or h-h-h, or e-e.  No hes, no hees, none of that.  Try and keep it ha.  That actually ensures that the tongue is in a somewhat neutral position, which is allowing all of the change to come from the back of the tongue and the larynx.  Okay?  Good.  The third most common issue is raising the larynx too high and getting a very choked or fluttery sound.  It sounds like this if you do it.  like that, right?  What that is is the back of your tongue lifted so high that it's actually sort of bouncing against the top of the palate or the back of the throat, either one, and it's sort of opening and closing, creating this sort of frictiony, fluttery sound.  If you hear that, that indicates that you're actually too high with your larynx and you'll wanna go lower, okay?  Just a little lower than that area there.  Fourth most common issue is tensing the neck muscles instead of allowing the correct muscles to perform the motion.  I see this pretty often.  Some people, they think it's in their neck.  Believe it or not, even though we're raising the larynx, it's not really like a neck phenomenon.  It's much more like a tongue phenomenon.  Make sure your neck's not tense.  In fact, if you look at mine, it barely does anything.  There's no extra muscles.  There's no extra tension.  That's it, okay?  So make sure you don't have that.  The fifth most common issue is squeezing the vocal folds too hard.  Some people, when they go to do this, they have all this vocal fold closure and it sounds like this.  Right?  Like they're like fighting or straining.  We don't want that.  We want to stay very calm, very relaxed, no choking off the sound, okay?  Good.  The sixth most common issue when people try to raise their larynx using these techniques is they don't listen, okay?  Listening is the single most important thing you can do in this entire process.  You literally have to use your ears critically.  You have to think very critically and ask yourself, what am I hearing?  Am I creating that?  How is it different?  How can it be closer?  Let your ears guide you and really listen, okay?  But the key to this process isn't how it feels.  It's not what muscles you're using.  It's what it sounds like.  It's using your ears.  And this is something a lot of people don't seem to quite understand.  Sound is literally a picture, okay?  When you hear someone's voice or when you hear a vowel or when you hear a sound, you are literally hearing a blueprint, a guide and a diagram of what the inside of that person's body looks like, okay?  So if you're trying to learn to feminize your voice and you're trying to do these exercises, maybe it will help you to think about muscles.  Maybe it might help you to think about feelings, but I guarantee it will help you if you use your ear and you really listen and ask yourself, what does this sound like?  How different is this?  How am I different?  What's different about mine?  And you really start to get critical with your ears, okay?  The ears should be the guide for the voice.  In conclusion, the larynx is a chamber which contains your vocal folds.  The height of this area and the sort of proximity of it can be altered.  When the larynx is lifted upwards, it brightens the sound, making you sound more feminine.  And when the larynx moves downwards, it darkens the sound, making you sound more masculine.  Review the exercises given in this video and listen very carefully to the samples.  I want you to experiment with all of the different techniques and let me know if this works for you or if you have any issues.  There is honestly so much more to know and explore and to fully digest, but I wanted to keep this video somewhat simple, clear, and easy to follow.

In this video, we'll be discussing the larynx and how to raise it to achieve a more feminine voice. The larynx is a muscular mucosal chamber containing the vocal folds. Its position can be altered through various muscle groups, affecting the sound produced.\n\nWhen the larynx is raised, the vocal folds are positioned closer to the lips, resulting in a brighter and more feminine sound. Conversely, lowering the larynx darkens the sound, making it more masculine. Let's listen to some examples of larynx alteration.\n\nTo raise the larynx, we'll use a specific exercise. First, we'll mimic the sound of \"ha\" and then turn it into a singing note. This exercise helps us develop the correct resonance and avoid common issues like flipping into falsetto or altering the resonance with the tongue.\n\nCommon issues to avoid include:\n\n1. Flipping into falsetto\n2. Altering the resonance with the tongue\n3. Raising the larynx too high, resulting in a choked or fluttery sound\n4. Tensing the neck muscles instead of using the correct muscles\n5. Squeezing the vocal folds too hard\n6. Not listening critically to the sound produced\n\nThe key to this process is using your ears critically and listening to the sound produced. Sound is a picture of the inside of the body, and using your ears will help you develop the correct resonance and achieve a more feminine voice.\n\nIn conclusion, the larynx is a chamber containing the vocal folds, and its height can be altered to change the sound produced.

Does it make a sound as it does so?  This is a pretty common philosophical question that has typically a lot to do with senses and observation.  But I think it's a very boring question.  But we're gonna talk about it anyway.  For a lot of people, this philosophical question is pretty dumb.  Like, what are you talking about?  Does it make a sound?  Well, yeah, the tree will fall down.  It will create vibrations in the air, in the atmosphere.  And that is what sound is.  Of course it makes a sound.  And they are saying that it doesn't matter if anyone hears it or not.  it still makes a sound.  But for this video, I want to take this philosophical concept and apply it to science.  So, say that there is a scientist in the middle of the forest, and they create a knowledge, but no one is around to know it.  Have they done a science?  Science is a very vague term for all sorts of knowledge-acquiring ventures trying to gather evidence about the universe in order to increase our understanding of the world around us.  There is some disagreement about whether or not science needs to have empirical evidence or not, but, you know, in general, science is about trying to understand the world.  And it's important to note that there are a lot of people who really like science, and they have opinions on what science is.  The idea is that science is very very different from politics.  Politics is opinions that's not based in empirical logic.  Whereas science doesn't have anything to do with politics. Merging politics and science, not allowing them to exist autonomously of each other, can only serve to alter science's trajectory to the path of truth. The claim that science shouldn't be political is something that is, I think, pretty ideal.  Like, science should be neutral.  It shouldn't have human values associated with it.  And you know, to a point, that's true.  But to say that science shouldn't be political is, I think, a sort of blindness of the world that we actually live within.  But when people say that politics maybe should start taking a role in science, there will always be those people that say that political science is almost always evil, and that it will detract from the true purpose of science, to reach truth.  to strive for knowledge.  And this usually also attracts comparisons to the Nazis, who, you know, did their own types of scientific pursuits in very evil ways. Okay, that's the main purpose here, and Bill Nye wants that specifically.  Some examples?  I know it seems tired and old hat, but let's go to Nazi Germany.  That's kind of a prime example of political science, as it were. But what they misunderstand is where the problem is.  The problem is not that science is political.  The problem is that the politics in question in the examples that they cite are evil and, you know, That's kind of political.  Scientists, people who, you know, do science, are human.  And everything that humans do will be in some way political.  But there will be people who say then that that's not really science.  That's just the structure in which science resides.  There's sort of this idea that everything around science can be political, but science in itself, at its core, is objective and is supposed to be this, apolitical bastion of truth and knowledge.  and you know there's a point there.  i think science should try to be that.  but the thing is nothing exists in a vacuum and until we can somehow create an environment where no humans are involved in the pursuit of science at all then I don't think that we can avoid politics in the process of science.  But another common argument is that science doesn't really have a morality, or doesn't have politics.  Science is neutral, but it's a tool that people can use for good and bad, and I think this argument is kind of bullshit.  Science today is also very political, but just in slightly different ways.  The society we live within currently is formed under capitalism.  Like, I don't think it's a big secret that a lot of biomedical research these days is being funded by medical corporations trying to make money from it.  And, you know, That's kinda political.  But is that science?  Or is that merely how science is applied?  Sure, corporations can do things, but corporations have motives to make profit.  Scientists.  Pure scientists.  Are they political too?  Well to that I say, if a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?  I've noticed that a common problem when trying to access academic literature for researching videos or just for pure curiosity is that I can't really get that information easily anymore.  When I was a university student, my university would pay for me to access all sorts of scientific and academic journals.  But most people aren't enrolled in university.  And most people don't really have access to those things.  And I definitely don't have access to those journals anymore, and I've realized that I've really taken them for granted in the last couple of years.  And so what I, and a lot of people do, is take their research from journalists or other academic sources secondhand.  I can't really afford a subscription to Nature, but maybe you know someone who does and maybe they can like hook you up with a copy of it.  But most people aren't so lucky.  But what this means is that a lot of what people claim to be scientific consensus is very inaccessible to people who aren't already within academic spheres.  For most people in society, what scientific consensus is doesn't actually matter at all.  And that's simply because most people don't have access to that.  Instead, people's idea of science matters more than the actual scientific consensus.  And that has direct political implications for people in society, which we live in.  So while science in theory is not political, it is in practice.  I should mention, though, that even the ideals of science itself, as it is currently, is not doing that great.  Even something as simple as calling something statistically significant might not actually mean anything at all.  Not to mention that there are significant issues with the current peer review system, as well as the existence of shady scientific journals.  What actually constitutes proper science these days is harder to discern than you might actually think.  Now obviously, that's a great thing.  Science shouldn't be black or white easy answers.  But at the same time, we don't really read it with that nuance in the public perception.  If we consider something to have a scientific consensus, we all pretty much agree that thing to be true, even if that might not be the case.  Now, if you don't know, I'm a trans woman, and that means that a lot of the time in my comments I will end up with people saying, there are only two genders, you can't change your gender, science says you can't change your gender, science is this, science is this, and the thing is, is that... Are they right?  For now, let's say that the people who say this are right.  That somehow, some biologist somewhere looks into a mitochondria cell and just finds a small piece of text that says there are only two genders.  Like an objective, scientific, definitive proof that there are only two sexes.  and that's it.  I would argue, does that matter?  A very common response to transphobic people trying to disprove trans people with science is that the science doesn't really agree with them.  And to a point.  that's kind of true, but only to a point.  Because I think the problem here is not really what the science says.  The science has been definitive, and that brings me back to if a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?  Some people might say that, of course it makes a sound, it makes vibrations, that equals sound, definitely sound.  Well, some people will say that sound is dependent on someone actually hearing it, and therefore it doesn't actually make a sound.  The same thing still happens.  The tree still falls.  But the interpretation of the facts is different.  The scientific community says that there are not really a binary choice.  It's more of a bimodal distribution with two bell curve thingies.  And this sort of pattern will repeat itself on all sorts of sexual characteristics.  Characteristics that set, you know, men and women apart biologically.  Things like genitals, height, secondary sexual characteristics, and everything, really.  But the thing is, there is an overlap.  And as you probably know, there are people out there that have characteristics of both.  There are several types of intersex conditions that can't neatly fall into one of the two groupings.  so the problem here is how do we interpret the data?  when i for example read comments on videos discussing this fact i don't really see people disputing the science itself but they have a different interpretation of it.  what they are saying is that there are two genders and everything else are outliers, and shouldn't really be counted into something statistically significant.  And this reminds me a lot of the argument that we shouldn't really accommodate things for trans people, because they're such a small part of the population, so they don't really matter.  And that is a political choice.  So the data itself might not be political, but how that science is taken in and used by people definitely is.  And so, is science political?  It all depends on context.  And this is why I don't think that the scientific argument is necessarily the best one.  The science has been stronger than ever, and still, you know, people become anti-vax.  People deny climate change.  People deny the existence of trans people.  But the science has been definitive for quite a while on a lot of these things.  This is where many people will argue for science communication.  People being public figures and educating about the science and how it impacts the world and how everything works.  But a lot of science communicators in the last couple of decades, that are famous anyway, have been people that do things like physics, environmental science, astrophysics, other physics, there's a lot of physicists.  And partially, you know, that's fine.  People can explore the stars and it's kind of funky to hear about space stuff, right?  I like space, everyone likes space.  And when it comes to people who do STEM communication, for example, That works fine when it comes to STEM subjects.  Like, people aren't denying science because they haven't heard the science.  There are other reasons as to why they aren't believing in the scientific consensus.  This is why I personally think that people should start investing more into science education in the humanities, because they deal with humans.  And I'm totally not biased at all when it comes to that, because these questions of how we are supposed to interpret the data have a lot more to do with things like social constructs than you might think.  And that doesn't mean it's fake.  That doesn't mean it's made up.  It just means that it's something that we as humans have created.  And STEM fields have a really hard time tackling with these things because it's fundamentally different from what they are supposed to be doing.  And that's not wrong, by the way.  Like, I don't want to crack down on STEM science here, because, like, physicists and doctors and all those kinds of things, like, hell yeah, do your, like, objective data thing.  Yeah.  Okay, you might say, after all of this.  This is not really science.  This is not actually science.  This is just how science has been applied in society.  And, you know, that's a fair point.  But can we really trust science as it's supposed to be, in its most basic form, at all?  I think it's important to have healthy skepticism of what science is, and what science actually can and cannot do.  I think the first step to dealing with this is realizing that science definitely is political, but that science isn't perfect even when it tries to not be.

During the exam, I managed to get a bit of voice feminization technique on camera. As far as I know, this is the first published footage of voice feminization via laryngoscope. There is a lot more footage to collect and hopefully someday I won't be pressed for time so I can exhaustively test things with a camera inside me but this is good for now!\n\nThere are a few key things to look for:\n1. The velum and how it opens\/closes airflow to the nose\n2. The tongue root elevation and retraction\n3. The curving of the epiglottis and actually resting it on the back of the retracted tongue\n4. The elevation of the entire larynx\n\nVoice feminization is all about space reduction of the throat and rear oral cavity. We call this space \"R1\" and it is responsible for the frequency of Resonance 1. We shrink all the space back there which causes R1 to climb higher, which causes the voice the feminize as the key difference between male and female vocal tracts is the negative space.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. James Thomas for cooperating with my off the cuff requests!\n\nwarmly,\nz\n\nhttps:\/\/www.patreon.com\/transvoicelessons\nhttps:\/\/www.transvoicelessons.com\/\nhttps:\/\/zheaerosemusic.bandcamp.com\/","publish_date":"2020-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":[""],"length":287,"views":19437,"thumbnail_url":"","yt_channel_id":"UCBYlEnfAUbrYSwF0VujcmHA","transcripts":"Okay, so recently I got a laryngoscope done on me.  They stick a camera up your nose and then lower it down the back of your nose into your pharynx and then we can look at the vocal folds and all the surrounding structures.  So let's take a look.  First off, we're inside my nose right here.  This is my soft palate or my velum.  This is at the very back and up of my nose where your nasopharynx starts.  And there we can see that the velum opens, aka the soft palate lowers, which opens up airflow into the nose.  You always lower this when you breathe through your nose.  And then we're just gonna stick the camera back, the back of my nose, and then we are now in the pharynx.  This structure here is the back of your tongue.  This is the tongue root.  This right here is the epiglottis.  We can actually see the vocal folds are down there.  This is your trachea.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Whenever you breathe, there should be symmetric motion here.  So that's what this test is checking.  And everything looks good.  This footage is a little bit more interesting.  So in this footage, we sort of look at some vocal function.  These right here are the vestibular folds.  The true folds, the vestibular folds.  I'm changing my glottal quotient there.  Let's look at that again.  I try and do the same thing, but for a really high note.  It's kind of hard to do that really, really open.  But I try.  So he asked me if there's anything I want to do that I wanted to see.  And I was kind of caught off guard because there's a lot of stuff that I want to do.  But since I had a camera in my nose, it was kind of hard to like.  It was really hard to like determine exactly what I wanted.  Right.  So I raised my larynx while you do this.  So I asked him if I could raise my larynx and he said yes.  And I was like, whoa, that was really fast.  So I do it a little bit slower.  And this is so exciting to see.  We see here the tongue root is coming back.  We see that the epiglottis ends up curvy and going all the way back here and the larynx is shifting up.  Wow.  Thank you.  I'm like, wow.  Tongue root?  And then I asked them for the tongue root because something that's really, really important is the structure of the tongue during feminization.  And I was gonna try and do this without raising the larynx too much.  And we can actually see some of this, see?  We can see the tongue root retracting back here.  We're looking down from the very back of the nose, down the nasopharynx.  This is the oropharynx back here.  There's the pharynx and then down here is the larynx.  And we can actually see the tongue root retracts.  Now, I think I talk here and you can actually see how when I speak, Ooh, this is actually really, really feminized.  This is like, ah, ah, like a really, really tiny structure.  Ooh, ooh.  Awesome.  So there's a word.  Let's look at the word awesome.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Now, I had a camera down my throat, but look at my tongue retraction here.  Awesome.  Thank you.  Right, and then he pulls the scope out, of course, and we go through my nose and so forth.  Okay, so I just wanted to go over a little bit of that once more where things started to get a little bit more interesting.  Will you do this?  Or will I?  Okay.  So I have a thing up my nose.  We are looking down from the nose.  We can actually see I raised the larynx really high at first and everything shoots up.  So he has to like pull the camera back, right?  So we lose vision.  Now I realize I can't quite go as high with it.  Wow, thank you.  And then the tongue group?  And I want to give a really special thanks and shout out to Dr.  James Thomas for capturing all these awesome images with his scope.  So yeah, thanks so much for watching.  I hope you find this interesting.  Post below what you think about this stuff.  Did you think it looked like this?  Do you have any questions about any of the anatomy stuff?

So the time has come to discuss how conservative Christianity and fascism has appropriated the word feminism as a means of attacking the LGBT plus community, specifically in relation to trans folk.  Now this is important to cover since there are segments of both the feminist and secular communities who are holding the door open for said people.  They don't seem to realise that there's going to be a cost for all of us down the line.  That is, unless we come together and stand in opposition to said bigotry.  So, this video is for the people who think the current discussion on trans rights doesn't really impact either secularism or feminism, because as I'm about to show you, it really does.  Not only is what is happening hurting trans people, it's extending the power of the church and defining women by nothing outside their ability to give birth.  both of which are an issue worth discussing in an open fashion.  Now, at the forefront of a lot of what is happening is a group known as the Women's Liberation Front, or WOLF for short.  They're an international group which targets trans people who are attempting to gain and secure their human and civil rights, utilising various methods they not only seek to stop advances on those fronts, but to strip back what has already been painstakingly gained over the past few years.  So right off the bat, one of the things to note about WOLF is the imagery they use.  go to the group's website, its Twitter page, its Facebook, and to a lesser extent its YouTube channel, and a common theme becomes apparent.  You'll see black and white photos of what could be considered old-school feminism.  In a similar vein to Feminist Wiki's Feminism Unmodified, their imagery seems to be designed to create the idea that there's some sort of feminist orthodoxy adhering to long-abandoned tenets of feminism, which is interesting since said group has no presence prior to 2014 when it emerged as a response to growing discourse surrounding trans people.  Prior to that, the organisers of the site seemed to have very little interest, certainly much less than they do now, in speaking on the subject of women's rights, and I feel it's important to point out the imagery at play here and what it seems designed to convey so that we may be less vulnerable to said methods.  Sure, Transphobia is nothing new, but neither is support for trans people.  Meanwhile, this organisation and others like it seem to be attempting to feed on this idea that there's some sort of extension of mainstream classical feminism, feminism responsible for the gains women have made thus far.  But the truth is, this image is entirely fabricated, it does not bear true.  Much like the minimal lit service they pay to various issues faced by cis women, whilst they tweet about things such as birth control, parental leave and rape, Beyond that, they don't do much.  And it's not for a lack of resources.  Wolf was very happy to file a lawsuit against the United States government for introducing policy seeking to protect trans children from physical, verbal, and sexual assault.  So, what could be the source of this discrepancy?  It's almost as if they aren't all that interested in women's rights at all, merely the aesthetic of it as a means to attack trans people whilst shielding themselves from criticism.  something which is supported by the evidence.  Take for example the fact that Wolf board member Kara Dansky, she received a donation of US$15,000 from the Alliance Defending Freedom, For clarification, a report put together by the Southern Poverty Law Center describes that organization as, quote, Founded by some 30 leaders of the Christian right, the Alliance Defending Freedom is a legal advocacy and training group that has supported the recriminalization of homosexuality in the US and criminalization abroad.  has defended state-sanctioned sterilization of trans people abroad, has linked homosexuality to pedophilia, and claims that a homosexual agenda will destroy Christianity and society.  ADF also works to develop religious liberty legislation and case law that would allow the denial of goods and services to LGBT plus people on the basis of religion.  Since the election of President Donald Trump, the ADF has become one of the most influential groups in forming the administration's attack on LGBT plus rights, working with an ally in Attorney General Jeff  Sessions.\"  And the subject of reproductive rights is also mentioned in quote, using its international platforms the ADF works with policymakers and other organizations to outlaw abortion, deny equality of marriage to LGBT plus people worldwide, and continue to push for a hard-right Christian theocratic worldview that is reflected in legislation and  policies.\".  Wolf has also received financial support from Imperial Independent Media.  This is an organization that sued a research clinic in Washington, not out of hopes of stopping the research carried out there, but in hopes of gaining the names and addresses of the involved researchers.  Now, why did they do this?  Well, the clinic utilised fetal tissue samples, so they had the intention of publishing said private details of the researchers involved in hopes that stochastic terrorism would claim further victims.  If you don't know what stochastic terrorism is, it refers to the use of public discourse to radicalise individuals and incite them to violence in a fashion that seems almost random.  If you've ever heard of so-called lone wolf terrorism, you've most likely heard this in practice.  That's why so many so-called lone wolves all share the same interests, the same backgrounds, follow the same people, share the same political ideologies, etc.  Because it's not random, it's cultivated.  Those open to being radicalised are filtered out by gradually worsening rhetoric until they reach a point where they hear some conspiracy podcaster saying something about their killing babies and decide to act on it.  And groups like those at FundWolf have a large role in that.  but it's not a case of simply taking money from these organisations.  Wolf has actively worked alongside them in multiple instances.  In 2017, Wolf filed a joint lawsuit against trans teenager Gavin Grimm.  their ally, the Family Policy Alliance, an organisation that asks you to, quote, join with Family Policy Alliance.  so pro-life, pro-family, pro-freedom Americans make their voices heard for pre-born babies and schoolchildren, end quote.  Then we come to Wolfe's involvement with the Heritage Foundation, specifically their Biology Isn't Bigotry talk, in which Active Wolf member Mary Lou Singleton took part in said panel, offering credence to the narratives surrounding trans people that have been constructed by the Christian right these past few years, narratives of the dangers trans people pose to society, in particular young girls and vulnerable women, and it's not like they hide the fact that these are constructed narratives particularly well.  LifeSite News hosted an article written by Mass Resistance, a conservative group from Massachusetts which fought against trans-inclusive bathroom policy.  Inside said article, they state the following, Now with the transgender anti-discrimination bills, the same thing is happening.  Our side concocted the bathroom safety, male predator argument as a way to avoid an uncomfortable battle over LGBT plus ideology and still fire up people's emotions.  It worked in Houston a few years  ago.\".  And this follows on directly from mention of a similar tactic used against same-gender parents at an earlier point in America's history.  So considering this, is it that surprising that said organisations refuse to make a stand for the rights of bisexual and lesbian women?  That it refuses to fight for reproductive care and abortion access which, outside of trans men and some non-binary folk, disproportionately impacts women?  Not really.  What we have here is something known as astroturfing, a term that describes the idea of creating a movement which has the outerly appearance of being grassroots, being self-formed by the people impacted by a certain issue.  The reality, meanwhile, is that said movement is artificial.  Wolf is presented as a figurehead that speaks for the wellbeing of women.  when the truth is it's funded and backed by the Christian right to the very opposite effect.  Now, there are several reasons to do this.  One is a very well-known divide-and-conquer strategy.  The LGBT plus community fractured is weaker than the LGBT plus community united.  The Southern Poverty Law Centre carried out an investigation into said right-wing groups and found a desire to utilise fringe lesbians as a means to separate lesbians as a whole from the rest of the LGBT plus movement.  But there's also the fact that conservatives see anti-trans bills as a way to limit reproductive freedoms of cis women.  Back in January, Utah passed a bill which defined women strictly by their reproductive capacity.  And whilst this was presented as an anti-trans bill, its true depths are a little more nefarious.  You see, if women are strictly defined by their reproductive capacity, that frame said reproduction as almost this inevitable trait inherent to a woman.  This framing can then be used in discussion on reproductive healthcare and abortion access to argue that pregnancy is almost this predestined or divine occurrence, one a person has no right to hold.  It's a sneaky way to use a wedge issue to control the language in abortion debate.  it offers the anti-choice crowd a sense of legitimacy that they lack.  And it's defended by self-proclaimed feminists who don't care about the impact this has on cis women, trans men, and non-binary folk.  They seem more preoccupied with how this hurts the trans community than the impact it has on those people.  And this is something I've witnessed here in the UK as well.  Self-declared doctor, Venice Allen, known by her online persona, Dr Radfem, is a particularly spiteful individual who shows many of the features discussed already.  While she thought of herself as old-school feminism, unflinching in a changing society, Her actions speak very differently.  Of particular interest is a certain photo, published to her Twitter.  In said photo, Venner stands next to Tory MP David Davies, thanking him for quote, standing up for lesbians.  Now, why is this picture of interest?  But it's of interest because David Davies voted against legalising same-gender marriage at every vote on the matter he attended.  So here we have an apparent radical feminist thanking a Tory MP who voted against lesbian rights for somehow standing up for lesbians.  Why?  Well, because David Davey spoke out against the rights of trans people, specifically in response to proposed changes to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, changes which would make legally changing one's birth certificate less of a bureaucratic nightmare.  Note, the proposed changes would not affect such things as passports and bathroom access, which trans people already had in the UK, making much of the fear tactics imported from the US a distraction.  Venice Allen is also well-known for her habit of attacking cis women she deems too masculine, hurling transphobic slurs at them only to claim it's their fault for not putting more time into adhering to patriarchal standards of beauty.  So, there's that to consider when she awes herself as a feminist.  One of her pals is another British woman, Kelly J. Keane Minshall, commonly known as Posy Parker, a woman who decries the evil of transgender people, whilst posing with Holocaust-denying Trump supporters such as Hans Johansson.  Fact is, even some of the terse find themselves unable to deal with the far-right cosying that takes place.  At the start of this year, one of said people, Jean Hatchet, broke off from the likes of Wolf and Keane Minshaw, but not before writing a post explaining her issues.  Amongst them are some of the things I've already discussed, but there was more.  For example, Hatcher took issue with Keane Mitchell's friendship with Stephen Yakesley Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.  Yakesley Lennon famously jeopardised court cases surrounding child grooming gangs to line his own pockets, breached court orders designed to protect the British judicial system and risked having the cases thrown out or started again as a new jury was found, all to fuel his xenophobic narratives at the cost of the victims of said grooming gangs.  Keane Minshall praised his actions whilst dismissing the work of feminists such as myself who cover the topic without resorting to xenophobia.  So it's not a case of.  Keane Minchell once spoke to a room full of Nazis, this is a repeated occurrence by self-declared feminists, hardly surprising when one realises that said feminism is appropriated.  And that's part of the reason why Irish Feminists opened fire at these appropriators at the start of 2018.  They went after the fact that whilst groups like Women's Place UK and We Need To Talk assist the Christian, white and fascist groups in harming trans people, women in Northern Ireland lacked access to safe and legal abortions, echoing very clearly the sort of selective concern for women's wellbeing that we saw in the States.  To them, feminism is just a mask.  It's a way for them to retain their polar views about trans people whilst being able to douse any form of criticism as sexism.  What they fail to realise or simply don't care about is the fact that conservative Christians and fascists have used them to adopt the very same mask to forward their anti-reproductive health and xenophobic goals.  Which brings us back round to where we started, Feminist Wiki.  Now you'd be fair in asking what Feminist Wiki has to do with any of the discussion up to now.  Well, if you go to its main page, the very first group it lists as one it stands in solidarity with is the far-right-funded Women's Liberation Front.  It also goes on to list Women's Place UK, the organisation that refuses to support abortion access in Ireland but expects Irish feminists to buy into their bigotry.  This is a conservative Christian and far-right infection which permeates throughout these pro-feminist organisations.  And there are people who buy into their narratives due to their own ignorance of trans people, not realising that all they're actually doing is helping certain groups position themselves to strip away the rights of all women, both cis and trans, and it's something they need to wake up to.  It's also something we need to wake up to in the secular community, because much in the same way that groups such as Wolf have given the far-right voices a means of attack, so too have certain voices in the secular community.  We have people who others look up to, parroting the likes of Ben Shapiro on trans people, unironically.  We have them using the same alarmist rhetoric to claim that trans people are a threat to cis women, that they're going to destroy their hard-earned rights by obtaining and securing their own rights.  And we have atheists asserting the same old tired, Christianity is responsible for all that is great in Western civilisation because of this.  What this is is a complete abandonment of secular humanist values, Just like the Christian right and fascists are all too happy to adopt the appearance of fighting for women's rights to harm trans people, they're ecstatic at the opportunity to don the veneer of reasoning\u2026 without the substance.  So we need to put an end to that.  We need to arm ourselves with the knowledge to deal with this creeping religion and fascism.  it's poisoning both the feminist and secular communities.  But what do you lot think?  Is this encroachment on both the secular and feminist communities by the Christian right something we can just ignore?  Is abandoning reproductive rights acceptable as a means to hurt the trans community?  Why is it that so few people know about said astroturfing, and what can we do to change that?  Did I miss something you not noticed?  If so, be sure to leave us a comment down below.  Now, I'd just like to give a special shout-out to KC Explosion.  Whilst I'm able to read through peer-reviewed journal articles, no problem, there's just too much going on surrounding the trans community for me to review every single news piece published on the matter, and Casey has been amazing in that regard.  She routinely puts out threads covering topics such as the one discussed today, and my life would have been a hell of a lot harder without her, not just for this video, but for many of my previous videos.  And Casey, I know you like to downplay what you're doing as just compiling a lot of what others have written, but I think you are truly underestimating the importance of what you do.  You've enlightened many people on complex subjects.  and that's admirable.  As always, please check out our other videos.  You can also support us in support by Patreon, and in doing so help us reach our goal of becoming ad-free.

And so what I mean by that is when we call up a place and the person on the other side of the phone makes an assumption of our gender based on the voice that they hear, and then they misgender us.  So for instance, Yesterday I made three phone calls because I just recently changed my bank and I need to change, you know, obviously with all the places that I am charged automatically every month for stuff, I need to change my bank account information.  So the first thing I did, which was like two weeks ago is every place that had an option online to change it.  I did that and I have put this off for two weeks, but now the debt, the dates are coming up and I need to go ahead and like call these places and and get it figured out.  And so one thing I learned from this is that if you have to go through something like this because you're changing your address, you're changing your name, gender marker, and you have to call up places, try to only do one, one at a time, one per day.  Again, if it's online, easy peasy, but if you actually have to talk to someone, try not to cluster it like I did.  I know I meant well, I was gonna just try to get it all done, but What happened is that I got really stacked.  The first phone call, the person on the other side of the phone called me either miss Hoffman Fox or ma'am I can't remember which one right away and I heard her.  I always prepare myself ahead of time before I make one of those calls.  what am I gonna do?  it doesn't mean it didn't feel flustering when it happened but I said and I still am trying to figure out my wording for it but I said actually my gender is not female.  could you please refer to me as Dara?  That person picked up on it right away.  So it's like the feeling came up and then it kind of went, you know, it comes down, but it doesn't go all the way back down to like how I was before the call.  It's there.  Second phone call, the person didn't gender me at all, which was great.  So I kind of was like, oh, nice.  It just kind of stayed there.  Third phone call, awful.  And because I got transferred three times and each person either said, sometimes they said Miss Dara or Miss Hoffman Fox or ma'am.  And so every time I got transferred, it happened again.  And then with the third person who was on the phone the longest, I, you know, I said, you know, my gender is not female.  Could you please just call me Dara?  The person, you know, apologized and said, sure.  And then they just kept going.  doing it and kept doing it.  And there was also frustration involved with me changing my bank account information that we were having a miscommunication about that.  And I was just like, it went like this.  And then I was just, just up here.  I know I was probably being a little curt and I'm sure I sounded frustrated, but I, uh, you know, I just couldn't was just very difficult to manage that and so that really sucked.  uh and you just never know when you're gonna call a place.  is it gonna be kind?  not you won't be misgendered or they get it pretty quick you don't have to repeat yourself or the person, and again, I know customer service people, they don't mean it maliciously.  There's cultural differences, there's, and I mean that within the United States and outside the United States in terms of how people are raised to be respectful to other people.  and it's very new for us to be talking about hey when you say sir and ma'am like maybe that's respectful in certain communities um but you just never know when you're misgendering somebody and it's time to have that conversation about how you can just use gender neutral language in these circumstances.  and so what i decided to do and I've done this before is because that particular phone call was particularly upsetting.  I did message the company to let them know what happened and they wrote back and just said we promise you we are looking we are I don't know we are listening something really generic.  so I wrote back and I said I would love to hear what it is you're going to do specifically And that's the thing is that I'm trying to think if there's something like a worksheet or a PDF that I can create that I can offer to send to places to say, look, here's just one page in which I discuss options to using ma'am and sir, and why it would be so important for you to do this for customers.  I mean, there's people who are cisgender who get misgendered over the phone, you know, like, and it just doesn't feel good no matter what.  And it just makes the whole conversation, um, already, which is already nerve wracking.  It just makes it worse.  And I am like, I, this hasn't happened for awhile, but it, it wrecked me for a couple of hours.  And when I say it wrecked me after these three phone calls that I had to make, um, I just was very agitated and it was hard for me to focus on getting any work done.  And so because of that, let's, I recognize that was happening.  And so I did things that helped me relax.  I took a shower.  just went through the rest of my morning routine.  I made my lunch I went to a coffee shop and sat there and worked for a bit and then by the time I had done all of that I was able like I was back to my normal self in terms of feeling not just like triggered I guess by the situation.  so this video was a little bit of me just kind of sharing what happened just so I can, we can empathize with one another and have compassion for each other as we're going through this.  Threw in there a couple ideas about maybe what can be done to help, you know, do.  at the beginning of the conversation, should I say before we begin, I just want to let you know that terms such as miss and ma'am are ones that do not apply to me because I'm not female.  And that's always hard as a non-binary person because then they might be like, oh, no problem, sir.  And then you're like, hmm.  So trying to figure out the right way to explain that short and sweet.  so it's not a big deal so we can move on.  And then it doesn't become like a big educational process as well.  put some thoughts below about this.  you know whether it's like what you've been through.  maybe ideas that you've had before.  and again I know that I've worked in customer service.  I understand like you're just trying to give good customer service I know there is not any kind of malicious intent.  so what do we do?  how do we find a way to go about this so that they don't feel criticized or shamed and that we can also feel like we are being being taken for who we truly are in those moments.  So thanks for listening.  I do feel like I was venting and I feel better now that I was venting to y'all.  So we'll talk again soon.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I was planning to make some phone calls to update my bank account information after changing my name and gender marker.

Let them look at you and see things.  Oh my god, maybe.  It might be, shoot, I haven't even tapped into like the body dysmorphia part of like having someone look at me.  So that's, that, there was another actual intimacy exercise that I was forced to do in college was to make eye contact with myself in the mirror and And tell myself that I'm worth it when I was going through a bad dysmorphia attack. So what about you?  Especially because you've been experiencing this recently and this is kind of starting to become something you think about more regularly and you're becoming more aware of within yourself.  Anything that you think will help with you to kind of Wrangle this sphere so you can sit knee to knee and like touch someone's chest. God, I can't even imagine how hard that must have been. Part one, what is vulnerability?  Who is vulnerable?  Are we vulnerable in our fields?  Part two, helpful tools for coping with fear of vulnerability and intimacy. I mean, it's, it's one of those things where we don't, we have, we all have these deep seated fears about ourselves, right?  About our, our worth, about our level of attractiveness, about our goodness.  We all have these fears that we may not be as good or as worthy or as lovable as we hope we are.  Right.  And so I think extended eye contact, like metaphorically also literally, but sometimes metaphorically, like that's what vulnerability is.  And we're afraid that people may confirm that.  fears mm-hmm you know that like not only are we afraid that someone will reject us for whatever reason we're also afraid that they'll see something in us and confirm our deepest darkest fears about ourselves.  yeah and our and our worthiness or lack thereof or whatever.  so it also comes down to self-love mm-hmm you know and the confidence in that because I think we're all we all have a certain level of doubt right about our worthiness and whether that comes from trauma or just society or the way we're raised or whatever you know like with my dad you know feeling like my lovability would be lessened if i revealed that i was gay.  you know it's like one of those things and then i may feel less lovable if i interpret his reaction to be anything that confirms that fear.  you know and that's i think that's a big part of vulnerability is the like being vulnerable comes down to like being brave, but being brave comes down to having that self love that just, you know, understand.  no matter how that person reacts, I'm still confident in my goodness and my worth, you know?  And I think that's a big part of vulnerability.  Most of us have a really hard time being confident in our worth.  You know, most people kind of, we're, we're all on an edge, you know, and if a bully talks trash about you, then it confirms that we're not, Yeah, I mean, it's so hard to navigate and we're kind of veering into what I was hoping to talk about, which is trying to discover what are some helpful tools or coping mechanisms to improve our fears of vulnerability and intimacy.  Um, the two kind of like overlap for me and I'm not sure if they're the same thing or not, but they're, they're very close together.  They're siblings.  Yes.  Vulnerability and intimacy.  Right.  Um, so like, uh, like for example, with the physical intimacy, like in that exercise, um, do you, do you know of any ways to like practice, like getting more comfortable with something like that?  Maybe, um, Is it just like doing it, you think? I think immersion therapy, you know, like getting out there and actually doing that.  I also think that another thing that's really, really helpful, or it has been for me, is therapy in general.  For me, talk therapy has been really, really great because it helps me anytime I'm sharing something like, you know, my vulnerabilities.  I have someone who is a safe space to confirm and validate my worth.  And, you know, it's almost like the opposite of the fear, right?  Someone is there to actually say, Hey, no, you are worthy of being loved.  You know, it doesn't matter if you're gay, you know, you are worthy of being loved.  It doesn't matter if you have this, it doesn't matter if you look like this, it doesn't, you know, you have that worth.  So I think for me also a big reason that I have so many walls up personally because I was in relationships with people who did not take care of my vulnerability.  So I think spending time with people who are safe spaces, I think that's big because I found that the more I do that and the more I spend time with, I'm going to use a term that Brene Brown.  It says marble jar friends. What's that? Okay, so there's... I'm going to mess this up.  But basically the concept is that you have a jar of marbles, right?  And when someone... proves their trustworthiness, you know, they get like a marble in that jar of friendship.  and people who have like a full jar of marbles have proven that they are trust, you know, trustworthy people in your life, you know, and capable of handling your emotional space, being safe spaces.  And so they're marble jar friends. Okay. And I found that the more time I spend with my marble jar friends and the people in my life and my therapist, you know, things like that, safe spaces, that's a good place to learn how to be vulnerable, but also how to be brave and how to be strong regardless of the outcome.  I think it's kind of like learning to swim, right?  Mm-hmm.  It's really scary if you don't know how to swim because there's these deep, dark waters and you don't know if you're going to drown.  You know, there's so much fear.  You don't know what's lurking underneath.  But if you start in the shallow end with an instructor, you know, or a friend who knows how to swim or someone who can be like, here's a little like floaty, use this.  Like eventually you're going to get to the deeper end.  You're going to be able to swim.  You're going to be able to dive deeply and you're not going to be afraid of it.  So I think that, Emotionally like the people in your life, you know, if you have these people who can be safe spaces Then it's a lot easier to learn how to swim alone.  Yeah, or with other people or in the deeper end.  I'm going off on right now.  Yeah for me.  That's that's been Where I've developed the most when it comes to vulnerability. Yeah, so I think our takeaways are that not everyone is deserving of your vulnerability and your intimacy. And it's not your fault if they are not a safe space or if they don't have the emotional capacity to handle it or if their reaction isn't what you'd hope to be.  It's not your fault. Right.  It doesn't, yeah, like all these fears that one might have about giving someone their vulnerability or intimacy, so we're talking about physical and emotional and spiritual, your fears could be, what, they, it's often going to be back onto you, right?  It's going to be back onto you, so, oh, they think I'm a bad person, they think I'm weird, they think I'm all those things, it kind of, I think the fears always try to like kind of like come back onto you.  But it is more reasonable to realize that it's more often than not another person just cannot handle your vulnerability or shouldn't have been trusted with it.  And it's going to be hard to determine that sometimes. Right.  One thing that I remember writing in that post was that, you know, sharing your... or accepting someone else's vulnerability is just as complicated and complex sometimes as sharing your own.  So I think that having a little more empathy for the people we choose to share with can help us.  Because we're not so, our expectations are not so strict that that person is going to handle it like a trained therapist.  So I think having empathy for other people and understanding that other people, even some people in just like that day may not have the emotional capacity because they're dealing with a big struggle and they may not be able to handle your vulnerability in a way that they would on a different day.  It could just be the day for that person. Right, right, right. Yeah.  So it's, I think sometimes it's kind of stuff we have to get out of our heads and get out of our spaces a little bit to understand, like get a little bit more perspective and to see that we're not giving away anything, you know, and we wait, other people only have power over us if we think they do. Yeah.  It's so hard to, like, really accept that, and I think, I don't know what it is about the fragile human mind, but we, yeah, I think that so many people, including myself, are, like, just riddled with fear, and the fear is more controlling and has more power over us than anything else, than anything that other people could think of them, etc. Right, we all think The worst of ourselves.  Worse than anyone else would think of us. Yeah. That was so bad.  I was sobbing, but I had to do it or I couldn't leave the office.  And so it's weird.  I think, I guess, similar to the takeaways we've already been going into is that perhaps... practice from the shallow end to the deep end in baby steps, right?  So I think that, like, for the example of making eye contact with somebody else, knee to knee, heart to heart. That might be deep end. Right, right, right.  So for something like that, maybe what I just mentioned with, like, doing work in the mirror is your baby step.  Because even the mirror is very hard.  Right.  But, right, like, so practicing, like, kind of being unafraid to be vulnerable and intimate with yourself.  I love that.  Right?  Isn't that interesting?  Um, and then like once, uh, you kind of reach this, um, this point of like self comfort and self love, like then you maybe won't be so afraid to, of what you think somebody else might take away if they have that same intimacy with you.  Does that make sense? I agree 100%.  I do think it comes, that's like a big part of self love is.  you can get to the point where, you know, maybe not every day, but most days to be able to like look yourself in the mirror and be like, I love you, you know, and then all of you, no matter what, we're here for it.  And, and so then when someone else is in that same space with you, you know, whether or not they react in a way that you would hope you can still be like, well, I love me. Right.  You know, but your own safety net, like if you're, if you're, if you're strong enough to be your own safety net, then anybody else's mockery or rejection, um, or perception of you is not gonna shake you.  I think I just found what people are scared of there, um, is, is, um, I think Unfortunately, I don't have the literal Phrasing but like I think there's a fear of like kind of having the carpet pulled out from under you This loss of control and all those things.  But no one can pull the carpet out if if your feet are firmly planted, right?  They're not gonna be strong enough, right?  So that's why Um, finding that strength within yourself first is probably going to be to your best benefit.  Your best defense.  Yeah.  To, in order to have vulnerability and intimacy with other people. And it's also a daily practice.  I don't think any of this stuff is like, well, I've accomplished self love.  Like, let me go about my life.  It's for me, it's a daily practice and you know, some days are better than others, but because I'm, it's like working a muscle, it's like working, you know, whatever you have to, do it every day and keep it up because I think self-love is like a muscle.  I feel like it atrophies if you don't give it attention. So, and that's a valid point.  I do definitely need to.  re-practice some stuff because I think you hit the nail on the head because I used to do more self-therapy for body dysmorphic disorder and kind of like.  once I felt recovered from it I'm like well I don't really need to focus on that anymore because it's not bad as it once was.  But it is kind of like mental illness has a back of the head kind of a haunting way of existing.  And yeah, if you don't practice all the time, if you don't feed it a la Babadook, if you don't feed it, then it might come out and get you. I agree with that.  I agree with that so hard.  And I've, I've seen that a lot with myself and with other people in my life when they are focusing on their mental wellness and they're doing self care.  And I don't mean just like face masks.  I mean like actual self care, um, that everything improves and then they feel good.  And so then they stop and then it, then they're back in a not so good place.  So this is one thing I say all the time, it's a daily practice.  Some days are better than others though.  It's better than not doing it. Wow.  We just cured fear of intimacy. You're welcome.  YouTube. This has been an amazing talk. I'm so glad that we had it.  Like I'm feel revived. I feel ready to like, I feel inspired.  I'm ready to like, to dive back into self therapy.  This was amazing.  Um, so we're now going to shoot a video over for Evelina's channel. Evelina. Evelina. It's fine, everyone does it.  I always do that. Alright, we're going to do a video now for Evelina's channel, and I'm going to put a link in the description, and I will see you eventually.

For a lot of trans people, it makes them question their interests, their expression.  I second-guessed myself a lot growing up because there were a lot of things I liked that were stereotypically boyish that I was very much into and still am into.  I think there's a room for everyone to like what they like, express themselves however they want.  I think that people can understand and get over their biases and their assumptions about how gender stereotypes work.  I think it allows not just trans people but cis people as well to put aside their fears or their generalizations and express themselves in a more truthful manner. If a trans person does not conform to the gender they are transitioning to and has a few aspects that are traditionally to do with their birth gender, it is viewed that they don't know what they're doing or that they're not actually trans enough.  Trans women especially are actually really held to very unrealistic expectations of femininity that you would never really hold anyone else to.  I prefer to wear jeans, t-shirt and a jacket usually and that in no way means that I'm less trans or less of a woman.  everybody has a different self-expression and it is really a very bad and inaccurate way of judging somebody's gender identity.  The best way is just to ask them. When I started going up to the gender clinic in Glasgow I just went up dressed as I normally would which was just sort of jeans and ripped t-shirt.  I didn't feel like I was actually being sort of taken seriously.  In the second appointment I was wearing more sort of stereotypically manly clothes and I feel like I was being taken much better. There are a large amount of people that need to access these services that actually do not identify as male or female and identify either as a mix of both or in between or outside of that or any combination of the spectrum of gender as opposed to being in the binary.  and a lot of the time they are forced to pretend to be something they're not, or told that they should be something they're not, and that what they are is not valid enough.  A lot of them do feel dysphoria, the same as other people, that their gender presentation is just not to the strict standards that doctors have historically required from people, so as a result they have been denied treatment that they need just as much as everybody else. think a lot of people still have this generalization in their head that there's male and female and there's nothing else whereas in reality we've kind of figured out that gender is more of a spectrum that there's male and female and then there's a lot in between encompassing non-binary and various other identities.  The medical profession is a bit behind on this and I think they need to get a bit more aware of issues regarding trans and non-binary people.  There's a lot of difference between how people express themselves and how people identify themselves and figure out ways to best serve the patient's needs rather than trying to fit people in of various boxes. So I was at a GIC appointment and the doctor had asked me if I was interested in being referred for bottom surgery.  And I said it wasn't really something I was interested in at that point.  And she said, oh, that's fine because our gender's a spectrum anyway and non-binary, you probably don't want bottom surgery.  And I thought that was quite a strange assumption to make.  that just because I'd said I didn't want bottom surgery but I would be non-binary because I'd always said that I was like a binary trans man.  It was great that she kind of recognised that gender was a spectrum and that not everyone attending the clinic would be a binary trans person but to assume that a binary trans person wouldn't want bottom surgery or someone not wanting bottom surgery would be non-binary I thought was kind of a bit of a jump to make. Another thing that people have very much experienced is that when they're in the room with a healthcare professional, it feels like a power struggle because the trans person's autonomy has been taken away in that situation and their control over their entire life is in the hands of someone who will never truly understand.  People need to pretend they are something that they aren't.  They need to perform to different standards of gender, different expectations of masculinity and femininity that cisgender people would not be held to in that kind of situation.  There's also been a lot of experience of having to jump through hoops.  It almost feels like you're having to do like an exam or a test to prove that you are trans enough and to kind of have to live up to society's expectations as opposed to being true to yourself, which should be the whole point of this process. It would be so refreshing not to be asked over and over again, why are you taking testosterone?  Are you sure that skin condition is not because of, you know, the hormone blocker?  Gender related medication does not have anything to do with my cold or my broken leg or, you know, with anything to do but taking testosterone or taking hormone blockers. Okay, so I had a GP appointment once and it was completely not trans-related at all.  And the GP was one I hadn't seen before and she was very interested in me being trans, even though that wasn't what I'd be in for at all.  Most of the appointment was her asking me questions like, are you sure you haven't started taking hormones yet?  And I was like, yes.  And then trying to kind of make the subject back onto what I was there for.  And then she'd be asking questions again, like, so you haven't taken anything, you haven't had any surgery.  And saying, wait, so do you want to be a man?  Like, do you sleep with men or women?  I was just about to leave and she kind of said, oh, one more thing.  So do you still get periods?  And I was just like, yeah.  And I just like ran out as fast as I could because it was just so awkward.  Like, I just wanted to answer and leave.  But I just thought I was kind of unprofessional. I have been told before that I'm not ready to go on hormones because of my mental health and they thought that my depression was actually the reason why I was developing these gender issues.  But in fact, it's completely the other way around.  Because if somebody has crippling gender dysphoria and they feel this way every time they look in the mirror and every time they walk out of the house, of course that is going to then give anxiety and possibly depression and other things.  And irrespective of whether a deed poll has happened, a trans person deserves to have their chosen name and their chosen pronouns respected.  When I personally went to the GP and told them about my name change, they refused to update any documents without a deed poll and even then they took a very long time to do so because they didn't see it as something that was that important.  It is incredibly disrespectful to ignore this kind of thing. So one thing I've found quite awkward is if I've had to go book an appointment for something that is typically what a cis woman might have, like a smear test or something, and I go to the desk and ask to book in for that, the receptionist might ask me, like, what would you want one of those for?  You don't need that.  You're a man.  Men don't need those.  And then I have to go into detail and explain, no, it's because I'm trans.  I do need those.  Some men do need those.  And kind of having to educate the receptionist, but also at the same time out myself to whoever can overhear, because... They're usually in quite a public place and there's not much privacy.  People stand quite close behind you.  The chairs are kind of everywhere.  And then you've got to go walk and sit down and kind of just be around all these people who've just overheard you have this quite personal conversation, which is really uncomfortable. When I came out as trans, I'd already done a lot of prior research into how hormones and transition healthcare works.  But when I spoke to my doctor about it, he was unaware of certain issues.  Recently, I had a problem with changing my details in the NHS, and he was unaware of how that works and seemed to just think, I'm stuck with an M on my NHS details.  But I went and did some digging and found that there are ways to do it.  And I had to inform my GP and my practice how to do those things.  And they did them, but they were completely unaware of how these processes work.  A lot of the time, trans people are constantly having to do their own research and find ways to get the health care that they need and inform their GPs when, in reality, I feel more GPs, more doctors need to be aware of these issues forefront and able to inform their patients. Every time I go to the nurse to get my hormone blockers, I need to tell her why she's giving me the hormone blockers, that they're not testosterone, even how it works within my body, what that hormone blocker does.  She's a medical professional.  She should know how all of this works.  It's not her fault.  It is that medical professionals don't get access to this kind of information and don't get a specific course or set of guidelines of what this medication does. Pretty much ever since I started hormones, I basically had to speak to my GP and just let her know exactly how I'm supposed to go through with my care.  Even from sending off my referral to actually be seen by a gender clinic, I had to explain to her what needed to be written in the referral, who it was supposed to go to.  And I mean, I was only 15 at the time and I was having to research how I should be taking care of my own health when I kind of hoped to go to a professional and they would explain that to me.  So after, again, I started hormones, I was basically checking in with my doctor, making sure that they'd received my prescriptions, was checking up on when I was having lighters come through from the gender clinic to them.  so I was basically acting like a middleman the entire time.  I kind of guess I was just hoping that surgeons and the gender clinics and my GP would all kind of speak to each other for me rather than me having to intervene and be the middleman between all these services and it was just a bit confusing and not what I was hoping for out of the health service.  to be honest. It's incredibly important that general practitioners, especially in rural areas where they are less likely to meet a trans person in their everyday life, have enough training on at least the basics of transition, such as the hormones and also the psychological issues that may go alongside being trans.  I was denied lockers on the NHS originally by my local rural funding board because it was deemed unorthodox use of it and that it was a frivolous way to spend NHS money.  And it is very important that we educate people that this is not the case and that we absolutely are deserving of it just as much as anybody else that's suffering with a hormone imbalance. Not enough doctors, nurses, GPs are being educated in just basic trans healthcare.  I think it would benefit a lot of people if there was just more basic training for GPs.  So like, this is how the hormone process works.  This is how you might use a binder and just all these basic little things that can help them along and just alleviate a lot of the pressure on gender identity clinics. A reason why it's very important also for general practitioners to have at least a basic knowledge is so that when a young trans person who has just realised they're trans comes to their doctor asking for assistance, even if the doctor is not knowledgeable on this specific matter, they should at least be able to point them in the right direction to access resources online or clinics or other services that can help them deal with those specific needs.","channel.id":"clxmi0mat00v7cdvio57tdapf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCsDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA","channel.name":"My Genderation","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/g864bFMBAXso_fkzd73ZmSXVmy9E2HHX__MiClzVA-IEppDPNVUpMVC4-dH8_O59GaGahuLOLg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses their experiences as a trans person navigating the healthcare system.

Now, I've already done a video detailing the fact that King Crocoduck was relying on far-right Christian and fascist sources on the Luna Damon Younger case, so if you'd like to know more about that then please do check out my video linked in the description.  It's time for us to move on to review the David Rima case.  We need to discuss the way anti-trans voices are starting to dishonestly frame what occurred to use that case as an attack on trans people.  We also need to discuss the harm said case has caused and still is causing intersex people to this day, since they're the ones who suffer the most as a result of the mistreatment David Rima received at the hands of psychologist John Money.  But let's go back to the beginning.  David Reamer was a cis male born in Canada on August 22nd, 1965, along with his twin brother, Brian.  Now, both David and Brian were diagnosed with Phimosis, and this is where things start to get incredibly messy.  What constitutes Phimosis is disputed even among medical circles.  According to who you talk to, Phimosis may be defined as sighting present in nearly 100% of all newborns born with a phallus, or a rare and potentially harmful medical condition.  And the problems occur when people operating on the basis of the latter definition start diagnosing people on the basis of the first definition, often due to inadequate training, as has been the case in both the US and even Canada.  So rather than taking either the inclusive or exclusive route, I'll be keeping to the two-type model.  There is physiological phimosis, and then there's pathological phimosis.  Starting with physiological phimosis, put simply, this is the inability to attract the foreskin over the glands of the penis, and this is something evidence suggests that as much as 96% of all newborns with a phallus are completely incapable of doing.  Now over time the foreskin naturally becomes detached from the glands as well as stretchier, allowing it to draw back.  and this can happen over a very long period of time.  Whilst many find their foreskin naturally retracts within 6 months, one 2005 study from Denmark found that, and keep in mind that this is a translation, that quote, the boys reported that they were able to pull back their foreskin for the first time at an average age of 10.4, end quote.  Quick thanks to Mycobloganism for their help in clarifying this translation.  So as we can see, not only is this a frequent occurrence, but it's not uncommon for adolescents to attain said trait right up to and even beyond puberty, many without ill effect.  The problems emerge when one conflates this with pathological phimosis, that's when the tissue of the foreskin begins to harden, making naturally occurring retraction impossible.  Now why is there such an issue with this term and how it's being used?  But it all goes back to that puritanical Christian mindset that pushed for circumcision as both a medical and moral imperative.  Accurate information about normal foreskin development was suppressed, allowing doctors to be taught that normal physiological traits were a cause for concern.  Now, how do they alleviate said concern?  Well, circumcision, of course.  Now, I raise this point since, whilst both David and Brian were diagnosed with phimosis and were scheduled for circumcision at seven months of age, only David was operated on.  Brian, meanwhile, was spared said surgery, and later on his foreskin retracted without intervention.  What this suggests is that said phimosis was entirely physiological, and not pathological.  which makes what happened to David even more tragic.  The reason Brian was spared the surgery was because the surgeon who operated on David severely damaged his genitals.  Worried about their child's future health, David's parents took him to John Hopkins Hospital, and that's where John Money entered the picture.  John Money was already carving quite a name for himself with hypotheses about gender and his methods for treating intersex individuals.  John Money was of the impression that gender identity and gender roles were one and the same, and therefore since gender roles are socially enforced, so too was gender identity.  John Money was also of the opinion that any visibly intersex individual should be reassigned female since he believed constructing a functioning penis to be impossible.  So when David and Brian Reamer were brought to him, John Money saw an opportunity to prove his hypothesis.  Not only could he work with a non-intersex child, but one with a twin no less, the ultimate control.  John Money told David's parents that he'd never be happy with a reconstructed penis, and that instead, they should start medically and socially transitioning him into a girl as soon as possible.  And the Remus had seen Money appear on Canadian news to share his views previously.  They had no reason at all to distrust him, so they agreed.  And at 22 months of age, David underwent his first medical procedure to reassign him as a girl.  David's name was changed from the one he'd been given at birth, and he was seen annually by John Money, who assessed him and his development.  and from Money's reports, the reassignment was considered to be an overwhelming success.  It became known as the famous John Joan case, and was used to argue that gender identity was completely malleable over the next few decades.  It became the foundation for various models on the subject that are still used to this day.  The problem?  Money's reporting the situation wasn't accurate.  Somewhere between the ages 9 and 11, David began to realise that the discomfort he felt day to day in his life was the result of the fact that he was not a girl as he'd always been told, but was in fact a boy.  And this was raised with both Money and the other researchers working on the case, but Rima was always told that he was a girl, he has to live as a girl, and there's no other way.  Over the years, his lack of support festered into anxiety and depression, accumulating to the point that David threatened to take his own life if he were forced to see Money again, aged 13.  And two years later, David's father finally told him the truth about what had happened to him as a child.  That's right, up to this point, David had no idea that he'd been assigned male at birth, something which says a lot about gender identity and its inherent nature.  David Riemer was finally allowed to transition back to the man he had always felt he was, yet sadly much of the damage had already been done.  For a start, he never fully repaired his relationship with his parents, and the fallout from what happened caused the family as a whole a great deal of strain.  David was haunted by his past abuse, resulting in mental health problems which undoubtedly affected his work and his relationships.  He was plagued by memories of money's twisted sessions with him.  Then in 2002, David's brother committed suicide, which heavily impacted him.  And in 2004, his wife notified him that she intended to proceed with a divorce.  With no support system in place, all of this proved just too much.  David Riemer, aged 38, committed suicide by firearm.  And whilst I can hardly state into the sole cause of David's tragic death, The man heavily responsible for the environment which proved too much, John Money, passed away two years after David committed suicide at the ripe age of 84.  Now, just to highlight the extremes of what money did to try and drive home David's womanhood, I'd like to take a look at one of the activities he used to do with the twins.  He had Brian, David's twin brother, partake in sexual play with David.  Said process involved David laying on his back with his brother Brian, both of whom were still children, laying between David's legs to form the missionary position.  Brian would then be asked to perform rhythmic thrusting against his brother's groin, imitating the act of sex, all of which Money forwarded as necessary for successful reassignment.  Money also photographed these sessions, yet perhaps most disturbingly, conducted some sessions without the supervision of a second professional.  They would also recall that money would verbally abuse his brother if Brian refused to do what money demanded.  In all, the ordeal was a horrific warning as to what can occur in science if one puts the desire to prove their hypothesis before the wellbeing of their patients.  But how does this relate to trans children and their treatment?  Well, for a start, it demonstrates that gender identity is not something we can change.  If the combined efforts of the medical establishment can't change the gender of a single child, then that won't happen because trans people have a growing presence in society.  Also, anime is not turning your children trans, something which sounds like it should be a given, But people actually believe that.  As for its application in the way the anti-trans crowd throws it out there, if anything it shows the exact opposite.  It tells us that if children were being pushed into transitioning, we'd expect to see the same anxiety and depression as we did with David Riemer in them.  But we don't.  And that comes down to a very fundamental difference in what occurred here versus what happens with potentially trans children.  David Riemer was forced to reassign, in spite of his wishes not to.  The same is not true of the fierce teenagers on Puberty Blockers.  And that's another difference, the most that a potentially trans child will be put on are fully reversible puberty blockers which have no known ill effects.  And this is done after the early onset of puberty, allowing an adolescent to delay the process long enough to reach an informed decision with the support of trained professionals.  And it's not a case of simply fumbling around in the dark.  Studies have found key differences between children who are simply showing behaviours outside of traditional gender roles, and those whose gender identity does not align with the gender they were assigned at birth.  And as a good consensus does, said understanding correlates perfectly with what the David Riemer case study tells us.  The age at which David began to realise that his gender did not align with what money and his parents told him, fits in line with this understanding of the recognisation of gender identity as one matures.  Now before this video I had knowledge of David's life, and I always stated that reading what he went through as a trans person looked a lot like gender dysphoria to me.  But during all of this I found some evidence that suggested that David himself made the same connection, something which speaks to the need to support people who think they may be trans at a young age in exploring themselves and figuring out the best path for them.  So this transphobic application of the David Rima case holds no water at all.  But as mentioned before, trans people are not the only ones with a stake in this conversation.  After David had committed suicide, John Money found himself come under heavy criticism.  In response, he asserted that his critics were conservatives looking to protect gender stereotypes, stating quote, They say masculinity and femininity are built into the genes so women should get back to the mattress and the  kitchen.\".  First of all, this screams hypocrisy.  Money's entire process from the way he dressed David right down to the sexual play involved forcing him to adhere to strict gender norms.  Any time David deviated, Money saw that as a challenge to his hypothesis and chastised David for it.  So this bullshit claim does not fly.  David never gave a damn about dismantling stereotypes, and if it's not already clear, gender identity does not equal gender stereotypes.  But what's more is that a great deal of the criticism came from intersex advocacy groups, groups representing the demographic which has been most harmed by John Money's hypotheses about gender.  For those who don't know what intersex refers to, it's a label applied to a variety of sexual presentations.  You see, sex as a concept can be divided into a number of features, such as gametes, karyotype-slash-chromosomal expression, internal sexual organs, gonads, and hormones, though funnily enough, certain ones are removed or others are added and further divided in specific discussions.  For example, there's been a push to separate hormone production and reception since people with androgen sensitivity produce testosterone at rates equivalent to your average cis male, but their cells physically cannot utilise it.  In that vein, I would personally ask us to consider gender identity as part of the physical brain amongst their traits.  but that's a different conversation.  Thing is, all people have some sexual variance.  Almost all men produce some estrogen, and almost all women produce some testosterone.  The label intersex, however, only applies to the most significant examples of this blending.  though the standards can be rather arbitrary, such as the phallometer, the unofficial name given to the real phallus measurement instrument by intersex advocates, such as the Intersex Society of America.  And it's on the basis of said arbitrary rulings that many intersex infants and children are subject to the same cruel treatments as David Riemer, all thanks to Money's insistence that not only is gender malleable, but it's in the child's best interest to do so.  As a result, countless infants undergo unnecessary cosmetic procedures designed to, and I put this in captions, normalise their body.  Doctors often forward this under the premise that, without said procedure, said infants would always be excluded from society.  So, rather than taking a curative approach and, say, tackling the misinformation and prejudice out there about intersex people, they set about using palliative surgery that ensures it goes unchallenged.  Because intentions aside, said surgery further stigmatises said intersex status.  That'd be like bleaching the skin of babies of colour just so they'd never have to deal with racism.  Not only would that be a horrific practice, it very likely wouldn't work.  When it comes to intersex people, very often the intersex status is kept hidden from them until they're an adult.  A common practice for intersex people with internal testes is to tell the child that they have ovarian cancer which needs immediate surgical treatment, else they could die.  Because many parents feel better telling their child that they have cancer than letting them know that they're amongst 2% of all live births with some form of recognised intersex status, which is really part of a much wider sexual diversity seen throughout humanity.  Though, it's not really fair to blame the parents, since it's typically the doctors who push them into doing so.  And that's why intersex groups from around the globe are calling for the depathologisation of intersex statuses.  And if you'd like to get involved in that, then please, follow the link to the statement on screen and get in touch with one of the 66 organisations from around the world listed in support of said action.  they really could do with the help.  There are also charities like Genital Autonomy, which is where this pin comes from, which advocate against all forms of child genital mutilation.  if a more general approach is your thing.  Because the fact is, whether or not a child's genitals are performed on surgically for non-medically necessary reasons, should be up to that child when they grow up.  Most intersex people will grow up perfectly healthy without said surgery, meaning it offers them no benefit yet has great cost in their bodily autonomy.  And that's without even considering the eugenics angle in all of this.  and how many intersex people who are capable of having children are forcefully sterilised to ensure their genes don't propagate since they're seen as undesirable.  So benign are the effects of being intersex that many intersex people slip under the radar.  Due to many of the traits such as karyotype and hormone levels not being obvious from birth, many intersex people never get detected until much later down the line, and luckily for them, that allows them to retain portions of their bodily autonomy their fellow people lack.  So not only does the case of David Rima do absolutely nothing to paint supporting trans children in a negative light, rather the opposite, but said case study has and is still being used to harm millions of people globally.  And you know what, I would love to see the energy wasted on trying to police trans bodies go towards actually dismantling something which is far closer to what many people attempt to try to paint trans supportive healthcare as being.  But I doubt that's about to happen, since that'd require much of the fear-mongering surrounding trans people to be based on simply being misinformed, rather than active bigotry setting out to cast us as evil.  But those of us who actually care about human wellbeing can take steps to educate others on the science of the subject, and in doing so, hopefully make the world a slightly more tolerant place.  But what do you lot think?  Why do people lie about the David Rima case to try and support their bigotry?  Is their practice exploitative, not simply harming trans people, but failing to address the harm caused to intersex people?  What can we do to show further solidarity and active support for intersex people?  Did I miss something you not noticed?  If so, be sure to leave us a comment down below.

David was born with a rare medical condition called phimosis, which was misdiagnosed as a rare and potentially harmful condition. Money, who believed that gender identity was malleable, convinced David's parents to medically and socially transition him into a girl. David underwent numerous procedures, including surgery to remove his genitals, and was forced to participate in sexual play with his twin brother to reinforce his female identity.\n\nHowever, David eventually realized that he was not a girl and began to experience anxiety and depression. He was forced to continue living as a girl, despite his wishes to transition back to male. David's story is often cited by anti-trans activists as an example of the dangers of allowing trans children to transition, but the video argues that this is a misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nThe video also discusses the harm caused to intersex people by Money's theories and the medical establishment's treatment of intersex individuals. Many intersex people are subjected to unnecessary cosmetic procedures, including surgery to \"normalize\" their bodies, which can have serious physical and emotional consequences.\n\nThe video concludes by highlighting the need for education and solidarity with intersex people, who are often marginalized and excluded from discussions about trans rights.

I live in Montreal Quebec.  so this is what I'm gonna be talking about.  I lived in different places all over the world.  to be honest I lived in Algeria which is where I'm from.  I lived in Malaysia.  I stayed in Indonesia as well for quite some time that I know a lot about it and now I'm in Canada.  so I kind of have always somewhere to compare it to like.  you know what i mean.  so we may not have the same like per perspective of it because you know someone that has why.  why?  why i feel like there's a lot of dust going on.  i feel like someone that has grown here lived here their whole life.  this is what they have seen their entire life will always find something to like.  hate about it i guess because you just get bored of it.  but if you lived somewhere that is horrible you're gonna appreciate the you know.  Yeah.  No, I'm not saying that it's, like, extremely, like, perfection, but in my opinion, in my humble opinion, I think Canada is one of the best countries in the world for LGBT rights, mainly because, yes, homophobia, transphobia could exist somewhere.  I haven't really dealt with any.  But then again, I don't know, because I'm passing, and not everyone knows I'm trans.  Like, very rare people know I'm trans in real life.  Not because I'm stealth or anything, I just, like, I don't feel the need to talk about it unless I do.  In that case, you know, there aren't many people around me that know I'm trans.  But, you know, whenever I need to come out, you know, in legal papers dealing with all that stuff, People are actually very understanding.  I just tell them, you know, if you're confused about my legal papers on trans, they're like, oh, okay, good for you.  And they're supportive.  And I'm like, okay, cool.  And I'm not used to that.  And I'm not used to this clothing.  being trans to anybody to begin with, especially legally, because I live somewhere that being trans is kind of, you know, not safe.  So I feel like I'm rambling.  I'm rambling.  I'm not even speaking.  Bref.  I feel like here race plays a big role, like in North America, rather than being trans.  The good thing about living in Canada is that, you know, you feel legally protected fully, you know, when it comes to your rights.  If anybody disrespects you for being trans, there is legal action you could take, as far as I checked last time I checked.  I have not encountered any situation personally for me that was harmful, dangerous, or in any way, not even disrespectful, like not at all, maybe just curiosity to a certain extent, but nothing major.  I have to also say that it depends on where you live in Canada.  So I live in one of Canada's biggest cities, so it's not going to be the same as in like somewhere, you know, on like the countryside, on like the mountains type of things.  it's not gonna be the same way because people here are way more educated on these stuff and you see them everywhere and you get what I mean, you know?  Because I know LGBT people that live outside of Montreal and they tell me like I'm the only one there, you know?  So I'm the only trans visible person out there.  so like people yes give me looks and stuff.  but again the fact that you're legally protected to a certain extent Personally makes me feel very safe, which is one of the reasons why I chose Canada.  I chose Canada because I knew it would be very trans friendly.  I think in my opinion, Canada is way more trans friendly than the US.  That is just my opinion, change my mind.  LA may be better, but like if we compare the countries as a whole, you know?  Also, if you're trans here and you have health insurance, health... If you have your medical... If you have your medical card in Canada, your surgery is gonna be covered, your hormones are gonna be covered.  So... Right?  Honestly, this is one of the topics that really interests me so much.  I feel like I may do something on my personal channel.  that would be like a project I don't know yet I'm just literally sharing random thoughts with you that where I could get different people from different countries in the world to talk about their trans experience and how it is and to compare it because I lived in different places and I was like God like it's just so different.  it's just so different especially people that live in Africa and Asia.  I feel like those need to be given even more platform to speak about their experience.  I don't know, I'll do something.  I don't know what I'll do, but this is the ultimate goal.  Imagine a Netflix show with trans people sharing their experiences.  Wouldn't that be fucking amazing?  I'm just dreaming.  So tell me about your experience.  Where do you come from?  How is it?  Where would you like to live if it wasn't there?  What is the country that you think would be better for you as a trans person?  Thank you for watching and I'll see you later.

It's Sunday.  I'm CJ and I'm a little bit of a broken CJ.  I was leaving my partner's house on Monday and the floor was slippy and I decided that I would give gravity a chance.  So I've just, I've sprained my shoulder slightly and it's fine.  I'm going for the, like, give me sprain but make it fashion.  So, um, yes, that is what is going on here.  I think medical transition is actually the thing I'm going to talk about this week.  I really, I haven't covered a lot of that.  I haven't talked about my own personal transition.  I understand that talking about dysphoria is one of those things that people get very, very uncomfortable about.  And I get that that is something that is a challenge for people.  And I also think that dysphoria is more and less than we think it is.  But I'm not saying that you have to have dysphoria to be trans.  I'm not saying anything about what your dysphoria may or may not be like.  I'm solely talking about me.  So I went to my GP and I said, hey, I think I might be trans.  And my doctor was like, I don't know what to do with you.  And I was like, fair.  I don't know what to do with me either.  Because at this point I was 28 years old.  28 years old, yeah, 28 years old.  Doesn't fit a lot of the narratives, you know.  And sure, looking back, I feel like one of the things about being trans is that you look back and you're like, oh, that was so much more trans than originally intended.  You know, the stories people have of things that I did and ways of behaving and, you know, my life in general.  When I look back, I'm like, oh, yeah, it was kind of only ever going one of one of one place.  But at the time, it was not.  it was not like the narrative likes to describe it.  I felt challenged in my body, but I felt a million other things.  at the same time and none of it dysphoria wasn't a thing that I had a name for.  discomfort I had a name for.  I knew I was uncomfortable.  I also kind of thought that that was just how I was supposed to feel in my body and it took until I think I really got to the point where I had like good friends and people that I could talk to where I was like oh shit like this isn't something that everybody has to go through all of the time like it is possible to feel comfortable in your own body and that doesn't mean like Or you have to love yourself.  I mean, it's great if you love yourself and I hope you love yourself.  But that doesn't have to be something that you worry about.  But you should be able to live with yourself and sleep with yourself and be present in your own skin.  And I wasn't and I didn't.  and I went to the doctors and I was 28 and I was like, shit, you know, this is this is fucked up.  And my doctor was like, yeah, sounds terrible.  I'm gonna refer you because I don't know what to do with you.  So let's do that.  And I was like, oh, okay.  And then nothing happened for two years.  Which, you know, that's the side of medical transition in the UK right now, the reality of it.  that's horrendous.  I started my testosterone journey, my medicalization journey, on the 28th of October 2016, which means that I have been on T for two and a half years until I stopped being on T last month.  And the reason that I've stopped being on T, and the reason that I've stopped like medically transitioning, ooh, really hard to do bunny ears when you've only got one hand.  The reason I've stopped medically transitioning is because I'm actually going through a fertility treatment.  I would like to see if there's an option of me potentially having a child who's biologically related to me.  I am 33 years old, and so now is a good time, perhaps the only time in my life I'm gonna be able to do this and have there be much of a viability.  So that is what I'm going through at the minute, which is weird, because it's obviously made me address my testosterone journey a little bit more.  There were things about being on testosterone that I loved.  I feel like we talk about those a lot, Deeper voice, loved it.  Facial hair, brilliant.  like body hair, as someone who's never been particularly hairy, I have a chestnut now that I really love.  And that is something that I just had never considered would make me feel as good as it makes me feel.  There was also downstairs growth, which I was not necessarily expecting.  And it's one of those things that I feel like I really had to Google to find out more about.  You know, the other things that also came with it, you know, I kind of went through the menopause.  And going through menopause and like puberty at the same time is one of those things where I've just never been so hot and sweaty and angry and horny.  and hungry all at the same time.  It was genuinely like the least civil war breaking out inside my body.  So that was real frustrating.  You know, people told me that I'd be angry a lot.  I'm not really an angry person.  So that was never, that never really kicked in.  I did have spikes of kind of temper and things like that.  Worst of all, I think it was that I could notice when I was getting into the troughs, I could physically feel that like stuff wasn't cool.  And that was weird.  It was also kind of amazing because I've never had the kind of relationship with my body where that would be something that I would pick up on and pay attention to.  So that felt kind of glorious because I was like, hey, I'm understanding what is happening.  You know, I kind of want to talk about the testosterone thing.  I'm not saying that anybody else's experiences are wrong.  And I'm not saying that they didn't feel what they felt.  because that's, why would I do that?  But their experiences were not my experiences.  I had so much overwhelming anxiety about testosterone and whether or not it was a thing that I should do and whether or not I felt right and whether that my first injection of testosterone just felt like something else to be worried about.  And then I had injections of testosterone that didn't go well.  Had been going to a nurse.  It was never something that I didn't dread.  To get my testosterone was always difficult.  To get my nurse appointment was always difficult.  I'd had it when nurses had messed up the testosterone injections.  One of the things that can happen is if the needle doesn't go into your body properly, you end up with like a kind of lump of testosterone because it's quite a thick substance and it really needs to go into the muscle.  and mine didn't and so it just left me with like a really odd painful kind of testosterone blister I guess.  So testosterone isn't ever something that I've been able to feel just like unmitigated joy over.  I've also always felt really medicalised.  My doctors.  at the moment, my GP surgery doesn't have a resident nurse which has meant for the past few shots I've been going to the hospital to have my shots.  and my relationship with hospitals is not great.  Not least because I have a mother who has been in and out of hospital with tests and things like that for the past two years.  My parents are elderly.  My relationship with hospitals is very much tied in with the ideas of, you know, death and sadness and mortality and the idea of going to get my testosterone from somewhere like that gave me this kind of complex in my head that didn't feel like unbridled joy and It was only through talking to other trans guys that I really felt like, oh, I'm not actually by myself in thinking that.  Which isn't the same as me saying that it's wrong.  Like, I don't think that me going on testosterone was a bad thing to do.  You have this idea that it's going to be the best thing ever, and it might be.  It may be the best thing ever for you to be on testosterone, and the minute you have it, everything in your body feels alive and aligned, and I hope so badly that that is the experience that you have on testosterone.  if you choose to go on testosterone if you choose to go on testosterone and that's not your experience that's also okay too.  there's a million and one reasons why being in testosterone might feel a little bit fraught and a little bit tense and that's okay.  so yeah so i think it's it's okay to feel troubled and confused and also because you're going through puberty and i gotta tell you i scarcely survived puberty.  the first time.  the second time was was torture.  um and i'm a little trepidatious about what the third time is going to be like because It's just a lot of confusion, really.  So yeah, and of course it's weird now because I had just kind of gotten used to what my body was doing and knowing all of that kind of thing.  and now I'm not on testosterone anymore.  And I'm still the same person in my head, and now I'm going through a different kind of newness.  And I'm still non-binary, and I still identify as being transmasculine, and I still see myself as being transmasculine.  And I'm nervous.  You know, this is very new for me.  And that kind of relationship with my body and how my body fits in the world is now going to be changed again.  And I don't know what that holds for me or what that means.

I recently sprained my shoulder and I'm using this opportunity to talk about my medical transition journey. I'm 33 years old and I started my testosterone journey in 2016, but I've stopped taking it to undergo fertility treatment. I want to explore the complexities of medical transition and how it affects individuals differently.\n\nWhen I first started taking testosterone, I experienced a range of emotions, from anxiety to frustration. I had difficulty getting my nurse appointments and injections, and I even had a painful testosterone blister due to a botched injection. I felt medicalized and my relationship with hospitals was already strained due to my mother's health issues.\n\nI want to emphasize that everyone's experience with testosterone is unique, and it's okay to feel troubled or confused. I've had to navigate the challenges of puberty twice, and I'm now facing a new kind of newness as I adjust to not being on testosterone. My identity as a transmasculine person remains the same, but my relationship with my body is changing.\n\nI'd love to hear from you about your take on medical transition. How do you feel about it? Are you considering it or have you already gone through it?

Hey guys, it's Kat, and it's time for another episode of True Tea.  I wanted to thank you guys for joining me for yet another episode of True Tea.  I appreciate those of you guys who are here every single week, and also I wanted to give a special shout out to those of you guys who have been here long enough to have heard me repeat some stories that I've told before.  Those of you guys who watched my video a couple weeks ago about why I am not a dom will have, and if you've been a long-term follower, you will have acknowledged that this was an old story that I'd already told.  I had an animated series where I told that story before.  And I appreciate those of you guys who have been with me long enough to have seen those videos.  And if you've been with me that long, you'll notice that those videos are now private aid.  They're no longer available.  But I did put them in a little playlist over here for those special people who care to see those old animated videos that I used to make.  So I'll put that right here for you guys to watch.  But yeah, I want to give a special thanks to those of you guys.  And if you're brand new here, what we like to do here is learn, share, and grow through education and conversation.  And this right here is the conversation segment.  This is where we talk about just the things that are on my mind, the things that relate to my personal life, the things that honestly I just sort of think about and feel like talking about.  And I like that.  we have a lot of really deep conversations in the comments section.  And that's really what this is all about.  My, my perspectives are not always correct.  They're not always measured, but they are my honest, true tea, right?  So that's what we're here to talk about.  And if you're into that sort of thing, you know, I think you should subscribe.  We'd like to do that here every single week on Tuesdays, usually at 6pm Pacific standard time, even though this video is definitely not being uploaded then.  So anyway, yeah, let's jump into this video.  But before we do, I would highly suggest that you go and grab yourself something to drink.  Personally, I am drinking some water because it is so hot.  If you can't already tell, I just, I try to film these videos at night, but I've had a really hard time filming these videos and have to film during the day.  It's stressing me out and I'm sweating quite a bit.  So let me drink my water and then we'll get into this conversation once again.  So I wanted to have a conversation about something that's been going on in my feed specifically on Twitter, right?  Um, I want to talk to you guys about pronouns because there's been a little bit of a discourse happening right now and I felt like I would share it with you guys because this particular conversation is honestly a true representation of some of the things that I was sort of referencing when I was talking about not always really having a full perspective when I used to make certain videos about certain things, you know?  And pronoun conversations definitely went a certain way for me when I was coming out of stealth, living in Orange County and not really having to engage with a community where people were discussing pronouns, where people were talking about pronouns, right?  Some of you guys know that I sort of became more popular on the internet because I was in a Buzzfeed video where I specifically talked about pronouns, right?  And after I made that video, I made another video talking specifically about pronouns.  And one of the bits of advice that I gave was if you don't know somebody's pronouns to use they, them and their pronouns until you know that those are the right ones, right?  Again, that's an example of something that I used to say when I wasn't so engaged in a certain community.  that now I feel differently about because personally for me, I definitely feel a lot of discomfort around people using they pronouns with me simply because they know that I'm transgender.  Right.  So I want to talk a bit about that.  I want to unpack that, go into my feelings about that, go into misgendering a bit more and yeah.  So this conversation started out by a tweet that I saw And this tweet was by someone named Diana Terje and she says, sometimes it's funny when you're the only trans person in a space where everyone's announcing their pronouns.  Like it gets to you and a hush falls over the room and you just like check your phone because only cis people need to be working on their pronoun game.  Right now, ContraPoints AKA Natalie Wynn respond to this and she says, this has happened to me before in hyper woke spaces.  Like it's me and a bunch of cis women and we all have to go in a circle saying she and her because I'm there.  She goes on to say, there's this paradox where I can go into a sports bar in North Carolina and be missed and ma'am all night.  No questions.  But in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces, I have to explain my pronouns and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves every time they say, you guys.  I guess it's good for people who only use they and them pronouns and want gender neutral language, but it comes at a minor expense to semi-passable trans women like myself.  That's super fucking hard for us.  And I actually really understood where this is coming from because this is actually something that I've dealt with, right?  You know, as a trans person, as a binary trans person specifically, I worked really, really, really, really hard to get to a point where people were looking at me, assuming my gender and gendering me properly.  Now, of course, my story is different from a lot of people's because my goal ultimately in life at a certain point was to be stealth, right?  And so that was really, really invested in maintaining these cisnormative ideas about what a woman looks like, how women are, da, da, da, da, classical femininity.  I had a lot of stake in these sort of ideas and it was all sort of created so that people would look at me and assume my gender, be correct and not be in a situation or I was being misgendered anymore.  Right.  And you know, I made a whole video over here where I talk a little bit more in depth about what it feels like to be misgendered.  But for me, being misgendered always felt like an attempt to embarrass me.  Right.  And you know, honestly, most of us are just out here trying to survive.  And for someone like myself, the goal was always to be, have my gender assumed and have it assumed correctly.  Right?  That's a very large component of what for me puts my dysphoria at bay.  Um, now sometimes when we have these conversations about, you know, pronouns and stuff, I'll be honest and say that it's an interesting paradox for me because I do feel a little dysphoric when people are specifically asking me for my pronouns because they know that I'm transgender.  Right.  And it's a confusing thing because, you know, on one hand, You know, when I was in college and I was coming out and I was figuring my stuff out, I would have killed for somebody to pull me aside and ask me what my pronouns were instead of assuming them and then misgendering me.  But now I feel very differently because there's so much space between that first couple of years of my trans life and where I am now almost a decade later, well, over a decade later.  And I think what it sort of triggers for me are those sort of defensive feelings, that sort of defensive reaction, right?  But I think one of the big things to acknowledge here, I think one of the most important things to acknowledge here upfront right away is that I have an incredible amount of privilege, right?  When I go through the world, I go into most spaces, and again, people now look at me, assume my gender, assume that I'm a woman, assume that I'm a she, her, and hers, and that's correct.  And that is an incredible privilege.  amount of privilege that your average non-binary person does not have.  I mean, for a lot of non-binary people, there's no such thing as passing as non-binary.  There's no such thing as looking non-binary and people just being able to look at you and assume that you use they, them, and their pronouns.  And then there's non-binary people who don't even use they, them, and their pronouns.  It's a very complicated, complex thing, right?  And non-binary people don't really play into, in fact, they're fighting against the cis-normative sort of ideas of gender that have made me feel so affirmed and welcomed and at home, right?  And so there's this weird way in which I think both of these sort of goals, right, are sort of working against each other.  You have trans people who, you know, trans people who are binary trans who say, you know, I want people to assume my gender and get that correct.  That is my goal.  That's what I want, right?  That's, even if it's not where I'm at now, it's where I'm trying to be.  And then you have people who say, well, I don't want you to assume my gender.  Right.  And so for me, that leaves me with a big question mark about how do we solve this.  right now, whenever we have these conversations, a lot of times non-binary people are sort of made to feel as though they are inconveniencing.  Um, people, right?  I, you know, obviously when we have these conversations about what, what are your pronouns, what are your, this, what are your, that's a lot of that is made in order to show support, right?  It's a, it's an attempt at sort of showing allyship to trans people, to non binary people, right?  And I have, you know, however, that all being said, I have my reaction to it.  Right.  And so I, this was a very interesting sort of bit of discourse for me to see in my feet because a lot of people were upset with Natalie because she was expressing that this sort of makes her uncomfortable, that being in these spaces where you have this sort of standardized, let me disclose what exactly my pronouns are.  it kind of makes people feel a little uncomfortable.  And I mean, to her point, a lot of times this happens and it feels like a very indirect way of attempting to clock somebody, right?  It happens a lot of times when people suspect that someone is trans.  suspect that someone has certain pronouns.  And in that way, sort of having a pronoun conversation draws attention to it in a way that a lot of trans people, especially ones who are binary, just don't truly feel comfortable with.  But again, it's this sort of complicated dance because this is something done in order to make people feel more included.  And a lot of times when binary trans people like Natalie complain about it, it seems like they're complaining about trying to be inclusive to non-binary people.  Now, one of the big things that I want us all to acknowledge in this conversation is that we're not really fighting against each other.  Binary trans people and non-binary trans people, like I said, we may have separate approaches when it comes to how we feel about pronouns.  But if we're being honest, if we're being real, what we're both fighting against is this sort of pressure to assimilate into cis normative standards.  That is what we're both sort of navigating around is this sort of thing that we're both sort of going through where people need to assume gender.  Obviously, assuming gender for most trans people, I would argue all trans people, has been something that at one point in our timeline has been incredibly hurtful, incredibly oppressive to us.  It's prevented a lot of us from being able to live the lives that we'd like to live.  In a way, I think sometimes we need to stop sort of looking at, oh, you know, non-binary people are making it inconvenient or binary people are sort of, you know, making us feel unwelcomed and understand that what we're both fighting against is the cis-normative standards.  Now, of course, everybody's feelings are valid.  Everybody's positions are, you know, valid.  And, you know, for me, where I sort of, my reaction sort of has, it comes from, you know, It's dysphoria and dysphoria isn't going to make any sense.  You have this practice that people do in order to make people feel included, but it makes me feel kind of alienated.  One of the things that I talked about on Twitter when I was sort of responding to a lot of this stuff was that this practice makes me feel alienated and so I tend to avoid most spaces where this is standardized.  We've already made a video on this channel about, you know, my discomfort in, you know, queer spaces and things like that.  But ultimately, um, when I know that I ha I'm going to go to a place where this is sort of a normal thing, I just try not to sort of engage with that.  I mean, I can really count the times that I put she, her and hers on, you know, my, my, my ID tags and any of these events that I've gone to with that standardized.  on one hand, it's It's just not really a thing that I find myself doing because for me, I feel like I guess my gender is obvious and somehow drawing attention to that does sort of trigger my dysphoria.  And what I want to communicate is that that feeling is valid, right?  But the big question that I have with that is, you know, a lot of times when we talk about allyship, we sort of talk about how allyship is supposed to be uncomfortable.  And maybe part of me being an ally to non-binary people is swallowing that discomfort that I have with people needing me to talk about my pronouns.  Because in truth, if we all standardize the practice of discussing pronouns, this would be less of a thing, right?  It would feel less like people are specifically targeting trans people.  They're only doing this when trans people in the room and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  When it was just a standardized thing across the board.  Right now, you know, I feel like this is a complicated conversation because to some degree, I think that people are always going to assume pronouns.  They're always going to look at somebody and assume their pronouns.  But maybe if we moved to a point where we were having this conversation, it would be less of a thing that felt jarring to me.  So I don't truly know what a solution in this conversation would be, which is why I'm asking you guys this question.  What do you guys think we should do?  Because on one hand, I don't want any non-binary people to feel alienated about these things.  On the other hand, I know I feel alienated when I feel like people are only asking about people's pronouns because I'm in the room.  You know, that for me doesn't feel like a safe and comfortable, happy place for me to be.  right?  But where does that leave us?  Where do we go?  I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.  So anyway, on that note, I will talk to you guys next week.  Right now, you're looking at two videos that you can watch if you want to continue to sip true tea right here on this channel.  And you know, you've got a little area in the corner where if you feel like sending me a tip, if you feel so inclined, you can do so.  Anyway, I'm melting.  So I'm going to go and I will see you guys next Tuesday.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0oqh02kncdvicaxc7qeq","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxFWzKZa74SyAqpJyVlG5Ew","channel.name":"Kat Blaque","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJWT7XDNz1Vl0sA7fBPrC4jkoFJO34GYvdMQlqX0Vg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2013-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, it's Kat from True Tea.

It's a really gendered place.  And so my gym, so I live in Colorado Springs and it's known to be a bit more of a conservative town.  And the part of town my gym is in is in a conservative part of the town.  It's a long story as to why I live there, but take it for what it's worth.  So anyway, I was in a cycling class at the gym the other day and the air conditioner wasn't working.  And so the instructor at some point was saying just about how hard it is and that afterwards it's going to be really hard for her to take her bra off.  because of how soaked it'll be with sweat and was saying that she wrote to a company and told them that they should create more that have zippers on the front so they could take them off more easily after a sweaty workout.  know i thought it was a good story because she was explaining what it is how.  it's a struggle that like people who make bras let's say are people let's say who don't understand that that's an issue that happens.  maybe it's like a man was in charge of the design.  so i appreciated the story but then um then she started talking about.  she looked around the room and then she said So everybody in here knows what I'm talking about except for the one guy that's in here and she kind of pointed him out.  And so yeah, so there's a lot to unpack with that.  So first of all, yes, that means that she made an assumption that there are only women in this room and one men.  So all women and one man.  So that's an assumption where I specifically was left out, not seen accurately as who I am.  You know, there's this sense of feeling invisible when that happens.  Those of you who know what I mean, you know what I mean.  So then usually I just kind of keep it in that area of it just being very personal and specific to my experience.  But then I realized, I started thinking about it.  I was like, how many other people did she maybe just make assumptions about in this room?  And therefore, they too could be feeling invisible right now.  For one, let's say, what if somebody in this room has had a mastectomy?  and they are therefore unable to wear a bra.  So there's an assumption.  What if that man or the person that she assumed to be a man was actually, for one, not a man?  For two, what if he was wearing a bra?  Obviously, she's leaving out people who are non-binary identified.  She's leaving out anybody who's not wearing a bra, which could also be those in the class who maybe have smaller chests and they wish they could be wearing a bra, but they can't.  And so There's a lot of different people that her comment was potentially leaving out.  And so the reason I'm sharing this is because oftentimes when these kind of things happen, I just think about my own experience or I'm just having my own experience.  And something about this made me remember that I'm not the only one who is being marginalized or made invisible.  In those moments, I still, I'm working on how and when to speak up about that.  I still am not gonna approach her about it.  If she ends up being one of my instructors and it happens like over and over and over again, I am gonna say something to her.  But you know, I thought about the other people too.  Maybe if I do say something about my particular experience, maybe it'll remind some of these instructors that there's other people that they're making assumptions about as well.  I also took this as a time to think about my own language.  When is it that I'm potentially using language that is creating that same feeling in someone else where I have left somebody out because of the language I'm using?  I just will toss that out there to you as something to think about as well.  And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts, like especially what are other ways that you think that we can work on our language?  There's so many other different ways people can be marginalized.

It's something that I started thinking about because I could actually participate in No Shave November.  I could have been able to participate in No Shave November since I started going through puberty.  So this partially has nothing to do with me being non-binary transmasculine.  I have what is considered to be above average testosterone naturally, and above average means above female, So truly, it's not really because I'm not female.  But anyway, so what that means is that even though I was going through female puberty, I was growing more than normal hair on all sorts of parts of my body.  I did not know at the time why or what was going on and I didn't talk to anybody about it.  So this would have been like the late 80s.  And so it was really helpful when I got older, when I found out that I have, again, quote, elevated testosterone.  I don't feel like that's what has made me non-binary, but it does work out nicely where that amount of testosterone actually helps me feel more balanced.  There was one time in my life, I talked about this before, where I took an herbal remedy to lower it, like before.  I knew I was non-binary.  And my doctor suggested it and I felt terrible, terrible having like average or normal testosterone for a female.  So anyway, this whole thing about me being able to grow facial hair, I haven't talked about it publicly yet.  This might be the first time I'm talking about it publicly.  I used to be really ashamed of it when I was probably 14.  I was standing in front of my English class and I was about to like give this like book report or something.  And this kid in the class was like, I think Dara's growing a beard.  I'll never forget that.  And I'm pretty sure it was shortly after that that I just would start taking like whatever razor I was using to shave my legs.  I would just like run it across my face and just try to like just dry.  Like I didn't know anything about shaving my face.  And so I was just doing that.  I'd carry it around in my car in case I forgot to bring it with me.  It was very embarrassing.  I didn't know what was going on.  I hid it from people.  I didn't talk about it until like I told a friend of mine in like 2004.  So I would have been 30 years old.  Before I even like felt like I confessed this to somebody, I ended up telling my partner probably like four years after we had been together.  And I felt like it was this huge revelation.  I was like, I wanted you to know, like in case I'm ever in the hospital in a coma, my facial hair is going to start growing and you're going to have to shave it for me.  So I just wanted to let you know that.  Fast forward to the present day.  And a couple years ago, I decided that I didn't want to be like ashamed of it anymore because I figured it out.  Like this is just a thing that happens.  And I happen to be an individual who is non-binary.  And if I wanted to, I could grow facial hair.  It's a little.  it would be patchy.  It's like a little bit like here and here.  And then like... So I would be kind of curious to see how it would come in.  But I started using the Dollar Shave Club to get razors from.  And I have like this whole thing when I get out of the shower now where I put shaving... cream on and I, you know, I've learned how to shave properly and it feels so much better.  It feels actually very like gender euphoric to me instead of just trying to like be like do it in the shower and really quick and be embarrassed and shy about it.  I actually really enjoy doing it now.  So anyway, back to the question at hand, why am I not going to grow out my facial hair for No Shave November?  I'm not really sure if I want to.  And so let's say there's two different reasons for it.  Well, one reason, which is the big question, is that I'm not sure if I actually would like it.  I'm the kind of person that... Actually, I do not like body hair at all.  And so I am like I shave.  It's not because it's a gender thing or I feel like am I being really womanly when I do this?  or whatever.  I don't label it as a gender thing.  It's a Dara thing.  I just don't like having hair.  I shave my arms because I have nice tattoos and I don't want the hair interrupting it.  So it could be just one of those things where clean face is my preference.  However, I do have to say when I see like a person with a nice, you know, beard, I don't know, like there's a part of me that's like, well, that's kind of cool.  And I can't tell if it's something where I'm like, I would like to give that a try.  Or if it's something where I'm like, you know, if I was desiring more masculine features and then maybe I would grow a beard.  Like if I was actually like on testosterone, like at a high level, like to create deeper voice and more facial hair, like that would feel, if that would feel very gender affirming for me.  And so I'm actually not sure.  I don't know if it's because of my fear of awkwardness, discomfort, blah, blah, blah, about society.  If I was to do No Shave November, how would my family react to my friends?  And how much confusion would I cause in the general public by doing this?  What would you all think?  Whereas I would just want to do it because I would just be curious.  Like I wonder what my face would look like with hair on it.  But I know it would mean so much more than that.  And like I said, I might, I maybe would just be like, yep, just like the rest of my body.  I don't want hair on my face, but how would I know for sure?  So what I'm trying to say is that not, I wasn't ready for it this year, but you know, Will I maybe do it a different time in the future?  I'm going to say maybe.  I just might.  And I think that's okay for me not to be sure and not to know whether or not I will.  So I just had that on my mind and I wanted to share it with you.  So what do you think?  You can comment on what I'm talking about.  Comment on your own thoughts and feelings about it.  And also about what is it like when maybe there's something, especially being non-binary, where you're not sure... If it's something you want to go for as a part of your gender affirming journey, or do you find it to be confusing at times?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks for listening.  That word was supposed to be listening.  Thanks for listening.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker is non-binary and has naturally high levels of testosterone, which allows them to grow facial hair.

This is just a super quick video to let you know that I have a new digital course out and enrollment is open now for a limited time.  The Story Magic Academy will teach you my complete step-by-step system for creating that first spark of a story idea all the way to turning that into a complete plot embryo or even a few plot embryos ready to be written.  If any of the following sounds familiar then the Story Magic Academy is for you.  You've tried the plot embryo method and you like it but you struggle to complete your plot embryos.  You want to write but you feel like you don't have enough ideas or maybe even any ideas.  Or you have plenty of ideas but you struggle to turn them into fully fleshed out narratives.  You've tried really detailed outlining techniques and your story still feels wonky.  You prefer minimal outlining or pantsing but then you get overwhelmed with plot problems in revision.  Your story starts out strong but then the middle gets very soggy and confusing.  Your protagonist seems to have a lot of bad days but you can't seem to establish a strong central conflict.  Maybe you're really good at creating suspense and build-up but your climax feels a bit anticlimactic and it doesn't really pay off in a satisfying way.  You're confused about theme and how to incorporate it.  You often get stuck with story craft or plotting or brainstorming, and you don't know how to get past it.  Maybe you've already gotten results with a plot embryo, but you really want to dig deeper and develop a more nuanced understanding of it.  You don't know how many plot embryos you need, who gets a plot embryo, or how to weave them together.  You're unsure how much time to spend in each plot point.  All of these are things that the Academy can help you overcome.  There are two things you need to succeed at writing.  You need a theoretical knowledge of how story structure works.  And for me personally, the plot embryo is the most effective version of that.  But if theoretical knowledge is all you have, you become the academic dreamer.  The person who knows what they need, but has no idea how to get it.  The person who aspires to write, but never starts.  You also need the practical ability to generate ideas.  But again, if all you have is that practical skill, you then become the endless tinkerer, the person who can create endlessly, but doesn't know what's good or what they need.  They write a lot, but they never finish anything.  In the Story Magic Academy, we alchemise these two powerful elements together to help you become an unstoppable writer.  When you combine theoretical knowledge and practical ability, you get wisdom.  And this is what The Unstoppable Writer has.  The Unstoppable Writer knows both what they need and exactly how to create it.  They can start and finish projects at will.  So what kind of writer is the Academy for?  The Academy is designed to help you write compelling stories no matter what medium you're writing for, whether it's novels, short stories, screenplays, or any other medium.  It also applies to crafting stories of all genres, whether you're interested in writing speculative fiction like sci-fi or fantasy, romance, thrillers, literary fiction, or anything else.  Here are some things that students are saying about the Academy. Yeah, I think the biggest thing I would say to someone else is probably there's going to be people like me who are less impulsive, who will think I've done some of the story craft sessions.  And so I get this and I've watched the videos and I would just say that like, you don't know the half of it kind of thing in a really good way.  And that there's, it really feels like the tip of the iceberg thing.  Like the videos are just like the tip of the iceberg and this Academy has been everything underneath that iceberg.  Um, I mean, I'm even using derivative metaphors, but like it just, it, uh, it's really expansive.  And I think that, um, like if anyone's kind of already using the methods to craft stories, it's so worth the investment to kind of get the bigger picture. I have zero regrets and only gratefulness taking this class.  Truly.  The stars aligned, I feel like, for me to be able to take it and be one of the first students and at the time that I needed it in my life.  I didn't know I needed it, but I feel really energized again after this. I feel like I actually can be a writer.  I really can. I feel like all the missing pieces have been put together in front of me. The schedule for this term of the Academy is also perfectly positioned to end in mid October, giving you a few weeks to continue to prepare and then write the first draft of your story in NaNoWriMo 2019.  If that's something that you would like to do.  Enrollment for the Academy is open now and will close in a few days for this year.  Find the link in the description or go to academy.rachelstephen.com to learn more and enroll yourself.  P.S.  If you're watching this sometime in the future, the Academy might be in session right now, but you can still go to that very same link and sign up to be notified the next time the enrollment opens.

I really like Infinity War.  I know it's got its problems, but I find it an emotionally thrilling watch every single time.  My heart still pounds during certain scenes, even though I know what's going to happen.  And I know that has something to do with the fact that we know they haven't really killed off Black Panther and Spider-Man.  But doesn't that kind of make it all the more impressive?  With the next Avengers movie upon us, theories for Endgame and lamentations of Infinity War have been all over my feed recently.  One of the latter that I keep seeing is anger at the relationship between Thanos and Gamora.  Specifically, how Thanos murders Gamora and calls it love.  Because it isn't love.  Right?  Okay.  I talked about this exact topic last year in my Infinity War spoiler review, and I feel the same way as I did then, but I wanted to dig a bit deeper into it this time around.  Let's just make it easy on ourselves and work with the assumption that the outcome of the Soul Stone scene isn't a fluke.  For the record, I don't think it is.  I believe that Thanos does love Gamora.  Regardless of how you personally feel about that idea, let's explore what that means if that's true.  First, I think we need to figure out what love is.  Love is an emotion.  It's an intense or deep affection for someone or something.  That's all.  While the intensity of the emotion itself certainly plays a role, I think the common refrain that love is complicated speaks less to any universal truth and more to how we romanticize love itself.  I can't speak with certainty about other cultures, but Americans think of love in a very different way than they do any other emotion.  We, uh, what's the word?  Right.  And a lot of this is due to Western media's obsession with love, particularly romantic love.  Obviously, this isn't the kind of relationship that Gamora and Thanos have, but it still applies.  Some of these ideas that appear in media over and over again have seen some very vocal pushback in the last decade or so.  The double standard regarding invasive behavior is a good one, wherein the lead gets away with treating their love interest in a variety of awful ways, ranging from rude to call the cops now.  Please?  And it's considered romantic because it's all done in the name of love.  Okay, okay, fine, I'll go out with you.  A lot of people are rightfully concerned about the kind of message this rom-com staple sends, that abusive behaviors are actually a sign of true passionate romance, or are an ideal to strive for.  Normalizing this kind of behavior as love makes people much more likely to not recognize abuse when they encounter it, and they're more likely to stay in toxic relationships.  This behavior is unhealthy and it gets people, mostly women, killed.  But the argument I often hear in these conversations about representations of love in media is, this isn't love.  That toxic, abusive, manipulative behavior is not real love.  And that's where I think those people are wrong.  The problem with this argument is that it's founded on the same assumption that allows the rom-com double standard to exist in the first place.  Is terrible behavior done for love excusable?  Or is terrible behavior done for love not real love?  These are just two different interpretations of the same principle, that love is both an inherently good thing and an indication of morality.  And this is the logic used to arrive at the conclusion that Thanos did not really love Gamora because he was abusive.  But by confirming that he does really love her in the film, it not only validates his expression of it, but also implies that he isn't really such a monster.  This is absolutely the wrong way to think about love.  Does Thanos really love Gamora?  Yes.  But who cares?  As if that fact makes what he does and has done to her any better.  As if it makes the years of psychological and physical abuse okay.  Why is this a serious question?  Why could that possibly matter when it's so clear that the way he treats her is abusive?  When it comes to relationships, even abusive ones, we put way too much stock in love as an irrefutable explanation.  There's a certain amount of morality that we as a society assign to all emotions.  Generally, we think of joy, gratitude, and excitement as good emotions, and sadness, fear, and anger as bad emotions.  If you feel the bad emotions too often, it reflects poorly on you.  Inside Out would not have been as unique a film as it was if we did not believe that happy is good and sad is bad.  There's also a strict performative aspect.  You have to act right in order to have your emotions taken seriously.  Lots of people have their depression and or anxiety brushed off because their every moment isn't spent sobbing on the floor in the fetal position.  These assumptions hurt all of us, but especially mentally ill and neurodiverse communities.  And yet there is an extent to which we recognize that behavior doesn't prove or determine the validity of emotion.  We believe that people can experience happiness without smiling, sadness without crying, and anger without violence.  But I don't think love is given any room for that kind of complexity.  Love is thought of as a superior emotion, and our standards for it are ridiculously high.  People like to say they're not, but for those of us who are, want to do the romance and the sex on people.  We have certain hopes and expectations, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Some people want a f*** ton of daffodils, and others want to f*** a fish god.  But the daffodils and the fish god don't have to come right now.  I mean, they could come later on in that relation- I'm s- I'm getting off topic.  The fish cut isn't the point!  That's all fine.  The problem is that so often, people really feel that if they don't encounter those things, it's not genuine love.  Or it's not the right relationship.  Because love is supposed to be this perfect, dazzling fantasy.  Anything less than that feels fake.  Or a letdown, at the very least.  I think that's why we're so vehement that abusive behavior isn't real love.  We think of love with such intrinsic goodness that toxicity existing alongside it feels like an endorsement rather than, oh, I don't know, a sign that love isn't evidence of virtue?  Maybe.  That it's just another emotion, no better than any other.  Personally, I think emotions themselves are morally neutral.  Morality is determined by choice and action, not by the existence or lack of emotion itself, which is largely out of one's control.  And the idea that an inability to feel automatically makes a person immoral isn't just ableist rhetoric used to dehumanize people, which it is.  It also completely ignores the agency that people who actually do immoral things have in a given situation.  It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.  It is our choices.  I'm not trying to convince you that you shouldn't be angry about Gamora's death in Infinity War.  The writers participated in that time-honored narrative tradition of hurting women in order to make great, flawed men feel things.  Maybe this wouldn't be as bad if we lived in a world where women aren't the majority of those murdered by an abuser.  But we don't.  And I don't think you're wrong to be upset by that.  I also don't think that the films encourage the audience to excuse what Thanos does to both Gamora and Nebula.  The Guardians films resist putting the trauma of their younger selves on display with flashbacks, despite the fact that it would be much easier and entertaining to show these events, instead opting for scenes where the characters discuss their trauma with each other.  Though it is pretty entertaining to watch them work through it by hurling spaceships at each other.  The long-lasting effect this abuse had on Gamora and Nebula, who are now grown up, is the primary focus.  not Thanos' feelings or motivations as an abuser.  He isn't the one who matters.  They are.  Even with Thanos being the protagonist of Infinity War, I think writers Marcus and McFeely are very clear about the fact that Thanos is an abusive father and not a good person.  Even if I do think that Thanos' plan needed to be criticized in the film more than it was.  I love how Zoe reacts to this moment where she believes that she's killed him.  It's really powerful.  And murdered her abuser.  There's really only one time in Infinity War where Thanos ever gets close to defending his abuse with love.  Probably because he's too self-assured to feel the need to explain himself.  Everything I heard about myself he told me.  And in doing so made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.  Oh, well in that case, Dad, thanks!  A relationship, any relationship, doesn't stop being one because it is toxic or abusive.  It's just an abusive relationship.  Love is the same way.  And the relationship that Thanos and Gamora have is abusive, but affection and love still exist in it.  These things exist together.  I was in an abusive relationship with someone for a very long time.  I remember when I wholeheartedly believed what Gamora did.  That it wasn't real love.  I don't think that anymore.  With hindsight and distance, I realized that that belief itself contributed to my staying as long as I did.  Because when I thought the reason I shouldn't be around him was because he didn't actually love me, All I had to be convinced of to give him another chance was that he did.  And the cycle would start again.  Here's a not fun thing.  I loved him and I think he did love me.  And I'll never really know.  I used to really want to know with absolute certainty.  And now I don't care.  Because at some point I realized that the answer to that question didn't matter.  And It never should have mattered.  Our relationship was toxic.  Knowing if he loved me wouldn't change that.  I'm not arguing this idea so you'll give abusers the benefit of the doubt.  I just want you to know what I wish I'd known.  That love doesn't make a person or a relationship good.  and in a broader, more timely and dangerous political sense, banality or relatability should not make you question the harm they inflict on other people.  We all want to think that we can never be or become that person, but the truth is, we can.  It's very important to remember that.  And that's what's so terrifying about Thanos.  Thanos isn't a threat of what a lack of empathy, love, and concern for the world can do to us.  He's a reminder that the presence of those things can be just as dangerous as the absence.  That when you are so sure of yourself that you refuse to listen to other people, your impact can be devastating.  That love itself is not enough, it's how you express it.  He's a reminder that just because you might see reflections of yourself in him doesn't mean he can't possibly be a monster.

A lot of people joining the discussion now don't realise the full scope of the timeline of what has happened.  something which is impacting the way they perceive things now.  So I thought doing a fully referenced timeline might help some people in that regard.  So this whole ordeal began when Steven Woodford published his original video on trans athletes on the 29th of March.  Said video was instantly picked up by far-right individuals and anti-trans organisations who began using it as a means to both delegitimise and attack trans women.  I was sent the video by numerous trans people, so much in fact.  I had to publicly request for that to stop.  I also saw it spring up in various circles I am part of as an attempt to further marginalise us.  I had to do something, so I set about going through Woodford's references and carrying out my own research.  What I discovered was that Woodford had no basis for the statements he had made, statements which positioned trans women as a threat to the very existence of women's sports, something which needed to be acted upon, which is incredibly troubling since excluding a group of women from women's sports violates numerous human rights.  But not only did he lack any ethical grounds to exclude trans women, what was even more telling was the science Woodford had attempted to use.  Woodford set out to utilise a bait-and-switch.  He invited his viewers in with promises of discussion surrounding trans women on HRT compared to cis women, only to switch to information on cis men compared to cis women.  no form of antiandrogen involved.  He also asserted that various things known to change with HRT didn't.  This included haemoglobin, which he forwarded as one of the most important elements to his argument.  To top this off, Woodford utilised various dog whistles, such as refusing to label cis women as such, instead he referred to them as simply biological women, implying that trans women were biological men, and therefore not true women.  He also used clips of Joe Rogan screaming, he is a guy, in relation to trans women, ending his video on such a clip, marking that as the very last thing he wants his audience to hear and to take away from the video as a whole.  He also resorted to various sensationalised news stories which he inaccurately portrayed, so his video delegitimised, and in many instances dehumanised, trans people, propped up our human rights as a topic of debate, and emboldened bigots with pseudoscience, all of which is still actively harming the trans community.  So I compiled everything I found and published a response on the 6th of April, which, outside of certain segments of his audience, was well received.  Everything I stated was clearly referenced in an accessible manner.  But Woodford did not take kindly to being criticised.  He rather famously stated that he'd watched six minutes of my video and that was all he'd watched since I had the audacity to notice flirtations with the far right.  Rather hypocritical considering that he'd complained about people not watching the whole of his video, which opened with him presenting trans women as a threat, before commenting on his transphobic content.  Move forward two days and we'd finally reached an uneasy truth.  He'd convinced me that he would check out my work and correct anything he'd got wrong, and I accepted that and sat there patiently.  The only thing I did was publish a video asking the attendees of Faithless Form 2019, which Woodford was presenting at, to keep an ear out for people trying to claim that I was unnecessarily fragmenting the secular community, and correct them if they did.  Thankfully, all that happened was someone asked Woodford a question about the subject, and he said he was working on an updated video.  Now, I was accused by one of the event's organisers of instigating violence to a level comparable to burning down Kingdom Halls.  When pressed on this, they kept asserting that we'd have to wait for the video to see what my fans had apparently done.  none of which ever emerged.  I still haven't received a sincere apology from either the individual or the faithless forum for their libelous  accusations.\".  Now whilst in the US, Woodford went on the Atheist Community of Austin's Atheist Experience show with host Matt Dillahunty on the 28th of April and again on the 5th of May.  So a day short of a month had passed between Woodford's original video and his first appearance on the show, three weeks since my response, during which Woodford had been at home for the vast majority of that time, and yet the most he did was tweet the following on the 1st of May.  Hey all, I'm currently working on a video in which I both clarify my views on transgender athletes, including how my views have altered, and publicly apologise for the ignorant language that I used and the mistakes that I made.  Please PM me if you have more info for me to digest.  End quote.  And that was all, just some ambiguous mistakes that I made.  Meanwhile, his video remained up completely unedited, with no clear indication that it contained errors, let alone what said errors were.  Profiteering off of the harm he was still inflicting on the trans community.  But it was something, and people such as Mr Atheist, Shannon Q, Suris, and various others kept telling me to give him time.  so I kept the peace and waited for another  week.\".  That's when the ACA stepped in and published this public condemnation of Woodford's original video, rightfully noting it as transphobic content.  Do note, it wasn't Woodford's first transphobic video, just his most blatant.  Adding onto this, the ACA stated that they should have waited until after Woodford had clarified his views on the matter, or at the very least, asked him about how they'd changed on air.  They finished with a statement of solidarity with the LGBT plus community, since Woodford had called for the removal of trans women's human rights.  And that was all.  They didn't attack him, they didn't paint him as this raging transphobe out there beating us up on the street.  They simply noted he had published transphobic content, and that they were sorry for giving him airtime until he had corrected it.  Now there is an issue here with the way that the ACA downplayed their knowledge of the problem.  not simply because Matt, the host of the show, had posted in support of Woodford less than three hours after his original video had been published, pretending like he had some right to declare it transphobia-free.  But listening to people who have since left the ACA, this human rights issue was known and they still chose to run with Woodford as a host.  All of a sudden, after five weeks of doing nothing substantial to repair the damage Woodford had inflicted upon the trans community, Woodford managed to produce a video comparing himself to Galileo in less than 48 hours of the ACA's public statement, at which point I gave up on waiting around and decided to drag him out for the fact that he'd failed to take even the most basic steps towards fixing the issue.  I dragged him out over the fact that he hadn't removed or made clear that his video contained errors, something he could have done much earlier with two clicks or a simple change of the title.  I called him out over the fact that he was still monetising said video after the ACA condemnation, and I demanded very clearly that he donate the money to a trans charity.  And only as I did that, refusing to give up, to back down as so many had demanded I do so before, did things start to change.  He then changed the title of his video.  He then demonetised it.  Not before.  And to be clear, his donation of the money that video had made wasn't enough.  Said video had lined his pockets via Patreon and bolstered his channel.  So this idea that giving the money said video had made is enough is insulting to everyone's intelligence.  He didn't just profit directly from that video, something a lot of people have just brushed under the rug.  Now, because I refused to stand by as I had done the month before, the abuse levied against me by Woodford's audience and supporters was stepped up a notch.  it wasn't just me they went after.  The same people swarmed over the ACA networks in a tidal wave of transphobic, homophobic and racist rhetoric.  It got so bad that there were a series of mass walkouts by volunteers over the abuse they suffered at the hands of Woofer's audience, and a lack of support from key figures in the ACA, the same ACA they were volunteering their time for.  Following the abuse, the ACA did the worst thing imaginable, and went back on its original statement on the 16th of May, Dropping his support for the LGBT plus community and pretending like Woodford's video wasn't a problem.  To add insult to injury, they flat out apologised to Woodford for disavowing his transphobic video.  On May the 18th, there was also an election at the ACA in which the pro-Woodford crowd turned up in force.  First-hand accounts detail how anyone in support of the original statement was endlessly grilled for their position, unlike those who supported Woodford.  I'd just like to note that two of the people elected are quite literally Woodford's drinking buddies from the Faithless Forum.  Just a little insert from Psych I Learned after recording.  Turns out that not only is Drew McCoy one of Woodford's drinking buddies and personal friends, but he actually violated the ACA bylaws in order to be elected onto the board.  Under qualifications, said bylaw reads as quote, Which is interesting since Drew McCoy wasn't a member of the ACA at the time the 2019 elections took place.  Now, what's really interesting is that a similar situation occurred last year in which a woman wanted to run for a board position even though she only had four months of ACA membership under her belt, which is still four more than Drew, and yet she was found to be ineligible to run.  And I have had it confirmed by numerous people that this issue was raised at this election, and it was subsequently ignored.  So whilst others with actual ACA membership are blocked from running, the people currently in power at the ACA are all too happy to ignore the same bylaws in order to replace board members that remain critical of Stephen Woodford with his personal friends.  I should also mention that two months later and the Minister said election still haven't been released.  At the same election, people who forwarded tighter vetting for guest hosts on grounds that the ACA was no longer a small show but an atheist celebrity mill were also targeted with hostility.  The message that sent out was very clear.  The cis white atheists are above criticism, and anyone who dares challenge that is not welcome at what was once the atheist community of Austin.  All of this culminated in more walkouts, including adored hosts who had been with the ACA for years, even decades.  People who made the ACA the name it was until recently.  People like Tracy, Jen, Claire, and Phil.  Now, some of the walkouts had formed a support group which I was later added to.  And reading through their accounts is truly horrifying.  Many discuss the abuse they suffered thanks to Woodford and his audience.  There are numerous discussions on how their sleep was impacted, how they're having to see psychiatrists and other specialists.  I've even seen posts discussing suicide in relation to what had occurred.  That's the level of severity we are talking about with this issue.  People discussing suicide.  That's the damage Woodford and his supporters have caused this one group, this one organisation.  On the 20th of May, Woodford finally released his apology video.  only for it to quickly become apparent that it wasn't an apology video, but a non-apology video.  Woodford opens the video with an attack on the very community that he had harmed, tone-policing the trans people who stood up to him, which is really rich considering that I waited for a month for him to do the right thing before I jammed my boot up his arse.  He also rolled out his token trans person, a trans person who has gone on record stating that she will fight for fascists and their right to hate speech.  because apparently said individual proves how not a transphobe Woodford is.  I of course responded, noting all of this and many other issues with his video, on the 25th of May.  Woodford then went ahead and published his Mistakes and Many video on the 28th of May.  Said video was meant to acknowledge his many scientific errors, yet spent the vast majority of the time lying about the science and attempting to dump his anecdotal arguments onto me to make me look bad.  Most impressively, he repeated a mistake he had just admitted to making in his first video with hemoglobin.  this time with muscle mass, something which could have been avoided had he just bothered to read the figure annotation of the graph he displayed on screen.  Figure annotation included.  So, I noted this in my video response on the 5th of June.  So by this point, it was pretty clear.  Woodford was not abandoning his transphobic narratives he had constructed in his original video.  He was simply trying to find ways to keep them in spite of having no basis for them to begin with.  I was vindicated in saying this when, on the 15th of June, Woodford posted his updated video.  Said video contained all the same dishonest tactics such as the phaeton switch and the dehumanising dog whistles.  It even contained Woodford actively lying about the contents of various studies to try and bolster his case.  He claimed that they showed heart and lung size as well as muscle fibre type to remain the same, in spite of HRT.  This is even though none of those things are even mentioned in said articles in any context, relevant or otherwise, as I noted in my subsequent response, published on the 22nd of June.  Which I'd just like to note is the very first time I have ever labelled Woodford as transphobic in a video.  Now since then the response has been a little\u2026 underwhelming?  I mean, many of the people who promised they'd step in if would prefer to change have either remained silent, or even come after me for sticking up for my human rights, because apparently the secular community has a statute of limitations on internal affairs.  I can effectively make the same video on the Kalam Cosmological Argument for eight years running, but the moment I spend part of my time addressing transphobic bigotry in the secular community on a matter of my human rights, that's me being obsessive or beating a dead horse.  There's a double standard at play here, one that I'm not all that keen in adhering to.  So over the coming weeks I'll be covering a variety of issues which took place on the sidelines.  I'll be publishing testimonies of many of the ACA volunteers, sponsors and community members who have since walked out.  I'll be covering the dishonesty of people such as Matt Dillahunty and Holy Kool-Aid in greater detail.  All because I have a passion, a desire to see the secular community grow into what it should be.  A community welcoming to all marginalised groups, groups which have historically been the victims of religious institutions.  Why?  Well, because I believe as a militant secularist that unless we can offer something better than religion to all people, our dream will remain just that.  when it can be so much more?  And all it takes us is some god-damned accountability.  As always, please check out our other videos, you can also support Essence of Thought by Patreon, and in doing so, help us become ad-free.

The video was picked up by far-right individuals and anti-trans organizations, who used it to delegitimize and attack trans women. The video contained several issues, including a bait-and-switch tactic, the use of pseudoscience, and dog whistles to dehumanize trans people.\n\nAfter the video was published, Woodford was criticized by several individuals, including a response video from a trans rights advocate. Woodford initially claimed to be working on an updated video to correct his mistakes, but he failed to do so. Instead, he continued to monetize his original video, which contained errors and transphobic content.\n\nThe Atheist Community of Austin (ACA) eventually condemned Woodford's video, stating that it was transphobic content. However, they later backtracked on their statement and apologized to Woodford for disavowing his video. This decision was met with widespread criticism and led to several walkouts by volunteers and hosts who had been with the ACA for years.\n\nWoodford eventually released an apology video, but it was widely criticized for being a non-apology video. He continued to use dishonest tactics and lies to support his case, and his updated video contained the same transphobic narratives as his original video.\n\nThe controversy has had a severe impact on the ACA and the secular community, with several individuals discussing the abuse they suffered at the hands of Woodford's audience. The issue has also highlighted a double standard in the secular community, where some individuals are held to a higher standard than others.\n\nThe trans rights advocate who initially criticized Woodford has vowed to continue addressing the issue and will be publishing testimonies from ACA volunteers and community members who have walked out. The advocate believes that the secular community should be a welcoming space for all marginalized groups and that accountability","responses":"[1] Social Justice: Mentions the controversy surrounding transphobic content and the need for accountability in the secular community.\n[1] Community Development: Mentions the impact of the controversy on the Atheist Community of Austin (ACA) and the secular community.\n[1] Politics: Mentions the controversy surrounding Stephen Woodford and the use of pseudoscience and dog whistles to dehumanize trans people.\n[1] Disability: Mentions trans people and the need for a welcoming space for all marginalized groups.\n[1] Government: Mentions the Atheist Community of Austin (ACA) and its decision to condemn and later apologize for Woodford's video.\n[1] Social Commentary: Mentions the controversy and its impact on the secular community, highlighting a double standard and abuse suffered by individuals.\n[1] Human Rights: Mentions the need for accountability and a welcoming space for all marginalized groups, including trans people.\n[1] Activism: Mentions the trans rights advocate's efforts to address the issue and publish testimonies from ACA volunteers and community members.\n[1] Education: Mentions the need for education and awareness about trans issues and the importance of a welcoming space for all marginalized groups.\n[1] Identity: Mentions the controversy surrounding transphobic content and the need for a welcoming space for all marginalized groups.\n[1] Relationships: Mentions the controversy and its impact on the relationships between individuals in the secular community.\n[1] Personal Development: Mentions the need for personal growth and awareness about trans issues.\n[1] Personal Growth: Mentions the need for personal growth and awareness about trans issues.\n[1] Personal Empowerment: Mentions the need for personal empowerment and a welcoming space for all marginalized groups.\n[1] Social Change: Mentions the need for social change and accountability in the secular community.\n[1] Community Building: Mentions the need for community building and a welcoming space for all marginalized groups.\n[1] Online Communities: Mentions the controversy and its impact on online communities.\n[1] Support: Mentions the need for support and a welcoming space for all marginalized groups.\n[1] Advocacy: Mentions the trans rights advocate's efforts to address the issue and advocate for trans rights.\n[1] Human Behavior: Mentions the controversy and its impact on human behavior in the"}

So, Dan Harmon created Rick and Morty, but you may or may not know that he also created the plot embryo, Hallowed Be the Universal Pattern, linked in our descriptions and our hearts, which is the story creation tool that he and his writers use to craft every single episode.  If you're new to my channel or you've only seen a couple of videos you might not know that teaching the plot embryo and helping writers get amazing results with it is actually my full-time day job.  The plot embryo can supercharge your storytelling but it can be a little bit tricky to get the hang of in the beginning.  so let's break down an episode of Rick and Morty so that you can see how the plot embryo works in action.  Today we're gonna break it down and get shwifty.  And spoiler warning, I'm going to spoil the entire crap out of this entire episode because that's what this whole video is about, so consider yourself warned, dum-dums. So first, let's take a quick look at the quadrants for this plot embryo.  For the comfort zone, so that's the familiar realm, we have Earth just doing its normal thing.  For the conflict zone, so that's the unfamiliar, we have the planet music competition.  And for the internal quadrants, which cover the theme of the story, We have Morty's before state, which is the belief that I can't put my faith in Rick because he doesn't give a fuck.  And then the realisation, his after state, that Rick's power comes from not giving a fuck.  So one thing that's interesting about this plot embryo is that Morty is actually the protagonist.  And hopefully you will see why.  That will become clear as we go through it.  So plot point one, it's really simple.  We have Rick and Morty in their comfort zone at home watching TV.  At plot point two, we have a giant Chromulon head appears over the Earth and creates global disasters.  They need an original hit song to get rid of it and all famous musicians having died in an earthquake.  It's up to Rick and Morty. This head won't go away until Earth shows them it's got a hit song.  Sanchez, are you a musician?  I dabble, Mr.  President.  Get this man and his grandson on a Black Hawk to Area 51. At plot point three, we have Rick and Morty go to Area 51 to play a song for the Chromulon.  Pleased with the song, it transports the entire Earth into the planet.  music competition. Morty, good music comes from people who are relaxed.  Just hit a button, Morty, give me a beat.  Oh man, okay, alright, um... oh yeah you gotta get swifty you gotta get.  i like what you got.  good job we asked them to show us what they got and they did but in the end there can only be one planet music. at plot point four we have the stakes established.  if they lose the earth is going to be destroyed.  Morty gets angry with Rick that he isn't taking the songwriting seriously and he steals the portal gun to escape and save himself. You lied!  You lied about the charge!  You were just being lazy!  Get back!  Sit down!  Morty, just put it down!  You don't know what you're doing! I'm going to go find Mom and Dad!  No!  At this point, Ice-T reveals himself to be an alien, but won't help Rick with the songwriting because he just doesn't care about anyone or anything. But I was frozen in exile to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. The US military plans to nuke the Cromulons during Earth's performance, which doesn't seem like a great idea. I'm setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earth's performance.  And, by the way, put Justin in the comments if you also had no idea that this guy is actually a little cameo of Justin Roiland. At plot point five, we have Morty's change of heart.  Morty finds himself with Birdperson, who tells him that Rick's refusal to give a fuck is actually his strength. Bird person, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn't care about anyone but himself.  He doesn't think about the consequences of anything he does.  And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds.  And he is the reason you and I know each other.  And the reason I'm alive at all. What's that?  Who's that baby? Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick.  How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick? So, having had this realization, Morty returns to help Rick with the performance.  At plot point six, the military nukes a Chromulon and it gets him disqualified from the competition.  But Ice-T returns to block the laser beam and saves the Earth because he cares now. Ice-T!  That's right, it's me, Ice-T!  I care now!  You made me care more! Rick and Morty play a weird improv song, giving zero fucks, and they win planet music, saving the Earth.  Uh-huh!  Here we go!  Say it with me!  At plot point seven, the Cromulons put the Earth back and leave in peace.  At plot point eight, the world is safe and planet music is no more.  So other planets are saved too.  And Morty gives a few less fucks now. So let's talk about theme in Get Shifty.  It was only after I started dissecting this episode for this video that I realised how amazing the theme is in Get Schwifty.  Now, I can do plot embryos in my sleep and a lot of the time, even just watching or experiencing a story, I can pick out the different plot points and elements.  But the theme went over my head completely in this episode until I started to dig deeper.  And you guys, it's about creativity and perfectionism.  And the setup of this episode, that the entire fate of the planet Earth depends on Rick and Morty's ability to write a catchy hit song on a crazy deadline is absolutely perfect.  Because the stakes are so over the top for something so seemingly unattainable.  Because for some of us, every act of creation, whether that's writing music or creating any other kind of art, feels like life and death.  It feels like everything hangs in the balance, like we're walking the knife edge of destruction, like we really are trying to save the world.  But what Marty learns is that when it comes to creativity, the best thing you can do is not give a fuck.  I'm really bad at this, Morty. There are way too many buttons in this thing.  Mr. President, if I've learned one thing today, it's that sometimes you have to not give a fuck.  Rick saves the planet by improvising, by refusing to overthink the creative process, by surrendering to his instincts.  and not sweating it.  And what I love about this is that it makes so much sense given what we know about Dan as a person from his podcast Harmontown.  Dan has talked about how his show Community was his baby.  He set himself insane standards for it.  And in some sense, maybe he even felt like it was his magnum opus.  Dan actually got fired from his own show which continued terribly for a season without him before it became clear that they really needed him and he got hired back.  Community as a show, while I absolutely adore it, had a really difficult, fraught time behind the scenes in production.  Rick and Morty, on the other hand, Dan talks about as something which began as purely a fun passion project where he and Justin Roiland would get to cut loose and be weird and just roll with it.  And of course now, Rick and Morty has become his most iconic work and has had more commercial success than Community ever did.  So the theme of Get Schwifty, that creativity works better when you give less fucks and when you abandon the idea of creative perfection, makes perfect sense to me.  But let's talk about Ice-T's theme.  But Rachel, you might be thinking, Ice-T's theme is all about learning to care more, not less. But I was frozen in exile to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything.  Take it from me, Ice, you can't just float around space not caring about stuff forever.  Psh, man, watch me.  Good luck, Rick.  Ice-T!  That's right, it's me, Ice-T! I care now!  You make me care more!  Ice-T's tiny little subplot in this episode is a perfect example of how you can use subplots to explore different facets or aspects of the main theme.  Ice-T learns to care more not about creative perfection but about people.  So when you put Morty's arc and Ice-T's arc together you get a kind of conjugated theme.  Give less fucks about artistic perfection and give more fucks about people.  And that is how Get Swift Day's plot embryo works.  Now of course I don't have access to the original plot embryo used to create this episode so that might look a little bit different but consider this my best interpretation of what that original plot embryo might have looked like based on reverse engineering it from the finished episode.  Now be sure to tell me in the comments which episode you would like to see me break down next.  Every episode of Rick and Morty is created using the plot embryo.  To me it's the perfect illustration of how much wild creativity you can bring to a story while still using that strong plot embryo structure as your foundation.  If you are a writer and you find that your stories never turn out as you'd hoped, that your middle gets a little bit saggy, the end ends up being kind of deflated, then I created the Story Magic Academy for you.  In it, I share my complete system from generating that first seed of a story idea all the way to turning it into a complete plot embryo ready to be written.  It's where I've put all my best secrets and tips for getting the most out of the plot embryo framework and making the story creation process clear, practical and gratifying.  So here's what to do next.  If you're watching this pretty soon after I released this video, then the enrolment for the Story Magic Academy is open now for just a few days more.  If you're watching this sometime in the future, the Academy might be in session right now, but you can still follow that same link in the description and sign up to be notified.  And don't forget to signal to our overlords that this content is above average, perform the token gesture which indicates that you'd like to see more videos from me, and grant me access to your sacred and coveted notification centre.  Okay, I'm going to leave you with my favourite line from this episode.  This is so hard to say.  Plot.  Problems.  I might just skip that part.  Plot.  Problems.  It sounds like a Rick and Morty character.  My own stomach rumbled there and it put me off.  By shrifting it.  To not give a fuck.  I just made half of that up.  Maybe get shwifty means like stop giving a fuck.  Finally.  That is not words.  Words are not things.  Consider yourself warmed.  I just said it again.  My God.  So consider yourself warmed.  Warned.  Consider yourself warm.  Consider yourself cosy.  Consider yourself warned.  I just looked at you instead of the camera.  Oh my god, consider yourself braised.  I just thought I was crying. Take your pants down. Take your shit on the floor. Take off your pants and your panties.  Shit on the floor.  Time to get shwifty in here. That moment's really relatable. Shit on the floor.

I'm so bad at French.  Hello everyone, Scrivener here.  Odds are, if you've only seen a few of our videos, you might be laboring under the delusion that Paige and I do not actually like films very much.  While it's not an intentional choice, it's true that our videos often tend to the more critical side of critique.  Frankly, negative criticism can be a lot of fun to write and consume, but it certainly doesn't mean that we just hate movies.  We love them.  So let's do something a bit different today.  I wanted to go through a few of my favorite films.  Some version of this sort of challenge always seems to be going around on social media.  Right now it's Twitter.  Introduce someone to your taste in movies with five titles.  As fun as listing off your favorite movies is, I don't think these memes and challenges actually reveal anything about a person.  Because there are really very few instances in which the title of a film alone can definitively mean something about who a person is.  I don't mean that it's not an incredibly personal piece of information, or that our favorite films don't reveal anything about who we are.  Just that if there isn't any kind of further clarification or explanation offered, it means almost nothing.  Everyone is going to bring their own preconceptions about what a film is to the table.  Basically, if you don't explain why those are your favorite films, people are going to decide for you.  And for better or for worse, they will almost always be incorrect.  Those tweets and posts about escaping out the bathroom window if a guy tells you his favorite movie is Fight Club when you're on a date, or that the epitome of basic is a woman who loves any Pride and Prejudice adaptation are funny enough, and I laugh at them sometimes, but they are still very judgmental and much too simplistic.  As if films are just a single look, or a single idea, a single image of a person self-reflected.  The fact is that there are an infinite number of components that go into a piece of art, and people can like those pieces of art for literally any of them, no matter how small.  And that doesn't even include the subjective elements a viewer brings to art.  Perhaps it was a movie that made your family laugh so hard you had to pause the movie for ten minutes.  Maybe it inspired a hobby you still do today.  Maybe you have a limited range, but every song on that soundtrack is perfect for your voice.  I want you to know what some of my favourite films are, but more than that, I want you to know why they matter to me.  I don't want you to have to resort to psychologising in your armchairs about why I love this film.  You don't have to guess.  My reasons are not always lofty.  Often they are subjective and messy and silly.  I don't want you to think that I'm some perfect, objective critic.  I'm not trying to trick you into thinking that I am.  I have preferences when it comes to stories, and those shape the way I process and analyze art.  They are not superior because I like them, they are just the ones I like.  And I'm not trying to convince you that my favorite story elements, or my favorite stories, should also be yours.  I'm not explaining why I love these films because I'm ashamed and need to find some way to rationalize, to legitimize what I like.  I want to share something that brings me joy.  Subjective, silly, messy joy.  And you never know, you might end up liking some of these too.  Without further ado, and in no particular order, here are just five of my favorite non-Disney films.  I wanted to make it a little more interesting for y'all.  You've probably heard of this one.  A guy named Peter, played by Jason Segel, whose TV actress girlfriend of five years, Sarah Marshall, played by Kristen Bell, dumps him in the first five minutes of the movie.  He is very, very sad about it, and at the urging of his stepbrother, Bill Hader, he goes on a vacation to Hawaii in an attempt to get over her.  only to discover she is not only staying at the same resort, but is with a new guy, played with a perfect level of smarmy obnoxiousness by Russell Brand.  There are a lot of things I really love about this movie.  It's hilarious.  There are tons of lines that just make me smile every time I think about them.  It has some very smart and thoughtful things to say about relationships and how they can deteriorate when you stop paying attention to them.  and how it's often not quite as simple as just blaming a relationship ending on one person.  There's a really lovely subplot with Jack McBrayer and Maria Thayer who are having trouble on their honeymoon, which ends in a very sweet way.  I also love that there are Native Hawaiians in this movie.  We see them outside of work at the hotel at places the tourists don't go.  This movie is very clear about the fact that actual people live in Hawaii all the time.  That they and Hawaii itself exists even when white people are not vacationing among them.  This is a movie that Paige and I watched in college together and it kind of solidified our friendship.  Especially when I would have relationship troubles.  This is a movie we would watch and Paige would remind me that she was the bill-hater, yelling at Peter over the phone to stop making such terrible, impulsive, masochistic decisions.  Peter, go back to your room.  Go back to your room, Peter.  I'm going in.  The weather outside is weather is a line that Paige absolutely loves.  It is her favorite joke in the whole movie, and I love the way she laughs whenever she thinks about it.  Also, this.  Peter, you suck.  Peter, you don't do anything of value.  Peter, you suck.  Okay, so this is one you might recognize only because this movie had a twin.  that was released the same year with a very similar premise.  This movie was first.  It came out in January, and Friends with Benefits came out in July.  Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake star in that movie, and Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are the stars of No Strings Attached.  This is a romantic comedy.  It is about Emma Kurtzman and Adam Franklin, who run into each other every couple of years, very When Harry Met Sally.  I don't want to give away too much because it's a much more enjoyable movie if some things are left as a surprise for you to discover for yourself.  Kevin Kline plays Adam's dad, and he is amazing.  What you need to know is that Emma and Adam are two very different people emotionally.  They start sleeping together and make a series of rules in order to keep their arrangement casual.  And over the course of the film, they quietly break every single rule as they fall in love.  This is another movie that Paige and I really love together.  though it's not as weighty in our personal history as Forgetting Sarah Marshall is.  This is the first thing I ever saw Mindy Kaling in, and I remember being captivated by her.  The part she has is not big, but she really gives it her all.  The same goes for Guy Branum and Greta Gerwig.  This is a romantic comedy that feels fresh and fitting for 2011. and it feels real.  There's a lot that I love about the script for this movie, written by Elizabeth Meriwether.  There's a lot of detail and worldbuilding and character moments and things that really make the movie stand out to me.  There's this extra effort put into a movie that, cynically speaking, didn't really need to in order to accomplish watchable rom-com status.  And these touches feel lived in.  They're not thickly laid on in a painfully obvious attempt to appeal to the youths.  It adds up to something fun and interesting and unique.  Cary Elwes plays a hot doctor who has no real bearing on the plot, but it's a running joke for Emma's friends to talk about how hot he is, because That's the thing some people do.  The dialogue has always stood out to me as very realistic, with the conversations between the characters feeling like ones I would have with my friends.  It manages to toe that fine line of realistic but not boring.  I especially appreciate the relationships and conversations between the men.  Adam's friend group, Ludacris and Jake Johnson, are not sex-obsessed, toxic misogynists that Adam needs to break free from.  They're just normal guys.  It's not a perfect script.  Let me put it this way.  If you told me that Meriwether had in fact met a single queer person before she wrote this script, I would be very, very, very Very surprised.  The film's handling of queer people, of which there are a few, is very clumsy.  Set your expectations very low for that.  But I love John Dabney's score, I love the soundtrack, I love the story, and I love Kevin Kline's hospital monologue at the end.  I may have to kill this dog.  I just haven't decided how.  This film is directed by Martin Scorsese.  It's an adaptation of a middle grade book called The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick.  I went into this movie not really knowing anything about it.  And once again, I don't want to tell you too much.  If you've seen the trailers and posters and think it's a fantastical adventure movie, it is, but there's a bit more to it than that.  And it's fun to let that mystery unfold.  I would even urge you not to look at the cast list.  Just go watch it.  But it is a historical fiction set in 1930s Paris about a young boy named Hugo Cabret, played by Asa Butterfield, who lives in the Montparnasse train station.  It's a beautiful and very sweet story.  This is a gorgeous movie in every sense.  I have read the book, and while it does enrich the viewing experience, I actually like the movie better.  Specifically, I like the dynamic between Hugo and Isabelle better.  The nature of the story being what it is also means that a film adaptation is probably the most fitting for it.  Wow, that was embarrassing.  It's a really wonderful and gorgeous cast.  Ben Kingsley, Chloe Grace Moritz, Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Jude Law, Emily Mortimer, and Christopher Lee.  And now you all understand why I love it so.  But this entire movie was very much made for me.  I love history, I love mysteries, I love stories, I love movies, and I love happy endings.  This is a movie that makes me cry every single time I watch it.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it.  If the movie has a central idea, it's that art has a positive and immortal impact on people.  And that's a very soppy message, and I do not think it would be as effective in this movie if it were beaten into you.  I'm sure for some people it feels like it is, but to me it is a loving portrait of that truth.  And that message is made more powerful in ways it couldn't be when it was released, at least for me, because Richard Griffiths and Christopher Lee are in this movie.  Two people who had a long, wonderful career as artists who are no longer with us, but they live on.  They will never really be lost.  And I think that is the film's true message, that art never dies.  Damn it, I knew I was gonna cry.  Alright, the climax has a touch of ableism, and the final scene is a tad sentimental with its unnecessary closing voiceover, but it's such a wonderful, heartfelt movie.  It is so sincere and beautiful, and I love it so much.  Come and dream with me.  What can I even say about this movie, except that I hope you've already seen it.  It is a musical, set in late 1920s Hollywood, and it's about a movie studio and its actors making the transition from silent films to sound films.  talkies.  Our main characters are the movie star Don Lockwood, played by Gene Kelly, his best friend Cosmo Brown, played by Donald O'Connor, and performer and love interest to Don, Kathy Seldon, played by Debbie Reynolds.  This is a classic musical.  The music is wonderful.  The dancing is top tier.  This is a movie that I have been watching for as long as I can remember.  God, I did not understand that dream ballet when I was younger, but man, it was really cool!  I remember how excited I was to save up and buy the soundtrack CD from Borders, and I remember listening to the songs over and over again.  You Were Meant For Me is still such an incredibly romantic scene and song to me.  I love that dress, I love Gene Kelly's voice, I love the way he looked at her.  It is so good!  Something that I really appreciate about it is the dialogue.  I think there are a lot of old movies that have very stilted and grandiose speech, and sometimes it can be hard to understand what people are saying.  I'm not really talking about the mid-Atlantic affectation, I'm really more talking about the writing.  There's nothing wrong with that style of writing, I'm not condemning it.  But I do really love that.  Singing in the Rain is a solid movie that has dialogue that is funny and witty and accessible.  And it is timeless.  It has these crisp, bright colors, incredible design, really impressive shots.  This would still be an incredible movie if it came out today.  I imagine some things would change, but not much would have to.  Audiences everywhere adored us.  All right.  Relative values.  It is... movie.  While it does have a bit of film flair, it is mostly just a pretty straightforward adaptation of a Noel Coward play.  Funnily enough, Relative Values is set in the same year that Singing in the Rain came out, and it also features a movie star called Don.  It also has John Debney doing the score, so clearly, I like John Debney's music.  So, this Earl of a wealthy British family gets engaged to an American movie star, and his mother Felicity, played by Julie Andrews, is not particularly happy.  Why?  Classism!  The Earl brings this fiance home to visit, and it turns out she's the estranged sister of Felicity's longtime mate and companion, Moxie, played by Sophie Thompson.  Yes, Emma Thompson's younger sister.  And as if that weren't enough for entertaining drama, the American movie star's ex-boyfriend, who is also a movie star, wants her back, and he crashes their visit to try and win her back.  This character is played by none other than Billy Baldwin, who plays a very similar character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, an exaggerated, corny actor.  I should note that he's playing himself in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  My family discovered this in a $5 bin at Best Buy or something many, many years ago, and we just... love it.  There's a lot of humor and little quips that you have to be paying attention to to really get, which is one of my favorite kinds of humor.  If you're one of those people who likes to sit on a bench and people watch at Disney World and, you know, just watch the drama and the tantrums unfold, you will probably enjoy this film a lot.  This was the first non-TV thing that Julie Andrews had done in nearly a decade.  And then, just a year later, she was in The Princess Diaries.  My favorite thing about this whole movie is Colin Firth's Peter, who is Felicity's nephew and the Earl's cousin, and I love him because Peter is me.  He is a chaotic gay who anytime he has the opportunity to stir the pot in this very fraught and ridiculous situation, does so with glee, with gusto.  If this were set today, he would be live tweeting it.  And I mean, Julie Andrews is great, Sophie Thompson's great, Stephen Fry has a lot of fun as the butler, everyone really commits to the satire.  There isn't a lot to this movie, but this is a comfort food watch.  It's what I watch when I need something light, when I just need to smile and laugh.  What did he die of so suddenly?  He was run over, my lady.  By an army lorry.  I'm sure you can see some similarities across these films.  Clearly, I love films with writing that engages me, films that make me laugh, films with messages, films that give a bit of insight into what goes into making film and TV.  And hopefully, knowing the kinds of films I like and why I like them has helped you understand my approach a little more.  I don't think these are objectively great films.  They're just great to me.  And they might be completely different for you, and that's okay.  Thank you for watching me rant about these weird movies.  I want to hear from y'all, though.  Leave a comment below with a favorite non-Disney film of yours, and let me know why you love it, especially if you think the reason is a little silly.

I'm 11 years old.  Probably when I was four years old, I knew that I wasn't happy being me and I felt trapped.  The first person I probably told was my mum.  She was really accepting. I think when Poppy first told us she was a girl, it just all fell into place and made sense.  Because previous to that, we were thinking that Poppy was maybe gay.  But it was difficult in the beginning, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Until we understood. It's just really, I love my child, so that's it really.  Be there for her.  Having a different background also, that's another issue.  But I take on that and it's not a problem.  Back home.  probably when I phone them and tell them they're 100% supportive too.  So we're lucky really, you know, and she's also, I think, lucky to have parents that really understand her. It was quite difficult for us when she left primary school and started high school, because at primary school she transitioned at nine, so the people there were part of that journey.  And to leave there and go to high school, it was the unknown for us.  We were extremely anxious to the point where we were feeling physically sick with fear.  But actually, she goes to school every morning with a beaming smile and comes home with a beaming smile and everything's been positive.  We just hope that, you know, the next few years are going to be crucial really because it's at the age where They start having crushes on one another and relationships and all those sorts of things.  So it won't be easy, but I think we just take one day at a time and just be there for pop. If I hadn't transitioned, I wouldn't be happy in my own body and I wouldn't be confident and I'd just be depressed and I wouldn't really want to be around anyone or anything.  I didn't know who I was before but now I know who I am and I'm coffee. I think our advice to parents who are experiencing children who are questioning their gender There's lots of resources out there.  There's mermaids, there's gyres, there's no end of stuff online.  And my advice would be to be led by your child and just go with it. Your child is your child.  Just support them.  It's not like I know anything else.  It's just like how you're born and that's it, who you are.  And there's no choice.  It's just something that is natural is there.  And that's it really. For me, it's healthier that Poppy has transitioned when she's younger because she's got all these years where she can be herself.  And hopefully that will protect her mental health and things like that because she's able to be who she is.  And she's loved and supported just the same.  You can't allow a child not to be themselves.  It's just not fair.  Why should she dress as a boy?  Why should she feel shame about who she is?  She feels a girl and she is a girl.

Today we're going to be talking about plastic straws.  Here are the points we're going to hit today.  1.  Plastic straws are medical equipment.  2.  Currently available alternatives to plastic straws do not suit all needs or all disabilities.  3.  Creating legislation around straws is dangerous.  Four, the campaigns against plastic straws have actually created a stigma for disabled people and thus made them targets for harassment.  And five, environmentalism doesn't have to be ableist.  I'm hoping that by now you may have heard that plastic straw bans would have a harmful impact on disabled people.  But if not, or if you're looking for more information, I hope that I can answer some of the questions you might have or offer you ways to move forward from here in this video.  Part one, plastic straws are medical equipment.  A brief history of straws.  Plastic bending straws were created to be more accessible than previous existing versions and are used as accessibility devices to this day.  In the 1930s, Joseph Friedman created the flex straw, a bending straw inspired by watching his young daughter struggle with a milkshake glass and a straight straw.  In the 1940s, they were marketed to hospitals and were quickly embraced as they allowed patients to drink while lying down and without necessarily having to hold their own cup if they weren't able to.  Plastic bendable straws are medical accessibility tools for people with various disabilities.  It's actually quite a list, so I'm going to read them off.  People who have difficulty gripping or holding their cups for more than a moment, people with physical disabilities such as chronic pain in their skin, bones, joints, and muscles, fragile tissues, conditions that require ingesting food as fluid, like gastrointestinal conditions, conditions of the mouth, jaw, or teeth, difficulty swallowing or chewing, postural conditions, people who have tremors or shake, and so on.  They need straws in order to independently feed themselves or drink.  I have some personal examples in my life of people who sometimes cannot lift a heavy glass.  includes myself, because I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and I have chronic joint and muscle pain, oftentimes it is very difficult or very painful for me to hold a cup.  So in those moments, I do need a straw to drink, as well as having jaw issues and teeth sensitivity on top of that.  And I also have a personal friend who very often has fainting spells and needs to stay in a reclining position, but also needs to stay hydrated at the same time.  So, She needs a cup of water next to her with a straw that can bend down into a position downward toward her so she can continue to hydrate while in the reclining position.  Plastic bending straws made their way into general use after it was determined that it was a huge improvement on the paper straw that came before them and became a mainstream market success.  Part two, why alternatives do not work.  We like charts here, don't we?  Let's pull up a chart.  Hard straws like metal, glass, and bamboo are injury risks.  Bamboo, pasta, rice, silicone, and acrylic straws are allergy risks.  Biodegradable plastic straws are often made with plant products, particularly wheat, which are a very common allergy.  and they are actually not even that great for the environment.  Paper straws disintegrate rapidly, become non-functional, and are a choking hazard.  And literally, I have yet to meet a single person that actually likes them.  Why did we go back in time for these things?  All these risks have the potential to be fatal.  Reusable straws in general require diligent cleaning in order to avoid bacteria buildup and consequential infections and illness.  The physical act of cleaning a straw can be difficult to impossible for certain disabled people.  And no, they do not necessarily have anyone around to help them with that.  Many reusable straws are not necessarily safe in all temperatures and they are not adjustable in their positioning.  Reusable straws also require the cognitive ability to be able to remember them when going out.  But someone not having a straw on their person when out at a restaurant shouldn't mean they can't be a patron.  Does that happen when people forget their reusable coffee mugs at home?  Also, you might be thinking to yourself that many of these reasons imply multiple disabilities at once.  And how often could that possibly happen?  Well, A lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, including myself.  Plenty of people do not just have one disability.  Plenty of illnesses and conditions actually impact multiple parts of the body.  Plastic disposable bending straws are the most accessible due to their sterilization, their adjustable positioning, durability, and safety, particularly in regards to temperature and being low risk of injury upon pressure, which can easily happen with physical behaviors such as chewing, fidgeting, spontaneous jaw closures, and fall risks.  Part three, creating legislation around plastic straws is dangerous.  Across the country, plastic straws are a recurring topic, with cities like Seattle and Santa Barbara putting a legal ban on the use of plastic straws.  Santa Barbara being the most severe ban in the country at the moment with threats of thousand dollar fines and jail time.  While plastic straws are a medical need, Legal bans are unconscionable.  Restrictions can be just as dangerous because it puts the power to deny a medical tool in the hands of someone who's ill-equipped to make that kind of decision.  There have already been several situations where disabled people have been put in danger or killed because of these bans on plastic straws.  From someone who was given a biodegradable plastic straw at a restaurant and not being told that's what it was and then going into an anaphylactic attack because of it.  To a woman who was impaled and killed by a metal straw after a fall.  Part four, we have made a moral detriment out of using plastic straws?  The villainization of plastic straws have created a new stigma for disabled people.  Now, when they are seen using plastic straws, they are shamed.  When they request one, they are guilt-tripped.  A reminder, disabilities won't always be visibly apparent to you.  Doesn't mean they're not disabled.  So even if we do roll back these bans, it feels like we're gonna have an awfully slow and gruesome time rolling back these elitist and ableist attitudes, pointing the finger at people who use plastic straws, and calling them... turtle killers.  These bans and all the hullabaloo around them have created a prejudice And I think we all know how difficult those are to undo.  Plastic straws should be available.  If you don't need one, don't use one.  But if you do need one, you should not be shamed for it or risk being denied one.  Part five, environmentalism doesn't have to be ableist.  First, I want to clarify that environmentalists and disabled people are not mutually exclusive.  A lot of disabled people actually do try and live as environmentally friendly as they possibly can.  But the truth is, a lot of resources that disabled people need in order to survive or for accessibility require non-renewable resources to maintain.  A lot of them already feel guilt about that.  but they have a right as human beings to survival and accessibility.  This is not the first time that disabled people get thrown under the bus as wasteful.  In fact, in my two previous videos, I talk about how outrage towards things that are deemed wasteful or lazy have had a negative impact on disabled people including outrage about pre-cut fruits and vegetables that would greatly help disabled people feed themselves more independently and feed themselves good healthy food independently but because of the outrage were taken off the shelves in supermarkets.  our ability to access the same independence as you is not a waste.  These kind of outrage campaigns making tremendous headway and rapidly at that is what happens in a system where abled voices hold the mic and disabled voices are erased.  For peace of mind and for information's sake, let's talk very briefly about the environmental impact of plastic straws.  as researched by scientists.  Out of the 35 million tons of plastic waste per year, plastic straws only account for 4% of all plastic waste.  What do you call a 4% discount?  Nothing.  And it would be even less if its use was simply reduced.  by abled people who don't need it.  It's really truly nothing.  Especially when comparing them to much larger environmental impacts like cigarettes and fishing nets and balloons and fireworks.  None of which, to my knowledge, have been campaigned or campaigned as hard as plastic straws.  to have their sale and purchase legally banned.  In comparison, the alternatives that have been created for plastic straws might in fact be creating more waste.  Yes, we should be reducing our use of plastic as a whole.  We should be reducing our use of unnecessary plastics.  We should be recycling more.  We should be finding alternatives when we can.  But if we're going to put the responsibility on the individual consumer, then put it on them to deny a straw or reduce when able.  Disabled people would love an earth-friendly alternative to the sterile, disposable, adjustable straw that is able to endure so much and safe to use and is made available to everyone, but it doesn't exist yet.  And in the meantime, we simply cannot do an outright ban on plastic straws without harming disabled people.  The production of plastic straws is a medical one.  And until a suitable replacement is found, people medically rely on them.  Single-use plastics are often medical for the reasons that I've already mentioned.  The production of plastic straws is just as valid as plastic gloves, catheters, stoma bags, IV bags, etc.  Just because you may have never considered them as medical or accessible devices doesn't mean that that's not how they are used by disabled people every single day.  In conclusion, we can do what's right for the environment and we do not have to sacrifice the medical needs of others.  We do not have to shame people for having those needs.  We do not have to tell them that their survival, their physical needs are harming the environment, particularly when the onus should not be on them.  We do not have to tell them Too bad, something else will probably come along.  In the meantime, let's deny you your access needs.  If we're going to save the world, we better make sure that it's a world worth living in.

Plastic straws are medical equipment, created to be more accessible than previous versions, and are used by people with various disabilities, including those with physical disabilities, gastrointestinal conditions, and difficulty swallowing or chewing.  However, alternatives to plastic straws, such as metal, glass, and bamboo straws, pose injury risks, and biodegradable plastic straws can cause allergic reactions.\n\nCreating legislation around plastic straws is dangerous, as it can put disabled people in harm's way.  For example, a woman was impaled and killed by a metal straw after a fall, and a person had an anaphylactic attack due to a biodegradable plastic straw.  The villainization of plastic straws has created a stigma for disabled people, who are shamed and guilt-tripped for using them.\n\nEnvironmentalism doesn't have to be ableist.

Hi everybody!  Everybody in this video except for my friend Brittany here has been in another Princess and the Scrivener video, so this is Brittany!  Yeah!  And Angel and ET.  Y'all know that already.  Wow!  So, we watched Not Another Teen Movie from 2001.  It was directed by Joel Galen?  Galen? It's interesting that the movie was made in 2001 because we thought it was a Mean Girls reference, but it came out in 2004, but It was kind of foreshadowing. I think that just says more about the way that Mean Girls was made than the way that this was made. Well, even ET, remember the first scene, he was like, that's a reference from Cars. Because Cars wasn't even out yet.  Mater was in this movie, don't let them tell you.  Cars was not around for five more years.  Mater and Wilbur Robinson were both in this movie.  Chris Evans actually plays Wilbur Robinson.  No, but actually he plays a character named Jake Wyler.  Not my favorite Chris part.  So I'll start with the pros.  There are actually more pros than cons this time.  Shopping.  It opens with I'll Stop the World, which is like one of the classic 90s.  Yeah, whatever, that one.  Ted Mosby is there. Classic Mosby. Classic.  Anthony Michael Dining Hall.  I don't know if anybody else noticed that.  Anthony Michael Hall is in The Breakfast Club. He was one of the main John Hughes characters, which is funny because the high school was named John Hughes High, so that was kind of a note to homage. Yeah.  The soundtrack?  Slaps.  Such a good soundtrack.  Wow.  Jake's entire personal plot is literally the, it's not my dream, it's yours.  I don't want your life.  E.T.  likes the purple walls in Jake's sister's room. Phenomenal.  I don't know who was at Home Depot looking at those watches and just said, yeah, this one. And then someone else was like, no, you got it.  Janie's got a gun scene has pretty much always been one of my favorite scenes of this movie, except for the banana split scene.  100% my favorite part of the movie. Would have never crossed my mind. I actually really liked... I'm supposed to be the only black guy at this point.  And then they're like, oh, I'm so sorry.  Here, have my drink. I'll head out.  It reminded me of a Key & Peele skit, because they had that one.  They were in an acapella group, though, but they were competing in the skit.  So I was like, oh, is there a competition in there? Oh, there is.  Bob Belcher just shows up, and then Good Charlotte is literally the band at the prom, so cons.  There's a lot of the use of the word slut, and I wouldn't care so much, except that it's almost always geared towards women.  I know it's a satire, but still.  It doesn't age well.  No.  Yeah.  They also mentioned lesbo and rug muncher, like those are bad things.  Again, I know it's a satire, but that doesn't really work so well.  Do any of the women in this movie wear bras?  They take their shirts off a lot, and none of them are wearing bras.  All of these high schoolers have back problems, I'm telling you.  I think that's like an early 2000s movie thing.  For sure.  Hem your jeans, Jake.  They're awful jeans.  They were awful.  Chris's hair is terrible. Somebody took a Sharpie and just... It is not the worst hairstyle that he's had in a movie.  There's a lot of ableism going on, and also casual fatphobia.  No biggie.  Everyone in the Wyler family wants to get in Jake's pants.  I also wrote down incest as another con.  The dad respected his baby. The dad's like... The dad was also trying to push the mom.  Yeah, and was like, make me proud. I did like, though, when he was like, what is wrong with this family? The Google renting option came with captions, but the captions were terrible.  They were mostly in sync, but they weren't right.  And this movie's been out since 2001, so it's a long time.  Yeah, Google has no excuse.  I really didn't understand the usefulness of the naked foreign exchange student.  That's a thing from American Pie.  Oh, I've never seen that.  That's why I don't get it.  And there's also a use of the R word, which, not cool.  It was Mr.  T, yeah.  It was Mr.  T, yeah. He also makes a cameo out of nowhere. The cameos!  They happen.  And we had Molly Ringwald, another cameo.  I liked her cameo because she is like... intentionally making fun of all of the movies she's been in. It's so meta.  The principal, you said, was the principal. Right.  Principal Vernon from The Breakfast Club is actually in it. The dad was somebody from one of those movies.  From Ferris Bueller. Yeah, it was the dad from Ferris Bueller.  Bogie Lowenstein from 10 Things I Hate About You, the most obscure reference to 10 Things I Hate About You, is the slow clap guy.  Melissa Joan Hart makes a very short appearance. Lacey Chabert was in it. That's it, yeah. She kind of appears appeared a couple times. It's kind of amazing how many people in this became really big stars.  I mean, it's a product of the times.  Definitely is.  We've made a lot of progress. And every time you're kind of like, ugh, you have to like, is that just because it's a spoof?  or was that just like a really cringey moment?  Yeah. Like the whole thing with the three guys in the vent over the girls' bathroom.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Did that happen in another movie that I just missed?  I don't think so. I haven't seen any sort of spoof like that, or I haven't seen it in a while, and just showing it was like, why? It was too much. It was very drawn out, too.  It was going on for a minute. Our arbitrary ranking category was whether or not we got the references that this movie was trying to play off of spoof.  make satire on.  We were pretty successful at that.  No, no, you guys were really successful. Because I don't really remember movies after I watched them. I feel like even the ones that you didn't know the movie from, you still got that it was a reference. Also, but then like the bring it on stuff was obvious because it was all cheerleader stuff. True. You could tell when they kind of like moved into reference zone no matter which movie it was. I will say also because we looked up the list of movies beforehand that I probably wouldn't have known the same amount if we hadn't done that before.  Yeah.  IMDb score 5.7.  Rotten Tomatoes score is 42.5.  My score was 4.  It was okay.  And my guest scores was an average of 5.3 because nobody could decide where in the middle of the road they were.  Had we seen this movie, I had seen most if not all of it before.  All of it.  A long time ago.  Am I the only one who didn't see it before? I believe it was on at, like, someone's house that I was at, because I remembered certain, like, parts of it, but not the movie as a whole. I've never seen this, and I've also, I haven't seen a lot of the movies that were referenced, but I know enough about pop culture to get the references.  Yeah. I think it works now, because when I saw this as a kid, Completely different movies.  Completely different circumstances. The total score is 57.5, which is higher than the other two movies that I've watched so far.  It's gotten ahead of the game so far. Because of those Brother Bear Cypress. They held the movie together.  Yeah, yeah, sure. The total score currently is at 1,992.7 out of a possible 4,160.  I don't really know what that is going to mean.  I'm just keeping score.  The next movie is Cellular.  I'm not excited for that one. Yeah, you can talk in the audience reaction here. You said cellular.  Bye!  Hello, everybody, for movie four of the Chris-travaganza!  I watched Cellular from 2004, and I had a coworker who told me that this wasn't a good movie, and that the cell phone was the star, and that coworker was wrong!  So Cellular was directed by David R. Ellis, who I had not heard of before, but I did actually look at the other things that he's directed, and among them are cinematic masterpieces such as Snakes on a Plane, and at least two of the Final Destination movies.  I mean, my expectations weren't super high, but I think going into it knowing that that's what this director had done, I actually appreciated this movie more than I might have otherwise.  So my arbitrary category is from Le Bas Fond Musique.  I hope I am saying that right.  I see you all the time.  I'm really glad that I got... your suggestion, but I wasn't really sure how this was gonna fit in.  Anyway, the category is any or all obscure and long-running jokes.  And so I really just picked jokes that I really liked or that I thought were like things that people could pick up on 15 years after this movie was made because it's very much a product if it's time.  A 10th grade biology teacher is kidnapped in the light of day from her own home and MacGyver's a phone.  It calls a Nokia brick of a phone.  And that just happens to be Chris Evans' character's phone.  His name is Ryan.  And the rest of the movie is Ryan trying to save this woman and her family.  because he was roped into this.  Overall, quite enjoyable.  I think you'll be surprised by what I have to say about it.  I was definitely surprised by how invested in this movie I was.  On to pros and cons.  It was on Netflix and captions were available, and unlike Not Another Teen Movie, the captions were actually spot-on pretty much the whole movie.  There's pleasant music at the opening.  I kind of liked that.  Ryan is very pretty.  Not bright, but pretty.  There are police jokes, like stuff about eating donuts, which are also fat jokes, so not great.  Not my favorite ones.  Kim Basinger is giving her all.  She gives 100% to this part.  And honestly, going off of that, There wasn't a performance that I didn't like except for the one like skeezy lawyer guy who really is only vaguely involved whatsoever.  Kim Basinger's character's name is Jessica Martin and her son, who's 11, is Ricky Martin.  And Ryan, as he learns that his name is Ricky Martin, is like, you named your child Ricky Martin?  Ryan is constantly doing the right thing.  Doesn't matter if it breaks the law or not, Ryan is like, this is what I have to do to save this woman!  It's the right thing to do!  The extremely outdated telephone technology was very funny to me.  That's one of the things that, like, a product of his time does not make it a bad thing.  The child has a Lord of the Rings backpack.  Ryan is at least polite when he has to steal cars.  Ryan stashes a gun on one of the kidnappers post-9-11 at an airport, but it turned out that the kidnapper, they're all cops.  I genuinely thought that throughout the movie there was a good buildup of tension, and knowing that this director also did Final Destination, not surprised.  All of the criminals are cops.  Jessica cuts a guy using 10th grade biology logic, and it's kind of fantastic.  So at the climax of the movie, they're at Santa Monica Pier, and the one bad guy is like... He's the one on the cell phone. Everybody's on a cell phone. thought that was like a running joke that still holds up today.  Ryan gets involved in this whole thing while he's trying to impress his ex-girlfriend Chloe, who's played by Jessica Biel, and he gives up on that need to impress her in order to save her life.  And he doesn't have to insult her to save her.  Jessica really does the heavy lifting in her family, to the point where, like, she is the one out of the three members of her own family that really does the most harm to the bad guys.  Jessica's kind of a badass, and she's allowed to cry throughout the whole movie.  The one F-word in the PG-13 movie was used so well, I thought it was probably the best one-liner in the movie.  It's a day spa, you... Those are all of my pros.  I actually only have a few more cons than pros this time, because again, I actually genuinely enjoyed this movie.  The child, the Martin child, Ricky Martin, he thinks that his mother is like being overly gross when she teases him about affection.  There's a slow-mo turn of Kim Basinger, and I knew that by watching how fast her hair turns.  Early on in the kidnapping, I thought Jessica should have taken her shoes off because she was wearing heels and they were making a lot of noise on the hardwood floor of the room she was being kept in.  If she wanted to be discreet, she needed to take them off.  Eric Christian Olsen is in it.  He's also in Not Another Teen Movie, which I didn't like his character in that either.  He's also introduced by videotaping hot chicks walking in their bikinis.  Man, this is the greatest cell phone ever made.  Because they had to show off the fact that the phones had cameras in 2004.  I guess.  Ryan coerces his friend into doing something that he doesn't want to do because will be involved because that woman doesn't have a name, apparently.  I did notice that Jessica was wearing fishnets.  That's just a weird... choice.  The costume designer was a man for this movie, so I'm not surprised.  I wrote Nokia brick phone as a con.  When Jessica first manages to get Ryan on the phone, he's kind of an asshole.  To some extent, you should just be like, okay, I'll call the cops for you.  But to another extent, I can kind of understand where he's like, I don't know who you are.  I have no way of knowing if you're telling the truth.  You just called my phone.  Ryan tells Jessica, You know, this has been really fun, but now you're wasting my minutes.  William H. Macy is a cop in this movie, and that's only a con now, for the same reason that watching The Perfect Score now is kind of ironic.  There are no police around, ever except at the station.  Ryan pulls a damn gun and nobody calls the cops.  There are like a few car chase scenes where Ryan is clearly going over the speed limit and causes many, many accidents and there's never a cop on the road when he needs one or when one should be.  like, pulling him over and arresting him, probably?  Jessica's lipstick is perfect throughout this entire movie.  It is never smudged once.  William H. Macy goes to Jessica's house but never asks the woman who answers the door that is not Jessica for any form of ID.  He just accepts that she's Jessica Martin because she says so.  He's just not a very good police officer.  I just want to know what kind of dirty cops leave the keys to their car inside the car!  They are asking for that car to be stolen by the victim that they're keeping.  Oh, and I hate the end credits.  I hate them so much.  They are the worst.  They're so bad.  I don't know if I hate this more than the Scantrons from The Perfect Score.  They may just be at the same level of me absolutely detesting what people thought was a creative way to do credits.  The IMDb score is 6.5.  The Rotten Tomatoes score was an average of 57.  My score was actually a 7.  I liked it.  I actually really liked it.  It's better than the other three that I've watched put together.  I had not seen it before, and the total point value for cellular is 70.5.  So the next movie is Fierce People, which was released in 2005, and I'm kind of excited for it.  It sounds like a hot, hot mess, but in the best way.  And I'm excited for it, especially for the cast.  So I will talk about that next time.

That's not really me personally.  Hey guys, it's Kat and it's time for another episode of True Tea.  I want to thank you guys so much for joining me for this video.  I am really appreciating all of the fun conversations we have been having on my channel about polyamory, even though I really want to reinforce that there are more things to my life than dating.  I have more things to talk about.  It's just one of those things where like, there are so many things to talk about that I can't stop.  So I want to thank you guys for being patient and really participating with me in this.  If you are new to my channel, we mostly for now do videos like this.  I will occasionally be doing videos like my video essay that I did about the rebranding of white nationalism, because we are a multifaceted type of person.  We have a lot of conversations here that are varied and different.  And this channel is all about learning, sharing, and growing together.  So that's what we're doing.  And this is the share portion.  And this is kind of the portion where I tend to overshare.  So, you know.  Hopefully you guys enjoy it.  Um, anyway, um, I'm going to be talking about something that I'm pretty passionate about.  So, um, I would suggest that you go to your kitchen and get yourself some tea.  I am drinking some Jade citrus tea, um, out of my SDSU cup that I got from the woman's resource center.  Um, when I went out there and I just want to thank everyone who's ever invited me to a college or university.  Um, I really love speaking at colleges and speaking to students.  So if you're ever interested, and having me come to your school, you can always check out the description box below.  So I wanted to talk to you guys about polyamory versus open relationships and why I tend to avoid people who are in open relationships, right?  Um, and I will start out by saying that everyone's got their own definition of these things.  You know, one of the things you learn pretty quickly in the poly world is that everyone's figuring their, their thing out.  Um, and different people have different understandings of both of these things.  You know what?  mean something to one person can mean another thing to another.  So, you know, I've got my own sort of thing.  Um, and that is what it is, but I'm open to being wrong as I usually am.  So if you're somebody who is in an open relationship and you've got something to say, you want me feel free to leave a comment in the comment box below.  I always welcome your brew of fresh, freshly brewed true tea.  So, You know, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or if you think I'm wrong.  I mean, I'm not.  I'm not.  But we can talk about it if you really want to.  Anyway, so open relationships, polyamory.  To me, these are very different things.  One of my biggest pet peeves, honestly, is that I think that there are a lot of people calling themselves polyamorous who are not polyamorous.  Um, and I, I'm always very hesitant to be a gatekeeper because I don't want to be that.  I don't want to be a person who says you have to feel this way or that way in order to be this thing.  But personally for me, um, one of the biggest, issues is there are people that do this thing.  I think I've heard, I forget the term.  It's like ambiarists or something.  There are people who are polyamorous and are monogamous in different situations.  Now, we've talked in the past about how I kind of feel like a lot of the thing that a lot of people in the poly community do.  is they?  It's like a lot of woo and a lot of like words that are, maybe you'll feel nice, but aren't real realistic or the application isn't real.  I know.  And again, feel free to drag me if I'm wrong, but I do not believe that you are polyamorous when you're open to monogamy.  I don't.  For me, monogamy is a trap.  It doesn't feel safe.  It doesn't feel warm.  It doesn't feel welcoming.  It doesn't feel flattering.  It feels like a threat.  And that's why I'm polyamorous.  And again, I don't want to do the gatekeeping thing of telling people who they are and what is and what isn't.  But it's hard.  It's been very frustrating for me to meet people who say they're polyamorous, date them for a period of time, and then have them, you know, get lassoed, as we call it in the poly community, by someone who's monogamous, right?  I think you can be monogamous.  I think that's fine.  I think monogamy is beautiful if that's what you want to do.  But as someone who does not find monogamy, to be romantic, flattering, or something that I desire, it's very frustrating dating people who say that they're polyamorous when they're actually not.  Everyone, I think, for the most part, goes through a process of dating a bunch of people before they find a person that they really, really, really, really, really, really, really like, right?  I don't think that that should be compared to polyamory because that's not really what we're doing.  people who are polyamorous believe that they can have significant relationships with more than one person.  That's not, you can have more than one person.  That's not, you can, you know, you'd be naughty and happy.  You can actually be in love polyamorous with more than one person.  Right.  But, you know, I think everyone can self-define, you know, don't, I mean, if you've, if, Don't let me tell you how to feel about yourself.  I have my position because for me, I think a lot of people like to do that weird, oh, I'm poly, but they just mean that they're dating around.  It's very different to me.  It's very, very different.  Most of us, date, sleep with, et cetera, more than one person at a time while we're trying to find a person that we really, really enjoy spending time with.  That's very normal, that's very common.  I don't think calling that polyamory is productive, especially with people who are actually polyamorous.  But at the same time, people are figuring themselves out.  And that's another thing about this conversation.  Oh, we're getting so off.  We're getting so derailed.  The thing about it is that you are, you are allowed to change your mind.  You are allowed to change it.  Like you can, you can change your mind.  It's just, for me, it's frustrating that people haven't done a real sort of soul search about how they feel about monogamy.  Because when I hear people say, oh, I'm, you know, I'm open to monogamy in certain situations.  I hear, okay, well, you're monogamous.  That's what I hear.  I hear, okay, you're not, and that's fine.  If you like it, I love it.  Be yourself, you know, love yourself, you know?  Um, but that's what I hear.  And so dealing with people who are in open relationships is frustrating to me.  Now, I understand that for some people, when you hear polyamory, and you hear open relationship, that sounds like the same thing.  It sounds like I'm talking about the same exact thing, right?  Now, I'll give you an example of myself.  I am solo poly at the moment, and so I'll just tell you what my situation is, right?  So I, as a solo poly amorist, I guess you could say, I have two partners.  Both of these are people who I care for very much, who I have a lot of emotional connection to.  They both know about each other and neither of them take precedent over the other.  In addition to those two people I'm dating, I'm also dating several other people who who are, you know, people I'm figuring out, some people that I haven't slept with, some people that I do sleep with, but they're not quite at that point that I would call them partners because they're not necessarily central portions, not necessarily central parts of my life, right?  That's my polyamory.  I believe that I can have those relationships And these can all be significant and important relationships to me.  And that's my polyamory.  Now, there's different types of polyamory.  Like I said, I'm solo poly, so I don't have, you know, I'm kind of doing my own thing.  I'm not really living with anyone.  I'm not nesting with anyone.  I don't have a primary.  That's my sort of thing.  But there's different types of polyamory, right?  Somebody who is in an open relationship, generally speaking, is somebody who is in a relationship that they want to protect.  And generally speaking, most of the time they are not open to having more than one true relationship, right?  So for example, I shouldn't probably tell people this, but, um, when I was at VidCon, right, I met these two different men, VidCon last year, these two different men who were in open relationships.  These men were both married, um, and they, had kids and things.  Um, but when they were out at VidCon, you know, having a good time socializing and things like that, their wives, um, gave them the permission to, if they were to meet somebody and that somebody wanted to have a good old time with them, that they can have that good old time.  Basically what I'm saying is people in open relationships generally have this relationship that they're protecting and they're leaving an openness for their partners to generally have other sexual connections, right?  Usually once that becomes more of a significant relationship type connection, that's when issues start.  Right.  And that's where I believe the polyamory thing doesn't really end up working out.  Right.  So for me personally.  I don't like to deal with people who are in open relationships who tend to often intersect and participate in poly spaces.  It's very, very common for people who are in open relationships to also want to be part of the poly community.  Sometimes people who are in open relationships become polyamorous because they maybe meet people who are significant to them enough that they want to date.  I mean, often people who are in open relationships, meet a person that they feel like they can date together.  And then that becomes like a close triad sort of thing.  Like all of that happens.  And like I said, people can change their mind.  But for me, For me, I tend to avoid everyone who is open to monogamy.  Everyone, you know, I mean, if I know you're open to monogamy, I'm saying that I dead ass have a date tonight with a guy who's open to monogamy.  But if you're open to monogamy, I know that our relationship isn't going to last because I'm not going to be monogamous with you.  You know, I'm not, I don't want to be monogamous with you.  Right.  And that doesn't mean that I don't like you or that I don't respect you, that I don't, enjoy your company or anything like that.  It's just, I'm not, that's not who I am.  You know, I'm not a monogamous person.  That doesn't mean I'm a cheater.  That doesn't mean that I go behind people's backs.  It means that I enjoy having more than one person in my life, but I don't believe that one person can be everything for me.  Usually with people who are in open relationships, they're generally sometimes trying to find something else in addition to what they have.  They're not trying to, um, you know, have these new relationships, have these new connections.  They're trying to have someone be an addition to, or a fun little moment for them at that time.  And I'm not super down for that.  You know, um, I don't want the relation.  I mean, obviously compersion is part of it.  Compersion is usually when you feel comfortable.  instead of jealousy, you feel like excitement that your partner is out there and, you know, having a good old time.  You know, that's great.  I think that's awesome.  You know, but I've always kind of had, I mean, obviously I want their partners to be happy that they're doing things with me, but I have a bit of discomfort with people who are pursuing a relationship with me because of how it enhances their relationship with their partner.  I don't like feeling like I'm being used as like a thing to, you know, spark a marriage up.  That's not really me personally.  Um, so yeah, that's why I tend to avoid people who are in open relationships.  I don't think that there's anything against that.  I have nothing against people who are in open relationships.  I just don't date them or really deal with them.  I mean, and if I do deal with them, it's in a very shallow space.  Like the one thing I've recognized for me about sex is that You know, I can have sex with somebody who is not particularly somebody who I want to date if it's like on my terms.  Like if I'm going somewhere and I'm deciding this is what I want to do and da-da-da-da-da and I think it's just that, I can do it.  But I generally speaking tend to really require a deeper, more significant relationship.  connection for me to enjoy sex.  I mean, of course I can have sex without that, but that's really important to me.  Sex is incredibly mental for me.  So I don't like to usually have sex without having that like intense connection.  Um, so yeah, that's why I, um, don't really deal with people who are in open relationships.  I think this is the shortest true tea video I have literally ever done.  But anyway, I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.  If you're in an open relationship, how is it working for you?  I'm curious for those of you guys who are in open relationships, why you aren't open to polyamory?  Why are you not open to your partner also having an actual significant relationship with another person?  And if you're poly, I also want to know how you feel about dating people who are monogamous.  I don't want to be a gatekeeper, but Whenever I, if I start dating somebody who's open to dating people who are open, who are open to monogamy, I know that's not going to work out.  I just know.  And historically that has proven to be true, you know?  And so I don't want to, um, I don't want to do that.  So anyway, I would love to know what you guys have to say.  So please feel free to leave your true tea in the comment box below.  I will be pinning my favorite comment.  that makes me think the most.  So please leave a good old meaty, thoughtful comment.  I love reading through them.  And right now you guys can see two fun little videos that are up right now that you can click on.  They're true tea videos about similar subjects.  And if you guys want to continue to watch videos on this channel, this is the best way to do it.  This is one of the best ways to do it.  Anyway, I will see you guys next week.

Today, I want to discuss the difference between polyamory and open relationships. I've noticed that many people use these terms interchangeably, but for me, they have distinct meanings. Polyamory is about having significant relationships with multiple people, where everyone involved is aware and consenting. On the other hand, open relationships often involve one person in a committed relationship who is allowed to have other connections outside of that relationship.\n\nI've found that people in open relationships often struggle with the idea of polyamory, as it requires a deeper emotional connection with multiple partners. I've had experiences where people in open relationships have tried to label themselves as polyamorous, but it's clear that they're not genuinely interested in having multiple significant relationships.\n\nAs a solo polyamorist, I have two partners who are aware of each other and neither takes precedence over the other. I also date other people who are not yet at the partner level, but are significant to me. I believe that polyamory is about having multiple relationships that are meaningful and fulfilling.\n\nI tend to avoid people in open relationships because I don't want to be used as a way to spice up their existing relationship. I value depth and intimacy in my relationships, and I don't want to be a mere addition to someone's life. I'm not opposed to people in open relationships, but I don't think it's the same as polyamory.\n\nI'd love to hear from you guys - if you're in an open relationship, how does it work for you? Why aren't you open to polyamory? And if you're poly, how do you feel about dating people who are monogamous?

They are 41 years old and they started HRT a year and a half ago.  And this person says one of my friends has noticed that I'm changing in personality and she doesn't like this change.  I tried to explain to her how the first few years have a big impact on our personalities and that the baby trans phase, which resembles adolescenthood, is an important phase to go through in order to find balance later on.  And this person says they feel like they're on a roller coaster ride and they're trying their best to keep it together, but they feel pretty uninformed when it comes to this phase.  So I think it's really cool that this person even knows that this is something that exists.  I have this come up a lot of times in sessions with my clients.  so let's start with a discussion around eric erickson's stages of cycle social development.  that is what this person is referring to.  so i just googled this.  but just to let you know There's different stages of development according to Eric Erickson, and a lot of people give his studies a lot of validity.  And so there's different stages, like what happens between ages zero and one and a half, et cetera, et cetera.  So once you get to I think what is pretty important aspect of what this person's talking about is between ages 12 and 18, you have what is called identity versus role confusion.  And during this stage, when people are between ages of 12 and 18, You are an adolescent and then you're going into like young teenager and then you're a teenager.  There's a lot, lot, lot that has to do with identity and your role.  And it's already confusing for somebody who's not trans, who's not queer, LGBTQ.  So then add on to it that there is something different.  definitely going on that is increasing that amount of confusion in oneself.  So this is, has to do with those who have not transitioned before puberty.  You know, you already went through puberty and you're transitioning to or addressing your gender identity later in life.  It could be even when you're in your early 20s and you're like, ah, no wonder I was so confused during my teenage years.  So what happens is that once you're able to, well, let me tell you what this article says.  Failure to successfully complete a stage can result in a reduced ability to complete further stages and therefore a more unhealthy personality and sense of self.  These stages, however, can be resolved successfully at a later time.  And that means you can move into the different areas of life that have to do with love and care and wisdom.  But basically you have become stunted.  in that stage that stage of identity versus role confusion and so you have arrested development.  you need to be able to figure that out.  like this article says you can resolve it.  so what happens is whatever age you are let's say that you begin to transition.  And again, this can relate to a lot of people also who experience this regarding sexual orientation, romantic orientation, and etc.  But you start going through that and you might then notice that you are experiencing things that feel like you're acting like a teenager, you're acting really young, maybe you feel like you're being irresponsible or immature or uh this is you trying to repair the damage that happened to you between ages 12 and 18 when you weren't you didn't know what your identity was and you weren't able to like go through that process and the way other people are.  so yes you might then end up doing that when you're older.  imagine it's like you push pushed pause during that time of your life and it doesn't matter if you're 25 45 65 you push play and there's a part of you.  it's not going to be every aspect of you but there's a part of you that's going to go way back to starting maybe even age 12 and you're going to have to work through some stuff from that time.  it could look like maybe the way that you are dressing in terms of style.  it could be the way that you are behaving.  um It could be true.  personality changes that are happening.  It could affect your relationships.  It will affect the way you feel about yourself.  It could affect the way that you feel about your work and your career.  Definitely the different roles that you play in life.  Those are all going to be affected by this.  And so, yes, it can be a bit tumultuous for yourself.  It can be tumultuous for the people around you.  And that's when you might hear people say things like, oh, it seems like you're changing so much.  Really what's happening is that you are getting to the root of who, not only who you truly are when it comes to your gender identity, but you, you, everything about you.  There's stuff that's just been builded up, builded up, built up, and it's, Imagine it's like all crusty and gross and you need to be able to move that stuff.  that really isn't you out of the way.  There's stuff that you're going to still hold on to that's always been a part of you.  And then there's going to be the new stuff that comes up that has just been, you know, repressed and covered over and it's going to come out all along with the gender identity exploration.  And you're finally reconciling that.  So this is why it can feel like this.  An example recently I had with a client was when they said that they were... She was actually hanging out with new friends.  And this person is about 37 years old.  And she said, I don't know.  I was just so nervous.  I wasn't sure if they liked me or not.  And afterwards I was analyzing everything I said.  And I couldn't figure out if there was anything I did dumb.  And... they were like, God, why am I thinking these things?  And I'm like, you sound a lot like a teenage girl.  And they're like, oh, no, no, yes, that's exactly what's going on.  I mean, if you can normalize it and validate that this is okay, that this is what you're going through, this is what you're feeling and experiencing, it's not going to last forever, but you've got to give yourself time and patience to get through this part.  And therefore, if you can explain this to some of the people in your life who are impacted, then you can also make them aware.  Like in the end, it's a good thing.  And it doesn't necessarily even mean that's going to be great for everybody around you, but for you to be able to, like this article says, reconcile and resolve.  This stunted this underdeveloped stage of your life.  then that way you're gonna be able to become healthier and you're gonna be able to have a stronger sense of self and resolve any personality Difficulties that have gone on which is also by the way a good reason to probably seek out therapy.  one thing I do want to mention is in my book is You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.  There's a whole section that has to do with looking back in the past.  And I ask lots and lots of questions.  They're not easy questions.  They have to do with childhood, adolescence, and teenage years.  when it comes to how did you experience this, how did you experience that, so that you can actually really dig down and see probably what are the different areas of your life that you weren't able to fully be able to express and explore when you were younger.  Those, even though it's gonna be hard to go through those exercises, you can still use that information so that you know this is what I still need to work on present day to help myself heal those wounds.  I'll put the link in the notes for my book in case you are curious about that.  So, well, anyway, that was a good question.  I appreciate that.  And I'll be sure every now and then to sprinkle a few of those into my videos.  See you next time.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"A 41-year-old person who started hormone replacement therapy (HRT) a year and a half ago is experiencing changes in their personality.

It's National Coming Out Day and I realized I was having some thoughts about it, both thinking about my own coming out, thinking about what coming out even means.  because those of you who have come out as LGBTQ, queer, trans, like maybe there's this one moment that you could remember telling a lot of people or even really important people in your life that you're about who you are the truth about who you are.  but then it happens all the time.  we come out all the time.  I'll give you example.  this morning me and my partner we were at the gym.  She's like my guest at the gym today.  And it's on the north part of Colorado Springs, which is known as to be more conservative.  So it's a heteronormative, cisnormative environment.  So the fact that she and I were like, we were engaging with each other on a very familiar level.  You know, I gave her a hug and kiss goodbye in the locker room.  And we were talking with each other in the sauna.  Like, obviously, we were together because we were talking about things about the day and all that and so the fact that we are in a hetero and cisnormative space just being ourselves it means we're coming out every time.  I ask somebody not to call me ma'am or to call us ladies or I try to teach somebody to use they them pronouns for me.  I'm coming out as being non-binary and it can be tricky because I like being visible And at the same time, it can be exhausting and it can be daunting to do it every day.  So, but you know, we're talking about National Coming Out Day in a different way in which it's maybe encouraging people to know that they are supported if they end up coming out as LGBTQ and trans and queer.  I was thinking about When I came out, I would say the first coming out I had was in 1998.  And I came out as 24.  And I came out as bisexual.  Now, there wasn't social media, so it's not like I made this big announcement.  But I told my mom, I told my dad, I told some friends from college.  I think I might have told my brother and sister.  But what happened was that I was married to my daughter's dad at the time.  I developed really strong feelings for a coworker when, um, at where I worked and I had, I had feelings for girls ever since I was like seven and eight years old, but, um, and attractions to girls and I'll say.  Um, cause I was a child at that point, so it was to girls, but never could, you know, be honest or admit it to myself.  So when I was 24, I finally, I didn't even know the option existed for bisexual until I moved to Colorado.  I moved from Kentucky.  And so I was astounded to find out I could be married to my husband and also admit that I had, um, attractions to women.  And so I came out in 1994.  And then in 2004, which was 10 years later when I was... No, it wasn't 2004.  It was 2004, yes.  I was 30.  And after a lot of soul searching and other behind the scenes things going on, had to definitely admit that I was actually not bisexual, but I was gay.  And at the time, and since I'm non-binary, I don't very often say that I'm gay because that infers that I'm attracted to the same... sex and gender and that's just even a whole mess.  but coming out when I was 30 as not being able to be married to my husband anymore so I got divorced.  in that case there was not really social media still to come out on but I did.  at that point I had to tell everybody because I was getting divorced and I wanted to be honest about one of the main reasons that was getting divorced and It felt great.  And I remember writing an email to a very good friend of mine and telling her that was where it felt to me like I was really coming out.  I was like, I'm going to say the words and this is what's true about me.  So that was really important moment to look back on.  Again, it just seems so funny because it's before social media.  time where it really is a big deal nowadays like when you come out you can decide to put it on your Facebook Twitter Instagram and like everybody can find out all at the same time.  and that's just not the way it was.  um for when I came out and so just think it's very interesting I wonder what it would have been like if it was different.  so that's how that went.  and I then coming out as non-binary.  honestly I don't think I ever came out officially as non-binary.  I spent at this point.  I did have social media at my fingertips because this was when I was 40. so about five years ago is when I started realizing I was probably not cisgender But publicly, like, and with my friends, I just started playing around with stuff, changing my appearance in different ways.  I eventually got breast reduction surgery.  And I, after that, didn't want, I wanted people to use they, them pronouns instead of she, her.  For me, there was not really this big one coming out.  I just sort of, it was like little sips of it over a period of time.  Probably four years.  If somebody's not on social media, they might not know that I'm on Binary.  So I have to keep that in mind when I'm spending time with family who I haven't seen for a while or friends I haven't seen for a while.  I have to remember I need to update them.  So I guess I would say I'm really fortunate in that sense that like for instance, with my partner, it wasn't like something I suddenly had to just like confess or reveal and be afraid that it was going to change our relationship.  Um, it was almost like I looked back in time and I was like, wow, I just kind of did it.  And everybody sort of just started trying to go along with it.  or some have done better than others.  But that was not, um, not necessarily a big coming out for being non-binary, but yeah, going back to 1994, uh, 1998 sorry I'm thinking about coming out as bi.  it was it was just.  it's just such a different world.  I will say I'm very fortunate that all the three coming outs that I've had I've not had family rejection.  maybe like one friend from college, I feel like rejected me for it.  And I know that's so, so I'm so fortunate for that.  And so for anybody who's watching this, I know there's a lot of different types of people who are probably watching, but if you are thinking about coming out, it's okay if you don't do it today.  Maybe it's just on your mind a lot.  Just know that there's a lot of people out there today sharing that there is support out there and I hope that you're able to um, really believe that and see that and be able to find your community to help you when you do this.  So for those of you who are cisgender or straight or who really don't, um, national coming out, they does not necessarily apply to you, but maybe you have loved ones who have come out or if you're just like a really good ally.  Um, I appreciate you being in this world as well cause it really does make it, um, better and easier for us to exist in it.  So, guess that's all I wanted to say.  thanks for listening.  feel free to chat with me below.","channel.id":"clxmi0lqz00hvcdvikdm2ixrd","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC75HVYVE-wYHGQlc4w3-GGw","channel.name":"Dara Hoffman-Fox","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX4zhIO_J4uImkfDkzQMkz4-ik4_-bz6-BYVac2NA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"It's National Coming Out Day, and I'm reflecting on my own coming out experiences.

It's Ohan, and this week on Transtastic, we're doing reintroductions.  Allow me to reintroduce myself as Ohan from Transtastic circa 2016.  I don't know.  Check the archives.  Let's go back.  Wednesday's my birthday.  I'll be 28.  One of the reasons why I kind of fell off the YouTube, uh, posting train as I thought, like, do 28 year olds post to YouTube?  Like, is that a thing they do?  I feel like I'm a bit older, which is somewhat ridiculous to say, but older in the sense of YouTube transness, you know?  And honestly, Luke, I didn't even know, I didn't even know Luke was 22.  Just watch his intro video.  I was like, surely this man is 25.  But no, so I feel like a little bit old to be here.  Thank you for having me.  As far as what do I do?  I mean, without giving you too much creepy info about myself, I live in Brooklyn, New York.  I live here because I work here.  I somehow found myself in the field of video post-production, kind of unintentional, just meandered towards that.  And I think I've been doing that for six years now.  And I mean, not to sound cocky, but I've become good at it.  And I think that's the only reason why I'm doing it is because it's just like the skills that I have.  It's not something that I feel particularly close to.  Most of my colleagues have intentionally studied film and ended up where I go every day intentionally.  I didn't.  And so I do feel a little out of place.  I don't feel like it feeds my soul in any way.  It's kind of just something I show up and get done, go home and then fantasize about like being a dog trainer for the rest of my life and like owning a pit bull rescue in upstate New York and Chihuahua.  So those are my dreams.  I love dogs.  Don't have one.  So it's very exciting.  Thanks for sticking around for that.  I have to check on the time because I'm making pasta because I am an ambitious adult.  I'm a musician.  That does feed my soul.  So I play piano, guitar, drums, which is a newer one for me, but super fun.  I'm excited to get back in the YouTube community.  I'm pretty active on Instagram.  It's like really weird.  I feel like I live most of my life.  I'm not, what am I trying to say?  I'm not as out as I used to be.  Like in 2016 or 2015, it was like early on in my transition, one year-ish.  so and so everything was like super exciting and new and now I'm kind of in a place where like I pretty much move through the world as a man.  most of the time you know except for the occasional like sees the long hair from behind misgendering or like at the doctor.  but other than that it's like pretty just not as much a part of my life as it was.  the way that I found to be visible is through being engaged online and so for me that's Instagram And now hoping to get back into YouTube.  I don't really know.  I'm trying to start off small.  My 2019 New Year's resolution is to do less.  Do less 2019.  And so I don't know that I'm going to be posting every week.  I'm going to start with once a month.  See how that goes.  In terms of my transition, if anyone cares.  I mean, this is called Transtastic.  It's somewhat relevant.  I started testosterone in 2015, I think.  15?  Yeah.  Yeah.  2015.  I'm approaching my four years on T on April 24th or 5th.  That's been a while.  I had top surgery in 2016.  Didn't go so well massive understatement.  Check out my personal channel if you are interested.  I ended up getting a revision which was basically like a surgery do-over in 2017.  I'm content enough Like obviously bummed and wish that didn't happen, but given the circumstance, I'm happy with the outcome.  I'm interested in pursuing bottom surgery, but honestly It's a lot to emotionally process.  It's a lot to financially process.  It's just a stressful thing.  I'm stressed.  I like the gym.  I've turned into kind of a beef head.  Is that a phrase?  Yeah, I just find that weightlifting really helps my mental health more than anything, and so I'm trying to get muscles.  I don't really know where else this is going, but I suppose that's the whole point of this reintroduction is to just say, hey, we're here, we're posting, drop us comments, topic suggestions, whatever you want.  That's what we're here for.  That's why I'm engaging.  My pasta's boiling.  I can hear it.  So I'm going to go.  Thanks for allowing me to reintroduce myself.  And I'll catch you next time.

So as many of you are aware by now, due to my argument with Logix, none other than King Crocoduck jumped in to defend his honour, and what followed was a truly shitty comparison between trans people and wanting to be an amputee of the seafaring variety, and whilst I could waste my time pulling apart what was stated there, something more important came up.  Namely, two case studies.  The first is a case I'm all too familiar with.  It's one of the case studies used in Psychology class to warn us what can happen if we let what we want to see blind us to what we actually observe.  People can die, sometimes after a lifetime of torture and betrayal, and I wish I was exaggerating.  I speak, of course, about the case of David Rima.  The second is that of Luna Damanjunga.  Now, oddly enough, only one of these people are trans and have any actual relevance to the conversation about trans people, trans children in particular, and that's Luna, so I want to focus on her case for now, but I will cover David Rima in an upcoming video.  Now, the reason I want to cover Luna's case first isn't just the fact that it's actually relevant.  There's also the fact that said child is not only currently alive, but both her and her mother find themselves being targeted by both conservative Christians and fascists.  And no, that's not hyperbole, as I'll evidence in a moment.  The case involves two divorced parents from Dallas, Texas, and their twin children, one of whom has come out as transgender.  The father is Jeffrey Daman-Younger, and the mother, Dr.  Anne Gurgals.  Now, the relevance of Anne's degree is the fact that she is not only a practising paediatrician with a relevant medical degree, she is also certified under the American Board of Paediatrics.  And to say her actions in this have been outstanding would be a vast understatement.  When the divorce first went ahead, she gained majority custody, including full medical custody, of both children.  Yet she understood that there would be disputes over various aspects of Luna's gender, so she put in the request for an amicus attorney.  For those of you who don't know, an amicus attorney is a court-assigned attorney who will obtain relevant documents for court proceedings, they will conduct interviews with the child and the surrounding people such as doctors, friends and family, they will communicate the child's desires without undue parental influence directly to the court, and lastly, they will sign or refuse to sign any parental pleadings on the basis of said information, all of which is done to ensure that the child receives the best quality of care.  And she didn't need to do this, but she did, and the parents were subsequently signed an amicus attorney by the court.  On top of this, Dr.  Anne Gurgels has also done everything in her power to try and get Mr.  Younger involved with the child's paediatrician.  When the issue first arose, Dr.  Anne Gurgels started sending her daughter to a paediatrician they knew through their career, but when Mr.  Younger raised issue with this over potential bias, doctor-uncle gals changed to a paediatrician.  she had no prior history with, again, something she didn't need to do since she has full medical custody of the child.  And all this information can be found on page 23 of the July 10th, 2018 court proceedings.  She actively chose to try and build bridges with the father to try and bring them around and accept their daughter for who she is.  Meanwhile, Mr Younger has taken to recruiting conservative Christians with the desire to torture the trans out of his daughter, and neo-Nazis to harass his ex-wife.  Dr Ungergauz just refuses to talk about her daughter's private information publicly.  As a result, all of the articles I found on the matter are reporting solely from the father's perspective.  and has complete respect for her daughter's privacy, so much that she even attempted to seal off proceedings from public due to harassment.  Everything I've said so far has come from the court transcripts which Mr Young has made publicly available, much to his detriment since they do not portray his actions in a good light.  Now, the story broke headlines in The Federalist in an article written by Walt Heyer.  If you are unfamiliar with Walt Heyer, he's a conservative Christian preacher who advocates the fairly horrific and entirely pseudoscientific process, sometimes referred to as conversion or reparative therapy, specifically of trans children.  The facts, it's akin to torture.  Now, Heyer's gimmick is that he's one of the very few instances of people who seem to have genuine regrets about their transition, something which has allowed him to fill the same role in the Christian ministries as ex-gay preachers.  Now, Why do I say genuine regret?  Well, when I say gender transition regret, people often jump to the conclusion that I'm talking about a person who thought they were trans and later discovered otherwise.  And whilst that would be arguable for Haier himself, the truth for many of the cases he has stolen and edited to fit his narrative before hosting them on his website is a little more complicated.  As an amazing investigatory piece by Zinnia Jones found out, there are many reasons a person may regret transition which lay outside of discovering that they were not trans.  In fact, many of the cases he references don't even qualify as having regret.  Some people who medically but not socially detransition still hold the experience to be something which helped them come to peace with themselves.  But the fact is, Meyer has carved an industry for himself by selling fears about transitional regret which are not factually based and actually run counter to what the scientific consensus tells us.  All of which is, again, covered in Zinnia's video, so be sure to check that out, either now or when you're done here.  So when Walt Heye wrote an article on the matter, we should be aware of this history and approach said story with caution.  We are dealing with an anti-LGBT plus minister who has a known history of editing stories to meet his narrative.  Now, following the original article published by The Federalist, these are the only news sites, and I say that loosely, to have covered the matter.  The Daily Wire, Breitbart News, Christian Post, Christian Examiner, Russia Today, World News Group, The New American, The Federalist , The Blaze, and The Daily Wire .  All of these are far-right Christian or fascist publishers, all of which are using the case of Luna Younger to whip up a trans panic, something King Crocoduck has thoroughly bought into without a hint of scrutiny.  Instead, King Crocoduck is trusting the man who violated not only the will of his daughter, but court orders him forcefully cutting her hair as an attempt to shut her up about being a girl.  For further clarification, the court had ordered that both parents would have to contact their assigned amicus attorney when considering a haircut for Luna.  Now, I couldn't find the original order, but I found it stated once again in the official documents after the order had been breached as stating, quote, Parties must obtain permission of the amicus attorney and follow the instructions of the amicus attorney regarding haircuts for the  child.\".  And to be clear that this already existed in some form, when Mr Younger showed a flippant disregard for the court order, pretending like he just misinterpreted it, the judge stated, and I do quote, Okay, first of all, you do have to get permission of the amicus attorney to cut the child's hair.  That's verbatim in the order.  That's a violation of the order for you to cut the child's hair without the permission of the amicus attorney.  Don't do it  again.\".  So whilst I don't have the original order, I am assuming that they're the same or at least near identical from the statements laid out by the judge.  Again, I'm having to work with what I have access  to.\".  Now, the hearing was not just about the hair, but also Mr Younger's actions following that breach of what the court had ordered.  Namely, whilst talking to his daughter over FaceTime, he attempted to fish a response from her about the haircut.  Luna froze and went silent for a couple of minutes before her mother stepped in to end the situation.  Luna has suffered clear distress as a result of Mr.  Younger's actions, distress he seeks to maintain.  Jeff was also blocked from holding custody during all teacher-parent conferences or similar meetings following said hearing, the reason being that he clearly had the intent of going to said school to actively misgender his child, is solely referred to as a girl by the name of Luna.  Dr.  Angel Giles had been willing to allow Mr.  Younger to attend if he were willing to use Luna's proper name and pronouns.  Mr.  Younger has shown no such intent.  It was also noted that Mr.  Younger had attended no prior school meetings for either of his children, and that it seemed to be another means of attack against his ex-wife, one which ignored the likely harm that such an action would cause Luna.  Mr Younger shows a desire to hurt his ex-wife at any cost, even at the expense of his own child's wellbeing, and the courts concurred.  As well as restating the order on haircuts, the court ordered that quote.  If a school activity for the children is scheduled on a Thursday night, father's possession on that Thursday night is abated.  In lieu of the Thursday night possession, Father is to have possession of the children from 6pm to 8pm on the Wednesday that is the day before Thursday on which the school activity is scheduled.  Mother must give father 14 days' notice of every instance where a school activity will occur on a Thursday night.  This order does not affect the right of father to attend the school activity on the Thursday  night.\".  End quote.  So again, the father is still allowed to attend alongside the mother, but the court sees his intent to be potentially harmful towards the child, and therefore won't allow him to do so on his own.  And that's really the whole situation thus far.  There was a use of force investigated by the police, but Mr Younger was later acquitted.  The details of that I do not know, since, oddly enough, those transcripts haven't been uploaded, so I don't know the grounds upon which they were acquitted, and I can't really comment on that.  What I can comment on, however, is their appalling behaviour towards their daughter.  Since their meeting with Walt Heyer, they've taken to setting up a website, promoting much of the dishonesty that people such as King Crocoduck seem to have bought into alongside pictures of their child in seemingly male-coded attire.  And the goal of this is rather clear.  They want to create an association between the child's clothing and their gender.  Clothing which, by the way, doesn't actually impact their gender.  Just like many cis girls can and do reject female-coded attire, so do some trans girls.  But there's also the fact that this child has been harmed by their father.  The hair is just one example.  Like a bad case of clich\u00e9, the father keeps demanding that they continue certain sports to try and turn them into a man, and the child is picking up on that.  So is it unreasonable to consider the fact that the child prefers to just do what their father says on the days he has custody, only to return to normality when she's back with her mother?  Well, the evidence would seem to suggest that.  Mr.  Younger claims he doesn't force his child to do anything, but the active avoidance of the amicus attorney paints a very different picture.  But now we come to the question of the video.  Has Luna Younger been scheduled to start puberty blockers when she becomes eight years of age, as King Crocoduck proclaimed?  No.  See pages 26 and 71.  That's when assessment of future options, including puberty blockers as well as hormone monitoring, begins.  Which is not the same thing.  It's the gathering of information to make a better informed choice in the future, not actually acting on it right then.  Puberty blockers in trans children are typically used somewhere during Tanner Stages 2-3, and whilst it's true that the lower end of this range for a typical person is 9 years of age, the vast majority of children are much older when they're put on them.  The number often thrown around by critics is usually 12 years of age.  But I don't know where that comes from.  In the study I just referenced, the average was actually somewhat higher.  The average for assigned boys was 14 years of age, and for assigned girls, it was 15 years of age.  However, in this case, they are taking a proactive approach.  They're not simply sitting around until the child comes to them after years of dysphoria.  they're getting ready to intervene at the first clear indication that this is the correct path for said child, so they'll likely start a little earlier.  Now, will they start at 8?  not likely.  That is, unless the child suffers precocious puberty, in which case puberty blockers are already the go-to response for that as well.  But all of this is pretty irrelevant since puberty blockers are clinically trialled and fully reversible, a fact that King Crocoduck just couldn't wrap his head around, as evidenced by his desperate attempts to quote Wikipedia as an argument.  Now, sadly, all I could grab was the response to his wiki quote due to the fact that they closed their Twitter account to scrub away the evidence of their misdeeds, such as this.  But I think the context is very clear, and it's true.  Some physicians have raised possible concerns about puberty blockers, Not one of which has actually been substantiated.  in all the years they've been using puberty blockers for cis children going through precocious puberty, and potentially trans children, to give them more time.  There's just no evidence to support that fear.  That's why people like Mr Younger turn to publishers such as the New Atlantis.  For those not familiar with The New Atlantis, they are to medical journals what the Creation Research Institute is to cosmology, geology, and evolutionary biology.  The people who publish in The New Atlantis do so since they find themselves unable to get through the peer review process to be published in a recognised medical journal.  It's pseudoscience 101. publish your wild claims with scientific jargon.  that will fail to convince the scientific community, but is good enough for your average buyer.  In this case, the aforementioned conservative Christians and fascists.  and that's all they have.  So, not only is the child not scheduled to start puberty blockers at age 8, the science on the matter is pretty clear.  There's no known negative effects of puberty suppression.  All it does is delay the process, offering the child, then teenager, more time to work with trained specialists to reach a decision on whether to begin HRT.  typically around the age of 16.  When said blockers are removed, whatever hormones are in the system will take their course.  That's whether it be the body's own hormones or those sourced through medical means.  So I hope this review of the Luna Damon Younger case reveals the true nature of the situation.  Please, if you see this case being thrown out there as an attack on the trans community, feel free to respond with either this video or the information supplied within.  All references can typically be found in the description, yet due to character limits, that's sometimes not possible.  In that case, they can always be found in the transcript and the pinned comment.  But I need to note this.  When we have members of the secular community.  turning to conservative Christian and fascist sources for ammunition against trans people, which were the only sources available to King Crocoduck at the time, That review was a deep problem needing addressing.  But what do you lot think?  Did King Crocodux screw up royally in throwing said case out there?  Should potential concerns overrule all available evidence surrounding certain medications, as seems to be the argument?  Why do so many people pretend to care about their child's wellbeing, only to subject them to hostile domestic environments?  Has Dr.  Angorgao's done the right thing for a child in not speaking publicly on the matter?  Did I miss something you lot noticed?  If so, be sure to leave us a comment down below.

And I don't say that proudly, it's actually a little bad.  I go through jars very frequently, and sometimes I leave the jars sitting in my room, which is really, really gross, and that's why it's my guilty pleasure.  When I was five years old, my mom bought me a pickle at a public pool in Rockville, Indiana from the concession stand.  And it costed 50 cents, and it was a whole deal.  And I bit into it, and I immediately fell in love, and I've been in love with pickles ever since.  That's my guilty pleasure.  So, Henna writes, Do I have any hobbies outside of sound-related things?  Yes, I do.  I love to paint, although not very well.  Here are some of my digital paintings.  I love to do 3D animation.  Here are some of my frames.  I love to build infographics for students and stuff like that, both music theory and voice.  I absolutely love video games, particularly Super Smash Brothers Melee.  And I like to dance, and I enjoy writing.  I enjoy working out, and that's pretty much it.  Yeah, thanks.  So Jackie Lynn says, what's your favorite hot sauce?  So I'm going to have to go super generic on this one and say Frank's classic hot sauce, only because I love wings so much.  And it's just burned into my brain as being like the wing flavor.  But I do love other hot sauces.  I recently had this black garlic Carolina Reaper sauce that was really good.  I have this sauce in my fridge right now called Antidote, which is really good.  I would love to try more sauces, but I'm getting to that.  But I really do love spicy food.  Snuggle writes, question, is it difficult or painful to keep using your voice day to day?  No, no, it should never be painful.  Otherwise, it's unsustainable.  Rose writes, with your voice videos, do you have an overarching personal goal that you want to accomplish?  Yes I do.  So I personally view voice alteration as a huge possibility to help change the world in a positive way with.  I think it goes beyond trans voice.  I want to learn how to do absolutely every modification of the voice possible and then I want to try and distill that down into efficient pedagogical technology in order to allow anyone to change their voice.  I think that so many people's lives can be improved with voice alteration.  I think that we can use voice alteration to heal social wounds, to heal psychological wounds, to actually have medical and skin benefits.  I think we can use voice alteration to help people who are born with physical deformities of the vocal tract and of the mouth and the jaw so that they can integrate better into society.  I think that voice can be used and voice alteration can be used for cosmetic purposes so people can feel more comfortable in their body.  Maybe some guys want to sound more masculine, you know, maybe some girls want to sound more feminine, etc.  I view it also as a powerful educational tool, and I also view it as a powerful tool for privacy.  We are fast approaching a world, if not already there for sure, where the global governments spy on everybody.  So I personally believe that in the future, moving forward, we will see an increased demand in the ability to alter one's voice for the sake of privacy.  So I just personally view this to be an incredibly beneficial thing to humanity, that nobody seems to be doing.  And I see the potential for it and I see the meaning for it.  And that's what I want to do.  So the overarching goal of my videos that I want to accomplish is to help people.  I want to help anybody who wants to change their voice because a lot more people want to change their voice than what most people think.  And we are basically taught and we basically grow up thinking that our voice is some innate expression of who we are, when in reality it's nothing more than a habit that you fell into when you were a child.  And I think that there can be so much global good that is done through the process of voice alteration, and I want to help people realize that good.  Okay, so Kai writes, have you ever trolled someone or used your man voice as a party trick?  Yeah, definitely.  So, um... I do it in all sorts of directions.  I like to go into Discord servers and I like to pretend that I am like female to male or I'll tell them I'm female to male to female to male, right?  And I'm like working on a guy voice.  And after they hear my voice for a while, they're like 100% sold.  It's like, you know, I'm like biologically female.  And so, of course, transphobes are always like, you'll never be a man, you'll never be male, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Because they're like trying to attack me.  But little do they know that I actually just turn it around on them and I don't know.  So, but there was this one time where I went to a server and I tried to tell everybody I was a boy and they wouldn't believe me.  And I literally tried my absolute hardest and did my best guy voice possible and they still didn't believe me.  So... And then let's see, sometimes when I'm in Uber rides, they'll like ask me like what my job is and stuff and I'll tell them and then they'll be like, oh, so you're a girl and you teach voice alteration.  Like, can you sound like a man?  And so I'll do that sometimes.  But in typical social situations, no, I never show anybody my man voice because it's kind of gross for me.  But in like passing situations where I'll never see the person again, sure.  Amy says, I've been listening to your music on YouTube all day and I can't get enough.  So amazing.  You've rekindled my long lost desire to pursue composition.  That's amazing.  Thank you.  How do I get to study music composition with you?  You can just send me an email at transvoicelessons at gmail.com.  My assistant will take care of it for you.  Now, music composition lessons with me are somewhat of a scarcity these days because I have so many students that I'm working with with voice, but I would love to take you on as a composition student, and it would be really great, so just message me.  How did people react to you the first time they saw you fully transitioned since pre-HRT?  Um... I haven't been home in a long time, so I will know soon when I go to my 10-year class reunion.  But the times that I were there, I was a year HRT, and I think I had okay progress, but I personally don't think I was that good in terms of my passing and that kind of stuff.  But still, everybody seemed to respond to me really positively.  I was accepted by some people, condemned by a few people in my old town.  I don't really care about the haters.  But... these days all the people who bullied me when i was younger now they try to slide into my dms.  so i don't know.  lynn writes.  do i consider myself in broad terms to be more introverted or extroverted and how has that affected my experience in general?  what is your mbti?  okay so um i've taken the test thing before.  i don't know if i believe in it or whatever but i am an intp.  um or at least i used to be but i used to identify so hard as an introvert and then as time has passed and my transition has gotten further along i actually people identify me as an extrovert now which is crazy because i feel like ultimately i'm like introverted but i think i'm an extrovert now and now when i take it it says entp.  so Do I identify with that?  Maybe not that test, but when I read about those, it definitely sounds like me.  I'm a thinker.  I'm very sort of just analytical and systematic, and I love to create models and just build structures in my own brain, you know?  I don't identify as an introvert anymore, but I kind of feel like I was one for all my life, so it must be that way.  In terms of the way that it's affected my experience through life, I was extremely withdrawn and I think my introversion was a huge benefit during my years coming up.  I basically would spend anywhere between like eight to like 16 hours a day making music, music composition or playing or studying in school.  And so I feel like when I would finish school, I wouldn't hang out with people.  I would go straight home, straight to my studio, put the headphones on, turn the monitors up, whatever, sit at the piano and I would just grind, you know?  And I think that if I were an extrovert, I would have had a lot more distractions like I do now.  Yeah.  That's why honesty is fashion.","channel.id":"clxmi0m1x00pccdviel2w89qa","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCBYlEnfAUbrYSwF0VujcmHA","channel.name":"TransVoiceLessons","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.95,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVGn9RebC2uvpIOs5p76eUcNUG43szROlvi5_w=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, I'm Z from transvoicelessons.com, and today I'm answering questions from my patrons.

Good morning.  I am finally free from my commitments for the rest of the year basically for this next month and a half.  If you guys have seen any of my other recent vlogs you'll know that I finished the Story Magic Academy running it and creating it about a month ago now, like mid-October.  I had a huge workload for a few months doing that and I got very burnt out.  so I took two weeks off and then as soon as I came back to work I had a workshop to work on.  I delivered a workshop on storytelling, it was for women in STEM.  and so it's actually not really for like fiction writers.  it was about like real life storytelling.  So I had a ton of work to do for that like creating it, making my slides, I had a workbook to make and then I delivered it just the day before yesterday which was new for me.  so I was a bit nervous but it seemed to go quite well and that means that now I'm finally done and I can get back to writing and doing whatever else kind of work stuff that I want to do.  Writing and making videos I think are the main things I would like to focus on for the rest of November and for December.  but because I've not had any space in my brain for that recently now that that's finally over I'm kind of like switching gears I suppose and I'm making this kind of transition into a different kind of work and a different schedule, different kinds of work days and stuff.  so I think I want to take today to kind of take stock, do a bit of a reset, figure out how I'm going to organise myself going forward and also catch up on a bunch of the tasks that I have been kind of ignoring or putting off or haven't really had time to focus on in the last week or so because everything has just all been about this workshop that I was doing.  So I bought a ton of replies for texts and emails and all that kind of stuff, among other things.  So I'm going to take you along with me today as we try and get all of my ducks in a row and all my shit together to start writing again tomorrow.  That's the plan.  But first we're having second breakfast.  Because apparently one breakfast is just not enough for me anymore.  Okay, so I have just spent a bit of time first doing like a mental inventory.  It's a tool which is part of the bullet journal method, which if you read the book, the bullet journal method, you will already know.  It's kind of like a brain dump or like a pensive.  You are just downloading everything that you can think of.  that you need to get done at some point.  And so that they're not just kind of all just swirling around in there.  So what I like to do is to do that big brain dump, try and download and get out every single thing that I can think of that I want or need to get done sometime in the near future.  And then I take that and I use a prioritisation grid to kind of filter out the most important things and give me an order in which I need to do them.  So I've got priority one, two, three, etc.  It just really helps me focus on what's actually important instead of getting distracted by lots of things that I want to do or that I think it would be really nice to have done.  Um, but which ultimately aren't as important as my priorities.  Um, so I've done kind of, I guess like the heavy lifting and now it's time to write that up into some kind of format that I can use.  Um, usually this would just be in my bullet journal in my kind of monthly lists.  Um, but obviously we're mid month because I'm doing this kind of.  refresh, switching gears, planning out what happens now that I'm kind of free floating after having completed a bunch of projects and I'm also just finishing my bullet journal.  I mean I guess it would probably make sense for me to just set up my new journal and then transfer like all the stuff, all the tasks that I've prioritised and stuff into that.  but then setting up the new journal is probably kind of a time-consuming process and I don't know if I want to like basically spend the lion's share of today doing that.  so I'm trying to figure out kind of what to do for that or if I should just maybe write write up my final lists like onto just a piece of paper for now and work off of that and so that I don't have to yeah do my bullet journal?  hmm yeah so setting up a bullet journal like I'm definitely gonna make it quite minimalist so it shouldn't actually take too long.  but I would like to you know take stock of my existing one and make sure that I'm transferring over anything that I actually want to and I'd like to give that process the time it deserves and also just because I fucking love doing things on paper and I love bullet journaling and Transferring over into a new one like starting a new one starting a fresh notebook.  It's like kind of fun for me as well It's kind of exciting so I don't want to like kind of rush through that and when I know it's something that I actually enjoy as well like if it's useful and I enjoy it I might as well let myself do both.  and and I think what is actually more important than that is Basically figuring out what my kind of schedule is from now on like how am I organizing my writing and creating some kind of regular but manageable video schedule which is twofold both so that I'm actually doing enough videos for my YouTube channel but also to make sure that I'm not doing too much because it's very easy for me to procrastinate on writing by like throwing myself wholeheartedly into videos because they're very much like kind of instant gratification compared to writing and so don't want to.  so I want to have like a kind of set schedule and both so that I'm doing enough but also not too much and I'm not using it as a way to procrastinate from writing and I also kind of need to think a bit more long term about both my patreon and the next semester of the Academy which will be in 2020 and making sure that I'm not got what I need prepared for that when it arrives.  I think the best thing to do because like literally setting up my new bullet journal is one of my tasks which I have prioritised.  so I think the best thing to do is actually just to kind of collate this stuff just on paper just on some loose paper instead of in my journal yeah and then take a look at like what the kind of order is and just work through it that way instead of trying to prioritise in my head instead of just using the prioritization stuff that I have just created.  Let's do that.  Let's write it up on paper.  Okay, I've finished writing up my final list of all my tasks for the moment.  I don't even really know how long this is going to last me, or how long I'll use this for.  This could last just for the next few days, or it could be for the next few weeks.  We'll see.  If you guys are interested in this prioritisation grid, thing, like the way that I figure out which order in which to do my top priority tasks.  I'm thinking about doing a video just on that, so if you would like that or if you're interested in that, please let me know in the comments.  and I will make it a priority.  But yeah, just roughly, I guess, to walk you through this list.  The idea with this is that I basically divided everything I want to do or need to do into three tiers.  We've got the top priorities, so the absolute most vital things I definitely have to do and which often have deadlines attached to them.  And then we have stuff that's still important, that still matters, but isn't quite as urgent.  So it doesn't have a deadline.  I would like to get it done at some point and it's still important, but it doesn't need to be done like absolutely immediately.  It's not a top priority.  It's that kind of like mid level.  I've got that as next priorities and then I've got low priority.  So this is stuff that I definitely want to do but I have evaluated it and deemed it not a top priority at all right now.  So it's things which are gonna probably act as distractions.  So I definitely don't want to be doing those instead of my top priority things.  although if I get to them then that'd be great.  So the idea with this is that I'm only ever working on one tier at a time so I only get to move on to the kind of mid priority tier once I've finished all the top priorities.  And I only get to move on to the low priority stuff once I've finished all the mid priority stuff.  So I kind of have to work through it roughly in order to make sure that I am focusing on what is most important and what actually needs to get done and not a bunch of stuff that doesn't really matter at all.  So that's the general idea.  After writing this up, I do feel a lot better and kind of more clear and focused, which is exactly what I wanted to come from this.  So that's great.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this list.  I might just like tape it up somewhere.  maybe on my fridge or just keep it by my laptop or something since it's not in my journal.  I'm just going to start with the first one that I've got and work my way through and see how much I can get done today.  It is twenty past one.  so yeah we've still got a fair amount of time and yeah we'll see how much I manage to get through.  Lunch has been had, a break has been had and now I'm trying to figure out where I'm setting up to do this work.  Having sat at that coffee table for quite a while already today I'm starting to be like, I would like a wheelchair please.  So thinking about going out.  Ross went in the gym this morning and It's now like 2pm and he's still not back and I know he's meant to be working on music stuff today.  so I don't really know what he's doing out there or what's going on.  I kind of forgot about him to be honest for a while there.  I was just like working away or having lunch or whatever and yeah I was like oh yeah Ross he was meant to come back at some point but he hasn't.  so yeah I think I might text him and see if he has a plan and then figure things out from there.  The first thing on my list is to catch up with all my messages and reply to all my texts and look through the most important emails and just get back to everyone who I need to get back to about things.  That's the first thing because that's quite overdue.  And then I'm looking at my kind of planning ahead in terms of more of like a schedule like these are like my immediate tasks but I want to figure out how I'm going to balance my writing and videos and then yeah potentially looking forward to that next semester of the academy.  and then I've got some follow-up things to do with that workshop that I did and so I need to send them the slides that I used and invoice them.  So to kind of try and sort out my new work pattern is what I'm calling it, I guess, like my schedule, balancing my different projects or focuses over the next few months, I basically just did a huge mind map, which was quite productive in a bunch of different ways, although I still don't feel like I've completely nailed it or managed to nail down exactly what I want to do.  It's quite complicated.  because there are different deadlines for different things like some things I want to be doing like on a daily basis or a monthly basis or like on a longer term basis than monthly.  so yeah figuring that out is all a bit complicated and I don't think I've like cracked it entirely but I've definitely like done a lot of it I think.  so I'll see how I get on with that.  I think I may have stretched my brain a little bit too far today trying to do all that kind of like heavy lifting sort of brainstorming mental processing stuff.  normally I try to do that kind of stuff in the morning and then save the afternoon for kind of lighter easier tasks because like I don't have finite brain power every day.  I think we've done alright.  it's been a nice productive day.  My motivation kind of wavered a little bit in the middle there but on heading out and getting back to it I definitely can turn things around.  So tomorrow I am off work because I've got an event to go to but I think The day after that is when we're going to put this new work pattern into practice and get down to writing and some videos and things.  So, goodnight, happy Friday and I'll see you soon.  And into my fire.","channel.id":"clxmi0r7004awcdvi35jusdms","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCXjda70KpggxCpmrLpxdHuw","channel.name":"Rachael Stephen","channel.lr":"LEFT","channel.tags":["LGBT","SOCIAL_JUSTICE"],"channel.ideology":"LGBT","channel.relevance":0.9,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/np6OxA__VgCJbk5OIlCijDSyBJv5-JmLOOcSZaTlE69txJqSDb4AyF2v4d3P8KgdD5IVi3i7=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I'm finally free from my commitments for the next month and a half, which means I can focus on writing and creating content again.

Back with spoilers!  Says the girl who doesn't play any video games.  Except for Mario Kart when the girlfriend brings it.  Yes, we're gonna talk about spoilers, just in case you didn't know, so I hope you're ready for that.  Let's get started.  I can't believe Peggy finally got that star-spangled dick!  That was such a bad wink.  Why am I so bad at the wink?  That was the opening I really wanted to use, but I just didn't want to ruin it for anybody who might have accidentally clicked on the video.  So anyways, for real now, I hope you did watch the non-spoiler video first because I am going to be explaining some of that stuff more in this one.  I enjoyed this movie a lot, but again, I want to start off with the bad stuff so that we can get it done and can end on a more upbeat note.  Also, I know you all love criticism.  Don't try to lie to me.  So here are some of the things that I was disappointed by.  There's a lot of stuff that I felt like had been alluded to in Infinity War that wasn't brought up at all here, probably because, like, the Thanos that we saw in Infinity War dies in the first ten minutes, which was unexpected, to be fair, and that was pretty cool, but, like, Thanos overall just got majorly downplayed, which was a real shame because he was a great villain in Infinity War.  I had sort of thought that we were going to learn about whether or not he was lying about the prosperity of Gamora's Palm Planet, and even how his own planet of Titan got so messed up.  What the hell happened to this planet?  Eight degrees off its axis.  Gravitational pull is all over the place.  I had kind of thought we were going to learn that, like, that he had come back to punish Titan for not accepting his idea, but no.  None of that was relevant, and now that he's gone for good, we'll probably never get an answer.  to those things, unfortunately.  Which is disappointing.  Thor's entire storyline, there was obviously the fat stuff, which was just really awful, but it just also really went against everything that the Thor movies have always been about, which is this big, great responsibility of being a king and a leader to a group of people, and specifically being worthy of having people depend on you, and the way in which that was undermined in this movie was just so boring and so weird.  It didn't make sense to me that Thor, in the midst of such a defeat, would retreat to be by himself.  I think it would have been much more fitting for him to become a really overprotective, active ruler.  of new Asgard, like an unhealthily active ruler.  And if they'd done that, him handing the reins to Valkyrie would have made a lot more sense.  And don't get me wrong, that was a scene I actually really liked, but with this storyline, it was still Thor handing off responsibility to somebody else so that he could just off to space for a while, I guess?  They really missed a huge opportunity to have Valkyrie kind of come in and, like, tell Thor to get his shit together.  That exact thing happens in Thor Ragnarok, like, it's practically, it's the same situation!  It's the exact same situation!  But Thor is the one to convince Valkyrie, like, stop running away from your problems, stop being day drunk all the time.  And that somehow doesn't happen in this movie, and it's so Oh my God.  Anyways.  God, Nebula's storyline.  I feel like where the film dragged the most was where we had to watch Nebula get the crap kicked out of her, not just by Thanos, but also by herself, which just seemed so needlessly sadistic in this movie that otherwise was really rather fun.  And Nebula, even like in this movie, just went through so much.  I hated that.  I hated it so much.  And I really hate that she didn't get to kill Thanos.  Especially because all of those scenes where Nebula is getting beat up in space would have been so much more worth it or even made sense if she had been the one to kill Thanos.  I don't think I would have minded if she'd even died while doing it either, because killing Thanos has been such a big thing for her in these movies, and she was robbed of both opportunities to have that closure with Thanos by men who did not deserve the honor of killing Thanos.  Can I also just say how ridiculous it is that Nebula gets got because her default settings are apparently to update to the cloud.  What?!  The female characters in this movie just got so screwed.  Look, I understand why Nat sacrifices herself, but it just would have been so much more interesting for Hawkeye to do it, given the impact it would have had on Nat, and because of what we see Hawkeye doing at the beginning especially.  If we want to look at it from a purely character development standpoint, his death would have furthered her development way more than her death furthered his.  Her death seemed to almost have no impact on how he acted after that.  He was just sad.  And it also didn't make any sense because of the arc that was set up for Nat in the first place.  Like, we get to see her, like, really taking care of the planet, and she doesn't even get to see the end of that.  And I hated it.  I hated it.  Ugh, she deserved better.  And I think if Hawkeye had died, it would have meant a bit more because his family would have come back and Nat would have had to deal with that.  It just... The women meant nothing in this movie.  And that big moment where all the women lined up was very, very cool, and I know that it was a reference to the A-Team or whatever, but like, it just felt so cheap to me.  Because it's so clear that the Russos and Marcus and McFeely have so little interest in their female characters, and that female characters are nothing but expendable to them.  The Guardians films feel kind of different now because of Endgame.  And I will admit that my feeling that way is probably influenced by the fact that this movie is just so, like, final.  And left such a crater of an impact on me emotionally right after I finished watching it that... It's probably going to wear off some with time.  I recognize that.  Especially as they move into the next chapter.  I'm sure that I will feel a little bit different by the time Spider- Study Abroad comes around.  I know it's not called Study Abroad.  I just like calling it Study Abroad.  It's faster than Far From Home.  Leave me alone!  And with James Gunn back in the fold, I do have faith that he can give us something really good for Guardians 3.  So we'll just see.  Let's lower my blood pressure now and talk about the good stuff.  I don't think you're at all wrong to be confused and annoyed by the time travel stuff.  Really confusing.  My friend Taylor sent me a two minute rant.  There are multiple theories of time travel.  The problem with this movie is that they incorporate both of them and also a bunch of other theories of time travel and all of them contradict each other.  They present multiple theories of like, oh, this is not going to work.  And then they completely undermine all of them.  So they wouldn't have had to go back in time in the first place.  So it should have erased the whole timeline.  The timeline is eating itself.  The time travel physics of this movie don't make any sense at all.  And I am personally still very confused about how Peter got mulched and then came back to high school five years later and, um, nobody else has graduated.  Like, Ned is still there.  So maybe Ned got mulched too.  I don't, I don't know.  It doesn't really matter, to be fair.  It's whatever, Tony.  I get why you did it, but it's also a little selfish to all the other people.  Couldn't you have just time traveled your daughter back to the future?  Wow, that was a joke that was not scripted.  All that being said, it's an incredibly indulgent movie.  I think it is really just better to acknowledge that this is a victory lap.  And they do not care about making something airtight.  They cared about making something that was going to reward you for sticking with them for so long.  I can honestly live with that.  That's fine by me.  As upset as I am that the Gamora we know didn't come back, I do think that this very sci-fi thing of having a younger or memory-wiped version of a character come back to interact with people who knew another version of that character is really interesting, and I'm curious to see what happens with that.  Carol's gay hair!  It was so gay!  It was so good!  I saw that hair and I was like, that is a gay haircut!  So good!  Okay.  We're fine now.  Okay.  I loved the 1970s trip to S.H.I.E.L.D Tony is my favorite character, and I really enjoyed him getting to talk to his dad.  And we have James Darcy back playing Edwin Jarvis.  He played the same character in Agent Carter, which was a series I really enjoyed, and that Marcus and McFeely were the showrunners for.  And I loved that nod.  It was the first time one of the shows was really mentioned in the MCU, and I appreciated that.  I had really been hoping Coulson would be brought back, but, uh, no dice.  But in honor of Phil Coulson, let's talk about our thirst for Steve Rogers.  He's a very good looking man, I'm not denying that.  I've never really had a crush on him or anything, which is astounding.  However, I have never wanted to Captain America more than when he picked up the hammer.  That was a good scene.  It was so good.  That was worth 21 movies.  That is the scene that I will be watching on repeat when this movie comes out on Blu-ray.  It was, it was so good.  I can't believe that Peggy finally got to take America's ass home with her.  You know what, actually, let's talk about the ass jokes for a second.  The ass jokes were so, so funny.  Like I said earlier about this film being very indulgent, the ass jokes were something I would definitely include in that.  They were just so ridiculous, but so great.  Moving on to the more serious thing, I actually watched a Full Fat video last week, and he theorized that they might send Cap back to the 1940s, and I was just so delighted because I could see that that's where they were going with it.  It was so touching, and I loved it.  I do think that they could have leaned into it a little bit more in this movie.  My ideal version of that scene would have been him showing up at whatever dance hall she said that she was going to be at in First Avengers.  I'm getting emotional just thinking about it.  But it was a really bold choice to end with the shot that they did, and that was impressive.  I thought the funeral for Tony was very, very sweet, even though I wish he hadn't died.  And I understand why he did, but I still wish that it had been someone else.  I didn't really feel like it was the right conclusion for him.  Tony's unhealthy work habits in the Iron Man films were always attributed to his fear of and inability to foster intimacy with other human beings.  But he overcame that a really long time ago.  So the final line that Pepper gives him of saying, you get to rest now, didn't really jive with me.  Especially because he's got a kid!  Oh man, that cheeseburgers line did make me tear up.  I was really holding it in quite a bit during Tony's funeral.  And I wish that Rhodey had gotten to say a few words, though.  As nice a touch as it was to have that kid from Iron Man 3 at the funeral as well, I just want to say that I hate that kid.  He's so annoying in that movie.  He's in Tennessee.  He would have a southern accent.  Let's get back on track though.  Oh boy, that part where Okoye, T'Challa, and Shuri emerge from the portal like bathed in light was so cool.  I loved it.  I loved it so much.  I feel so bad for Peter Parker because there's that moment where he's hiding on the ground like clutching the Infinity Gauntlet and Carol's just like looking cool as hell and she just does that... Hey, Peter Parker.  And that poor boy is going to have the biggest crush on her.  He nearly melted under the heat of that smile.  Mmm, so good.  Yes.  The whole battle is just really, really fun.  It's murky and there's a lot going on, but when you get to be up in it, it's really, really cool.  The rubble of Avengers HQ was a very cool action set piece that I loved.  So Scott was the unproblematic pure fave of this movie.  He was so, so good in it.  It made me want to watch Ant-Man and the Wasp, which, I mean, I thought was kind of forgettable.  I saw it in theaters last summer, and I was like, sure, yeah, whatever.  I want to watch it again now.  And I enjoyed that.  they kept that kind of subtle dynamic of him being really obviously obsessed with wanting to be in with Steve and be Steve's friend, and Steve kind of being like, that's cool, buddy.  You stay over there, I'm... I'm dealing with stuff right now.  It was a fun dynamic.  His reunion with Cassie did make me cry.  It was the first thing that made me cry.  Cassie seemed a bit old, but that's whatever.  There's really quite a lot of things I'm willing to let go of because the movie was so enjoyable and gave me so many fun things as a fan.  Ultimately, I would say that even though I think this movie was really packed and not a fantastic standalone movie in the way the other MCU films generally are, I can't really say that I care that much.  And I think it's okay to let go of some of the things, like the time travel plot holes, just so you can fully enjoy seeing all of these things that the MCU has built.  over 22 films just collide with each other at full speed.  I did have a great time.  I think I'm going to enjoy it even more now that I know what to expect.  The female characters thing is like a big problem.  Like I'm not gonna lie about that.  It does really, really bother me.  It's been a long journey to get to Endgame and I hope they're actually going to walk the walk in regards to their uber diverse next slate of films.  We'll see.  I am excited to see Endgame again.  I probably won't for another week or so.  I hope you all enjoyed this.

With what happened at Faithless Forum, I've decided it right to issue a public apology and condemnation of said acts.  When I made a video response to Stephen Woodford, an attendee and speaker at said event and my subsequent request video, I had no idea what would transpire.  Acts comparable to arson tore through the secular community, bringing pain and anguish to many.  So let me say it clearly.  I condemn what occurred, and I apologise.  Now since we're here talking about fictitious events which never occurred, I'd also like to apologise and condemn any part I played in The Fall of Man, Stealing Fire from the Gods, and the sinking of the lost city of Atlantis.  So yes, we've reached that stage where my critics are trying to silence me as a means to stop me defending not just trans rights, but myself in defending trans rights.  For those who don't know, I published a video on the Faithless Forum following the whole Woodford incident.  I'd seen similar situations in the eight years I'd been part of the secular YouTube community, and had concerns about what could potentially transpire at said event.  So I made two simple requests.  I asked people to keep an ear out for said claims that I fractured the atheist community, and, if they emerge, remind people of the truth of what happened.  And that was it.  Now, a big part of what I did was actually a preventative measure.  People are less likely to start shit if they know the person they're talking about might find out.  It pretty much acted as a reminder for people to watch what they say, and it seemed to have worked.  the topic only came up one time, as far as I'm aware, as a question for Woodford.  Now, according to my sources, he answered said question without even mentioning my name, so all was good.  So why am I making this video?  Well, I was on a livestream with Maddie from Objectively Subjective, talking about the state of the secular community, and I had my Twitter open at some point.  Now, after the show had ended, I opened that tab and saw that someone had included me in one of those suggestion lists.  You know, normal stuff, it's just rather typical.  But what stood out was a particular tweet by Telltale Atheist, which stated, quote, Indeed, join our community.  Although Essence the Tweet tried to start shit at our conference, so I'm not super happy about that.  Wouldn't recommend them.  Either way, lots of us  around.\".  Well, I wasn't about to ignore accusations levied against me, so I took a screenshot of said tweet and asked Telltale to defend their claims.  What followed were accusations about what my fans had apparently done at said event, but it was always kept vague, so I and others kept demanding to know what had happened, precisely.  reports only mention the single question, to which Telltale told us we'd have to wait for the conference video to come out, so clearly there's an active accusation going on.  Now, I'm not so sure about what took place after that, since they suddenly started changing tact.  They started claiming that it wasn't about what had happened, even though their original tweet and their tweet about the video implied differently, I got the feeling that maybe one of the attendees or organisers had told them that they're spouting shit and there's no way to dig themselves out of that.  So I just took it for what it is, an attempt to avoid being caught out on a lie.  So I and others pointed out the very active assertion that I attempted to start shit, to which Telltale responded that they'd done no such thing, only to gloss over the fact that they had when I inevitably reminded them of the original post that had started the whole damn thing.  At which point they offered no apology, they just wanted to turn conversation away from the fact that they'd been caught lying to trying to implement me in what hadn't occurred.  It reminds me a lot of far-right types grabbing any brown person they see on the street and demanding that they condemn 9-11.  It's not a genuine demand for condemnation, they're putting said person in a bad situation.  If they condemn it, that can be twisted to be a sort of apology from the right angle, implementing them in some way in what occurred.  If they don't, well, clearly that's to do with the fact that they agree with what happened.  Either way, they're fucked.  Now following all of this, Telltale switched tact once more and attempted to cosy up to me, asking for a private conversation, which I was not going to entertain, especially with shit like this.  Not only have their attacks and their lies shown them to be acting in bad faith, but they openly admitted to backpedalling, not because they were proven wrong, but because they wanted to shift the focus of the conversation away from said lies.  And that was it for them.  I have no intention of spending labour talking to someone who has demonstrated themselves to be acting in bad faith.  It reeks of fakeness, and I think that's by design.  They don't want a conversation, they want me to see the backpedaling comments because they know a reasonable person would cut off contact after that.  But they can still present that in the same fashion as theists present people refusing to waste time with them.  So again, no matter my response, I take flak for this.  But I feel I've defended myself well enough.  I've seen some people removing their support for Telltale, which is good.  It's good to see actual consequences for their actions.  But it wasn't just Telltale.  I had this lovely figure come and tell me that my defence of myself would now tarnish their opinion of trans people forever.  They went on to say that they've gone beyond simple transphobia, as a result of me defending myself over defending my rights.  as a trans person.  Again, it's more hard choices, and I could just brush this off as simple trolling, but it's not that.  This is manipulation designed to stifle criticism, both by Telltale and this jackass.  You need to know what happens to trans and other minority voices in the secular community.  This acts not only to justify the transphobia they started with, since, no, I don't buy the, I used to support you.  If you claim to have supported me, only to revoke said support when I act in self-defence, that's not actual support.  But it's also designed to disarm me.  Pretty much, they wanted to disable my defence response.  I can't defend myself without them revoking some allyship.  Which, by the way, Prue said allyship to be fucking false to begin with.  But they don't care about that.  All they care about is putting me back in my place.  I first discovered the label trans and the various sub-labels in 2011, at which point I started going through them to figure out which one described the sense of identity I had had since I was a young child.  And I kept that hidden for years, because I was too afraid to come out.  And as part of that, I couldn't defend my peers as much as I wished, and I have to live with that.  But I can tell you one thing.  I'm not going back there, and these attempts to stifle my voice can all get fucked.  I don't like what I'm doing, but it's necessary.  My rights are not up for debate.  Me defending myself over defending my rights is not up for debate.  This is a game for people like Telltale and just Friedel.  It's not for me.  I actually have something to lose from this emotionally draining conflict.  And it is emotionally draining.  I shared Telltale's tweet with a friend of mine, not realising that her child was a massive fan of him.  It feels shitty to know that I'm breaking a lot of heroes, and it got to the point where I actually broke down crying over this fact whilst talking to both Maddy and Godless Cranium.  I had to walk away for a couple of hours to calm down.  This work is not leaving me feeling good.  I don't do it because of positive reinforcement.  But it is necessary.  And I know that some people already see me as foreboding, so perhaps people's perceptions of me aren't exactly changing.  But this isn't something I do out of joy.  It's something I do out of desperation.  out of pure fury of the injustices being wrought.  And I'm damn tired of this culture of apathy.  I'd have once referred to it as the Cult of Apathy, but the word cult has been overused by every bloody tool under the sun so bloody often that the word has lost its bite.  but I'm still sick and tired of it.  This idea that I should either not speak out in protection of trans rights, my fucking rights as a trans person, or in defence of myself over possible occurrences, is just a symptom of that fucking apathy.  So as is hopefully made clear from this video, if they lack any actual reason to discredit you, they will invent something, and I'm questioning as to whether this is simply motivated by a sense of protectiveness surrounding a single conference, or whether it's an opportunistic attack used to try and poison my character in relation to recent discourse.  Nothing is simple anymore, and as Telltale has shown, his word on this can't be taken for shit.  I mean, Telltale was so protective of his conference that he attacked someone with a known history of documenting shitty behaviour and reporting back on it.  The fact that I'm making this video can't be a surprise, and surely someone of basic intelligence would realise that by forcing my hand on this, faithless form now becomes tied to libelous allegations.  Allegations which include comparing my actions in defending my rights as a trans person to the burning of kingdom halls and targeted harassment of women until they close their accounts.  When people search faithless form and future, this video will appear, and none of that can be a surprise to telltale atheists if they're half as smart as they pretend.  So what does that tell us about their motivations here?  But what do you lot think?  Are we coming to a tipping point in the secular community, or am I just being hopeful?  Did anything I say in my Woodford or subsequent Faithless Swarm video amount to starting shit?  Was Telltale fair in comparing my actions to the burning of Kingdom Halls and targeted harassment of women until they closed their accounts?  Did I miss something you lot noticed?

In this video, I want to talk about one of the most important tools for analyzing, measuring, and interpreting sound: The Spectrogram. \n\nThe spectrogram displays sound in 3 dimensions: frequency, time, and amplitude. The spectrogram makes it very clear what the differences are between sounds. Plus, it's beautiful and fun!\n\nA spectrogram can allow you to get more objective feedback about the acoustic behavior of your voice. To utilize the tool for voice feminization, try to maintain a single static pitch but shift while shifting resonance. You should be able to see the harmonic's amplitude change while the fundamental pitch remains the same. In this way, you are directly observing resonance by controlling for the variable of pitch.\n\nFreeware spectrogram: http:\/\/friture.org\/\n\nI hope you all enjoy this video! More epic voice content coming soon.\n\nwarmly,\nAmelia Zheanna H.\n\nLove my videos? Consider supporting me on patreon!

So let's get started.  So first off, that's a spectrogram, and it allows us to see sound in three dimensions.  We have the first dimension, which is frequency, and that goes up and down on the y-axis like so.  So you'll see that this Little piece up here goes up and then it goes down, right?  So that's displaying the frequency measured in hertz, okay?  Now it also shows us time, which is on the x-axis, and we can see that here.  So as the sounds occur further apart, naturally the spacing and the display of it shows that they're further apart.  So we have time and we have frequency.  And then the last thing that we get to see from this is amplitude, okay?  Now let's take a look at this.  Notice how as the sounds get louder and quieter, you see that when they're loud, there's that hot intense heat map, that bright orange, right?  And then when it's very quiet, there's that faint blue.  Now we can change that color layout to anything we want, but basically this shows us like a thermal heat map of volume or amplitude.  So those are the three dimensions of sound and you can recreate any sound that has ever existed with just those three dimensions.  frequency, time, and amplitude.  And they are all perfectly displayed on a spectrogram here.  Now, you'll notice that that was just one straight line, right?  That typically doesn't exist in nature.  In nature, we have what are called harmonics typically occurring when we hear a pitch.  Like these lines, yeah?  And those exist in any physical object that creates a pitch.  Now let's take a look at an actual real instrument or a digital reconstruction of a real instrument.  So here you can see a flute with some reverb and a hall and we can see the individual notes of the flute.  and you can see there are lots of harmonics, right?  Like all these extra little streaks here are harmonics and you can see how the room is causing the sounds to sustain and almost blur into each other.  So even the very room that you exist inside changes the way the frequencies behave inside them, okay?  You will see each of these harmonics gaining volume right there.  Now the resonance is there, now it's there.  And you can see how these harmonics are individually getting louder or quieter.  That's what I do in my voice when I do this.  It's the exact same process.  So resonance modifies the relative amplitude or volume of these harmonics, which comprise the sound, okay?  Sounds are not just one sound.  They are typically infinite nests of other frequencies.  And we make those louder or quieter to change the timbre of our sound.  Let's take a look at some more sounds.  Let's take a look at, I don't know, like a drum set.  So a drum set might look like this.  These actually have a chaotic amount of frequencies because they don't produce exact pitches.  So they just kind of push air everywhere and you get these signatures.  You can see here that there's like kick drums there, the snare drums right there.  So you can tell whenever there's a snare drum.  Now let's look at a piece of music and see what that looks like.  A piece of music has lots of stuff going on at once.  So you're gonna see tons of frequencies all over the place.  You can see the kick drum, the 808 right there, right?  That's this low frequency.  The snare is this huge streak of frequencies.  And so that's what we're looking at when we deal with sound.  Now essentially all sounds are just arrangement of these frequencies in various volumes and various times.  Lastly, I wanna show you what human voices look like on a spectrogram.  I'm gonna demonstrate using my voice.  Now, here's what a live microphone looks like.  Apparently there's some noise in my room, so we can see really low frequency noise down there, right?  And we can see that my voice has lots of harmonics.  Right?  Those lines are harmonics.  Now watch me change gender. Um, okay, so like if I talk in this voice and I keep it at this kind of pitch, and then I talk in like a female version of that pitch. You can see here in the female one, there's all this brighter stuff going on than the male one, right?  Those higher harmonics are activated.  So we can use a spectrogram to measure if our voice is sort of moving more feminine or more masculine.  The pitch should stay the same, but we should see greater brightness or greater intensity, greater amplitude on these higher harmonics like so.  Or like this.  And you can see that when I raise my resonance really bright, like my pitch wobbled a little bit, right?  That was just bad control.  But you can see how we can observe all these amazing details about the sound, thanks to a spectrogram.  And all it shows us is frequency, time, and amplitude, which are the ingredients that build every sound that you've ever heard.  Okay?  so i hope you learned a little bit about spectrograms today.  there's a lot more to learn and there's so many cool uses for them.  um and below in the description i will put a link to a freeware one that you can use.  if you have any questions or comments please feel free to post below.  i love interacting with you all down there.

It would have triggered me.  and it did trigger me so much and it triggered my dysphoria crazily.  Probably cried, whatever.  But now I feel like things changed, that I moved forward, I'm to progress to be put in that position again.  For so many reasons, now if somebody comes off like that, I just feel at peace because I don't want to be around someone that would just tolerate my body parts.  I want them to be genuinely attracted to it.  And if they're not, they're not.  Somebody else will and they might be even cuter, even better, even smarter.  And I have had trans people asking me, you know, the ones that are still new in their transition as well, asking me, I'm scared to transition and I'm scared to just accept being trans because I'm scared I'm not going to be loved ever.  And that is just heartbreaking to me.  And that is not true.  You will.  And the second type of rejection I think hurts me more now which is the social one.  you know when you find a girl that really cares for you and really loves you but she's not that girl.  you know she's not the type of girl that would stand up for you no matter what.  she's very influenced by society because i mean depending on the girl's family it could be actually somehow i'm not gonna say brave but Like she would come out of her way to date me as a trans person.  Just a short story, I'm not gonna get into details with this.  I had a girl that I really liked since I was a kid and she didn't like me ever because we grew up very close.  She was one of the few people that I have met Since I was a kid and still kept contact with still came out to but still was there But she was not quite that type.  She was very influenced by society.  She was so scared scared of her parents scared of everybody and she knows that by dating me She's gonna put herself in a specific spot, especially that everyone is religious in her family and she is as well.  So it's.  It's sad.  I think that is the most heartbreaking experience because you know I just sit in the end in the corner and think to myself why do I have to be the one that people would question?  why do I have to be the one that people are not sure about?  always you know just because I'm trans if I were cis it would probably be like literally the opposite because I have everything that she wants.  I just I'm not like other guys you know.  So yeah, that sucked.  I think the third type of rejection are people that will just reject you for the idea.  They're just like, oh, I'm not going to date a trans person.  They don't know what a trans person specifically is or what type of trans person are you.  Because trans people have different body parts, let's say.  It could be like pre-surgery, after surgery.  Like they will literally just not want to date you because you're trans and just that idea of it.  Those are the people that you literally should not encounter in your life whatsoever.  You should be able to build up a space that doesn't put those people in your way.  With me coming back to the online life after a year of deciding to go stealth, went wrong.  I didn't like really, I felt like so much pressure, you know, and I felt that dating would be way harder if I were stealth.  But being out online and everything, so everyone that approaches me, I automatically know that they know I'm trans.  They know I think like that and that.  And they're cool with it already, so it's not gonna be a topic that we'll discuss.  Will you accept me?  Will you still love me because I'm trans?  I fucking hate that.  Like, who are you to be sitting deciding whether I'm worthy or not of your attention or time?  Like... Come on.  And it's usually like, what sucks is that it could be people that I'm considered maybe more attractive than or smarter than or I have more to give than, like, in general.  But still, with that little piece of me being trans, it's just gonna make me automatically lower.  No.  We don't need those people.  We don't want those people.  Yeah, that's my take on this topic.  If you guys have a story of your own, feel free to share it.  We need that right now.  We need to know that we're not alone and you're not for sure.  So thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in another video.

I have this intellectual thing where I say to myself, you know, I would date a transgender man.  I also know that I don't know what that would be like.  Hey guys, it's Kat and it's time for another episode of True Tea.  I want to thank you guys so much for joining me yet again on this channel for True Tea.  I really appreciate those of you guys who are here every single week and have decided to make True Tea part of your weekly routine.  If you're brand new to this channel, what we'd like to do is learn, share, and grow through education and conversation.  And that is what we're doing here, the conversation portion.  We like to just have open conversations where we are just sharing our feelings, our experiences and all that jazz.  And hopefully we can sort of learn something from each other.  I know that I have a lot to learn and you know, this is just sort of the space for people who enjoy learning.  Now, if you are a fan of True Tea and you like these videos, I would highly suggest that you support me on Patreon because I do upload True Tea videos way ahead of time.  So if you're interested in that sort of thing, go to the description box and, you know, see how you could, you know, support me.  Supporting this channel really does mean an absolute lot to me.  Times are a little rough.  It's the summer, so I would appreciate, you know, any little help that I can get.  So yeah.  Anyway, let's jump into this video.  But before we do, I would highly suggest, as I usually do, to go to your kitchen and grab yourself some tea.  Now, personally, I am drinking some youthberry tea, if you can't tell from the pink hue on of my drink and it is very, very warm in this apartment.  So I'm probably gonna be sipping this quite a bit.  I might even jump up and get some more tea.  I don't know, but y'all are just gonna have to bear with me because I'm melting.  So let me take a big sip and then let's get into this video.  So we're going to be having a conversation that a lot of people have requested that I have.  A lot of you guys have asked me to talk about this, but to be honest, I've been a little nervous about discussing it.  You know, I don't want to sound ignorant.  I don't want to say things that are hurtful, but True Tea is all about me being honest and real.  And so I felt like I would be honest and real about this subject and maybe accept the blow back if I get any.  We're going to be talking in this video about why I have not dated a transgender man.  I want to say that, um, I'm nervous about having this conversation because there are so many parallels, right, to how people could talk about me and I don't want to say things that make people dysphoric or make people upset.  But again, this was a really requested video and I felt like, you know, I needed to come and say how I felt.  one of the reasons why I made this video is because I've, throughout this series, spoken a lot about men.  And a lot of times when I've discussed men, um, it's been cis men, right?  I haven't, um, I guess I remember I got a comment that was like, you don't mention trans men when you mentioned dating men.  Do you not think that trans men are men?  And to be honest, I didn't really understand that particular reading of my conversations about men, you know, I am a very social woman who is unfortunately quite tragically straight and I go out a lot and men talk to me and it, you know, it is what it is and most of those men are cis, right?  It's not like I've actively rejected trans men.  It's not like I have on any of my dating profiles, trans men don't contact me.  It's just that I haven't really had a lot of experiences.  Now I will be very, very, um, you know, forthcoming and honest with you guys and say that there was definitely a time in my life where I did write trans men off completely and totally.  But right now, I definitely have recognized that I could date trans men.  Now, one of the things that I think is so relevant in a lot of conversations we have about dating preferences is that I personally sort of believe that a lot of people's minds are opened up when they're exposed to certain things.  You know, when I sort of had my opinion that I would not date trans men, the sort of trans men that I met just happened to be trans men that I wasn't attracted to.  But since then I've been exposed to several trans men that I have found attractive and that's helped me sort of put the pieces together and understand that I would probably date a trans guy.  I just haven't met one yet that I would.  Now, there's a parallel here because in my own personal life, I've definitely been a lot of men's first transgender experience.  And that's always been something that I, Well, not always.  There was definitely a time where when I was younger and I was a guy's first time experience, it was like a badge of honor, you know, like it was something to be proud of.  Now, I, with time, recognize that men are not worth that amount of, you know, excitement.  But for a while, I really sort of felt like, you know, if I was a guy's first... it was this sort of big thing.  right now the problem that i've that i've kind of experienced with being men's first is that when you are someone's first experience there's always that risk that they may try something and totally withdraw.  they may actually be interested in you they may actually be attracted to you but when it comes to doing anything you know, they may shut down.  And I've had several experiences like this.  I've had several experiences where I'm talking to a guy.  He's really, really interested in me.  I'm really, really interested in him.  He's attracted to me.  He either knows that I'm trans or I tell him that I'm trans and he's like, cool, I'm OK with that.  And then, you know, I we get down to business And he freaks out, just freaks out and can't do it.  Right.  Can't do it.  And as a trans person, that's been particularly painful.  I mean, honestly, I sort of have to go through life right now, sort of swallowing the fact that I'm going to have a lot of exchanges and interactions with men who are very, very attracted to me but are unwilling to pursue me because I'm not cisgender.  I have several men in my life right now who, you know, we get along, we like each other, there's mutual attraction, but our relationship can only go so deep because they can't get over the trans thing.  Now that doesn't mean that they're not nice to me, that doesn't mean that they're not kind to me, but it does mean that ultimately they are not willing to be what I want.  And that is sometimes really upsetting.  It is sometimes very upsetting for me to be in situation upon situation upon situation where I'm given this sort of like.  I see what could happen, right?  I see where we could go and what I could do and what sort of relationship I would have.  And then my transness completely contradicts it or completely cancels it out.  You know, men would be willing to give me the world, at least they said that they would, but then they find out that I'm trans and it's suddenly like, oh, well, and that's really, really, really painful for me.  So I'll be honest and say that I'm definitely attracted to trans men.  I mean, I matched with this trans guy on OkCupid the other day.  I have my OkCupid set to include transgender men.  And he was really, really handsome.  And I will say, and this is part of the problem with this conversation, I think it is relevant.  And I know that this is something that's probably really hurtful to hear for some people, but the trans men that I tend to be attracted to look like the cis men that I tend to be attracted to.  You know, I am very kind of attracted to the kind of men that look like they could throw me across the room.  Okay.  I know that.  It sounds, you know, but I like what I like, you know, I like what I like, you know, I like a good bearded man, you know, maybe a guy who's a little thick a little bit, you know, a little cuddly or whatever.  I like a big sort of, you know, man.  And the kind of trans men that I found myself attracted to look like that.  And I know that there's a conversation here about whether or not that is transphobic or sexist or, you know, all these other things.  But that's how I feel.  And one of the issues that I've had with having this conversation and having other conversations is that I find that people often want to over-politicize some of these conversations about attraction.  A lot of times we have these conversations and people say, Oh, you know, if you were really on board with all this stuff, none of these things would matter.  I mean, we have a similar conversation when it comes to discussions of trans women.  I remember when I did a video with my ex, right?  And it got reposted on all these LGBT sites, right?  A lot of people were upset because he was willing to openly claim a trans person, but a trans person who was passable or who was read as cis, right?  That's who he was willing to claim.  And he probably wouldn't have had a similar relationship with someone who wasn't that way, you know?  The sort of frustration I get when we have this conversation is I don't really, I understand the criticism of, you know, sometimes when we express these things, it says that, it makes it seem like The only people who deserve relationships are the people who pass.  The only people who deserve relationships are the people who look cis.  I do get that.  I also don't really know where we could take this conversation because to be honest, I've been in a lot of situations where again, men have made exceptions for me.  They like cis women.  They've all throughout their life been exclusively interested in cis women.  They meet me and they're attracted to me.  They're interested in me.  They want to go and they want to pursue something with me.  But what ends up happening is it's too much of a... square peg in a round hole.  You know, they will go, they will in what their mind might be, put aside their usual preferences, put aside their general desires to pursue something with me.  Um, And oftentimes because I'm not what they're used to, because I'm not what they usually like or what they usually want, it doesn't work out.  And so my sort of thing with a lot of people who do this, like, well, you shouldn't, you know, we shouldn't have these conversations or people shouldn't have certain preferences.  is I personally, cause I've been through it several times, think that it's a lot more hurtful to date somebody who sort of has these feelings about something, but has put them aside only to have them ultimately be like, yeah, I like what I like.  You know, it's not, that's not a dynamic that I want to be in.  Right.  And so I have this intellectual thing where I say to myself, you know, I would date a transgender man.  I also know that I don't know what that would be like.  And I'll be real and say that sometimes my hesitation with pursuing transgender men does come from what I know.  it feels like to be a person who Someone is attracted to physically, but they just can't do it.  To me, that's so painful.  That's so hurtful.  And I worry about putting trans men in a position where maybe I am attracted to them.  Maybe I do have an interest in them.  Maybe we do really get along.  But maybe I don't know, actually, because I've never been in this situation.  Maybe I just can't do it.  I don't know.  And that I don't know sort of space makes me feel really nervous.  Because, again, I don't want to hurt someone in the way that I've been hurt.  And so... That's been really the reason why I haven't dated a trans guy.  The guy that I matched with on OkCupid the other day, he was very, very cute.  And unfortunately, he was just visiting.  I don't, I mean, I do know.  I was about to complain about people who use dating apps while they travel.  But then I remembered that when I was in London, I went on like three dates with guys on Tinder.  So I'm a hypocrite.  What else is new?  He was traveling, so he may or may not be back in town.  I don't know.  But that's kind of a rare situation.  It's very, very rare that I have even come across... first of all, even come across a trans guy.  I mean, even in all of the sort of sex positive, you know, gothy, body positive, BDSM-y spaces that I exist in, even in all these spaces, I think I've probably only ran into maybe three trans men at tops, at least that I've known of.  Probably three.  I think three is a good number.  I've been out here for two years you know.  i just don't find that i in that i run into trans men very often you know um and i'm the sort of person where i do like for things to be sort of organic.  one of the reasons why Ugh, you guys, I've been caught now because I just revealed that I had undeleted my OkCupid, which is still not going well.  But I was gonna say that I like to organically meet people, and the reason why I deleted my OkCupid page is because I recognize that a lot of times when you meet people from these dating sites, you're not really meeting people who could integrate into your life.  You're meeting people who often exist completely outside of your own experience and completely outside of your world, And you've got to either bring them in or you've got to come into their world.  Right.  And I just kind of got tired of that and decided that I wanted to sort of try to date people who are actually in my world.  Right.  And so I'm not going to go out of my way to find a trans guy.  to prove a point.  You know, I would rather if I met a trans guy, and we connected and there's mutual attraction, see where that goes.  But I still don't quite know where it could go or where it would go.  I don't know.  And I'm still afraid of sort of putting a trans guy into that situation.  So that's what I had to say on that.  So I'm very, very curious to hear what you guys have to say about this.  I would love to hear from trans men if you've been in similar situations I've been in where you date somebody who is attracted to you, who just can't do it.  Cause I've heard that a lot with, um, trans women, but I have not heard that a lot with trans men.  I'm very, very curious if you've been in that situation.  And I'm also curious to hear how you guys think about what I said.  Um, because honestly, I don't want it to sound ultimately problematic because I would date trans men.  I just haven't met one that I would.  I've met several trans men.  I think I meet the most transgender men when I do my speaking because that's just where people go.  But in general, I just don't run into them.  And so that's a big reason why it hasn't happened.  Anyway, I would love to get your true tea.  So please leave your true brew in the comment box below.  Right now, you're looking at two videos if you want to continue to sip tea with me.  And I hope that you do do that.

Today, I'm discussing why I haven't dated a transgender man. I've been asked to talk about this topic, but I've been nervous about it, not wanting to sound ignorant or hurtful. I want to be honest and real, though, and that's what True Tea is all about.\n\nI've realized that I've been attracted to trans men who look like the cis men I'm typically drawn to. This has led to some hurtful experiences, where men are interested in me but can't pursue a relationship due to their own preferences. I've been in situations where men have made exceptions for me, but it ultimately doesn't work out.\n\nI've come to understand that it's not about being transphobic or sexist, but rather about being honest about my own preferences and limitations. I worry about putting trans men in a position where I might be attracted to them, but ultimately can't pursue a relationship.\n\nI've only met a few trans men in my life, and I've been hesitant to seek them out on dating apps. I prefer to meet people organically, and I've found that dating apps often lead to superficial connections. I'd rather meet someone in my own world and see where things go.\n\nI'm curious to hear from trans men who have been in similar situations, where they've been attracted to someone who can't pursue a relationship due to their own preferences. I also want to hear your thoughts on this topic and how I can improve my understanding and approach.\n\nThanks for watching, and I look forward to hearing your true tea in the comments below.
