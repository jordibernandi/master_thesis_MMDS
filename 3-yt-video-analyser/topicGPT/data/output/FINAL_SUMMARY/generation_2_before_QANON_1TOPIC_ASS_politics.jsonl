{"summary":"Document 1\nMatthew discusses the death of Jeffrey Epstein, claiming it was a suicide despite the circumstances being suspicious. He believes Epstein's death is a distraction from the real issue, which is the government's control and manipulation of the population. Matthew expresses concern about the upcoming gun laws and the potential for further events, urging Americans to be prepared and protect themselves. He questions the official story of Epstein's death, pointing out the lack of guards and the ease of his escape. Matthew concludes by emphasizing the importance of standing together and fighting against government overreach, stating that the fight has just begun.\nDocument 2\nThe speaker from BigSwearRoadDriver.com is warning about a potential collapse of the cryptocurrency market and the banking system. He claims that the government and the Fed are rigging the market by selling off cryptocurrencies and manipulating prices. The speaker points to the recent price movements of gold and silver, where silver spiked while gold dropped, as evidence of market manipulation. He also mentions that Deutsche Bank clients are pulling $1 billion out of the bank every day, which he believes is a sign of a bank run.  The speaker believes that Deutsche Bank is on the brink of collapse and that its failure could lead to a global financial crisis. He notes that the bank has $45 trillion in derivatives and that it could take three to four weeks for derivative contracts to settle, which could lead to a cascade of defaults.  The speaker advises viewers to get their cryptocurrencies off exchanges and into their own possession, as the banking system could freeze up and exchanges could shut down. He also warns that the government could put the price of cryptocurrencies at zero with a click of a mouse.  The speaker concludes by saying that the time to act is now and that viewers should take their cryptocurrencies off exchanges and into their own possession to avoid losing them.\nDocument 3\nToday, I'm discussing the world's worst currency, the Argentina peso, which has seen a 3.6% gain against the US dollar. However, this gain is minimal considering it's lost over 50% of its value in the last several months. The peso has been steadily trending down towards its intrinsic value of zero, trading at around 45.8 pesos to one dollar.  The article from Bloomberg states that the peso rebounded after the central bank said it would step up intervention in the currency market. However, this policy shift came after the currency hit a record low and bonds fell to distressed territory. The central bank has tweaked monetary policy four times in six weeks, which suggests they may not know what they're doing.  Argentina's government has borrowed $50 billion from the IMF and is now intervening to stabilize the currency. However, this is ultimately a failed policy as they're selling their reserves to prop up a currency that will inevitably fail. The country is experiencing its second recession under President Macri's presidency, and the current fiscal policy is aimed at reviving his approval ratings and re-election chances.  Argentina is a naturally rich country with a thriving agricultural base, but corruption at all levels has led to indebtedness and enslavement of its people. The country's economy is now functioning based on debt, and every other country is experiencing similar practices, leading to more money printing and a loss of purchasing power.  Over the last year, the currency has lost 50% of its purchasing power, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on how bad the crisis will get. Will it reach hyperinflation like in Venezuela and Zimbabwe? Leave your comments below.\nDocument 4\nThe Giggling Conservative discusses a potential deep state-Chinese collusion to undermine the US. China owns most of the US debt and has demanded that the deep state install socialist politicians in Congress and the Senate in exchange for propping up the US economy. This aligns with the Chinese Communist Party's Leninist-Marxist ideology, aiming to take over the West without violence. The deep state allegedly influenced the 2018 midterm elections, installing Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed communist, is accused of being part of this deal, having praised communist governments in the past and given instructions to a foreign leader on how to fight against the US. The Giggling Conservative urges people to wake up to this alleged conspiracy before it's too late.\nDocument 5\nThe host introduces a special guest, David Nino Rodriguez, thanking him for joining the show.\nDocument 6\nHello everyone, I'm Peter from England, and I'm here to update you on a previous video I posted two weeks ago. It was about the 21 trillion US dollars parked in the Department of Defense budget, which could help clear the US debt when a potential jubilee is announced. This could happen as early as March 18th. The Trump administration is planning to release Pfizer declassification documents, which will implicate many high-profile individuals, including James Comey and the Clintons, in the fourth collusion.   We Are Bank, a bank formed in 2011, is working with the Trump administration and the Department of Defense to help with a potential jubilee reset or debt eradication program. I'm asking those in the US to send an email to register their interest, and I'll provide more information in future videos.   We Are Bank has been met with ridicule and fake news from mainstream media, but no official court or criminal investigation has been brought against us. Our website is still active, and we're working to help people become their own bankers and free themselves from debt.   We're beginning to work with the Trump administration, the Department of Defense, and other organizations to implement a voucher or coupon system to help with debt relief. I'm asking people to register their interest and help us make this happen. Thank you for listening, and I'll see you in the next video.\nDocument 7\nThe speaker discusses the death of Jeffrey Epstein and suggests that it was faked using a triox compound. They reference a Star Trek episode where a character fakes his own death using a similar compound. The speaker believes that Epstein's death was a psyop to prevent him from revealing information about powerful people. They argue that the Federal Reserve Council in New York is a key player in this scam and that New Yorkers in positions of power are arrogant and out of touch with the American people. The speaker also mentions the Mossad's possible involvement in Epstein's fake death. They conclude that the information Epstein had on powerful people was too sensitive to be allowed to go to trial and that the government is now targeting Americans who question the official narrative. The speaker uses a Star Trek analogy to explain how the government can manipulate people's perceptions and control the narrative. They also touch on the idea that the government is controlling the media and suppressing free speech.\nDocument 8\nHello everyone, I'm Peter of Ringland, and today I'm sharing crucial information that will change your perspective on the global political arena. A recent video has surfaced featuring Barack Obama, where he admits to not being born in the United States, but in Kenya. This contradicts his previous denials and confirms the allegations made by Donald Trump in 2016. Obama also reveals that his election was a result of misleading and dishonest practices.  This video is significant because it comes from Obama's own mouth, and it's not just a conspiracy theory. The mainstream media has been hiding this information, and it's essential to understand the gravity of this revelation. Obama's admission raises questions about his eligibility to become President of the United States and his potential involvement in treasonous activities.  Furthermore, Obama's personal life is also shrouded in controversy. He's a Muslim, married to a transgender woman named Michael, and their children's parentage is questionable. The Obamas have also been involved in a $65 million book deal, which is being investigated by the Department of Justice.  Additionally, the director of the office responsible for verifying Obama's birth certificate, Loretta Fuddy, mysteriously died in a plane crash in 2013. This incident is eerily similar to the death of a comedian who exposed Michelle Obama's transgender identity, which led to a lawsuit against the hospital.  In conclusion, this information is not hyperbole or a conspiracy theory, but a factual revelation that challenges the status quo. It's essential to research and verify this information, and I encourage you to circulate this video to spread awareness. Thank you for listening, and I'll see you in the next video.\nDocument 9\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan provides a weekly perspective on the stock market and precious metals. For the week of September 6, 2019, David Morgan notes that the stock indexes broke out of their August trading range, with the financials and tech sectors leading the charge. However, this breakout came at the expense of gold, which was \"whacked down pretty good.\"   David Morgan discusses an article by Nesbitt, \"How the Next Global Financial Collapse Will Unfold,\" which highlights Italy's government debt of over $2.5 trillion, equivalent to 133% of its GDP. He notes that the U.S. is not far behind and that politicians often lie. He also references the Cyprus banking crisis, where depositors who withdrew their funds before the bailout kept 100% of their capital, while those who delayed faced losses up to 100%.  In the precious metals market, David Morgan notes that gold is experiencing a correction after a significant breakout, with a potential 50% retracement of its recent move. He believes that the correction will not be severe and that the market will eventually shift towards precious metals as investors become increasingly concerned about the equity and debt markets.  David Morgan also discusses the importance of being prepared for a potential economic downturn and the benefits of holding physical gold and silver. He encourages listeners to take a long-term outlook and to be prepared for the ongoing currency crisis.  The Morgan Report offers a free weekly newsletter with analysis of the financial markets, interviews, and conference schedules, as well as a paid service for small to medium-sized business owners, professionals, and seasoned investors. David Morgan's area of expertise includes equity analysis throughout the resource sector, energy metals, and base metals, and he is passionate about helping people build and protect their wealth.\nDocument 10\nA 2,000-person operation rescued a woman from Africa who was trafficked to the Middle East under false employment agency promises. She was forced into labor, beaten, starved, and subjected to sexual exploitation. The traffickers took her passport, leaving her with no documentation.   This is a common story for many girls who are desperate to provide for themselves or their families. They're lured with job opportunities, only to be trapped in debt bondage, forced to pay for their flight and documentation. If they escape, they're charged with overstay fees, making it difficult for them to return home.  A Ugandan girl is also being held in debt bondage, and efforts are being made to raise funds to buy her out and repatriate her. A similar case to Rachel's, the Ugandan girl was also forced into labor and subjected to exploitation.  Thanks to a rescue operation, Rachel was able to return home and receive aftercare. She's now on the path to healing and has started thinking about her future, including becoming a fashion designer. Her story is a testament to the importance of rescue and aftercare efforts, with the organization's leader stating that even one rescue is worth it.\nDocument 11\nThe conversation revolves around several topics, including the 2024 presidential election, trade secrets, and geopolitical tensions. The speaker suggests that Joe Biden's hands are \"deep into the Chinese money\" and that China is influencing the election. They also mention the Silk Road project between India and Pakistan, which China is involved in, and how this could lead to a powder keg situation in the region.  The speaker also discusses the shale oil industry in the United States, which is nearing its peak, and how this could impact the country's energy security. They also mention China's involvement in Venezuela's oil fields and how this could eliminate the need for oil exports from Saudi Arabia or the US.  Additionally, the conversation touches on recent events such as the explosion in Russia, the uptick in Syria, and the mass shootings in the US. The speaker suggests that these events are part of a larger playbook to control the narrative and remove God from society.  The conversation also delves into the topic of gun control and the Second Amendment, with the speaker arguing that the Democrats want to remove all weapons from law-abiding citizens. They also mention the removal of founding father Constitution and Bill of Rights provisions and how this is a dangerous time for the country.  The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of truth and the need for patriots to stand up and defend the country alongside law-abiding citizens. They also mention the role of veterans in defending the country and how they will be the ones to stand up against any threats.\nDocument 12\nThe host discusses a potential stock market crash in mid-October, citing an email from Dick Allgaier with a 90-day outlook. Allgaier predicts a significant event on Monday, October 14th, which could be related to the financial system. The host believes that the mass chaos is already happening, pointing to the bailouts and the fact that people have lost faith in the US dollar. He expects chaos by mid-October and thinks that the world will look very different by the end of the year.  The host also discusses the repo market, which he believes is a confidence game. He thinks that the Fed will lose confidence and that the system will collapse. He references a chart showing the exponential growth of the repo market and predicts that it will reach $20 trillion by November.  The host also talks about the banking crisis in India, where a bank has been caught cooking the books and misreporting non-performing loans. He believes that this is a sign of things to come and that people will lose their money in the bank.  He also mentions the Hong Kong banking crisis, where ATMs have run out of cash, and the central bank has stepped in to prevent a panic. He thinks that this is a sign of confidence being lost in the financial system.  The host also discusses a conspiracy theory that the military has been ordered to deploy within the US to help civil authorities in the event of an emergency. He believes that this is a sign that people inside the government are extremely concerned about events taking place inside the country.  Finally, the host talks about his own experiences with YouTube and how he has been censored for speaking the truth. He has written a song called \"They\" that talks about the censorship of free speech in the US.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Geopolitics (Document: 11): Mentions geopolitical tensions and conflicts in the Middle East and Asia.\n    [2] Election Interference (Document: 11): Mentions election interference and foreign influence in the US election.\n    [2] Economic Collapse (Document: 2, 9, 12): Mentions potential economic collapse, bank runs, and stock market crashes.\n    [2] Conspiracy Theories (Document: 4, 7, 8): Mentions alleged conspiracies involving the deep state, China, and the government.\n    [2] Financial Crisis (Document: 2, 9, 12): Mentions financial crises, bank failures, and currency devaluations.\n    [2] Government Debt (Document: 3, 9): Mentions government debt, fiscal policy, and the impact of debt on the economy.\n    [2] Corruption (Document: 3, 4): Mentions corruption, cronyism, and the influence of special interest groups on government policy.\n    [2] Immigration (Document: 10): Mentions human trafficking and immigration issues.\n    [2] Gun Control (Document: 11): Mentions gun control and the Second Amendment.\n    [2] Government Control (Document: 1): Mentions government control and manipulation of the population."}
{"summary":"Document 13\nThe speaker discusses the current economic situation and the potential risks of a changing global economy. They mention that the US dollar is the world's reserve currency, but this may not be the case in the future. The speaker also talks about the importance of a level playing field in international trade and the need to address currency manipulation.  The speaker then shifts the focus to the topic of digital currencies, specifically XRP, and its potential to solve the problem of cross-border payments. They explain that XRP is fast, cheap, and secure, making it an attractive option for international transactions.  The speaker also mentions the idea of a multipolar currency, where multiple countries have their own currencies, and the need for a new virtual currency to ease the reliance on the US dollar. They reference Mark Carney's call for the creation of a new virtual currency.  The speaker then moves on to discuss the importance of sovereignty and independence, and how these values are essential for freedom, democracy, and peace. They emphasize the need for nations to protect their sovereignty and independence in order to build a better future.  The speaker concludes by calling for a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride, and for nations to choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat.  Key points:  * The US dollar may not remain the world's reserve currency in the future * A level playing field is essential for international trade * Digital currencies, such as XRP, have the potential to solve the problem of cross-border payments * A multipolar currency system may be necessary to ease the reliance on the US dollar * Sovereignty and independence are essential for freedom, democracy, and peace * Nations must protect their sovereignty and independence to build a better future.\nDocument 14\nWe're at a critical point where there are no plans to fix the system. The derivative bubble is growing exponentially, and the cryptos won't take out the old system in a smooth manner. The crash will be an ending of the old system, and it may happen in a day or a week. The computer trading models will start fighting each other, and the Dow, stock markets, bond market, and crypto markets will shut down.  The speaker believes that the all-time high in the Dow was on Tuesday, and it will go to zero. They recommend having assets in your own possession, such as silver, and not relying on the price in US dollars. The future is in how many ounces of silver you own, not in the price.  The speaker criticizes the crypto market, saying it's rigged and that the exchanges are ridiculous. They believe that the banks know what's going to happen and are planning to crash the system. The ECB's warning about financial stability is a sign that they want to crash the system.  The speaker advises getting out of everything and stopping looking at the price of Bitcoin and silver. They recommend having silver in your possession, as it will be the first to run in a freely traded market due to 150 years of price suppression. They predict that silver will go to $50 and then $100, but it won't be on the comics.  The speaker will be posting a debate with Bitcoin Ben later today and wants everyone to comment on who won the debate. They also mention that Jamie Dimon will make a perp walk this year due to the silver investigations of JP Morgan rigging the silver market.\nDocument 15\nBushakusha discusses the potential for a global reset, where countries will transition to a gold-backed currency. He cites President Trump's efforts to replace the dollar with gold as the global currency and the increasing demand for gold by central banks. Bushakusha references articles from 2017 and 2019, highlighting the growing trend of central banks buying gold and reducing their reliance on dollar reserves.  He mentions that Iraq's economy will be backed by both oil and gold, and that the country's gold reserves have increased significantly. Bushakusha also notes that the global reset is not just about the United States, but about many central banks working together to transition to a gold-backed currency.  The video is part of a series on the global reset, and Bushakusha encourages viewers to support President Trump and trust the plan. He believes that the global reset is a necessary step towards removing the elites and taking down the central bank system.  Key points:  * President Trump's efforts to replace the dollar with gold as the global currency * Central banks buying gold and reducing their reliance on dollar reserves * Iraq's economy will be backed by both oil and gold * The global reset is not just about the United States, but about many central banks working together * The need to remove the elites and take down the central bank system * The importance of supporting President Trump and trusting the plan\nDocument 16\nIraqi politician Rod Al-Daliki stated that the US military presence in Iraq serves as a safety valve, providing additional security for the country. The decision to keep US forces in Iraq lies with Prime Minister Adil Abdi Almaty.   Iraqi politician Ayyad Alawi suggested dissolving the Iran-backed IMIS militia, citing its existence is no longer necessary as ISIS has been defeated. Alawi proposed boosting the Iraqi army to handle future threats.  Former PMs Haider al-Abadi and Nouri al-Maliki will run in local elections on one list, according to the Islamic Dawah party. The planning ministry announced that 426 Iraqi contractor companies have been blacklisted due to failure to fulfill contractual obligations.  Iraq's Prime Minister, Latifa Rashid Mohammed Al-Jalama, aims to leverage South Korea's expertise in health, agriculture, and infrastructure development. The two countries are expected to cooperate on mutual benefits and transfer of expertise.  In Baghdad, the foreign currency market saw a rise in the US dollar exchange rate against the Iraqi dinar. ISIS militants continue to operate in Iraq, exploiting security gaps between Kurdish Peshmerga lines.  Iraq has assured the International Monetary Fund that it is adopting a new policy to diversify its sources of income.\nDocument 17\nThe speaker claims to have received a message from God, stating that Donald Trump will become a trumpet, a symbol of influence and change. God promises to open doors for Trump and have him elected as president, bringing about a praying president who will be baptized with the Holy Spirit and power. The speaker sees a future president who will make decisions without fear, leading to rapid restoration of America due to energy sources, medical breakthroughs, and agreements with nations like China.  God warns that those who reject this president will be shocked by his ability to take down the giants of debt, socialism, and human secularism. The speaker sees a plan to defeat these giants, using a simple stone, and predicts that the president will be impeached but ultimately succeed. The speaker also mentions a woman who will bring healing to the nation, pouring oil on the scars of the past.  The speaker senses a strong presence of hatred and bitterness in America, but God promises to bring healing and restoration. The speaker shares a vision of a strange infiltration, possibly related to the enemy's plan, and warns Canada to be vigilant. God also mentions a visit to North Korea, implying a significant event.  The speaker reflects on their upcoming trip to New York, where they will meet with leaders, including Donald Trump, who has just announced his candidacy for president. The speaker believes that God's plan is unfolding, and they are excited to see what comes next. The Spirit of God promises a divine acceleration in the nation, protecting it through prophets and apostles, and announces a fresh flow of the Spirit, coming from an open heaven and tomb.\nDocument 18\nThe speaker warns of a desperate cabal in panic mode, trying to shut down the country through various means, including energy plants and pipelines. They urge listeners to be vigilant and stand strong against evil. The speaker emphasizes that it's not about politics, but about preserving freedom and way of life. They criticize one-sided movements and encourage people to march for all, not just specific groups.  The speaker discusses their interactions with Trump, stating that he's breaking down the system to allow people to have a say. They highlight bills that have been passed with the help of the trust and team, such as the Sovereignty Act and tax reform. The speaker notes that Trump's actions are a significant change in policy from previous presidencies.  They caution against blindly trusting Trump, as he's still part of the system, but commend him for resisting pressure from the \"nest of vipers\" around him. The speaker also addresses critics who point to US invasions as evidence of Trump's failures, stating that these actions were implemented by the Deep State and other powerful groups.  The speaker concludes by urging listeners to stand up against violence and oppression, using peace and nonconformity as a response. They emphasize that the key to success lies in what people do, not what those in power do, and that the show and its affiliates will support those who fight for all people.\nDocument 19\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan discussed the financial markets for the week ending March 22, 2019. Key points include:  - A plunge in bond yields led to an inverted yield curve, pushing bond prices higher and stocks lower. - The inverted yield curve is hurting the banking sector and rewarding the utility sector. - Small-cap and transportation sectors are showing relative weakness. - Executives at FedEx, BMW, UBS, and others are warning about bleak macroeconomic conditions. - FedEx's earnings missed expectations, citing slowing international conditions and weaker global trade growth trends. - The Baltic Dry Index, which measures global trade, is also showing weakness. - David Morgan believes that stagflation is slowing the economy and increasing prices. - Global jitters are growing, with Fitch Ratings cutting its 2019 global forecast. - Russia's central bank added 1 million ounces of gold to its reserves in February, making it the fifth-largest gold-holding central bank in the world. - Experts believe that the world may be running out of gold, with peak production reached and minimal new discoveries. - A hedge fund, Crescat Capital LLC, recommends buying gold and selling stocks, citing a potential meltdown in risk assets. - The Basel III accord will classify gold as a Tier 1 asset, similar to cash, which could have a positive impact on gold prices in the long term.  David Morgan also discussed his mission and the services offered by The Morgan Report, which includes a free weekly newsletter, paid client services, and a focus on equity analysis and precious metals.\nDocument 20\nToday's video is about Robert Kiyosaki's opinion on silver. I recently watched an interview with Kiyosaki where he referred to silver as \"real money\" and said it's undervalued. He mentioned that you can buy a silver dime for two bucks, which is a rip-off considering its actual value.   I want to introduce you to Robert Kiyosaki, who I've been listening to for years. I've read many of his books, including \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" and \"Conspiracy of the Rich.\" These books have helped me understand investing and precious metals.   Kiyosaki's message is reassuring, especially for those who feel like they're not doing enough. Even if you can only afford a small amount of silver, you're ahead of the game compared to the average person.   I recommend checking out Kiyosaki's books, which cover various topics, including investing, real estate, and personal development. Reading books is a great way to increase your financial IQ and improve your financial well-being.   I'm currently paying tuition, which is expensive, and I wish I could convert my money into silver and gold. However, I'm doing what I can with what I have, and that's perfectly fine. At the end of the day, I'm already doing more than the average person.   If you enjoyed the video, please hit the like button and subscribe to my channel for daily videos.

Mueller's office spent over $732,000 on private investigators and researchers, but refused to disclose their identities. The arrangement has led to speculation that Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, who created the Russian collusion dossier for the Clinton campaign, might have been involved in Mueller's operation.  Mueller's report recycles general allegations from the dossier and cites articles that used Steele and Fusion as sources. The report also selectively quotes from Trump campaign emails and omits exculpatory information, casting the campaign's activities in a sinister light.   Judicial Watch suspects Mueller's office may have farmed out work to Fusion GPS or its subcontractor, Steele, who were paid by the Clinton camp during the 2016 presidential election. Several law enforcement and Hill sources believe Steele and Fusion GPS were deputized in the investigation.  The article highlights several suspicious connections, including Mueller's team working closely with Steele and Fusion GPS, and the fact that Mueller's report includes allegations from the dossier. Judicial Watch is trying to get information on the outside contractors through FOIA requests.  Deb also discusses other suspicious aspects of the Mueller investigation, including the Carter Page warrant, which accused him of knowingly cavorting with Russian spies, but federal court records show he did not know they were Russian agents. Mueller's report also includes allegations about Manafort, which were suspect due to Mueller's team working closely with Steele and Fusion GPS.  The article concludes by highlighting the connections between Fusion GPS, Steele, and the Mueller investigation, and how Judicial Watch is trying to expose the truth about the outside contractors involved.\nDocument 22\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George, non-attorney spokesman for Trusts Unlimited. Today, January 1st, 2020, I'm discussing the situation in Iraq following the US Embassy assault. The attack was led by Hadi al-Amin, a pro-Iranian sympathizer, who was a minister in the cabinet of Nouri al-Malaki, a corrupt pro-Iranian Prime Minister of Iraq.   In 2011, Nouri al-Malaki and Hadi al-Amin were guests at the White House, and I believe the Obama administration didn't want the Iraqi Dinar to reinstitute in 2012 because it would contradict Obama's stance on the Iraq war and make many Americans wealthy, potentially leading to a shift in their voting behavior.  Now, with the current situation in Iraq, the government is moving quickly to resolve critical issues, including the hydrocarbon law and the 2020 budget. The Sadrists have publicly opposed a war between the US and Iraq, and the US has doubled its military force in Iraq. The Trump administration has made it clear that expelling Iranians from Iraq and reinstituting the currency are necessary to resolve the issues.  I still believe the Iraqi Dinar will reinstitute in January 2020, which will officially end the Iranians' influence in Iraq. Despite Iranian interference, I don't think they will succeed in their attempts to pressure corrupt officials in Iraq. The reinstitution of the Iraqi Dinar will allow Iraq to deal with other nations and acquire what it needs, no longer being a piggy bank for Iran.  We plan to have a call next week, and if something dramatic happens, we'll schedule an emergency conference call. Thank you for listening, and I wish you a happy new year.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Economic Policy (Document: 13, 19): Discusses the potential risks of a changing global economy, the importance of a level playing field in international trade, and the need to address currency manipulation.\n    [2] Financial Crisis (Document: 14, 19): Warns of a potential financial crisis, citing the growth of the derivative bubble and the potential for a crash in the stock market and crypto markets.\n    [2] Prophecy and Politics (Document: 17): Discusses a message from God, stating that Donald Trump will become a trumpet, a symbol of influence and change, and the potential for a praying president who will make decisions without fear.\n    [2] Iraq Politics (Document: 16, 22): Discusses the current situation in Iraq, including the US military presence, the role of the US Embassy, and the potential for a war between the US and Iraq.\n    [2] Iraq Economy (Document: 22): Discusses the situation in Iraq following the US Embassy assault, including the potential for the reinstitution of the Iraqi Dinar and the impact on the country's economy.\n    [2] Financial Markets (Document: 19): Discusses the financial markets for the week ending March 22, 2019, including a plunge in bond yields, an inverted yield curve, and the potential for stagflation.\n    [2] Gold Standard (Document: 15, 19): Discusses the potential for a global reset, where countries will transition to a gold-backed currency, and the increasing demand for gold by central banks.\n    [2] Precious Metals (Document: 20): Discusses Robert Kiyosaki's opinion on silver, referring to it as \"real money\" and stating that it's undervalued.\n    [2] Mueller Investigation (Document: 21): Discusses the Mueller investigation, including the spending on outside contractors, the involvement of Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, and the potential for a cover-up.\n    [2] Conspiracy Theories (Document: 18): Warns of a desperate cabal in panic mode, trying to shut down the country through various means, including energy plants and pipelines."}

He claims that the Supreme Court's decision to block Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament is a travesty of justice, orchestrated by the elite to frustrate the will of the people. He argues that the Supreme Court is a private corporation with a vested interest in supporting the elite, and that its justices are operating on a \"spin cycle\" to manipulate public opinion.  Peter also criticizes Gina Miller, the lead plaintiff in the case, as a Soros-funded agent who is not representative of the people. He claims that the European Union is a euphemism for a corporate, globalist, Nazi-founded hellhole dedicated to the destruction of Western civilization.  He presents various economic arguments against staying in the EU, citing Germany's close-to-technical recession, Italy's bankruptcy, and the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. He also mentions the Frexit movement in France and the fact that several other European countries have voted to leave the EU.  Peter concludes by warning Remainers that they are supporting an agenda that is not in their best interests, and that they need to wake up to the reality of the one world commercial enterprise that is being pushed by the elite. He encourages viewers to share the video and to subscribe to his channel for more information.\nDocument 25\nA New York State judge, Sylvia Ash, has been arrested for alleged obstruction of justice.  She was arrested at LaGuardia Airport on Friday after prosecutors accused her of deleting text messages and other evidence related to a corruption investigation at the state's largest credit union, MCU.  Ash, 62, is the presiding judge of Kings County Supreme Court Commercial Division and has served as a state judge since 2006.  She faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison for obstruction and conspiracy charges.   The investigation into MCU corruption began after its former CEO, Cam Wong, pleaded guilty to a multi-million embezzlement scheme.  Ash, who served as MCU's board chair from 2008 to 2016, is accused of deleting text messages and wiping her iPhone to destroy evidence.  She also allegedly made false and misleading statements to federal investigators.   Ash was previously celebrated for her achievements, including receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Brooklyn Women's Bar Association in 2022.  She was the first person of color to sit as the presiding judge in Kings County Supreme Court and had been serving as a state judge since 2006.   The charges against Ash are part of a wider investigation into corruption at MCU, which has nearly three billion dollars in accounts held by over half a million members.  A former NYPD officer, Joseph Guilardo, has also been charged in connection with the MCU fraud.\nDocument 26\nThe video discusses the question of whether Donald Trump is a Zionist or a patriot. The speaker references an article by Newsweek journalist Neil Burley, who exposed the Israeli deep state's plan to take over the world. The article was praised by Adam Green of No More News for its courage in speaking out against labeling alternative news as anti-Semitic. The speaker notes that they have zero confidence in the Rothschild family and their minions, but emphasizes that not trusting Trump does not mean supporting the deep state.  The speaker also expresses skepticism about the idea that modern Israel is a fulfillment of biblical prophecy, citing the lack of the Messiah's return and the rebuilding of the temple. They question the morality of a loving God ordering the murder of an entire race of people, as described in the Bible.  The speaker concludes that they are an explorer, seeking to reveal the truth and bring about positive change, but acknowledges that they don't have all the answers. They express frustration with the mixing of truth and lies, and the polarization it creates. The video ends with the speaker stating that they don't know what Donald Trump is, but are skeptical of his alignment with modern Israel.\nDocument 27\nCatania Alvin discusses the Committee of 300, a secret society founded by Cecil Rhodes in 1891, with the goal of creating a New World Order. Rhodes' vision was to establish a British plutocracy, with the aim of promoting Anglo-Saxon influence worldwide. He believed that the more land Britain controlled, the more English people would be born, and that this would be beneficial for humanity.  The Committee of 300 was structured like the Jesuit order and was designed to absorb wealth and power to achieve its objectives. Rhodes' will and testament outlined his plan for global domination, including the occupation of Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas.  Catania Alvin connects the dots between Cecil Rhodes, the Committee of 300, and modern-day events, including the Brexit referendum and the rise of Donald Trump. She suggests that the British press is working to destroy Trump because he is clearing the swamp and undermining the New World Order.  Dr. John Coleman, a researcher and author, is interviewed on the topic of the Committee of 300. He explains that the Committee is a world government that operates through a network of secret societies and organizations. Coleman's research has revealed a complex web of connections between the Committee of 300, the New World Order, and modern-day events.  Catania Alvin emphasizes the importance of being informed and learning about the true nature of the Committee of 300 and the New World Order. She encourages viewers to do their own research and to be aware of the orchestrated efforts to control and manipulate global events.\nDocument 28\nDr. O, a hospital-based internal medicine doctor with a part-time holistic practice, shares his clinical experience on vaccine issues. He notes that in hospitals, there's a standard practice to vaccinate patients, often without consulting the doctor, driven by corporate directives and the CDC's push for universal vaccination. Dr. O believes that vaccines escape scrutiny due to pharmaceutical company sponsorship of studies and the suppression of independent research.  He shares a personal anecdote about a product that eradicated HIV and cancer in thousands of people, but was suppressed by the FDA due to accusations of an \"illegal practice\" by a naturopath. Dr. O suggests that this suppression disrupts the medical economy and is a form of censorship.  Dr. O also discusses the removal of published literature that contradicts established vaccine safety and effectiveness. He compares this to historical examples of book burning and censorship, and notes that the Supreme Court has ruled that vaccines are \"unavoidably dangerous.\"  Dr. O expresses concern about the use of aluminum and polysorbate 80 in vaccines, which he believes can harm children's bodies. He shares examples of patients who have been injured by vaccines, including a client who became profoundly weak after receiving a high-dose flu shot.  Dr. O notes that these adverse reactions are often dismissed by regular doctors, who attribute them to other causes. He suggests that the medical community is resistant to acknowledging vaccine risks due to a lack of independent research and a culture of censorship.\nDocument 29\nWe're moving forward with a project to challenge vaccine mandates. After reviewing every legal case and constitutional issue, we've identified a strategy to overcome these obstacles. It requires more than just online efforts, but also people sending certified letters to the post office. We're seeking donations to support this effort, as we need funding to move forward. We're not soliciting donations normally, but this issue is too important to ignore. We've already been approved for grant funding, but we need money in the meantime. We're asking viewers to contribute any amount they can, even small amounts like $15 a day, to make a difference. If everyone contributes, we can change the course of this country and restore constitutional law.\nDocument 30\nA new campaign called One Nation and One God has been launched to encourage the church to make a stand and fill a truth vacuum in the nation. The goal is to schedule 100 One Nation, One God nights before the next election, where pastors and community members will gather to pray and hear a message from the speaker. The aim is to turn the nation around and protect Christian values for future generations.\nDocument 31\nOn March 23, 2019, IQDCalls.com members discussed the potential for a predictable and gradual appreciation of the Iraqi dinar's nominal exchange rate, triggered by strong oil revenues and the Balassa-Samuelson effect. This effect occurs when countries with high productivity growth experience high wage growth, leading to higher real exchange rates.   The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) cannot stop currency auctions until it has a replacement source of revenue. The IMF has suggested that the CBI should get its revenue from the banking sector, not from the spread. Article 8 and Article 14 of the IMF's policy state that multiple currency practices, such as the CBI's current system, require prior approval.  Iraq needs to go international and raise the value of the dinar to have a free flow of capital. The current system is disastrous and interconnected, requiring a change now. The CBI's lack of transparency and outdated data on the dinar's circulation make it difficult to determine the actual number of dinars in circulation.  The CBI still runs auctions for the US dollar, making its money reserves from the spread. The IMF suggests that the CBI should get its revenue from the banking sector. The CBI is run by the Rothschilds, but this is just one factor to consider. The community waits for further developments, with more information available on IQDCalls.com.\nDocument 32\nTwister Christian discusses Vietnam and the Vietnamese dong, speculating about its potential value in a global currency reset. He notes that Vietnam's gold reserves are unknown due to a lack of official data, with some estimates suggesting $10 billion in gold. The country has been considered a currency manipulator, artificially holding down the dong's value.   Vietnam's economy has benefited from the U.S.-China trade war, with increased contracts and deals with the EU and China. However, the country's currency has weakened due to the trade war's fallout. The government has been tight-lipped about its gold reserves, which could be a concern for the country's readiness for a global reset.  Twister Christian also discusses the potential for the gold price to increase, which could impact Vietnam's economy. He holds some Vietnamese dong as an investment but believes the Iraqi dinar is a better value. The country is increasing its minimum salary in 2020, which could improve living standards for its citizens.  Ultimately, Twister Christian speculates that Vietnam's economy will change in value during a global currency reset, but it's unclear how much the dong will be worth. He suggests that the country may be keeping its gold reserves and economic data tight-lipped to benefit its own economy and currency.\nDocument 33\nThe speaker discusses recent news developments, stating that the storm of truth is finally upon us. Key points include:  - The Mueller report confirms no Russian collusion, exposing the fake news media as conspiracy theorists. - The Justice Department declares the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. - The Vice President calls for Ilhan Omar's removal from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. - Mike Pompeo bans aid to abortion groups. - Michael Avenatti is arrested for extortion, with his accomplice revealed to be Jussie Smollett's lawyer Mark Garagos. - Bill Mitchell questions the media's portrayal of Q, highlighting their double standard in promoting the Russian hoax while demonizing Q. - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is voted down 0-57, a significant victory for the speaker.\nDocument 34\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles shares three important articles and a podcast interview with Devin Nunes. Nunes warns that without prosecutions, the FBI and DOJ will lose trust for generations. He also discusses the Mueller investigation, stating that it was set up as an obstruction of justice trap and that some dirty cops should go to jail.   The podcast interview with Bill Hemmer from Fox raises questions about Mueller's destruction of evidence, with some text messages from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page still unreleased. Sundance's article on conservative treehouse provides a detailed timeline of the events, starting from November 2015, and explains how the FISA Court was repeatedly used by unauthorized individuals.  Deb also mentions a 99-page opinion from the FISA Court, which identified tens of thousands of search queries using the FISA 702 system. Admiral Mike Rogers discovered the unauthorized access under Obama, and the trail may lead back to him. The article also discusses the Mueller report's misleading information and the use of wordsmithing to make it seem less untruthful.  Deb recommends reading Sundance's article and listening to the podcast interview with Devin Nunes, which is 30 minutes long. She also shares her concerns about YouTube's new tactic of manually deleting videos and suggests that it may be done by trolls.\nDocument 35\nCardi B and Senator Bernie Sanders discuss various pressing issues in America, including low wages, police brutality, immigration, and access to healthcare. Sanders emphasizes the need to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and make it easier for workers to join unions. He also proposes reestablishing and expanding the DACA program, providing free healthcare as a human right, and canceling all student debt in America.  Sanders explains that the current healthcare system prioritizes profits over people, and he wants to change that by making healthcare a fundamental human right. He proposes a system where people pay more in taxes but have no premiums, co-payments, or deductibles.  The conversation also touches on the importance of education and job training, with Sanders advocating for making public colleges and universities tuition-free. He believes that this will help young people, particularly those from marginalized communities, access better opportunities and break the cycle of poverty.  Cardi B shares her personal experiences with struggling to make ends meet and emphasizes the need for change. She encourages young people to get involved in the political process, register to vote, and participate in the democratic process to bring about change.  Ultimately, the conversation highlights the need for systemic change in America, particularly in addressing issues of economic inequality, racism, and access to healthcare and education.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Truth and Deception (Document: 33): Mentions recent news developments, including the Mueller report and the Affordable Care Act.\n    [2] FBI and DOJ (Document: 34): Discusses the need for prosecutions to restore trust in the FBI and DOJ.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 25): Mentions a judge's alleged obstruction of justice and corruption at a credit union.\n    [2] Vaccine Mandates (Document: 29): Mentions a project to challenge vaccine mandates.\n    [2] Secret Societies (Document: 27): Explores the Committee of 300, a secret society founded by Cecil Rhodes.\n    [2] Zionism and Patriotism (Document: 26): Discusses the question of whether Donald Trump is a Zionist or a patriot.\n    [2] Currency Reset (Document: 31): Speculates about the potential value of the Iraqi dinar in a global currency reset.\n    [2] Vaccine Issues (Document: 28): Discusses the concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness.\n    [2] One Nation and One God (Document: 30): Discusses a campaign to encourage the church to make a stand and fill a truth vacuum in the nation.\n    [2] Healthcare and Education (Document: 35): Emphasizes the need for systemic change in America, particularly in addressing issues of economic inequality, racism, and access to healthcare and education.\n    [2] Financial Crisis (Document: 23): Discusses the global financial collapse and its impact on the economy.\n    [2] Vietnam and the Dong (Document: 32): Discusses Vietnam's economy and the potential value of the Vietnamese dong in a global currency reset."}
{"summary":"Document 36\nBix Weir from RoadDriver.com reports that Chinese bank runs have started, with four prominent banks experiencing issues. He warns that European banks will be affected in the next two weeks, followed by U.S. banks. Weir believes the endgame is near and that the Federal Reserve will have to fund banks with $20 trillion, which Congress may not approve.  The current problem is not liquidity or the repo market, but rather banks' reluctance to lend to each other due to the severity of the situation. Weir compares the deposit insurance system to the FDIC, stating that it's like an insurance company with no backing, and that the theory of state-run insurance being covered by the bank is flawed due to the contagion problem.  Weir references an interview with Cliff High, who discussed the Soaring 20s report and its predictions. He also mentions the Veritasium token, which could reach $20 and stop being given out. Weir advises viewers to subscribe to Road to Ruta for more information and to get a Veritasium token.  In a separate segment, Weir sings a song about bankers, accusing them of robbing the world of billions and trillions of dollars while paying fines and bonuses. He warns that the people will eventually find out and lock them away.\nDocument 37\nThe speaker discusses the State of the Union address and the military's presence on the streets of LA, questioning why Donald Trump wouldn't mention it in his speech. They suggest that Trump might be afraid to upset his \"masters,\" implying a conspiracy theory. The speaker also criticizes the idea of secret military tribunals, stating that if they were real, Trump would publicly acknowledge them and Hillary Clinton would be in hiding. They express skepticism about the QAnon movement and its claims of military tribunals. The speaker reports on military training exercises in LA, which they believe are a sign of the deep state preparing to remove Trump from power. They also mention Maxine Waters' response to the drills and the LA Police Department's coordination with state and city officials. The speaker concludes by suggesting that the empire is struggling and that Trump's State of the Union address on Chinese New Year might be a warning sign. They also imply that Ivanka Trump's teaching her children Chinese is a sign of the empire's decline.\nDocument 38\nToday's guest on the Titans of Industry show is Kenneth Lewis, a legend in the bullion dealership business. He's a good friend of the show and a great presenter. Kenneth is here to discuss the advantages and pitfalls of owning rare coins and precious metals.  Kenneth emphasizes that owning precious metals is a long-term investment, not a short-term trade. He recommends owning gold and silver as a way to diversify a portfolio and protect against economic downturns. He notes that gold has been the second-best performing asset class behind real estate since 2000 and tends to perform inversely to the equities market during tough economic times.  When it comes to purchasing precious metals, Kenneth suggests starting with core products such as sovereign coins, gold eagles, and silver maples. He advises against buying large quantities of metal, such as kilos or 100-ounce silver bars, as they may be difficult to sell and result in a lower price.  Kenneth also discusses the importance of storage solutions for precious metals. He recommends storing metal in the US, where the regulatory environment is more favorable, rather than moving it offshore. He notes that storage expenses can be higher in other parts of the world, such as Switzerland.  Kenneth's company, OneGold, offers a digital product that allows customers to hold their metal at the Royal Canadian Mint or in the US. He's working on expanding this product to the UK and Switzerland, offering customers the option to hold their metal offshore while still maintaining title.  In terms of purchasing precious metals, Kenneth suggests focusing on the right products, such as sovereign coins and core bullion products, and being mindful of spreads and premiums. He recommends buying metal as you go, using dollar-cost averaging, and not trying to time the market.  Overall, Kenneth emphasizes the importance of education and research when it comes to owning precious metals. He encourages listeners to do their own research and not rely solely\nDocument 39\nRachel Seller, a forensic nurse, is discussing the 5G Wi-Fi takeover and its potential health effects with Dr. Kenneth Stoller.

Dr. Stoller shares his expertise on the effects of EMFs and radiation on human health, particularly on children and adolescents. He mentions that the blood-brain barrier is more permeable in younger individuals, making them more vulnerable to EMF exposure. Rachel also brings up the topic of weaponized water and the potential effects of EMFs on water vitality.  The conversation also touches on the topic of vaccines, including the Ebola vaccine and the use of aborted human fetal cells in vaccine production. Rachel expresses skepticism about the efficacy and safety of vaccines, particularly in the context of tertiary vaccine failure.  Overall, the discussion highlights concerns about the potential health effects of 5G technology, the use of aborted human fetal cells in vaccine production, and the need for environmental justice and awareness about these issues.\nDocument 40\nHello, I'm Roy Potter, a former U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel.  I'm discussing the Trump budget and border deal, which I strongly oppose.  Trump signed the deal, declaring a national emergency, and I'm concerned about its implications.  I'll share a clip from Bill O'Reilly, who shares my sentiments on the matter.  Regarding the declassification of sensitive material, I speculate that Trump might be holding back to avoid compromising potential evidence in a criminal trial.\nDocument 41\nA prophet is speaking about a future war in Europe, stating that it will be short-lived and that France will play a key role in defeating the invading forces from the East. The war is seen as a physical battle, not just a spiritual one. The prophet believes that France will join forces with Great Britain and other nations to overcome an agreement between Russia and Iran.   The prophet also speaks about a great move of the spirit in Europe, which will be the next reformation. This move will be driven by reconciliation and will overcome the hatred and demonic rage that has been present. The prophet emphasizes the importance of saying the name of Jesus, Yeshua, to bring about victory.  The prophet also shares a vision of a dark cloud descending to deceive and lie to God's people, but another cloud will descend to protect them. The prophet believes that France will experience a mighty revival and that Europe will once again have a flame of faith.   The enemy is attacking France and Europe for a reason, and the prophet believes that these nations will soon be terror targets. However, the prophet encourages people to keep their eyes open and watch what happens after these events take place.\nDocument 42\nThe speaker shares a personal experience where they claim to have received a vision from God, warning of America's impending judgment. They describe seeing a map of the United States with blood spreading across it, followed by an image of an old, emaciated woman trying to nurse a newborn baby. The speaker believes this vision represents America's spiritual condition and its impending judgment.  The speaker also discusses their Christian faith and how it relates to their prepping channel.

The question now is what will happen to Julian Assange.\nDocument 44\nMarta Andreasen, a qualified accountant, was hired as the EU's first chief accountant in 2002. She discovered that \u00a3170 million, or $220 million, was missing from the EU budget. Despite her efforts to rectify the issue, she was suspended and later fired for allegedly violating staff regulations. Andreasen refused to ratify the European Commission accounts, revealing that the massive \u00a3143 billion per year budget was not accounted for in its entirety.  The EU's secret bank accounts have never been properly investigated, with some set up by employees of Eurostat, the EU's statistical watchdog. A double accounting system was allegedly used to transfer money to secret accounts not monitored by auditors. Between 1996 and 2001, an average of $1 million per year disappeared without trace.  Another whistleblower, a Danish statistician, exposed a multi-billion dollar Eurostat scam involving secret accounts in Luxembourg. She pointed out suspicious contracts and payments for work that was never carried out. Despite her allegations, she was intimidated into taking sick leave and received little support from EU officials.  The EU's budget is \u00a3360 million, or $475 million, per day, with most of it siphoned into secret EU bank accounts. The EU's VAT taxes have risen significantly, with VAT in the UK now nearly 30% sales tax. The EU's handling of the whistleblowers and the lack of investigation into the secret bank accounts have raised concerns about corruption and mismanagement within the EU.\nDocument 45\nCalifornia's state controller, Betty Yee, is being sued by the nonprofit American Transparency for allegedly lacking transparency in state spending. The organization is seeking an electronic copy of all records relating to state spending information, but Yee claims she can't locate a single one of the 49 million bills she paid last year. This has raised concerns about how and where the state's $320 billion annual payments are being spent. The lawsuit is part of the Open the Books project, which has collected detailed spending accounts from all other 49 states. California's new central system for accounting, the Financial Information System of California, has been criticized for its inability to produce a simple line-by-line accounting of expenditures. The system's price tag has exceeded $1 billion, and even if it were operating properly, it would only reflect about 65% of what's spent by the state. The lawsuit aims to force open the state's line-by-line expenditures and provide transparency into its core operations.\nDocument 46\nDr. Dave Janda discusses President Trump's strategy to dismantle the mainstream media, which he refers to as the \"lamestream, fake media.\" Janda claims that Trump's team has been working behind the scenes to cut the budget of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), a propaganda arm of the US government. The BBG was established to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda, but Janda argues that it has been used to manipulate public opinion and suppress alternative media.  Janda points to several headlines about the decline of the mainstream media, including layoffs at BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, and Vice Media. He suggests that these layoffs are a result of Trump's efforts to cut the BBG's budget, which has been used to fund these media outlets.  In 2016, President Obama signed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act, which established a fund to help train local journalists and provide grants to non-governmental organizations and private sector companies to identify and analyze foreign government disinformation techniques. Janda argues that this act was a step towards creating a US Ministry of Truth, which would be used to control the narrative and suppress alternative media.  Trump's first budget in 2018 cut the BBG's funding by $63 million, and he doubled down on this cut in the following year, reducing the budget by an additional $24 million. Janda suggests that this is the reason why the mainstream media is \"melting\" and experiencing layoffs.  Janda encourages viewers to join him on his radio show and website, where he provides original content and analysis that is not available in the mainstream media. He also warns viewers about unauthorized channels that have stolen his content and are monetized by YouTube.\nDocument 47\nBill Murphy, co-founder of the Gold Antitrust Action Committee, joins Reluctant Preppers to discuss the current state of the gold market. He explains that the physical market is the key to the gold price increase, with new buyers coming in and the gold cartel running out of physical gold to supply. This has led to a scramble to get physical gold, and the gold price has rallied over $100 in the last two and a half months.  Murphy believes that the gold cartel's control is weakening, and the gold price will continue to rise. He notes that the gold silver ratio is currently 90:1, which is a joke, and that silver should be around $25 if it were equivalent to gold. He predicts that when silver finally breaks out, it will go fast and spectacularly.  Murphy also discusses the manipulation of the silver market by J.P. Morgan, which has kept the price artificially low. He believes that the mechanism used for price suppression is the futures derivatives market, and that the physical market is the key to breaking free from this control.  The conversation also touches on the U.S. debt clock, which shows a ratio of 198:1, and the possibility of a default in paper contracts. Murphy notes that the central banks' actions are difficult to understand, but that the tightening physical gold market is a major factor.  Reluctant Preppers also answers viewer questions, including one from OKIGETIT, who asks if there is hope for a change in the system. Murphy responds that he is an old-school advocate for gold and silver, and that he believes that the system will change, but it will take time.  The conversation concludes with Murphy's final thoughts, encouraging viewers to follow him on the Metropole Cafe and to stay informed about the gold and silver markets.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Government Control (Document: 42): Mentions the government's control over its citizens.\n    [2] Currency Reset (Document: 36): Mentions the potential for a currency reset.\n    [2] Financial Crisis (Document: 36): Mentions the potential for a financial crisis.\n    [2] Gold Standard (Document: 38, 47): Mentions the gold standard and its potential impact on the economy.\n    [2] Economic Policy (Document: 36, 38, 47): Mentions the government's economic policy and its potential impact on the economy.\n    [2] Immigration (Document: 40): Mentions the government's handling of immigration.\n    [2] Economic Collapse (Document: 36, 42): Mentions the potential for an economic collapse.\n    [2] Gun Control (Document: 40): Mentions the government's handling of gun control.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 40, 44, 45): Mentions corruption in government institutions.\n    [2] Financial Markets (Document: 36, 38, 47): Mentions the financial markets and their potential impact on the economy.\n    [2] Geopolitics (Document: 41): Mentions the geopolitical situation in Europe.\n    [2] Election Interference (Document: 40): Mentions the potential for election interference.\n    [2] Government Control (Document: 42): Mentions the government's control over its citizens\n    [2] Government Debt (Document: 36): Mentions the government's debt and its potential impact on the economy."}
{"summary":"Document 48\nThe speaker discusses the prophetic financial freedom and wealth transfer, citing the prophet Kim Clement's prophecies. Kim Clement has predicted a wealth transfer from the East to the West, specifically mentioning the country of Iraq and its currency, the dinar. The speaker explains that the wealth transfer will come at a cost and is part of a larger prophecy that includes the US-China trade war and a currency war.  The speaker shares Kim Clement's prophecies, including a 2002 vision of a huge event happening due to a US-China deal, which would lead to a surrender of masses of wealth from the East to the West. Kim Clement also prophesied that the dinar would bring great wealth to the Middle East and the US.  The speaker notes that the Central Bank of Iraq has taken steps to stabilize the dinar, but the currency's value remains uncertain. They emphasize that investing in the dinar is not a recommendation, but rather a potential opportunity for those seeking financial freedom.  The speaker believes that Kim Clement's prophecies are coming to pass, citing current events such as the US-China trade war and economic instability. They encourage listeners to take advantage of the wealth transfer opportunity, which they believe will bring prosperity to those who are prepared.

The Iraqi Saudi Coordination Council has held a preparatory meeting for a joint meeting with the Saudi Council, scheduled to take place in Baghdad next month.\nDocument 50\nCatania Alvin discusses Theresa May's body language during a speech, suggesting she's hiding something. May's tiny posture, minimal movement, and loose coat are indicative of deception. Alvin notes that May's legs are crossed, she's making herself small, and barely moving, which suggests she's hiding her plan.   When asked about the UK's potential exit from the EU, May avoids eye contact, particularly on key points, indicating she's not being truthful. Alvin explains that good eye contact on certain words in a sentence can indicate the speaker's confidence in their statement.   In another interview, Alvin analyzes May's body language, suggesting she believes in herself and her actions, which is why she's resistant to resigning. However, May's wiggling head and leaning forward during the interview suggest she's nervous and unsure.\nDocument 51\nDavid Icke's visa to Australia was revoked just hours before his flight, citing pressure from special interest groups and an article in The Australian. Icke claims he's been a victim of a smear campaign, spreading lies about his anti-Semitic and Holocaust-denying views. He denies these allegations, stating he's not anti-Semitic and doesn't support Holocaust denial in schools.  Icke attributes the ban to Zionists, who he claims control the media, financial systems, and politics worldwide. He believes Zionism is a political movement that wants to control information and divert attention from important issues. Icke also criticizes Donald Trump's administration for having too much Zionist influence.  Icke's supporter, who spoke after him, agrees with some of his views and praises his work in spreading awareness. They mention that Icke's speaking engagements often sell out, and thousands of people attend his events. The supporter emphasizes the need to shut down Zionism, which they believe is the root of many problems.  The speaker also discusses the importance of knowing the truth and not just believing in it. They criticize the media and politicians for being controlled by liars and emphasize the need for people to wake up and take responsibility for their actions. The speaker ends by expressing hope for an awakening and a return to truth and responsibility.\nDocument 52\nThe host of rotoro.com discusses the ongoing investigation into Deutsche Bank's role in the 200 billion euro Dansk Bank money laundering scandal. The U.S. Department of Justice has stepped up its investigation, focusing on whether Deutsche Bank helped move tainted money from Dansk into the United States. If proven, this could lead to steep financial penalties.  The host questions the timing of the investigation, given that the SWIFT system, which Deutsche Bank uses, is controlled by the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank, and they have known about the transactions since the beginning. The host also criticizes the Federal Reserve for changing the rules to report interest rates in the repo market, rather than addressing the underlying problem.  The host also discusses the current state of the economy, including the everything bubble and the potential for inflation. They argue that the Federal Reserve's policies have created deflation and supported zombie companies, and that a new rule allowing inflation to run above 2% may be necessary to make up for lost inflation.  Additionally, the host discusses the price of silver, which they believe is undervalued and will eventually break out. They argue that silver is being consumed and used in electronics and other products, and that its price is being artificially suppressed. The host recommends swapping gold for silver, as silver is likely to perform better in the long run.\nDocument 53\nThis week, gold and silver prices showed strength, with the spot silver price nearing $16 an ounce and the gold spot price closing just under $1,330 per ounce. James Anderson of SD Bullion discussed the latest news in the precious metals industry, including technical resistance levels for gold and silver. He noted that experts predict near-term gold price resistance levels of $1,360 to $1,350 per ounce, and that a close above these levels could lead to a retest of the $1,400 an ounce psychological and last five-year price resistance level.  Anderson also discussed the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes, which indicate that their balance sheet reduction program is likely to end this year. He believes that this change in policy will lead to a shift in sentiment, with the markets that have been bullish over the past five years giving way to precious metals.  In industry news, the US Mint temporarily halted 2019 Silver Eagle coin sales, which is not surprising given the recent uptick in demand and the US Mint's quasi-just-in-time delivery nature. Anderson noted that bullion dealer Silver Eagle inventory levels are not exorbitantly low, but their amounts are limited, and that the US Mint is known to get caught flat-footed due to supply constraints.  Anderson believes that the day is coming when bullion buyers will face significant delays or backorders, and that most people's only option will be to stick their cash in a derivative or pay an exorbitant premium for bullion. He encourages listeners to check out his article on SD Bullion for more information on the negative contributing factors ongoing with the silver bullion industry supply side manufacturing.\nDocument 54\nIraqi news updates from March 19, 2019. Key highlights include:  The Iraqi Parliament rejected draft amendments to the Iraqi Nationality Law, citing concerns over its current form. The law aims to address the Sunni community's crisis of authority and identity.  Jared Kushner's Middle East peace plan, which includes land swaps with Saudi Arabia, has been met with skepticism. The plan also proposes an oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia to Gaza.  Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi emphasized the country's commitment to peaceful relations with its neighbors, stating that Iraq will not return to destructive wars.  The government faces criticism over corruption, with High Nassif revealing several files that the government cannot control, including oil licenses and smuggling.  The Ministry of Health denied rumors of the Minister's resignation, while the Ministry of Immigration plans to open offices in seven countries.  The Palestinian National Council condemned the Israeli Occupation Court's decision to close the Bab al-Rahma Chapel of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.  The Iraqi Parliament decided to hold its next meeting on Sunday, and the Prime Minister agreed to compensate Basra farmers affected by floods.\nDocument 55\nWe stand at a crossroads in history, where our actions will determine the fate of our civilization.  We must choose between preserving freedom and risking a thousand years of darkness.  We know that life is not so dear that it should be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.  The patriots of history did not back down in the face of adversity, and neither should we.  Our cause will not be won in a short time, but we must begin.  We will be judged by history, and we must strive to be the land we love.  We are opposed to secrecy and will not be intimidated by a monolithic conspiracy that relies on subversion and infiltration.  We will replace a corrupt establishment with a new government controlled by the American people.  This is a moment of great significance, and it belongs to us.  We will be protected by God, and we must reclaim control over our government.\nDocument 56\nThe speaker discusses various topics, including the Litecoin Summit, a debate with Bitcoin, and the importance of freedom. They mention that they've started posting footage from the Litecoin Summit and are sharing a debate with Bitcoin on the crash of cryptocurrencies. The speaker emphasizes the need for freedom and the importance of taking down corrupt systems.  The speaker also talks about Veritasium, a cryptocurrency that has been charged by the SEC but has since settled. They mention that Veritasium is still up and running and sees great things in its future. The speaker is giving away Veritasium tokens to their Road to Ruta members and is encouraging people to join the private road to access exclusive content.  The speaker then discusses silver, calling it a \"ridiculous fraud\" that is ending soon. They mention that J.P. Morgan is being investigated and charged under RICO laws, which could lead to a massive increase in the price of silver. The speaker encourages people to buy physical silver and warns against investing in silver mining stocks or ETFs, which they believe will be nationalized.  The speaker also discusses the current state of the economy, including the repo market and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. They mention an article by Charles Hugh Smith that highlights the Fed's panic and the potential for a blow-off top in the stock market. The speaker believes that the Fed's attempts to prop up the global bubble will ultimately fail, leading to a massive correction.  Finally, the speaker discusses the idea of \"On the Road to the Golden Age,\" an economic formula that involves printing money to infinity and building infrastructure. They believe that this is what is happening behind the scenes, with the government creating money without restraint. The speaker encourages people to join their private road to learn more about these topics and to prepare for the coming changes.\nDocument 57\nI'm Neon Revolt, author of the book \"Revolution Q,\" which tells the story of QAnon and the Second Great Awakening. With over 500 articles on the subject, I realized a book was needed to provide a permanent resource for those interested in QAnon. The book covers the movement's history, the origins of the cabal, and over 3,000 Q posts. It's designed for both new and experienced followers, offering a detailed explanation of Q and its significance. The book aims to preserve this chapter in American history and provide answers for those who will be affected by the upcoming events. I need your help to spread the message, visit neonrevolt.com\/revolutionq to order the book and help bring it to the masses.\nDocument 58\nGood evening, I'm Karen Hudis. Due to a holiday in DC, I'm recording this video myself. I wanted to update you on the current situation. There's a showdown between the people and the corrupt group, the Central Bankers, who are led by the Black Nobility. This group has been corrupting the world for over 9,000 years, and their corruption is the root of all problems.  I've been working with whistleblowers and military powers to expose the corruption. In 2004, I was in the World Bank legal department and discovered the extent of the corruption. I've been using the common law to bankrupt corrupt agents, including Jesse White, who tried to undo my work.  The idea is to decentralize and give power back to the people. We'll use the world's monetary gold reserves and local currencies to replace the corrupt paper currency. The World Bank has a political activities prohibition, which means countries will decide for themselves how to get their governments to be responsive to the people.  We'll have to work carefully with the militaries to ensure there aren't pockets of corruption. It's a challenging task, but we're making progress. Next week, I'll be back at DCTV, and I'll send out scripts so people can read the highlights of my message.  This is a turning point, and we're making ourselves loose from the corruption. We're not subject to a centralized corrupt force, and it's going to be a different kind of existence. We're here to maintain the peace during the transition, and ultimately, all people on Earth will decentralize. Thank you, and I'll be updating you in the coming weeks.\nDocument 59\nThe speaker is warning America about the rise of the Fourth Reich, a supposed new world order controlled by the same people who were in power in 1944. They claim that the world has ignored the persecution of various groups throughout history, including Neanderthals, Native Americans, Jesus and his family, the Templars, and many others. The speaker believes that the same forces are now targeting Americans, stealing their wealth, homes, and rights, and even poisoning their air, water, and food. They also claim that children are being taken for ritual and sacrificial purposes. The speaker argues that Americans are ignoring the problem because they don't live in other states or countries that are being targeted. They urge people to wake up and take action to protect themselves and the planet. The speaker points out that many policy makers in the US have German names, including the mayor of Herndon, Virginia, and suggests that this is not a coincidence. They conclude by saying that it's time for Americans to remember who and what they are and to take action against the Fourth Reich.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Geopolitics (Document: 49, 54): Mentions the complex relationships between countries and their impact on global politics.\n    [2] Prophecy and Geopolitics (Document: 48, 49, 54, 59): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping global politics and relationships between countries.\n    [2] Prophecy and Gun Control (Document: 48, 49, 54): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping gun control policies and outcomes.\n    [2] Gun Control (Document: 49, 54): Mentions the impact of gun control on global politics and the economy.\n    [2] Election and Prophecy (Document: 48, 50, 51, 59): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping election outcomes.\n    [2] Government Control (Document: 55, 58): Mentions the need for government control and the importance of decentralization.\n    [2] Prophecy and Geopolitics (Document\n    [2] Currency Reset (Document: 48, 52, 53, 56): Mentions the impact of currency reset on global politics and the economy.\n    [2] Election Interference (Document: 50, 51, 59): Mentions the role of external forces in influencing election outcomes.\n    [2] Prophecy and Currency Reset (Document: 48, 52, 53, 56): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping currency reset and its impact on global politics and the economy.\n    [2] Prophecy and Election Interference (Document: 48, 50, 51, 59): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping election interference and its impact on global politics.\n    [2] Prophecy and Economic Policy (Document: 48, 52, 53, 56): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping economic policies and outcomes.\n    [2] Immigration (Document: 49, 54): Mentions the impact of immigration on global politics and the economy.\n    [2] Prophecy and Zionism (Document: 48, 51, 59): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping Zionism and its impact on global politics.\n    [2] Economic Policy (Document: 48, 52, 53, 56): Mentions the impact of economic policies on global politics and the economy.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 52, 58): Mentions the extent of corruption within government institutions.\n    [2] Prophecy and Economy (Document: 48, 52, 53, 56): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping economic policies and outcomes.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Corruption (Document: 48, 52, 58): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping government corruption and its impact on global politics.\n    [2] Prophecy and Politics (Document: 48, 54, 59): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping politics and the future.\n    [2] Prophecy and Immigration (Document: 48, 49, 54): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping immigration policies and outcomes.\n    [2] Zionism and Patriotism (Document: 51, 59): Mentions the role of Zionism in shaping global politics and the importance of patriotism.\n    [2] Government and Prophecy (Document: 48, 52, 53, 56): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping government policies and outcomes.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Control (Document: 48, 52, 53, 56): Mentions the role of prophecy in shaping government control and its impact on global politics."}
{"summary":"Document 60\nThe host, Twisted Christian, discusses the global currency reset and its potential impact on the economy. He cites various articles from mainstream news sources, including the Sydney Morning Herald and investing.com, which suggest that a global monetary reset is necessary due to the growing debt and negative interest rates.  Mark Carney, head of the Bank of England, is mentioned as advocating for a global monetary system to replace the dollar. A leading global investor warns of a real and growing risk of a credit bust in China, which could lead to a monetary reset.  The host notes that the term \"global currency reset\" might not be used directly, but rather \"global monetary system\" or similar terms. He expects to see more discussion about this topic in the media within the next few months.  The host also touches on the idea of a cashless economy, which was pushed in 2016, and how it might be connected to the global currency reset. He believes that the debt and the need for a global system reset are closely linked.  The host concludes by encouraging viewers to support his channel on Patreon and to stay informed about the potential global currency reset.\nDocument 61\nThe speaker discusses the potential for silver prices to reach $600, a prediction made by Cliff High, a well-known figure in the crypto and precious metals space. Cliff's model has been delayed due to market manipulation and censorship, but he believes the longer the data is in the system, the bigger the eventual boom will be. The speaker notes that Cliff's predictions are not just based on his own data, but also on the work of other experts like Ted Butler, who has accurately predicted market trends using his own data. The speaker also criticizes the management of silver companies for allowing market manipulation to occur and for not speaking out against it, despite the negative impact on their employees, shareholders, and the overall market. The speaker believes that the price of silver could reach $600 due to the fundamentals of the market, and that this would be a significant boom for silver investors.\nDocument 62\nThe Giggling Conservative discusses an incident where an SUV crashed into a barrier near President Trump's motorcade in Alabama. The driver claimed to have swerved to avoid another vehicle, but the incident highlights the potential threat of an out-of-control SUV. While the incident may have been accidental, the Giggling Conservative speculates that it could have been a veiled assassination attempt by the deep state, given their hatred for President Trump. The commentator believes Democrats are angry about the country's prosperity under Trump's leadership and will stop at nothing to remove him from office. The incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers faced by the President and the importance of his safety.\nDocument 63\nThe speaker discusses the concept of intent and its implications in prayer and meditation. They argue that setting intent can be a minefield due to the lack of understanding about implied intent and the potential for manipulation by external forces. The speaker questions whether one's intent serves only their personal interests or if it involves others, and highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of one's actions.  The speaker also critiques the practice of praying to external entities, suggesting that it can be a waste of life force energy and that praying internally is a more effective and responsible approach. They propose that individuals should focus on personal growth and self-improvement rather than relying on external saviors.  The speaker then shifts to discussing the life and work of Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood. They highlight Sanger's connections to various occult and eugenicist groups, including the Rockefellers, and suggest that her work was heavily funded by these organizations. The speaker also notes Sanger's contradictory views on masturbation and her advocacy for birth control, which was initially banned in the US.  The speaker concludes by suggesting that Sanger's life and work are a prime example of the intersection of occultism, eugenics, and politics, and that her legacy continues to have a profound impact on modern society. They propose that a deeper understanding of these connections is necessary for personal growth and self-awareness.\nDocument 64\nA Democrat politician, Clayton Luckey, is headed to prison after pleading guilty to mail fraud. He was sentenced to four months in prison and is now seeking a pardon from President Trump. Luckey claims that a pardon would show that President Trump cares about the minority community, as he is black. However, Luckey was charged with ripping off other black and minority business owners by using his company as a front to help another firm win work intended for disadvantaged businesses.  Luckey's actions were part of a larger federal public corruption probe in the Dayton area, which has resulted in the indictment of seven people, including Luckey. The probe is investigating a \"culture of corruption\" in Dayton area politics. Luckey has a history of corruption, having previously been convicted of election falsification, money laundering, and grand theft.  Luckey's pardon request is seen as a desperate move, as he has already been convicted of multiple felonies and has a history of corruption. It is unclear whether President Trump will respond to Luckey's request, but it is likely that he will not grant a pardon due to Luckey's history of corruption. The case is part of a wider corruption probe in the state of Ohio, with more arrests potentially on the way.\nDocument 65\nThe speaker is criticizing Democrats, specifically Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, for their handling of a situation involving Lucy Flores, a former gang member who claims Biden kissed her without consent. The speaker questions Flores' credibility, pointing out her past mistakes and accusing her of being ungrateful for Biden's support. The speaker also mocks the idea that Democrats would hire someone with a questionable past to make accusations against a prominent figure like Biden. The speaker then makes a point about the large number of Hispanic and European men who identify as Caucasian, suggesting that Democrats' attempts to appeal to minority groups by pitting them against white men are misguided and likely to backfire.\nDocument 66\nThe video discusses the authenticity of reports about high-profile arrests and trials, particularly those involving George Soros, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The speaker expresses skepticism about the reports, citing the lack of confirmation and the possibility that they may be part of a larger deception.   The speaker also touches on the idea that we live in a world of lies and deception, where our mental perception of reality is shaped by false information. They question the reliability of mainstream news and the ability to discern fact from fiction.   The speaker emphasizes the importance of love, spirituality, and truth, and expresses a desire to see justice prevail and the truth come to light. They also mention the concept of fallen angels and the Creator's role in allowing deception to exist.   Ultimately, the speaker calls for a shift in perspective, encouraging listeners to seek the truth and to be on the side of humanity, love, and truth. They conclude by asking viewers to reflect on whose side they are on and to consider the bigger picture.\nDocument 67\nImagine a world where reality is distorted, and it's difficult to distinguish between humans, robots, and illusions. People around you seem to be living in a warped daze, influenced by indoctrinations and manipulated realities. They're being controlled by a mix of ideologies, including socialism, communism, and white supremacy, all working together to normalize their version of America. This is a result of a \"trifecta of brainwashing\" consisting of genderizing agendas, deep state manipulation, and Hollywood's influence. The goal is to destroy and reconstruct the country, and we're reaching a critical moment. It's time to drop the veil of fear, be bold, and speak out against this normalization. We must take action before it's too late and remain awake to the truth.\nDocument 68\nSDBullion.com is a leading US-based precious metal dealer, offering low-cost, high-quality investment-grade bullion products. The company has experienced rapid growth, being recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of America's fastest-growing companies.  In the latest Metals & Markets podcast, host James Anderson discussed the current state of the financial markets with guest Dave Kranzler from Investment Research Dynamics. They touched on various topics, including the junk bond market, the steep inversion of the Treasury curve, and the potential for a major financial blowup.  Kranzler suggested that the plunge protection team and the Trump government are actively intervening in the markets to prop up financial values and keep the price of gold below the key $1,400 level. He also mentioned the importance of the Eurodollar curve inversion, which he believes indicates major capital flows are moving and that something has been blown up already.  The conversation also turned to the topic of Deutsche Bank, with Kranzler stating that the bank's equity is essentially optionality value, and that a combination of central banks are propping it up to prevent a collapse. He also discussed the potential for a big blowup in the financial system, citing the delinquency and default rate on credit card debt, auto loan defaults, and mortgage defaults.  The discussion also touched on the topic of China's gold reserves, with Kranzler stating that the official figure of 1,800 tons is likely an underestimate, and that China may have accumulated as much as 25,000 to 35,000 tons of gold.  In the longer term, Kranzler expressed excitement about the prospects for precious metals, stating that they are cheap and that investors should consider holding 5-10% of their portfolio in silver and gold for the next 5-10 years.  The conversation concluded with a discussion on the gold-silver ratio, which Kranz\nDocument 69\nThe global economy is in its worst shape since 2009, with China experiencing a deceleration in GDP growth and Europe facing low growth and inflation. The slowdown in these economies can affect the United States, which has been relatively insulated due to its alliances. However, the US economy has not been growing much, and the yield curve inversion, where the 10-year treasury yield falls below the three-month treasury yield, is a significant recession indicator that has preceded the last seven recessions in America.  Jerry Robinson, a Christian economist, believes that the US is technically bankrupt and cannot pay for what it has promised. He expects the government to inflate its way out of the debt, rather than paying it off. Robinson recommends diversifying investments, including exposure to emerging markets, and diversifying income streams. He also suggests taking action to protect oneself, such as having a financial advisor, a will, and insurance.  Robinson's website, followthemoney.com, offers free resources, including a podcast, a free newsletter called the Robinson Report, and a guide to the five levels of financial freedom. He encourages viewers to take action and focus on making a plan, rather than getting caught up in social media outrage.  The Austrian Mint and SD Bullion are offering a Silver Philharmonic x19 get-one-free-coin deal, which includes official European legal tender silver coins with a minimum.999 fine silver bullion content. These coins qualify for silver IRAs and are a good choice for tax-deferred, long-term bullion savings. The deal will end soon, and discreetly shipped, fully insured coins are available to SD Bullion customers' doors and non-bank vaults.\nDocument 70\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles found the POTUS schedule Twitter account, which tracks the President's schedule, suspended. The account, which is not official, posted a picture of the Beast with the caption \"Capital the Beast waiting on the way back.\" Deb believes this might be a member of the entourage inside the car. The account was suspended without explanation, despite only sharing public information and not posting anything controversial. Deb also discussed a video about helicopters and military activity, which she hasn't seen but heard is related to a lawyer for the NXIVM cult. She encourages viewers to share the video or provide more information about the helicopters. Deb is concerned about the suspension of the POTUS schedule account and the unusual helicopter activity, which she plans to research further.\nDocument 71\nPeter of England discusses the significance of Queen Elizabeth not wearing the Imperial Crown during the State Opening of Parliament. The media dismissed this as a minor issue, but Peter believes it's a sign of change in global world dominance by the elite. He suggests that the Queen may have abdicated and been replaced by those seeking a free, democratic, and just control of the world's governance and financial systems. This is linked to Weir Bank's initiative to participate in the global reset and economic restructuring, which has been promised by various groups. Peter hints at a major announcement from Weir Bank regarding a global currency and financial reset, including a debt assumption and eradication program. He encourages viewers to stay tuned for further updates.\nDocument 72\nDr. Dave Janda discusses President Trump's efforts to cut off the deep state's supply lines, which he believes is a key aspect of the president's war against the globalist syndicate. The deep state's modus operandi is plunder, and they have been involved in plundering natural resources, including oil, gold, and silver, as well as human trafficking.  Janda highlights two recent events that have upset the deep state's apple cart: the US Army's seizure of 50 tons of gold from Syria, allegedly from ISIS, and President Trump's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. The withdrawal from Afghanistan, Janda argues, is aimed at cutting off the globalist syndicate's supply line of opium poppy cultivation, which supplies 90% of the world's heroin.  Janda also discusses the human trafficking trade, which he believes is another means of plundering humans. He argues that President Trump's efforts to enhance security at the border and declare a national emergency are aimed at cutting off the supply lines to the deep state and the globalist syndicate.  Janda concludes that the president is fighting a war on multiple fronts, including the border, Syria, and Afghanistan, and that he is intent on winning by cutting off the deep state's supply lines. He encourages listeners to join his platform, Operation Freedom, and become subscribers to support his efforts.  Key points:  * President Trump is cutting off the deep state's supply lines * The deep state's modus operandi is plunder * The deep state has been involved in plundering natural resources, including oil, gold, and silver, as well as human trafficking * The US Army's seizure of 50 tons of gold from Syria is a recent event that has upset the deep state's apple cart * President Trump's withdrawal from Afghanistan is aimed at cutting off the globalist syndicate's supply line of opium poppy cultivation\nDocument 73\nDonald Trump Jr. joins Tucker Carlson to discuss the threat of woke capitalism and the alliance between the activist left and big business that is shutting down speech. He shares his personal experience of having his Instagram post deleted and his account unfollowed due to his conservative views. Trump Jr. argues that this is a one-way systematic attack on free speech and a trial run for 2020. He believes that the media benefits from our freedom of speech but is not covering the issue, and that places like CNN encourage companies to de-platform voices they don't think should be heard. Trump Jr. also criticizes the Republican Congress for not standing up for free speech and suggests that they are complicit in the erosion of the First Amendment. He calls on Republicans to push back against this attack on free speech and to take a stand against fascism. Trump Jr. also discusses his father's efforts to negotiate nuclear peace settlements with North Korea and criticizes the Democrats for trying to counterprogram this progress with Michael Cohen's testimony.\nDocument 74\nStarting in October, the Oasis will host \"hub nights\" on the third Friday of each month, with the first one on October 18th.

{"summary":"Document 75\nThe speaker, claiming to be a commander of a mission, discusses the nature of reality, God, and extraterrestrial life. They assert that Ashtar, a term often associated with a space being, is actually a command or a computer system used for tagging and evacuation purposes. The speaker emphasizes that their mission is focused on guiding humanity towards perfection, integrity, and equality, but acknowledges that most visitors are not benevolent.  The speaker criticizes church doctrines and teachers for lying to people, leading to ignorance and detrimental behavior. They emphasize that prophecies will be fulfilled, but not through a mass turnabout of humanity, rather through individual choices and free will. The speaker also discusses the importance of discernment, highlighting that some individuals may be difficult to distinguish from humans due to their inbred animal nature.  The speaker expresses frustration with those who deny or mock their mission, suggesting that these individuals are often misled by false teachers who drain their assets and lead them astray. The speaker emphasizes that their mission is focused on fulfilling a divine purpose, rather than building a church or group. They conclude by stating that they will not protect those who deny them, but rather allow the consequences of their actions to unfold.  Ultimately, the speaker encourages individuals to reflect on their own actions and intentions, and to seek truth and guidance from within. They emphasize that it is never too late to change and serve a higher purpose, but that few people choose to do so. The speaker concludes by thanking listeners for tuning in and encouraging them to explore the Phoenix Journals, which they consider to be important books for our time.\nDocument 76\nThe global economy is heading for trouble as manufacturing and construction sectors shrink. The service sector is the only thing standing between the economy and a full-blown recession. Global manufacturers reported new export orders fell for the 10th month running in June, with the most widespread decline for six years. This is contradictory to mainstream financial news, which claims the economy is recovering.  India's economic slowdown may be reversed by major rainfall, but China is facing problems with the army beetle, affecting food supply. The Midwest floods in the US have also impacted corn yields, leading to higher food prices. This will contribute to inflation, which will be noticed by the public, potentially driving interest in precious metals.  The tech industry is doubting Facebook's ability to launch its Libra currency by 2020. Regulators are taking a close look at it, and Libra's exec is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee.  The Pentagon is considering investing in virtual reality platforms to prepare troops for nuclear threats. This is a sign of the end of the age of empire and the push towards wars.  The world's population continues to grow, leading to increased use of natural resources. Energy prices remain too low for producers, which can have severe consequences. The growth rate of world energy consumption has fallen behind the 2% per year growth rate required to avoid recessions.  The gold market is strong, with gold reserves increasing in Poland and hitting a six-year high in US dollars. Gold is viewed as an alternative currency and is rising in dollar terms. The true hallmark of a bull market in gold is its ability to rise relative to other major currencies.  David Morgan, publisher of The Morgan Report, believes that gold will reach 1450 by the end of the year, with a potential of 1500. He also thinks that silver will start to push forward and lower the gold-silver ratio.\nDocument 77\nJerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was asked about the possibility of the US returning to the gold standard. He responded that it's not a choice, but rather a combination of gold and silver as the standard. The speaker argues that the US Constitution already established gold and silver as the standard, citing Article 1, Section 8, which mentions coining money and fixing standards of weights and measures.  The speaker criticizes the Federal Reserve's ability to maintain price stability, citing a chart showing the dollar's purchasing power has decreased by 97% since 1913. They also argue that the price of gold has sent negative signals for the Fed's objectives, but claim that gold is not a signal, but rather a measure of value.  The speaker references the Coinage Act of 1792, which established the value of gold and silver coins, and argues that the Fed's mission would be to stabilize the dollar price of gold, not to manage the economy. They also claim that the Fed's current mission is to manage maximum employment and stable prices, but that this is not a reliable measure.  The speaker concludes that the gold standard is not a choice, but rather a constitutional requirement, and that the Federal Reserve's reluctance to return to the gold standard is due to the benefits of debt-based fiat currency. They also argue that the CEOs of the world's most systemically important banks do not want to return to the gold standard because it would limit their ability to profit from price suppression.\nDocument 78\nThe speaker, Hengist Mountebank, initially planned to create a video about the Notre Dame fire but was too angry. Instead, he discusses the desecration of Hagia Sophia, a historic church in Constantinople, which was converted into a mosque. He expresses his disapproval of churches in France being desecrated at a rate of two per day and suggests that if Notre Dame is rebuilt, it may ultimately be turned into a mosque or a multi-faith center. Mountebank believes it would have been better for Notre Dame to burn rather than be desecrated. He promotes his book, \"A Little Life in You Yet,\" and emphasizes the importance of preserving one's culture and civilization by having children and making a country great again.\nDocument 79\nMatt Schwab from New York asked about the silver purchase last year, citing the announcement that supply and demand fundamentals would be reestablished at a higher price. He inquired about the specific fundamentals driving this expectation.   The speaker explained that aggregate demand for silver is around 800 million ounces annually, primarily from photography, industrial uses, and ornamental jewelry. Meanwhile, annual silver production is approximately 500 million ounces, with most of it being a byproduct of gold, copper, lead, and zinc mining. This makes the supply relatively inelastic to price changes.  The speaker noted that there's a historical gap of around 150 million ounces between supply and demand, which has been filled by bullion inventories above ground. However, these inventories have been depleted significantly, indicating that the current price of silver does not establish equilibrium between supply and demand.  The speaker believes that this imbalance will eventually lead to a change in the market, which could be a reduction in usage, an increase in supply, or a change in price. They emphasized that the price change is likely to be significant due to the inelastic nature of both supply and demand.  The speaker also discussed the historical influence of government policies on the silver market, including the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which artificially inflated the price of silver. They noted that similar dislocations have occurred in the past, causing the price to be affected by inventory accumulations and reductions.  Charlie, a partner, chimed in, downplaying the significance of the silver purchase, stating that it's a non-event for Berkshire Hathaway, which has a large portfolio of assets.\nDocument 80\nHere's a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  Twister Christian discusses what to do after the Dinar Revalues. He thanks viewers for their support on Patreon and PayPal, which will help him focus on creating content. He warns against panicking, overspending, and posting on social media, as this can attract unwanted attention from scammers.  He advises viewers to change all their passwords on the day of the revalue, including email, computer, and financial accounts. He also recommends switching to an encrypted email service and setting up alert systems for financial transactions.  Twister Christian emphasizes the importance of security, warning against downloading anything from chat rooms or 800 numbers, which may contain viruses or scams. He advises viewers to be cautious when receiving email alerts and not to open suspicious emails.  Before going to the bank, viewers should change all their passwords, write them down, and prepare for a new computer system, iPad, and phone. Twister Christian recommends getting a new phone with a new telephone number.  In the next video, he will discuss what to do during and after the exchange, including using a new checking and savings account, and considering putting money in a CD or untouchable account. He will also cover security measures, such as protecting against scammers and making promises to others.  Twister Christian concludes part one of the series, thanking viewers for listening and inviting them to check out part two tomorrow.\nDocument 81\nThe speaker believes that the current moment is a critical moment for democracy and that the American dream is big enough for everyone. They emphasize the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect, particularly the Latino community. The speaker is optimistic about the future and believes that if we work together, we can fulfill the ideals of this nation.  However, the speaker criticizes Joe Biden's campaign for launching a Latino support network without properly securing the domain name, allowing Donald Trump's campaign to claim it and use it against Biden. The speaker finds this to be a masterful troll by Trump and a demonstration of his dominance in social media.  The speaker also criticizes Biden's campaign for its lack of action and inaction, suggesting that Biden is not taking the Latino community seriously. They contrast this with Trump's campaign, which has effectively used social media to its advantage and has dominated the conversation.  The speaker concludes that Trump's campaign is a joke and that he is completely untouchable in the social media game. They recommend that viewers join the TotusCon Biden page, which has been taken over by Trump's campaign, to see the humor in the situation.\nDocument 82\nRachel Seller, a forensic nurse, is joined by Dr. Kenneth Stoller to discuss current events, including censorship on YouTube and Facebook, and the dangers of 5G towers and cell phone radiation. Dr. Stoller shares his concerns about the lack of risk assessment and environmental impact studies on 5G technology, which he believes is being used for behavioral control. He notes that cell phone towers are being installed near schools and residential areas without proper zoning restrictions.  The conversation turns to the contamination of drinking water, including the addition of fluoride, arsenic, and lead. Rachel mentions that city water reports are available online and encourages viewers to check them. Dr. Stoller shares his concerns about the use of microwaved water, which he believes can change the molecular structure of water and have negative effects on human health.  The discussion also touches on the topic of chemtrails, a geoengineering project that involves spraying aluminum chafe into the atmosphere. Dr. Stoller notes that this project has been ongoing for years and is being done without environmental impact studies or disclosures. He believes that this is a military operation, carried out by the deep state, and that it's having a toxic effect on living systems.  Rachel emphasizes the importance of being aware of what's happening in our own backyards and encourages viewers to take action by demanding environmental risk assessments and objecting to the installation of 5G towers and cell phone radiation. She also mentions that city water reports are available online and encourages viewers to check them.\nDocument 83\nBreaking news from California, where a restaurant in Rainbow, California, is showing patriotism by playing the Star Spangled Banner at noon every day. Leonard Bacani and Linda Forsythe visited Rainbow Oaks Restaurant, which has an old-town-era America ambiance. The owners, Janelle and Duke Maples, are being praised for their patriotism, proving that there are many patriots in California and the US. This is a refreshing change from the narrative that California is unpatriotic.\nDocument 84\nSenator Moran expressed concerns about the Federal Reserve's FedNow system, citing the need for interoperability and a level playing field with private sector service providers. He emphasized the importance of equal pricing for all financial institutions, regardless of size.   Regarding blockchain technology, the Senator expressed concern about the lack of clarity in the US, leading companies to move overseas. He asked for more guidance from the SEC, specifically on the classification of tokens as securities or utilities.   The SEC Commissioner acknowledged the complexity of the issue and the need for a clear framework. He mentioned the UK's approach to categorizing tokens into three buckets: security, utility, and exchange tokens. The Commissioner noted that the SEC is working to provide more guidance and clarity on the matter.\nDocument 85\nThe song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" by Tears for Fears is a commentary on the human desire for power and control. The lyrics describe a world where people are driven by their own self-interest and a desire to dominate others. The song's chorus, \"Everybody wants to rule the world,\" is a repeated refrain that highlights the universal nature of this desire.  However, the song also touches on the idea that this desire for power and control is ultimately futile and that true freedom and happiness can only be found by letting go of our ego and embracing love and connection with others. The lyrics \"So let go, jump in, we're what you're waiting for\" and \"It's alright, cause there's beauty in the breakdown\" suggest a sense of release and surrender, and the importance of finding beauty in the imperfections and uncertainties of life.  The song also features a second half that is a more upbeat and optimistic message, with the lyrics \"Come on people now, smile on your brother, everybody get together, try to love one another right now.\" This section of the song emphasizes the importance of love, connection, and community, and suggests that by coming together and supporting one another, we can create a more harmonious and loving world.\nDocument 86\nNicholas Sandman settled his defamation lawsuit against CNN, but the terms of the settlement remain confidential. Viva Pry, a YouTuber and litigator, breaks down the settlement and its implications.   The lawsuit stemmed from a viral video of Sandman and other Covington Catholic High School students at the Lincoln Memorial, which was misinterpreted by mainstream media as racist. Sandman sued CNN, Washington Post, and NBC Universal for over $250 million each for defamation and pain and suffering.  The Washington Post initially had a motion to dismiss granted, but Sandman's lawsuit was later reinstated in part. Sandman settled with CNN, but the settlement amount is unknown. Pry notes that settlements don't necessarily imply a large payment from the defendant to the plaintiff.  Pry suggests that the settlement amount could be between $5 and $20 million, but this is speculative. The parties will likely discuss the settlement among themselves, which could give insight into the settlement amount and its implications for the other lawsuits against Washington Post and NBC Universal.  Ultimately, the settlement's implications are unclear without knowing the settlement amount. Pry advises not to believe the hype and to consider the complexities of defamation law and the Sandman lawsuit.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Blockchain Technology (Document: 84): Mentions Senator Moran's concerns about the Federal Reserve's FedNow system, and the SEC Commissioner's acknowledgment of the complexity of the issue and the need for a clear framework.\n    [2] Gold Standard (Document: 77): Mentions Jerome Powell's response to the possibility of the US returning to the gold standard, and the speaker's argument that the US Constitution already established gold and silver as the standard.\n    [2] Silver Market (Document: 79): Mentions the speaker's explanation of the silver market, including the historical gap between supply and demand, and the depletion of bullion inventories above ground.\n    [2] Desecration of Churches (Document: 78): Mentions the desecration of Hagia Sophia, a historic church in Constantinople, and the speaker's disapproval of churches in France being desecrated at a rate of two per day.\n    [2] Economic Policy (Document: 76): Mentions the global economy heading for trouble, manufacturing and construction sectors shrinking, and the service sector being the only thing standing between the economy and a full-blown recession.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Control (Document: 75): Mentions the speaker's mission to guide humanity towards perfection, integrity, and equality, and their criticism of church doctrines and teachers for lying to people.\n    [2] Patriotism (Document: 83): Mentions the restaurant in Rainbow, California, showing patriotism by playing the Star Spangled Banner at noon every day.\n    [2] Human Desire for Power (Document: 85): Mentions the song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" by Tears for Fears, and its commentary on the human desire for power and control.\n    [2] Dinar Revalue (Document: 80): Mentions Twister Christian's advice on what to do after the Dinar Revalues, including changing passwords, switching to an encrypted email service, and preparing for a new computer system.\n    [2] Censorship (Document: 82): Mentions the discussion of censorship on YouTube and Facebook, and the dangers of 5G towers and cell phone radiation.\n    [2] Defamation Lawsuit (Document: 86): Mentions Nicholas Sandman's defamation lawsuit against CNN, and Viva Pry's breakdown of the settlement and its implications.\n    [2] Latino Community (Document: 81): Mentions the speaker's criticism of Joe Biden's campaign for launching a Latino support network without properly securing the domain name, and their praise for Trump's campaign for dominating the conversation on social media."}
{"summary":"Document 87\nHello everyone, I'm Matthew. Today is July 19th, and I'm trying to get some work done at the homestead. However, I've been busy staying on the phone and responding to comments. I want to clarify that I'm not perfect and don't claim to have all the answers. I'm just trying to provide information and vet it to the best of my ability.  Regarding the Epstein case, I highlighted a video in my previous video that shows Robert Maxwell, the father of the Epstein madam, was indeed involved. I'm not trying to drag our president through the dirt, but rather provide information and let you decide what to believe.  As a good friend and source advised me, it's a fact that our president has rubbed elbows with the deep state and cabal players. However, this doesn't necessarily make him complicit. There are some interesting examples, such as the yacht sold to the Saudi Arabian attorney that once belonged to the Khashoggi family.  I want to emphasize that you shouldn't take my word for anything, and I'm just trying to bring out the truth, not fiction. Some of the information I uncover may not be liked by everyone, but that's the nature of the job.  I've been getting information about China Lake being targeted by the White Hat community, and there's a decrease in chemtrails on the West Coast. However, we're still seeing a dramatic rollout of 5G, which is a concern for me. I'll be discussing more breaking news on Iran and the potential for another major conflict.  I also want to talk about the markets and food shortages. Food shelves are starting to get thin, and I recommend diversifying your assets and not relying on electronic banking. I've considered sticking to geopolitical and prepping news, but I believe Donald J. Trump will win in 2020.  Before moving on to the news, I\nDocument 88\nWelcome to the Trusts Unlimited Wednesday conference call. I'm Jim George, non-attorney spokesman and facilitator. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, whether it's live or on the replay. I'll keep the call brief and handle it differently today.\nDocument 89\nThe world is at a standstill, with those in power trapped and unable to move forward or go back. Their attempts to control the world are now just empty charades, and their actions will become increasingly disjointed as they realize they've lost. They're fighting out of habit, but it's only a matter of time before their operations cease. The harm, hate, and deception they've caused will no longer be borne by others, and it's up to the people to create a new reality. This is a choice between hate, vengeance, or love, and the speaker chooses love.\nDocument 90\nHello everyone, I'm Peter of England, and I'm here to announce a major project from Weirbank for 2020. The goal is to tackle the global debt crisis, which is poisoning society, culture, and our ability to progress. Weirbank has been working on a debt eradication program since 2015, showing individuals how to become private bankers by issuing promissory notes and checkbooks to pay off debts.  We're now introducing a new methodology to sell your debt to Weirbank, an Alternative Service Provider, with the help of Freeman Legal Services. This will allow you to break free from the debt circle and become debt-free. We're not just talking about credit card debt or mortgage debt, but any form of debt, including taxes and loans.  The webinar on January 15th, 2020, will explain the process in detail, and we encourage you to attend. We'll also show you how to change your legal status to that of a private banker, which is crucial for this process. This is not a pie-in-the-sky solution, but a credible and realistic way to overcome the debt burden.  We're not just fighting against the global banking cartels, but also against the judiciary, executive, and legislative branches of government, which are controlled by a Vatican Masonic secret manipulation. We're also fighting against the corporatocracy, large money men, and the fake news media.  The offer is simple: sell your debt to Weirbank, and we'll take care of the administration. We're not just talking about a financial reset, but a biblical struggle to free humanity from debt slavery. We're confident that this can be done, and we invite you to join us on this journey.  Please prepare your list of debts and attend the webinar on January 15th, 2020, at 7 o'clock London time. We'll provide you with\nDocument 91\nDr. Dave Janda discusses the deep state's illegal surveillance activity, focusing on President Trump and the recent developments with the Jesse Smollett case. He emphasizes that corruption, coercion, and compromise are key factors in the deep state's actions, and that leverage is the primary tool used to achieve their goals. The deep state obtains leverage through information, often obtained illegally, which is then used for potential coercion, blackmail, or other nefarious purposes.  Dr. Janda references a recent article by C. Mitchell Shaw in the New American Magazine, which exposes an Obama-era deep state surveillance program that spied on Trump, judges, and millions of others, including citizens. He also mentions Operation Freedom, a radio show where he and his guests, including General Tom McInerney and Kevin Shipp, will further dissect the deep state's methods and how they utilize information to achieve their agenda.  Dr. Janda encourages viewers to join him on Operation Freedom, a free live stream on Sundays from 2 to 5 Eastern, and to visit his website, davejanda.com, for more information and analysis. He also promotes a subscription platform, offering a \"big bang for the buck\" for those interested in in-depth coverage of the deep state's activities and their impact on American freedoms.\nDocument 92\nThis video discusses an interview with a guest named DeGenova, who shares information about the declassification of documents related to the Obama administration's use of intelligence agencies to target opponents. The guest mentions that Samantha Power, a former US Ambassador to the UN, had 250 names unmasked in NSA databases, but it was actually four contractors working for the FBI who made the unauthorized queries in her name. The contractors were accessing information illegally, and this is the main scandal.   The guest also talks about Mike Rogers, the former head of the NSA, who discovered the illegal queries and went to the FISA courts to report them. However, John Carlin, the former head of the National Security Division of the Justice Department, tried to get Rogers fired for being honest with the court. Carlin also filed a false certification to defy the court, which was later accused of institutional lack of candor by Judge Collier.  The guest believes that the declassification of documents will reveal more about the Obama administration's use of intelligence agencies and the targeting of opponents. He also thinks that Christopher Wray and Gina Haspel are preventing the declassification from happening, but that Bill Barr has the authority to bypass them. The guest concludes that the swamp needs to be drained, and the truth needs to come out to expose the corruption and restore control over the country.\nDocument 93\nMississippi Mayor Maurice Howard is facing 100 years in prison and $25,000 in fines after being arrested and charged with embezzlement. Howard, the mayor of Aberdeen, allegedly stole nearly $3,500 from taxpayers by depositing city funds into his personal bank account for trips he did not attend. Investigators also found that Howard used a city vehicle for personal travel and should repay the city for unused hotel rooms and conference registration fees worth over $2,000.  The charges against Howard include five counts of embezzlement, with the alleged incidents occurring in 2016 and 2017. Howard has denied the allegations, claiming he is not a thief and that the charges are a result of a personal vendetta. However, an investigation by the State Auditor's Office alleges that Howard deposited city funds into his personal bank account and used a city vehicle for personal travel.  This case is part of a larger trend of embezzlement cases in Mississippi, with two Smith County clerks, Helen Bounds and Justine Middleton, also being charged with embezzling over $20,000 each. The State Auditor's Office has noted that these cases are similar to others across the state and has called for voters and government employees to be on the lookout for similar schemes.  Howard has refused to step down as mayor, despite the charges against him. The case is ongoing, with Howard facing up to 100 years in prison and $25,000 in fines if convicted.\nDocument 94\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry plan to move to Los Angeles after President Trump leaves office, but until then, they want Canadian taxpayers to cover their security costs. However, a new poll shows 73% of Canadians do not want to pay for their security.   The couple's decision to move to Canada has been met with controversy, with many questioning their motives. Markle has been openly critical of President Trump and has been accused of using charity as a photo opportunity.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been secretive about his schedule, with many criticizing him for not being transparent. Trudeau's office had previously promised to make his daily schedule public, but it appears to be a pale imitation of one.   Meanwhile, conflicting reports have emerged about the Obamas' involvement in the royal transition and a top donor to the Clinton family, Frank Giustra, has denied owning a $14 million Canadian mansion that was loaned to the royal couple.   The issue of whether Prince Harry and Markle will receive public funds when they live in Canada remains unclear, with Trudeau saying that the federal government has not been involved in discussions about their potential cost to taxpayers.\nDocument 95\nThe video of Joe Biden touching women and children inappropriately has been circulating online, but the New York Times' technology reporter, Neil Perlroth, dismissed it as \"alt-right fake news.\" However, the Free Thought Project reported on this issue before, and it's not new. In fact, the U.S. House of Representatives has spent $15 million in taxpayer funds to settle sexual misconduct lawsuits in the last decade. Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, stated that the process for victims to file complaints is flawed, requiring them to sign non-disclosure agreements and not being represented by counsel.  A former Secret Service agent assigned to Vice President Joe Biden claimed that the service often had to protect female agents from him, and that he would grope women and children. The media's attempt to cover up the alleged crimes of D.C.'s elite is evident, as seen in a recent episode of C-SPAN's Washington Journal, where a caller was cut off when discussing pedophilia and dropped a few names.  President Trump has been attacked for his alleged crimes, but the media remains silent on the issue of Joe Biden's alleged misconduct. The question remains, why is the media silent on this issue, and why do taxpayers have to pay for the indiscretions of politicians?\nDocument 96\nThe speaker claims to have received a message from God, stating that America will retaliate against a terrorist act, but God warns that the retaliation will not be right and will be a wrong decision. God says He will prevent many deaths by causing a security measure to happen. The speaker also mentions a future president who will be elected and will pray, but will not be a praying president initially. God will baptize him with the Holy Spirit and power.  The speaker sees a vision of a president who will have no fear and will make decisions quickly. He also sees a future where America will experience rapid restoration due to a source of energy and medical breakthroughs. God says He will bring a woman who will pour oil of healing on the nation, and the healing will begin rapidly.  The speaker senses a strong presence of hatred and bitterness in the United States and prays for God to deliver the nation from this enemy. He also senses a strange infiltration that will come upon the nation, and God warns Canada to keep its shield up.  God says He will pay a visit to North Korea and is tired of the leader's actions. The speaker is on his way to New York, where God has led him, and he shares that Donald Trump has announced his candidacy for president with the motto \"Make America Great Again.\"  The Spirit of God says a divine acceleration is taking place in the nation, and some are weeping and crying, but God is protecting the nation through His prophets and apostles. God says His gatekeepers are the apostles and prophets in hiding, and a fresh flow of the Spirit is coming from an open heaven and an open tomb.  God says He will arise and take the children and grandchildren of believers and give them a double portion of what they had. He also says He has young men and women who do not want to hide under the armor of Saul and will use them to bring down the force of hell\nDocument 97\nThe Spirit of God is sounding the trumpet of victory, warning of impending events in the Middle East. The Lord will raise up the Trump to become a trumpet, and Bill Gates will open the financial gate for the church. Israel will not be destroyed, but its enemies will become friends and protectors. Iran will try to destroy the God of Israel, but God will stop them. North Korea will rise up against Iran, and they will implode from within. The Lord will expose corruption in Geneva, Switzerland, and Europe, and will take down the United Nations for standing against His people.  The enemy, ISIS, has infiltrated the United States, but God will use His prophets and priests to raise a voice and make a sound. The Lord will expose Jihadi John and other terrorist leaders, and will bring light to nations in obscurity, including Ukraine and Estonia. Russia will be brought to its knees by a small nation, and the Lord will expose the corruption in Iran and the Middle East.  God will use a cell phone to expose the truth and bring down the enemy. The Lord will have the last laugh, as He exposes Russia's alliance with Iran, Syria, and other nations to strike at the Jews and Christian nations. The church in China is growing, and the Lord will pour out unimaginable favor upon His people, healing bodies and raising the dead. Signs and wonders will occur, and the Lord will begin in China, then move through Iran and the Middle East, and finally flame the United States again under a righteous president.  The Lord is grieved by the bitterness and corruption in the hearts of Americans, and is calling for lone voices to cry out to Him, saying \"let my people go.\"\nDocument 98\nHost of Southern Perspectives reveals the contents of envelopes that were sent to viewers. The envelopes contained handwritten notes from Donald J. Trump, William Barr, and John Durham. The notes read \"It's over\" and were a jaw-dropping response from those who received them. William Barr appointed John Durham to investigate the dirty dossier, and Durham is currently investigating Hillary's email server. The notes also mention that Epstein is facing conviction for sex crimes and sex trafficking, with Bill Clinton involved.

The email was meant to gauge public opinion, but the results were embarrassing for Wasserman Schultz, with 46% of respondents opposing impeachment and 54% supporting it. This comes as House Democrats approved two articles of impeachment against President Trump.  Meanwhile, a federal court-ordered hearing is taking place today against Imran Awan, a former IT aide to Wasserman Schultz. Awan and his family were banned from the House computer network in 2017 after an investigation found unauthorized access and falsified procurement records. Wasserman Schultz kept Awan on her staff despite the ban, and he was later arrested trying to board a flight to Pakistan.  Judicial Watch is pursuing the release of documents related to the Awan Brothers IT scandal, which implicates national security and involves a cover-up by House Democrat leadership. The scandal includes allegations of leaked secret data and a missing server. The DOJ has been slow to produce records, citing technical difficulties and a related sealed criminal matter.\nDocument 100\nChris Marcus from Arcadia Economics is joined by Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital at the New Orleans Investment Conference. They discuss the current state of the economy and the Federal Reserve's policies. Peter Schiff believes that the Fed has given up on shrinking its balance sheet and is now expanding it again, which means there is no exit strategy from the current economic situation.  Schiff argues that the Fed's policies are a form of quantitative easing infinity, where interest rates will stay near zero forever or even go negative. This will lead to inflation running rampant and the dollar becoming a bottomless pit. He predicts that gold will go through the roof when the markets realize that there is no shrinking of the balance sheet.  Schiff also discusses the idea that the Fed is not going to default on its promises, but rather create more money to pay off debts. He believes that this will lead to an appreciation of the currency, not a debt default. However, he thinks that the dollar will be the biggest casualty of this whole thing.  The conversation also touches on the idea that the Fed's statements are not genuine, but rather propaganda to keep the economy afloat. Schiff compares the Fed's actions to a person who is addicted to heroin and can't quit, even though they know it's bad for them.  Schiff also mentions that he has been saying for years that the Fed's policies would lead to this outcome, and that he has been warning people about the dangers of fiat currency. He believes that the time is coming when the Fed's credibility will be lost, and people will rush to gold and other safe-haven assets.  In terms of investing, Schiff recommends buying gold and other precious metals as a way to preserve wealth. He also suggests setting up a gold money account or investing with his company, Euro Pacific Capital.\nDocument 101\nThe video discusses why the speaker believes Barack Obama is the shadiest person to ever run the country. The speaker points out several instances where Obama lied, including claiming to be Christian when his name is Barack Hussein Obama, suggesting he is probably Muslim. The speaker also mentions Obama's association with Louis Farrakhan, a man who preaches death to white people, and his trip to Ukraine to look at a weapons silo as a junior senator.  The speaker then discusses Obama's alleged involvement in training ISIS, his comment on live TV about speeding up training of ISIL forces, and his \"hot mic\" comment about being more flexible after the election. The speaker also mentions the Fast and Furious program, which allowed hundreds of guns to be trafficked across the border into Mexico.  The speaker then discusses the connection between Obama and a radical imam from Brooklyn, Siraj Wahaj, who has ties to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The imam spoke at Obama's 2012 DNC, and the speaker suggests that this is a big deal because the rate of mass shootings tripled under Obama.  The speaker also discusses Obama's alleged gay relationships, including a claim by Larry Sinclair that Obama had a sexual relationship with him. The speaker also mentions that Obama's wife, Michelle, is a trans woman, although this is not confirmed.  The speaker then discusses Obama's appointment of Michael Taylor, a former Monsanto executive, as head of the FDA, and his signing of the Monsanto Protection Act, which protects genetically modified seed patents from litigation over health risks.  The speaker also discusses Obama's real feelings on illegal immigration, which seem to be contradictory to his current position. The speaker suggests that Obama has a history of talking out of both sides of his mouth and that his entire life is a lie.  The speaker then discusses Obama's birth certificate, which was released in 2011, and how it was immediately disputed by\nDocument 102\nDr. Dave Janda discusses the Deep State's recent setbacks. A federal court ruling dismissed a Democratic National Committee civil suit against Julian Assange, exposing the Russiagate conspiracy theory as a fraud. The ruling also upheld Assange's status as a journalist and publisher. Additionally, Judicial Watch obtained Bruce Ohr's 302 forms, which show an irregular effort by the FBI, Department of Justice, and State Department to dig up dirt on President Trump.  The Deep State is also facing challenges from other fronts. The Mueller investigation was chastised by a federal judge, who ruled that there were no ties between Russian troll farms and the Russian government. Furthermore, Joseph Massoud's attorneys claim that their client was working for the CIA, not the Russian government, contradicting the Mueller report.  Dr. Janda also discusses Hillary Clinton's emails, which were forwarded to a private Google email address featuring the name of a Chinese company, Carter Heavy Industries. This raises questions about the security of Clinton's email server and potential ties to China.  The Deep State is also facing backlash over a satirical movie called The Hunt, which was pulled due to public outcry. The movie's producer, Jason Blum, is an acolyte of Harvey Weinstein, a globalist and deep state player with ties to Israeli intelligence, Mossad.  Dr. Janda also discusses Joe Biden's latest gaffe, in which he said that poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids. He also mentions the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death, which is still shrouded in mystery.  Dr. Janda concludes by saying that the Deep State has had a very bad week and month, and that more declassification and information is coming forward. He encourages viewers to join his subscription service to support his platform and stay informed about the latest developments.\nDocument 103\nMatthew's second DNFM report for October 5, 2019, discusses several significant events. The US government has activated reserve components in the Marines for active duty in support of civilian authorities, possibly in preparation for riots. This comes as Democrats and Socialists make claims about arresting Republicans and removing the President.   Matthew also shares articles on rising domestic ISIS arrests, terror arrests doubling since 2018, and anti-terror police taking over a Paris knife attack case. Additionally, he mentions the impeachment process moving forward without facts, Ukraine's prosecutor general reopening Biden cases, and riots in Baghdad resulting in 100 deaths and thousands injured.  Other headlines include six elephants dying in Thailand while trying to save each other, the Washington Post calling out Adam Schiff for lying about a whistleblower, and a possible Hillary Clinton run in 2020. Matthew encourages patriots to stand tall and support military vets, ending with a message of hope and a call to action.\nDocument 104\nJussie Smollett's hoax crime case has taken a surprising turn as Cook County, Chicago, dropped all charges against him. This has raised several questions, including whether Valerie Jarrett and Obama pulled strings to get the charges dropped and if there was a backroom money deal. Rahm Emanuel, a former Chicago mayor, expressed his disappointment, stating that the decision was a whitewash of justice and sends a message that those in power get treated differently.  It's reported that Jussie Smollett paid $100,000 in bail, with $10,000 coming from him directly. The remaining $90,000's source is unknown. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Push nonprofit coalition was also involved, with Jussie allegedly performing community service for the organization.  The speaker questions whether a powerful political gang pushed for Smollett's release, citing a hypothetical scenario where a real assault occurred and the perpetrators would have faced harsher consequences. The speaker names several individuals involved in the case, including Obama, Jesse Jackson, Valerie Jarrett, Tina Tichen, Kim Fox, and a judge who allegedly had a part in the cover-up.  The case has sparked concerns about corruption and the treatment of the rich versus the poor in the American justice system. The speaker plans to analyze the players involved in the hoax cover-up in a future segment.\nDocument 105\nRepresentative Doug Collins sent a letter to Attorney General Barr expressing concern over the Department of Justice's declination to prosecute leaks of classified information. Collins cited the case of an FBI Deputy Assistant Director who leaked information to the media, which was disclosed in an Office of the Inspector General report. The report found that the DAD engaged in unauthorized conduct, including disclosing law enforcement sensitive information to the media and accepting a gift from the media. However, the DOJ declined to prosecute the case.  Collins also sent a letter to Inspector General Horowitz, asking for answers to several questions regarding the leak investigation, including whether Peter Strzok, a former FBI counterintelligence agent, was the DAD referenced in the report. Collins expressed frustration that the DOJ declined to prosecute the case and called for transparency and accountability in the investigation.  The letters were also sent to Jerry Nadler, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and were made public on the House Judiciary Committee's website. Collins' actions were praised by the host of Truthfication Chronicles, who encouraged viewers to support Collins and to demand answers from the DOJ and the IG.  The host also discussed the issue of leaks and the need for accountability in the intelligence community. They argued that the mainstream media and the intelligence community have an incestuous relationship and that this needs to be broken in order to restore the rule of law. The host also mentioned that they believe that the CIA and other intelligence agencies have been working with the mainstream media to shape public opinion and to discredit individuals who they deem to be a threat.  The host also mentioned that they believe that the release of documents from the D-class will be a game-changer and that it will reveal more information about the corruption and abuse of power in the intelligence community. They encouraged viewers to be patient and to continue to demand answers from the DOJ and the IG.\nDocument 106\nThe EMP Shield is a device that protects against electromagnetic pulses, coronal mass ejections, lightning, and power surges. It has been tested at a federally approved DoD testing facility and can withstand over 40 EMP strikes with zero degradation. The device is also one of the world's strongest surge protectors and works in less than one nanosecond.  In other news, a lawsuit has been filed by attorney Ty Clevenger listing Ellen Ratner, a Fox News producer, as a source for Seth Rich murder investigation. Ellen's brother, Michael Ratner, was Julian Assange's attorney, which raises questions about her involvement in the case. The lawsuit also alleges that Julian Assange paid individuals for information, which will be discussed further at 3:30 PM Central Standard Time.  The host also discusses various other news stories, including the spread of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the sanctions against Turkey, and the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking case. He also mentions the potential for a game-changing announcement in the Seth Rich lawsuit and encourages viewers to stay tuned for more updates.  The host also promotes his website, shtfandgo.com, and the EMP Shield, offering a discount code for viewers to use. He signs off by thanking viewers and encouraging them to support veterans and patriots.\nDocument 107\nSir Bill Cash, a member of the House of Commons, discusses the UK's Brexit situation with an interviewer. He emphasizes that motions in the House of Commons are not the same as acts of Parliament, and the government cannot exercise its powers to frustrate Parliament's intentions. Cash highlights that the Withdrawal Act contains the repeal of the European Community Act 1972, which applies to all laws, and that the Parliament has made its views clear, not wanting a no-deal Brexit. He also mentions that a motion is not the same as something with legal effects, and that the law of the land is clear: the UK is leaving the European Union.  Cash expresses his concern that the government is trying to impose conditions on the Brexit process, which would be unlawful. He notes that every time the government asks for an extension, it costs the British taxpayer \u00a312 billion. He also criticizes the interviewer for not understanding the law and the implications of Brexit.  Cash then discusses the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal, citing the Brady Agreement for an invisible border in Europe. He believes that the Prime Minister is wasting her time with these questions and is deceiving the people of Great Britain. He also mentions that the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has been inconsistent in his views on Brexit.  Cash concludes by emphasizing that the law of the land is clear, and the UK will leave the EU on April 12th, reverting to WTO rules. He criticizes the demonization of Brexit by the media and some politicians, and signs off the conversation.\nDocument 108\nThe Holocaust is a topic of much debate and controversy, with some questioning the widely accepted figure of 6 million Jewish deaths during World War II. However, the speaker emphasizes that one life lost is important, regardless of the numbers. They point out that other countries suffered significantly higher losses, including Germany (7-9 million), China (20-50 million), Russia (24 million), and the Dutch East Indies (3-4 million). The speaker suggests that the focus on the Holocaust may be due to its use as a justification for the establishment of Israel, which they claim was motivated by a desire for a military base in the Middle East. They argue that the truth should be open to investigation and that the world should not be restricted from questioning or criticizing Israel. The speaker concludes that the world will remain on the edge of hostility as long as the truth is suppressed.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Leaks and Whistleblowers (Document: 100, 102, 105, 106): Mentions the release of classified information and the role of whistleblowers.\n    [2] Election and Politics (Document: 99, 103, 104): Mentions the impact of politics on elections.\n    [2] Propaganda (Document: 100, 105, 106): Mentions the use of media to shape public opinion.\n    [2] Government and Politics (Document: 99, 103, 104): Mentions the involvement of government officials in politics.\n    [2] Politics and Economy (Document: 100, 103): Mentions the impact of politics on the economy.\n    [2] Government and Economy (Document: 100, 103): Mentions the involvement of government in economic policies.\n    [2] Holocaust (Document: 108): Mentions the controversy surrounding the widely accepted figure of 6 million Jewish deaths during World War II.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 99, 102, 104, 105): Mentions the involvement of government officials in scandals.\n    [2] Government and Media (Document: 100, 105, 106): Mentions the relationship between government and media.\n    [2] Brexit (Document: 107): Mentions the UK's decision to leave the EU.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 102, 105, 106): Mentions the alleged involvement of government agencies in conspiracies.\n    [2] Media and Politics (Document: 100, 105, 106): Mentions the role of media in shaping public opinion on politics.\n    [2] Election Interference (Document: 99, 103, 104): Mentions the impact of politics on elections."}
{"summary":"Document 109\nPresident Trump announces several critical actions to confront the national security crisis on the US southern border. He emphasizes the need for border security due to the flow of drugs into the country. Trump also discusses his trade deal with China, which he believes will be great for both countries. He mentions that China has agreed to put fentanyl on its list of deadly drugs, with a criminal penalty of death.  The video then shifts to discussing the UK's potential martial law after Brexit. It's suggested that the Global Economic Security and Reformation Act (GESARA) will be enforced, leading to the collapse of the cabal-stroke deep state military industrial complex and their financial capital, the City of London.  The Earth Alliance is willing to do whatever it takes to begin the transition, including the RV (revaluation) of currencies. The RV is expected to begin at any moment, kicking off the transition. The video also mentions the end of the cabal financial system, with the New York stock market on the brink of collapse.  Additionally, it's reported that Tony Blair has been arrested, according to a reliable Alliance source. Blair was believed to be on a chartered flight to Montserrat for further interrogation prior to being sent to Gitmo.  Benjamin Fulford also appears in the video, discussing the US government shutdown and the defaults of the US government. He believes that the shutdown is phase two of a long-standing narrative to hide something behind the scenes. Fulford also mentions the Pentagon's budget and the reduction of drug money due to the legalization of marijuana.  The video concludes with Tanya Alvin thanking her subscribers and emphasizing the exciting times ahead, with huge changes expected over the next few months.\nDocument 110\nThe video discusses a conspiracy theory surrounding Joan Rivers' death. In 2014, Joan Rivers told TMZ that Michelle Obama is transgender, which some believe led to her death after a routine surgery a few weeks later. The top comment on Melissa Rivers' Instagram post about this incident suggests that Obama had Joan killed for speaking the truth. What's interesting is that Melissa Rivers liked this comment and also opened a wrongful death suit, claiming her mother's death was preventable. The video also touches on the idea that Joan's death might have served another purpose, such as preventing potential support for Trump from Hollywood celebrities. The video also mentions the high number of celebrity deaths between 2015 and 2017, which some believe was orchestrated by the deep state.\nDocument 111\nThe speaker emphasizes the importance of protecting national sovereignty and independence. They discuss the central bank's plan to create a new global empire, with the Bank of England's Mark Carney proposing a synthetic hegemonic currency to reduce reliance on the US dollar. The speaker explains the concept of a global reserve currency and how it creates an artificial demand for the issuing nation's currency.  The US dollar's dominance is seen as a problem, as it allows the US to borrow and spend recklessly without suffering immediate consequences. Economist Robert Triffin's dilemma explains that global reserve currencies never last forever, and the US is eventually expected to become so indebted that other countries will abandon the dollar.  The speaker notes that pressure has been building to reduce dependency on the US dollar, with countries like Russia, China, and India looking for alternative approaches. They discuss the regulatory climate around the world, with 50 governments engaged in discussions with Ripple, a company that views cross-border payments as a practical use case for digital assets.  The speaker highlights the risks of the US dollar losing its reserve currency status, but notes that it's a long-run thing and it's hard to see the dollar not being the reserve currency for quite some time. They also discuss the potential for digital assets to solve the problem of trapped capital in the traditional correspondent banking system.  The conversation also touches on the topic of the Federal Reserve and its relationship with President Trump. The speaker suggests that Trump's attack on the Fed is a signal that he's prepared to go after the Federal Reserve System, which is seen as the problem. They also discuss the deep state and central bankers pushing their agenda, but note that the patriots are on the winning side, as they are on the offensive, while the deep state and central bankers are on the defensive.\nDocument 112\nMichael Pento, a financial expert, joined Chris Mark on the Arcadia Economics show to discuss the recent Fed meeting and its implications for the economy. Jerome Powell announced that interest rates will likely never be raised again, citing the Fed's 2% inflation target. However, Pento argued that the Fed's measurement of inflation is flawed and that the dollar is weakening.  Pento also discussed the ECB's new head, Christine Lagarde, who he believes is a hawk and will prioritize inflation control. He noted that the dollar tanked after her comments, and gold soared. Pento also mentioned a tweet from Donald Trump, which led to a trade deal and a subsequent surge in the dollar.  Pento emphasized that the real issue is not the trade war, but rather the global state of anemia, characterized by high debt, demographics, and asset bubbles. He believes that the stock market is overvalued and that growth is hampered by the $255 trillion global debt.  Pento's model suggests that the credit market will freeze, leading to a stock market crash. He recommends a hedged portfolio to ride out the wave of euphoria and volatility. Pento also discussed the gold market, noting that the actual numbers support a higher price, potentially above $6,000 an ounce.  Pento cautioned that investors should not invest solely based on headlines and that a diversified portfolio is essential. He recommended having a minimum of 5-10% of physical gold in one's possession and overweighting gold and silver when falling real interest rates and a falling US dollar are observed.  Pento expressed skepticism about silver, stating that it's not his favorite investment at the moment, but rather physical gold. He believes that silver is an industrial component and that its price will rise when global growth accelerates, particularly in emerging markets.  Pento concluded by inviting listeners to visit his website, pentoport.com, for a free\nDocument 113\nHello everyone, welcome to this YouTube video with Frank26. Today, we're discussing the Iraqi Dinar investment, and I want to emphasize that this is a speculative investment, and I don't know the exact date or rate.   Recently, there were meetings between the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) and various agencies, where they discussed the International Exchange Department. The CBI mentioned that this department is coming soon, which could be related to exchanging currency outside of Iraq. This is a new development, and it's not clear what it means yet.  Frank26 also discussed the new small category notes and coins that the CBI is introducing. He believes that these new notes and coins are part of a larger plan to increase the purchasing power of the Iraqi currency. The CBI has also mentioned that they will be adding value to the currency, but they haven't given a specific date.  Frank26 also talked about the Trade Bank of Iraq, which apologized for a glitch that occurred at their ATM machines. The glitch caused some customers to not receive their money, but the bank has since resolved the issue and is returning the money to the customers' accounts.  Additionally, Frank26 discussed the recent developments with China and Donald Trump. China has signed a $1.4 billion contract for the reconstruction of Iraq, and Frank26 believes that this is a significant development that could impact the Iraqi Dinar.  Overall, Frank26 is excited about the developments in the Iraqi Dinar market and believes that there are many positive changes happening. He encourages viewers to stay informed and to be patient as the situation unfolds.\nDocument 114\nBreaking news, another top Democrat, Louis Arroyo, has been arrested in Chicago on federal bribery charges. This is part of a wider trend of Democrat politicians being arrested, particularly in the Chicago area, with close ties to Michael Madigan, a top Democrat and close ally of Obama. Arroyo, the assistant majority leader in Springfield, is accused of offering a $2,500 monthly bribe to a state senator in exchange for sponsoring his legislation. The state senator, who wore a wire for the feds, secretly recorded conversations with Arroyo, including one where he allegedly planned to make monthly payments to the senator from six months to a year.  This is the latest in a series of arrests and FBI raids targeting Chicago Democrats, including Alderman Ed Burke, State Senator Thomas Cullerton, and Alderman Kerry Austin. Many of these politicians have close ties to Madigan, who is under investigation for corruption. The FBI has also raided the homes and offices of State Senator Martin Sandoval and a slew of public officials from the southwest suburbs.  The raids are tied to Madigan's son, Andrew, who works for a financial company that has contracts with several municipalities that were targeted by the FBI. The company, Alliant\/Mesereau, has been raking in insurance business from local governments, including McCook, Lyons, Schiller Park, and Summit. The federal raids are part of a sweeping corruption probe, with federal agents investigating the local governments and their ties to Madigan's son and his company.  The investigation has been spearheaded by U.S. Attorney John Lausch, an appointee of President Donald Trump. Lausch has been overseeing the investigation of several high-profile cases, including the use of a private email server by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the firings of James Comey and Andrew McCabe from the FBI.  Arroyo has been released on a $10,\nDocument 115\nWelcome to the Times of Industry show. I'm joined by Bill Alter, a returning guest who's known for his forthright and unfiltered opinions. Today, we're discussing the recent phase one deal and its implications for the global economy.  Bill explains the concept of the \"credit impulse,\" which refers to the expansion or contraction of credit in a fiat system. He argues that credit must always expand, and that the recent debt saturation in China will prevent it from doing so, leading to economic decline.  Bill also discusses the repo operations and the Fed's balance sheet expansion, which he believes will continue indefinitely. He notes that the Fed's attempts to normalize the balance sheet in the past have been met with market tantrums, and that they've realized they can't shrink the balance sheet.  Moving on to the election year, Bill believes that the country is divided and that the rule of law may be at risk. He thinks that Trump will be the first impeached president to be reelected and that the current Democratic candidates may not ultimately be the final candidate.  Finally, Bill discusses the price of gold, which has been rallying despite a strong stock market and a near-all-time high dollar index. He believes that gold is moving higher because people are beginning to understand that fiat currencies are credit-based and that credit will be the biggest problem.  To learn more about Bill's work, visit www.jsmindset.com.  Key takeaways:  * The credit impulse is a critical concept in understanding the global economy, and China's debt saturation will prevent credit expansion. * The Fed's balance sheet expansion will continue indefinitely, and they can't normalize the balance sheet. * The country is divided, and the rule of law may be at risk. * Trump will be the first impeached president to be reelected. * Gold is moving higher because people are beginning to understand that fiat currencies are credit-based and that credit will be the\nDocument 116\nJay, a YouTube creator, discusses his research on the Iraqi dinar and its potential revaluation. He claims that the dinar will not revalue until mass arrests take place, which he believes will lead to a global economic reset. Jay argues that the current president of the United States is not in favor of revaluing the dinar, as it would benefit corrupt individuals who have been stealing money from investors.  Jay points out that $9 billion has gone missing from Iraq, and estimates suggest that up to $100 billion may be unaccounted for. He believes that the current president will not give more money to corrupt individuals and that mass arrests are necessary to restore justice and reparations to the world.  Jay also discusses the concept of the Great Awakening, a biblical prophecy that suggests a strong delusion will be sent to people to believe a lie. He believes that this delusion may be related to mainstream Christianity and the reduction of books in the Bible from 66 to 66.  Jay concludes that the revaluation of the dinar is not about economic growth or oil contracts, but about restoration, reparations, and justice. He believes that the current president will be the start of the global economic reset, but it will not happen until mass arrests take place.  Jay emphasizes the importance of supporting the red wave and the current president, regardless of one's feelings on social issues. He believes that this is crucial for the global economic reset and the restoration of justice and reparations to the world.\nDocument 117\nWelcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings. Today's presentation is Red October for Comrade John Brennan, former director of the CIA, and the deep state. Red October refers to an information-based offensive insurgency operation directed at the deep state. This concept started with President Trump's speech at the United Nations on September 24th, where he declared war against the globalists. The speech highlighted the importance of national pride and sovereignty to every country.  President Trump's speech was a declaration of war against the globalists, and in particular, China, which is a technocracy and a deep state globalist model of democracy. China's abuses were highlighted by President Trump, as it is the business success model of the technocracy movement.  On the same day, Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry, which is not out of a position of power but from fear, weakness, and desperation. The impeachment inquiry is based on vapor, gossip blowers, and not real whistleblowers like Bill Binney, Kirk Wiebe, and Dennis Montgomery.  Real whistleblowers face consequences, such as having their doors kicked in, like Bill Binney. In contrast, the first whistleblower in the impeachment inquiry was a gossip blower with second- and third-hand information, biased against Donald Trump, and employed by the CIA. The handler of this gossip blower was John Brennan, who is the head of the snake of the deep state puppets.  The impeachment inquiry is based on vapor produced, constructed, and blown open by deep state puppets, including John Brennan. There will be more gossip blowers, but President Trump's popularity is rising, and Red October is just beginning.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 109, 114, 117): Mentions the arrest of politicians and the deep state.\n    [2] Prophecy and Economy (Document: 116): Mentions the restoration of justice and reparations to the world.\n    [2] Election and Politics (Document: 109, 115): Mentions the election year and the rule of law.\n    [2] Prophecy and Global Reset (Document: 109, 116): Mentions the concept of the Great Awakening and the global economic reset.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Corruption (Document: 109, 117): Mentions the arrest of politicians and the deep state.\n    [2] Economy (Document: 112, 115): Mentions the global state of anemia, high debt, demographics, and asset bubbles.\n    [2] Prophecy and Politics (Document: 109, 117): Mentions the declaration of war against the globalists and the deep state.\n    [2] Prophecy and Economy (Document: 116): Mentions\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Control (Document: 109, 117): Mentions the deep state and its control over the government.\n    [2] Iraq Politics (Document: 113, 116): Mentions the Iraqi Dinar and its potential revaluation.\n    [2] Prophecy and Immigration (Document: 109): Mentions the flow of people into the country.\n    [2] Trade (Document: 109, 111, 115): Mentions trade deals and the global economy.\n    [2] Gold (Document: 112, 115): Mentions the price of gold and its potential to rise due to credit-based fiat currencies.\n    [2] Immigration (Document: 109, 114): Mentions the flow of people into the country and the arrest of politicians related to immigration."}

They point out that these individuals have been absent from public appearances and social media, with their accounts seemingly inactive. The host suggests that this could be due to their arrest or detention, and that the government might be running their accounts to keep this information secret.   The host also mentions the appointment of 95 federal judges by Trump, with many more to come, and predicts that Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be replaced soon. They believe that the Obama-era judges and Department of Justice must be removed before any prosecutions or tribunals can take place. The host speculates that William Barr and George W. Bush might be working with Trump to bring down the \"deep state.\"\nDocument 120\nThe speaker discusses the $22 trillion US debt, claiming it's fake currency not backed by silver or precious metals as the Constitution intended. They argue the Federal Reserve, which issues this currency, is bankrupt and owes over $2 quadrillion in debt. The speaker claims to have put liens on the Federal Reserve and is working to wind it down as part of a global currency reset.  The reset is a coalition effort involving people worldwide, including military powers, to shift from fake paper money to precious metals. The speaker believes this transition has a 90% chance of success, citing a power transition model from the National War College.  The speaker also discusses the 9\/11 attacks, claiming they were fabricated to distract from the military's lost budget. They believe the buildings were demolished to hide gold stored beneath them, which is now being recovered.  The speaker reassures listeners that entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare will remain in effect during the transition. They plan to work slowly and peacefully to decentralize and let people know the actual reality, eventually replacing fake paper money with precious metals.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of staying calm and realizing the real attack is the attempt to confuse people. They believe communities will figure out how to take care of their own people once they're in charge, and the global currency reset is a step towards decentralization and a more equitable world.\nDocument 121\nDavid Morgan discusses the current market trends on The Morgan Report. The US dollar has reached a two-year high, putting pressure on the gold market. However, copper is handling the pressure better than gold, indicating a possible shift in the economy. Morgan emphasizes the importance of debt, stating that US institutions and government entities hold the lion's share of the US debt, not foreign holders.  He also discusses the upcoming financial crisis, citing Charles Hughes Smith's article that the next crisis won't be caused by fraud but by the sheer fact that the system is based on a lie. Morgan believes that the government and banks may try to come to the rescue, but it's uncertain whether it will work.  Morgan highlights several indicators of a contracting economy, including more stores closing, such as Pier 1 Imports, and the rise of online shopping. He also mentions the potential for a global food crisis due to weather conditions and the African swine fever disease.  On the gold front, Morgan discusses how central banks are buying gold to chip away at the US dollar's role as the reserve currency. He believes that the dollar will not be the reserve currency forever and that there will be more pressure on the dollar, leading to increased pressure on gold.  Morgan advises his audience to be cautious and prepared for the upcoming economic changes, including the potential for food price increases and a shift in the gold market. He encourages his audience to take a long-term outlook and be prepared for the ongoing currency crisis.  The Morgan Report offers a paid service that provides in-depth analysis of the financial markets, metals price forecasts, and special reports on resources and wealth preservation. David Morgan's mission is to teach and empower people to understand the benefits of an honest monetary and financial system.\nDocument 122\nThe speaker, who used to work as a nightclub doorman for a triad gang in Hong Kong, discusses the topic of foreigners joining the triads. He clarifies that there are no white triads or foreign triads in the classical sense, but rather a group of Westerners who work closely with the triads, often in exchange for a better life.  The speaker shares his own experiences and those of others, including a South African man named Drick who was rescued by the triads and became a key figure in their operations. Drick would use a secret cough code to communicate with other expats, and the speaker eventually discovered that this code was used to signal to other triad members.  The speaker also mentions a Westerner who wrote an article about his experiences with the triads, including his involvement in the \"foreign triad\" clique. This clique was made up of Westerners who ran errands for the 14K triad gang, including drug running and prostitution.  The speaker reflects on his own experiences and how they relate to the topic of the foreign triad. He notes that he was unaware of the extent of the triads' involvement with Westerners until he read the article, and that he was able to piece together the truth about the foreign triad through his research.  In the end, the speaker concludes that there is no such thing as a white triad or foreign triad, but rather a group of Westerners who work closely with the triads in exchange for a better life. He notes that this phenomenon may have been specific to the 1990s and that it is unclear whether it still exists today.\nDocument 123\nRicky Gervais hosted the 77th annual Paedophile Awards, making a joke about it being his last time hosting. He poked fun at celebrities, calling them \"perverts\" and \"icons.\" Gervais mentioned the presence of notable actors like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, joking about their fear of Ronan Farrow. He discussed the theme of pedophile movies and the importance of telling the truth. Gervais also made jokes about Tom Hanks and his experiences, as well as his own wealth and comfort. He referenced the Me Too and Time's Up movements, joking about the hypocrisy of some celebrities. The segment ended with Gervais promoting his Twitter handle, \"I double underscore love underscore Trump.\"\nDocument 124\nThe speaker shares a personal experience of receiving a snow squall alert on the day of the impeachment vote, which they believe was a presidential alert system message to patriots. They connect this to Q's post on September 17th, where Q mentioned the presidential alert system with a two in brackets. The speaker believes this was a signal to use the impeachment as a way to red pill the entire country.  The speaker discusses the significance of the Q drops, which they believe are coming straight from the White House. They mention the presidential alert system and how it relates to the movie White Squall, which they believe is a metaphor for the great awakening.  The speaker also talks about the Durham report, which they believe will be a game-changer in exposing the corruption in the government. They mention that Attorney General Barr said the investigation was an intrusive one on the thinnest of suspicions, and that the report will show the extent of the corruption.  The speaker believes that the public is starting to wake up and that the great awakening is taking place. They mention that the president's speech in Michigan was a signaling of the great awakening and that the destruction of the Illuminati will take time and patience.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of the slow mass awakening of the public and the need to see the full extent of the corruption in the government. They believe that 2020 is crucial in seeing this through to the end and that the White Hats will continue to leak information to the public.  The speaker concludes by saying that the evidence is piling up and that it will continue to come out with the Durham report. They believe that the enormity of what is coming will shock the world and that it will be biblical in its scope.\nDocument 125\nThe Sharp Edge is investigating the Humpty Dumpty Institute, a UN-backed organization with ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, sits on the board of directors. The Institute claims to tackle global issues, but its true agenda may be to implement the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which focuses on global governance and control. The name \"Humpty Dumpty\" is curious, as it implies reshaping the world.  The Institute has connections to several individuals with questionable pasts, including Walter Simon Arbyb, who worked with DynCorp, a company involved in child trafficking. Another board member, Jennifer Diamond, is linked to Jeffrey Epstein through her husband, Bob Diamond, who was involved in a LIBOR rigging scandal.  The Institute's co-founder, Constance Milstein, has ties to Cooper Union, where Jeffrey Epstein attended school. Huma Abedin, a key figure in the Clinton email scandal, attended a fundraiser at Milstein's home. The Institute's Congressional Advisory Board includes several high-profile Democrats, including Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Adam Schiff.  The board also includes individuals linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and a Chinese gaming company, Perfect World. Another member, Yvette Clark, was involved in the Imran Awan scandal, which involved unauthorized access to congressional data and potential blackmailing of representatives.  The connections between the Humpty Dumpty Institute and Jeffrey Epstein, the Clintons, and other individuals with questionable pasts raise questions about the Institute's true purpose. The Sharp Edge believes that the Institute may be involved in a similar operation to Epstein's, and that it needs to be investigated.\nDocument 126\nHello everyone, I'm Deb from Truthfication Chronicles. Today, I'm discussing Julian Assange's arrest and its implications. It's no coincidence that Assange was arrested now, especially after Mueller's report and Barr's actions. The Trump campaign was spied on, and it's clear that the reason was Hillary's loss. The Russia collusion hoax was just that, a hoax.   The indictment against Assange reveals that he conspired with Bradley Manning, and it's time to bring back the nickname \"fraud\" for him. Assange will likely not reveal his source, but he'll say it wasn't Russia under oath. This will be a death blow to the Russia collusion conspiracy.  Assange has been passing himself off as a passive recipient of stolen classified info, but the indictment shows he was involved in hacking and espionage. The timing of the indictment is suspicious, and it's clear that it's not coincidental.   The indictment is for conspiring with Manning, and it mentions the executive order 13-526 signed by Barack Obama. Assange will likely be held accountable for his actions, and it's time to bring back the truth about the DNC emails.   The biggest card in the Trump-Russia collusion hoax house of cards is the DNC emails, and Assange will likely reveal that they weren't hacked by Russians. This will be a major blow to the hoax, and it's time to expose the truth.   In conclusion, Assange's arrest is a significant development, and it's time to bring back the truth about the Russia collusion hoax. The indictment against Assange reveals his involvement in hacking and espionage, and it's time to hold him accountable.\nDocument 127\nThe video discusses HR 25, a bill that aims to abolish the IRS and income tax. The speaker believes that the current tax system is unlawful and that a national sales tax administered by individual states is a more equitable alternative. They argue that the IRS and Federal Reserve are bankrupt and that the current system is a form of piracy, where certain groups of people align themselves with dark elements to rob others.  The speaker also touches on the idea that the Declaration of Independence, the original Constitution, and the Bill of Rights were designed to protect natural rights, but that these rights have been limited by the current system. They believe that the cabal, a group of powerful individuals, has confiscated human assets and limited freedom of speech, religion, and the press.  The speaker expresses frustration with the current state of the world, citing the abuse of children and the promotion of false ideologies. They also mention their personal struggles with a friend who has not reached out to them despite their past interactions.  The video concludes with the speaker expressing their desire for real change and the manifestation of the kingdom of heaven on earth. They mention that they are contemplating stopping their daily video series after reaching 3,000 videos, but are unsure of their future plans.\nDocument 128\nThe video discusses the concept of a global currency reset and the restored republic. The narrator mentions that on September 30th to October 1st, 2019, Restored Republic and Gold Standard announcements were made, along with the release of codes and 800 numbers. This was supposed to be followed by a 45-day period for redemption appointments under martial law, after which the general public would be able to exchange their currencies in banks starting from November 15th, 2019.  The narrator expresses frustration that this timeline has not been met, despite receiving periodic messages about the impending reset. They attribute this to the cabal's attempts to keep people on the edge of expectation, hoping for real change.  The narrator also discusses the history of the Federal Reserve and the scam of the monetary system, which they believe has been ongoing for centuries. They mention the House of Rothschilds and the Rockefellers as key players in this scam, and how the Federal Reserve was created to bankrupt the country.  The narrator questions the concept of everything happening now, and how this can be reconciled with the past and future. They argue that time is not just now, but also has a past and a future, and that without these, there would be no physical manifestation or life as we understand it.  The video concludes with the narrator expressing their desire to see the promises of a global currency reset and the restored republic materialize, and their hope for a world where humanity is liberated from the lies and bondage of the corruption of the money system.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Prophecy and Economy (Document: 128): Mentions the scam of the monetary system and the need for a global currency reset.\n    [2] Government and Economy (Document: 127): Mentions the current tax system and the need for a national sales tax.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 119, 125): Mentions the deep state and its involvement in government corruption.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Corruption (Document: 128): Mentions the scam of the monetary system and the need for accountability.\n    [2] Prophecy and Currency Reset (Document: 128): Mentions the global currency reset and the need for a new monetary\n    [2] Government and Prophecy (Document: 123): Mentions the presidential alert system and its connection to Q's post.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 118, 125, 126, 128): Mentions government corruption and the need for accountability.\n    [2] Prophecy and Politics (Document: 124): Mentions the great awakening and the destruction of the Illuminati.\n    [2] Election and Politics (Document: 118, 119): Mentions election and politics-related news and discussions.\n    [2] Prophecy and Global Reset (Document: 124): Mentions the global currency reset and the restored republic.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Control (Document: 124): Mentions the great awakening and the need to expose the truth.\n    [2] Government and Politics (Document: 122): Mentions the involvement of Westerners with triads and the government's role in it.\n    [2] Prophecy and Gold (Document: 121): Mentions the importance of gold and its role in the global currency reset.\n    [2] Prophecy and Gun Control (Document: 118): Mentions gun control and its connection to the great awakening.\n    [2] Prophecy and Currency Reset (Document: 128): Mentions the global currency reset and the need for a new monetary system.\n    [2] Prophecy and Immigration (Document: 128): Mentions the need for a global currency reset and the restored republic.\n    [2] Prophecy and Financial Markets (Document: 121): Mentions the upcoming financial crisis and the need for caution."}
{"summary":"Document 129\nDavid Morgan, publisher of The Morgan Report, discusses the current state of the financial markets and the precious metals sector. He notes that the stock market is in a hesitant uptrend, with utilities leading and transportation lagging, indicating potential resistance. Morgan also highlights the growing number of countries with negative 10-year yields, exceeding $15 trillion, which he believes is a sign of central banks losing control.  Morgan then focuses on the precious metals sector, noting that gold has broken through the $1,500 level and is expected to stay strong for the next 6-12 months due to global factors such as low rates, a soft dollar, trade tensions, and geopolitical tensions. However, Morgan emphasizes that the physical gold market has taken control, and the price may continue to rise as demand accelerates.  Morgan also discusses the silver market, noting that it has not confirmed the gold price movement as much as he would like, but believes it will eventually catch up. He expects silver to have a lot of catching up to do, given its current price and the historical ratio between gold and silver.  Morgan concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the truth about the financial markets and aligning oneself with reality, particularly in the precious metals sector. He encourages listeners to review their metal holdings and consider taking a more proactive approach to protecting their wealth.  Key points:  * Stock market in a hesitant uptrend, with utilities leading and transportation lagging * Growing number of countries with negative 10-year yields, exceeding $15 trillion * Gold has broken through the $1,500 level and is expected to stay strong for the next 6-12 months * Physical gold market has taken control, and the price may continue to rise as demand accelerates * Silver market has not confirmed the gold price movement as much as Morgan would like, but believes it will eventually catch up * Importance of understanding the truth about\nDocument 130\nThe speaker discusses the possibility of Tulsi Gabbard, a Hindu candidate, becoming the President of the United States. They express their personal admiration for Gabbard but question her eligibility due to her birth in Samoa. The speaker argues that, according to the Constitution, only natural-born citizens of the United States can run for president. They point out that John McCain, born in Panama to American parents, was considered a natural-born citizen, but Gabbard's birth in Samoa, a self-governing territory, raises concerns.  The speaker suggests that Gabbard's candidacy is a test subject, designed to acclimate Americans to the idea of a non-Christian, non-American-born president. They compare Gabbard's situation to Obama's birth in Hawaii and McCain's birth in Panama, highlighting the importance of birthplace in determining eligibility. The speaker also mentions the 666 gang, a conspiracy theory, which they believe is behind Gabbard's candidacy.  The speaker presents a hypothetical scenario where an American woman gives birth to a child in Russia and then tries to run for president, arguing that this would not be acceptable. They conclude that Gabbard's birth in Samoa and her support for a universal basic income make her an unlikely candidate for the presidency. The speaker expresses their sadness at having to criticize Gabbard but believes it is necessary to uphold the Constitution.\nDocument 131\nGood afternoon, I'm Catania Albin, and this is the 1st of April 2019 update. Today, I'll be discussing NESARA, GESARA, and the Global Currency Reset. The Clinton administration signed off on NESARA, but it was sequestered by the Supreme Court. GESARA was agreed to in the 2015 Paris Accords, outlining compliance obligations and strategic components of the GCR.  The Bank of International Settlements decided that as of March 29th, 2019, gold in commercial and business banks becomes cash equivalent. This is a significant step towards the GCR. 209 countries have signed off on the Paris Accord, and three conditions must be met for a nation to benefit from the GCR: be at peace with all nations, be sovereign, and have made good on all debt to others.  According to Judy Byington from the Restored Republic website, notification for Tier 4 Group B, or the internet group, private appointments, would happen right before or after Monday, April 1st. This is when banks would transition to the gold-stroke asset-backed quantum financial system. Zim holders would have 10 days to redeem their Zim before April 12th, when gold-backed digital credits would come online.  The Mueller Report, which exonerated President Trump, officially turned on the RV process at the new U.S. Treasury offices. The report would be released by April 12th, showing how it had morphed into an investigation for treason involving the Panama Papers. The RV had been released, and paymasters had been hydrated. A limited number of exchanges at low teaser rates were done on the Dinar and the Dong.  The Brexit vote effectively collapsed the Queen's City of London and Vatican Banks, taking away the cabal's last bastion of rule over the global financial system. By law, central banks were\nDocument 132\nThe host discusses a recent arrest outside a Trump rally in Dallas, where a counter-protester was caught with a gun, mask, and aerosol can. The host speculates that this incident may be connected to other suspicious events, including Nancy Pelosi's cryptic comment about wearing an orange bullet bracelet, Joe Biden's slip-up during a debate, and a CNN video suggesting that Trump's presidency will only end when he dies. The host also brings up Biden's past dealings with foreign influencers and his son's billion-dollar contracts. The host concludes that something shady is going on in Washington and that the public should be paying attention to these events.\nDocument 133\nBruce welcomes everyone to the Big Call and shares that the last couple of days have been exciting. He receives intel daily and sometimes things supersede others. He mentions that on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, they were getting good news, but now it's Tuesday and everything has started.   The activity began in Hong Kong and Beijing, with a meeting in the White House involving the President and other key individuals. They discussed new currency rates, and documents were signed. The dinar was rolled out and officially recognized in-country at a rate of $6.73. The dong was slower but moving upward, and the Zim had significant rate fluctuations.  Bruce shares that the IMF is being merged into the World Bank under the umbrella of AIIB, relocated to Laos. Banks, including Chase, are coordinating with the new QFS system and merging with other banks. ATMs in the US and Iraq will operate with new denominations of the Dinar.  SKRs (Special Knowledge Required) are being made liquid, and people are traveling to areas like Reno and Chicago to have their SKRs activated. This process involves identification through retinal scans and fingerprint activation. Tier 4 group B is getting close to their toll-free numbers being placed in the queue.  Bruce mentions that he's heard time frames for the GCR, and it's possible that they're down to the final couple of days. He recommends being cautious of other numbers and encourages people to stay with their groups or negotiate privately. He shares his vision for Rebuild America and the Veterans Retreat Network, aiming to help people in Central and South America.  Bruce concludes by thanking everyone for their support and encourages them to stay in faith. He mentions that they might be putting together a celebration call on Thursday night and thanks everyone for their understanding.\nDocument 134\nOn April 7, 2019, Iran's Khomeini urged Iraq's Abdul Mahdi to remove US forces from Iraq. Solev stated that Iraq is not a battlefield for rival players. Iraq and Saudi Arabia agreed to serve the Iraqi economy through a rapprochement. Turkey appointed a new special envoy to Iraq to resolve water issues.   In other news, the IMIS smuggled oil from Kirkuk to Iran. The ISIS leader was killed in Anbar. The Baghdad International Exhibition kicked off, featuring 12 countries and dozens of local and international companies. The event aimed to double bilateral trade between Islamic countries to over $481 billion.   Senior Under-Secretary Walid Al-Muzaewi expressed hopes for economic integration between member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. He emphasized the importance of collaboration and leveraging opportunities for sectors operating in these countries. The exhibition aimed to promote investment and publicity for products and industries of member states.   Iraq is striving to return to the Arab and Islamic course after defeating ISIS. The exhibition is a multi-sectoral forum for organizations, companies, and business people in the Islamic world, promoting investment and trade relations with Islamic countries.\nDocument 135\nAndrew Maguire, a whistleblower, claims that bullion banks are manipulating the price of gold and silver through algorithmic trading systems. They use these systems to buy and sell massive quantities of futures contracts in the blink of an eye, creating artificial price movements. This allows them to profit massively from the price fluctuations, with some making up to $80,000 per contract. Maguire alleges that this is illegal and that the banks are dictating the price on the futures market, which is against commodity law.  Maguire approached the CFTC with his allegations, and an investigation was triggered. However, the CFTC faces an uphill battle due to its poor funding and understaffing, as well as the massive lobbying efforts by the banks. The investigation is ongoing, but Maguire's claims have sparked attention and raised questions about the integrity of the gold and silver markets.  The manipulation of the gold and silver markets is a complex issue, but Maguire's allegations highlight the need for greater transparency and regulation in the industry. The use of algorithmic trading systems and the concentration of power in the hands of a few large banks creates an environment in which market manipulation can thrive.\nDocument 136\nGlobal quantitative easing reached a $2.12 trillion annual run rate by the end of 2017, with the New York Fed stepping in to help money markets. The Fed's actions are seen as emergency measures, but they can't be taken every day. The repo market has been experiencing a supply-demand imbalance, with the Fed prepared to supply liquidity but struggling to distribute it effectively.  The Fed has been conducting repo operations to reduce market strains, but there are potential strains in the funding market coming at the end of the quarter. The Bank of England's Mark Carney is calling for the creation of a new virtual currency to ease the reliance on the US dollar.  Ripple's CEO believes that digital assets can help solve the problem of trapped capital and pre-funding in the traditional correspondent banking system. XRP is a decentralized open-source asset that can facilitate international payments and reduce friction and cost.  The IMF has been supportive of central bank action, but there is a risk that central banks are running low on bullets. Ripple's on-demand liquidity solution, xRapid, uses XRP as a bridge currency to connect different fiat currencies and source liquidity from digital asset exchanges.  The Bank of England is exploring ways to enable the digital economy and empower competition while ensuring the resilience of the financial system. The ultimate test of new finance is whether it can deliver a more sustainable and inclusive future.\nDocument 137\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George, non-attorney spokesman and facilitator for Trusts Unlimited. Due to recent events in Iraq, today's conference call will be a brief overview. I've been in contact with individuals in Iraq, including an American citizen at the U.S. embassy during the assault. Two essential questions are: will there be a war with Iran, and how will this affect the re-institution of the Iraqi dinar?  I don't believe there will be a war with Iran. Iran understands that a direct military confrontation with the U.S. would be a bad decision. Their response to the death of their top terrorist was a fireworks display, indicating they know a real response would lead to severe consequences.  The situation in Iraq is stabilizing. U.S. forces will remain, and troop strength has increased. The faux parliament vote to remove foreign troops was invalid due to a lack of quorum. The death of Soleimani and al-Muhandis has sent a clear signal to Iran and Iraq, putting them on notice to sever ties with Iran and get their house in order.  The UN has threatened to push Iraq back into Chapter 7, and the IMF has told Iraq to sever ties with Iran before moving forward with the reinstitution of their currency. The U.S. has increased military presence and sanctions against Iraq and Iran.  In conclusion, the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar may be postponed but not suspended due to recent events. The Iraqi government can still issue the 2020 budget at the old rate and postpone payments for a quarter. The provocations by Iran are likely due to Iraq's movement towards resolving internal issues and no longer needing Iranian assistance.  The silver lining is that the Iranians and sympathetic Iraqi officials have been put on notice, and the U.S. military has made it clear that they will not win in their effort to postpone Iraq's full reemergence\nDocument 138\nThe question of why humans haven't returned to the moon in decades is a valid one.

On May 2nd, 2019, Judge Perrella, presiding over the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed et al. Military Tribunals, announced his reassignment effective June 2019. This comes as the next round of KSM et al proceedings begin in June.   Leonard Bucconi, a citizen journalist, witnessed the event and noted that this is not an isolated incident. The head of Gitmo was fired on April 16th due to lack of rights, and the commander of Gitmo was reassigned four days prior. President Trump transferred background investigation powers from the Office of Personnel Management to the Pentagon in April.  The restructuring at Gitmo is believed to be part of the Trump administration's efforts to prepare for future proceedings. The Department of Defense is now handling background investigations, and the construction of Gitmo is nearing completion with 1,000 beds. Q, an anonymous source, claims that Gitmo is already at full occupancy.  The reassigned judge, Perrella, has been criticized for closing proceedings and preventing the release of information, including CIA-taped recordings. The recordings were supposed to be released in January but have been delayed multiple times. The transcripts of these recordings remain unknown, and their release is expected to be a significant development in the case.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Concludes that Gabbard's birth in Samoa and her support for a universal basic income make her an unlikely candidate for the presidency.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Mentions the Constitution and censorship.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Mentions the 666 gang, a conspiracy theory, which they believe is behind Gabbard's candidacy.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Discusses the 666 gang, a conspiracy theory, which they believe is behind Gabbard's candidacy.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Concludes that Gabbard's birth in Samoa and her support for a universal\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Presents a hypothetical scenario where an American woman gives birth to a child in Russia and then tries to run for president, arguing that this would not be acceptable.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Discusses the Constitution and censorship.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Expresses their sadness at having to criticize Gabbard but believes it is necessary to uphold the Constitution.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 130): Discusses the importance of birthplace in determining eligibility."}
{"summary":"Document 140\nDavid Morgan discusses two articles on the current state of the global economy and the US dollar. The first article by Hugo Salinas Price states that the world's central banks have peaked in their monetary reserves, primarily made up of US dollars, and are now reluctant to hold on to them. This is due to the US's history of exporting inflation and printing money to make up for trade deficits. The article concludes that the dollar's heyday is over and that central banks are increasingly turning to gold as a desirable reserve asset.  The second article from Zero Hedge discusses the US's growing debt and interest expenses. Starting in 2024, all US debt issuance will be used to pay for interest on the debt, which will be a significant burden on the economy. David Morgan notes that this is a red flag and that the US's ability to pay its debt is becoming increasingly unsustainable.  David Morgan also discusses an article from Bloomberg, which reports that central banks are ditching the dollar for gold. Russia and China are leading the charge, with Russia reducing its US Treasury holdings as part of its de-dollarization drive. The World Gold Council expects another good year for central bank purchases of gold.  Finally, David Morgan discusses a speculative investment opportunity in the recycling of electronic waste, which contains valuable metals such as gold, silver, and copper. He notes that this technology has the potential to significantly improve the environment and provide a new source of valuable metals.  David Morgan concludes by promoting his newsletter, The Morgan Report, which provides analysis and insights on the financial markets, precious metals, and mining. He emphasizes the importance of honesty and integrity in the financial system and encourages readers to take a long-term outlook and bet on speculative securities.\nDocument 141\nDr. Dave Janda discusses the lack of prosecution for former FBI Director James Comey's memo leaks.  According to Janda, Comey's friend and attorney, Daniel Richman, was given special government employee status, allowing him to access classified information and leak it to the press.  Janda claims that Comey insulated himself by not directly leaking the memos, but instead giving them to Richman, who then selectively leaked portions to the press.  This selective leaking, Janda argues, is not considered gross negligence, which is the standard required for prosecution under the statute.  Janda believes that the Department of Justice, under Attorney General William Barr, declined to prosecute Comey due to concerns that they would lose the case and it would damage their ability to prosecute Comey on more serious charges, such as FISA abuse.  Janda emphasizes the importance of following the law and ensuring that prosecutions are based on solid evidence, rather than political motivations.  He encourages listeners to support his website, DaveJanda.com, for accurate and unbiased information.\nDocument 142\nHello everyone, I'm Peter of England, and I'm here to update you on the Facebook class action lawsuit.

A car suddenly appeared from the opposite side of the road and headed towards the motorcade, but was stopped by wires in the median. If not for these wires, the car could have crashed into the motorcade, potentially hitting President Trump. The incident is eerily similar to a previous event where a car attempted to crash into the motorcade. The presidential motorcade did not slow down or take evasive action, as the car was stopped in the center. The incident has raised questions about the intentions behind the car's actions and whether it was a deliberate attempt to harm the President.\nDocument 144\nHillary Clinton supported the administration of former Honduran President Lobo, whose wife, Rosa Elena Bonilla, has been sentenced to 58 years in prison for misusing $779,000 in funds between 2010 and 2014. This scheme involved using international donations and public funds meant for social programs to pay for personal expenses, including medical bills, jewelry, and tuition. Clinton's State Department had promoted the Lobo administration, saying they were fulfilling their obligations and should be readmitted to the Organization of American States.  Lobo's administration has been linked to other criminal organizations and trials in the U.S., with one of his sons pleading guilty to conspiring to import drugs into the U.S. and sentenced to 24 years in prison. A lawyer for Bonilla plans to appeal the conviction, which carries a sentence of between 58 years and 87 years.  Clinton's role in setting up the Lobo administration has been criticized, with some accusing her of rewarding the termination of Honduran democracy in 2009. Her management style at the State Department was described as creating a \"stovepipe arrangement\" that shut out non-favorable data and allowed only one viewpoint to drive foreign policy outcomes.  Lanny Davis, a close friend of Clinton's, was paid $20,000 by Lobo Sosa and over $350,000 by the interim president in Honduras. Davis and another Clinton insider, Bennett Ratcliffe, were hired as lobbyists for the coup plotters and became the regime's top representatives in Washington.\nDocument 145\nReluctant Preppers welcomes Nico Kakos, CEO of Blue Sky Uranium Corp., to discuss the future of the uranium mining industry. Nico highlights the policy changes in Argentina, enabling foreign investment in mineral resource development, making it an attractive jurisdiction for mineral exploration and development.   The uranium industry has been in a bear market since Fukushima, but the price of uranium has made a 50% move in the last year. New nuclear reactors are being built worldwide, driven by China and India, with non-traditional places like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also investing in nuclear power.   Nico emphasizes the efficiency and safety of nuclear fuel, citing that it has the smallest carbon footprint compared to other renewable energy sources. He notes that the average human being needs half a barrel of oil filled with uranium to meet their energy needs for a lifetime.  Countries like China and India are investing in nuclear power capabilities to increase their national independence of energy. Nico mentions that Argentina has a strong desire to have a domestic supplier of uranium, and Blue Sky Uranium Corp. is working to meet this demand.  The company's assets in Argentina are unique, with a large land package and a defined deposit. Nico highlights the potential for growth, aiming to increase the deposit from 23 million pounds to 100 million pounds. The company is at the exploration stage, with engineering studies to begin in the final quarter of the year.  Argentina's pro-business government supports deregulation and the development of mining, making it an attractive location for Blue Sky Uranium Corp. Nico notes that the country is stable, with a strong economy and a desire to develop its resources.  The company's competitive advantage lies in its 25-year presence in Argentina, excellent network of contacts, and timing, as the bear market has ended, and prices of uranium and vanadium are rising. Shareholders can find more information on the company's website, blueskyuran\nDocument 146\nBruce from the Big Call team updates listeners on the current situation. Iraq has passed their budget, which includes a new rate for their currency. The rates are live and fluctuating every 18 minutes. Iraq is ready for the gold-backed currency, and the US Treasury note (USTN) may be announced soon.   The US military has completed exchanges for military personnel and private individuals, with some exchanges happening around the clock. Wells Fargo has been updated to the quantum financial system, and people who exchanged a month ago are now seeing funds in their accounts.   Bruce emphasizes that the back screen rate for Zim is varying and will be determined by humanitarian projects and worthiness. He encourages listeners to consider partnering with the Big Call team for rebuilding America and veterans' retreats.   Bruce reminds listeners to be prepared for the upcoming events and to take advantage of their unique opportunity. He shares the importance of legacy and helping others. He also provides information on how to set up appointments and redemption centers, with 1896 tier 1 banks and over 7000 redemption centers in North America.   The call ends with a thank you to listeners and a reminder to stay in faith and stay vigilant.\nDocument 147\nHello everyone, I'm Peter of England, and today I'm discussing an interesting topic concerning the UK's constitution, monarchy, and politics. A recent article in the Daily Telegraph and Apple News suggests that there's a plan to save the Queen in case of no-deal Brexit riots. This is intriguing, especially considering rumors that the royal family may be given an ultimatum by \"white hat forces\" to abdicate.   Historically, the British monarchy's rule is based on the idea that if the monarch leaves their palace, it's a sign of their abdication. If the Queen decides to quit the throne, it would be an abdication of the crown.   From my perspective, this could be a gift in disguise for those who have campaigned against the monarchy and for electoral reform. The Brexit confrontation is being pointed at the Brexiteers, and it's possible that the monarchy is creating their own escape route to another country, such as Canada or Australia, as the global Zionist cabal and international banking cartel begin to crack.   This is a developing story, and I'll be discussing more on this topic in my next video, including potential massive economic reform projects worldwide. Please subscribe and like this channel to stay updated, and thank you for listening.\nDocument 148\nGood morning, I'm Big Square from Roderick.com. Today is Saturday, the 30th. I've updated the private road repo report, and it's growing rapidly. The total bailout needed for this weekend is $316.62 billion. This is not a bailout, but rather the dysfunction of the overnight lending market due to banks not trusting each other due to rehypothecation of bonds.  Martin Armstrong, a renowned expert, agrees that the banks don't trust each other and that some banks are going under. He also mentions that the way interest rates are calculated and reported in the repo market is ridiculous and that the Fed no longer uses the calculations to tell you what the rates are.  In other news, China is bracing for an unprecedented default of a massive state-owned enterprise, a commodity trader with huge silver and gold derivatives. This could be a huge deal, and the price of silver and gold could skyrocket.  In the crypto world, things are getting crazy. The obvious manipulation of the crypto markets is evident, and China is starting to crack down. IDAX, a Chinese cryptocurrency exchange, has suspended deposits and withdrawals after its CEO allegedly disappeared. This is a common tactic used by exchanges to hide the fact that they don't have the coins they claim to have.  It's essential to keep your keys in your own possession and not trust third-party exchanges with your funds. Recent data shows that even institutional traders still overwhelmingly prefer trusting others with their funds. Get your cryptos off exchanges now, as they are not long for this world.

They highlight the Patriot Beacon, a solar-powered flashlight with multiple functions, including a compass, window breaking hammer, and seatbelt cutter. The channel's host claims the deep state is panicked due to their efforts to shine a light on their activities.  The host discusses the Russian and Ukrainian hoaxes, which they believe were orchestrated by the CIA, led by John Brennan. They claim the CIA's mandate is to focus on international affairs, not domestic ones. The host references an article by Ron Paul, who questions whether the impeachment efforts against President Trump are a genuine attempt or a CIA coup.  The host argues that the CIA's actions are a form of leverage, used to gain information and control individuals. They point to the release of the unredacted transcript of the Ukrainian phone call, which showed no quid pro quo. The host also references treaties between the US and Ukraine and China, which allow for cooperation in investigating criminality.  The host criticizes John Brennan for his comments on the presumption of innocence, which they believe is a fundamental principle of the US judicial system. They argue that the deep state has been attacking this principle since 2016, using allegations and media narratives to implant seeds of guilt in the minds of Americans.\nDocument 150\nHello, Brave Awakened Ones. I'm Lady V from Higher Realm Holistics. I have a message download regarding the recent Schumann Resonance spike to 60 Hz and the significance of the number 17. According to the download, the 17% of farmers and ranchers who disapprove of Trump's job performance are likely Q, and the number 17 holds great importance.   The download revealed that it's not CERN causing the Schumann Resonance spike, but rather a takeover by the light forces. The 17 mark on the Schumann Resonance chart represents the crossover from the ethereal realm to positive 4D, higher 4D. This is a significant event, and the Schumann Resonance must have been around 90 Hz during this time.  The download also mentioned the number 144 and a video from Wages World, which shows unusual magnetic activity on Earth. The activity is not caused by the solar wind, but rather by an object interacting with the sun. The Schumann Resonance spike to 40 Hz is also not a natural occurrence, suggesting that it's caused by an external factor.  The download revealed that this event is the switchover, where the light forces took over from the dark ones. The Schumann Resonance chart shows a massive spike from 0600 to 1900, which is not a natural occurrence. This event is a significant milestone, and the Earth's heartbeat has been reset to a higher frequency.  The download also mentioned the number 1111 and a video from the sixth, which shows the Earth's heartbeat. The Earth's heartbeat is compared to a 12-lead EKG, and it's always steady at 7.83 Hz. However, during the switchover event, the Earth's heartbeat was reset to a higher frequency, allowing for 5D to come\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 149): Mentions the deep state and its alleged manipulation of the US government.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 140, 144): Mentions government corruption and scandals.\n    [2] Propaganda (Document: 142): Mentions propaganda and manipulation of information.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Corruption (Document: 140): Mentions prophecy and government corruption-related topics.\n    [2] Government and Politics (Document: 140, 144, 149): Mentions government and politics-related topics.\n    [2] Prophecy and Corruption (Document: 140): Mentions prophecy and corruption-related topics.\n    [2] Prophecy and Government (Document: 140): Mentions prophecy and\n    [2] Prophecy and Government (Document: 140): Mentions prophecy and government-related topics.\n    [2] Government and Prophecy (Document: 140): Mentions government and prophecy-related topics.\n    [2] Prophecy and Election (Document: 140): Mentions prophecy and election-related topics.\n    [2] Election and Prophecy (Document: 140): Mentions election and prophecy-related topics.\n    [2] Election and Politics (Document: 140, 143, 144): Mentions election and politics-related topics.\n    [2] Prophecy and Politics (Document: 140): Mentions prophecy and politics-related topics."}
{"summary":"Document 151\nThe speaker emphasizes the importance of the Second Amendment, which grants Americans the right to keep and bear arms. They argue that this right was included in the Constitution to protect against a runaway government and to ensure individual freedoms. The founders recognized that governments can become too powerful and infringe on citizens' rights, and the Second Amendment serves as a fail-safe to prevent this.  The speaker criticizes the government for overreach and abuse of power, citing examples such as over-regulation, taxation, and the use of propaganda to indoctrinate the populace. They argue that Americans are tired of being controlled and are approaching a tipping point where they will no longer comply with unjust laws.  The speaker addresses those who support legislation restricting firearms, arguing that they are advocating for violence against innocent Americans if the state decides to disarm them. They question whether these individuals believe the state should use violence to take away citizens' guns, and point out the hypocrisy of advocating for a fascist dictator to have guns while restricting others.  The speaker emphasizes that they are not an NRA member and are not a gun enthusiast, but rather someone who understands history and trusts their government. They conclude by emphasizing the importance of individual rights and freedoms, and warning representatives that if they continue to pass overreaching legislation, Americans will not comply.\nDocument 152\nLeonard Bucani from Seavine News International is reporting live from the White House on the military tribunals at Fort Meade. The judge has suspended proceedings until a closed-door hearing can be held, where confidential matters will be discussed. The tribunals are expected to resume on Wednesday.   Yesterday, defense attorney James Cottrell III argued motions in front of the judge, representing Al Belushi, the financier behind the organization. Cottrell was under court orders not to discuss methods used by three-letter agencies to collect evidence.   A significant revelation emerged yesterday: the US government knew of the 9-11 plan prior to the attacks. Between April and October 2001, the CIA intercepted 118 calls from 25 different telephone lines, which a linguist identified as being from the people behind the plan. This information was not publicly known until now.   The news has sparked excitement among patriots, who see it as a vindication of the president and a sign that declassifications and unsealed indictments are imminent.\nDocument 153\nRoy Potter, a former U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, welcomes viewers to the Potter Expositor.\nDocument 154\nCatania Alvin discusses the ongoing Brexit situation, suggesting that Obama's visit to the UK and meeting with Merkel indicates his continued influence in the British government. Alvin believes that there are traitors within the British government, working to undermine the democratic vote of the people in 2016.   Sir William Cash raises concerns about the Prime Minister's actions, questioning whether she consulted the law officers before making critical decisions. Mark Francois comments on the failed attempt to seize the order paper, defeat of the second referendum, and revocation of Article 50.  Jeff Taylor discusses the Cooper Act, passed to prevent a no-deal Brexit, but notes that it may be toothless. The Act requires the Prime Minister to seek an extension, but does not impose any further duties or obligations. The EU could refuse the extension, or agree to it unconditionally or with conditions, rendering the Act ineffective.  Nigel Farage discusses the demand for political change, citing the Scottish example as a potential catalyst for major change. He emphasizes that sovereignty rests with the people, not Parliament, and that MPs are their servants, not the other way around.\nDocument 155\nRobert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, shares his insights on preparing for a potential financial collapse. He emphasizes the importance of owning real money, such as gold, and having a plan in place for basic needs like food, water, and shelter. Kiyosaki's \"five G's\" include gold, grub (food), gasoline, ground (real estate), and guns.  Kiyosaki also discusses the concept of risk and how it's often internal, rather than external. He advises people to practice self-discipline and to be aware of their own limitations and weaknesses. He encourages people to learn and educate themselves, rather than relying on others for financial advice.  Kiyosaki warns against taking financial advice from people who need money, such as financial planners and stockbrokers. He advises people to be cautious and to seek out qualified financial advice. He also emphasizes the importance of self-discipline and taking responsibility for one's own financial decisions.  In terms of specific actions, Kiyosaki recommends owning gold and silver, as well as having a plan in place for basic needs. He also advises people to practice self-discipline and to be aware of their own limitations and weaknesses.  The conversation also touches on the importance of financial education and the need to be cautious when seeking financial advice. Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for one's own financial decisions and being aware of one's own limitations and weaknesses.  Overall, Kiyosaki's message is one of preparedness, self-discipline, and financial responsibility. He encourages people to take control of their own financial lives and to be aware of the potential risks and challenges that lie ahead.\nDocument 156\nThe host of a YouTube channel shares a news article about a federal ruling that allows women to go topless in six states, including Kansas. The ruling was made by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, citing gender equality as the reason. The host expresses concern and disappointment, stating that this decision will likely lead to more liberal states adopting similar laws. He believes that this is a sign of the country's decline and encourages viewers to pray for the nation. The host also shares a personal message from God that he received several months ago, which speaks of America's destruction and judgment. He believes that this message is a warning and encourages viewers to turn away from their sins and repent. The host concludes by asking viewers to pray for the nation and to support his channel by liking, commenting, and sharing the video.\nDocument 157\nGlobalization has accelerated significantly over the past few decades, driven by the rise of information technology, reduced trade tariffs, and increased connectivity. Today, one billion people come online every five years, and digital platforms coordinate various aspects of the economy and society. However, the current management structure of the nation-state is inadequate to meet the demands of global networks, leading to systemic detrimental effects. Global institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF, are incomplete solutions to global governance, being piecemeal, undemocratic, and often ineffective.  The financial crisis marked a turning point, as the well-accepted truths of the free market were questioned, and multinational organizations lost influence. Nationalism expanded, and the seeds for the next era of globalization were sown. The model for globalization is transforming, driven by information and services rather than goods exchange. As 4 billion people connect to the Internet, huge flows of data and platforms have become the new architecture of globalization.  The story of globalization is one of information technologies enabling a global economic and financial system that brings humanity into a shared value system mediated by markets. The linkage between technology and institutional structures is now apparent, and the focus has shifted from physical connectivity to technology and information. The financial crisis marked an inflection point, where everything began to shift towards technology and information, paving the way for a new era of globalization.\nDocument 158\nThe video discusses the topic of gun confiscation and red flag laws, with the speaker expressing their personal opinion on the matter. They believe that individuals have the right to own guns and that the government should not be able to take them away without due process. The speaker also discusses the importance of not lying to the government and the potential consequences of doing so.  The speaker shares a personal story about a subscriber who asked for their opinion on gun confiscation, and they express their own feelings on the matter. They believe that if the government comes to their door to confiscate their guns, they will not give them up without a fight. However, they also acknowledge that resistance may not be the best course of action and that it's possible to lose in such a situation.  The speaker also discusses the FBI's statement that conspiracy theorists can be considered terrorists, which they believe is a form of fear-mongering. They argue that individuals have the right to investigate and question the government, and that this is a fundamental aspect of a healthy democracy.  The speaker concludes by encouraging their viewers to use their own judgment and to not be swayed by the government's narrative. They also emphasize the importance of having a personal relationship with God and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit in times of uncertainty.  The speaker also touches on the topic of prepping and the importance of staying safe and alert in the face of potential threats. They encourage their viewers to stay calm and to not get too caught up in the news, and to instead focus on their personal relationships with God and with each other.  Overall, the video is a personal and philosophical discussion on the topics of gun confiscation, government overreach, and the importance of individual freedom and responsibility.\nDocument 159\nMatthew from Truth Not Fiction Matters is discussing a breaking news story about Jeffrey Epstein. He claims that Epstein shared an FAA aircraft tail number with a U.S. military reconnaissance plane used for covert operations in Colombia. This allowed Epstein's helicopter to bypass border security checkpoints and potentially evade law enforcement.   According to documents filed in 2008, Epstein's helicopter and a U.S. State Department plane shared the same identification number, both being owned by the U.S. State Department and contracted to the private military company DynCorp. This raises concerns about Epstein's potential involvement in child trafficking, which was also linked to DynCorp in 2011.  Matthew also mentions other bombshell information, including a former Mexican president allowing the CIA to operate in Mexico under the Obama administration and Epstein's pilot deleting his Instagram account after Epstein's death. He emphasizes the need for further investigation into the Epstein case, which could reveal more shocking truths.\nDocument 160\nThe speaker discusses Robert Mueller, the former FBI director, and his alleged connections to the Deep State. Mueller's father was a Gestapo head, and Mueller oversaw the 9-11 investigations. After Comey's firing, Mueller was appointed as the new Deep State Protector. The speaker claims Mueller built a secret computer network and created an alternative infrastructure to circumvent Trump's authority. Mueller is seen as the operator behind the scenes, not a politician, and is a key part of the Deep State. The speaker suggests focusing attention on Mueller and his family history.   The conversation then shifts to the topic of flat earth theories, which the speaker believes is a distraction introduced by the CIA to divert attention from real issues. The speaker emphasizes that the shape of the earth is irrelevant to solving global problems such as poverty, disease, and war. The group's focus will be on addressing real issues, not getting caught up in distractions.\nDocument 161\nHello, I'm Roy Potter, a former U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel. Today, I'm discussing the censorship program by the leftist media, supported by the CIA and the intelligence community. This has led to the banning of individuals like Alex Jones, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos for mentioning their names. I believe this is a step towards a Chinese-style model of control, where people can be attacked financially and monitored for \"hate speech.\"  I want to emphasize the importance of free speech, the right to bear arms, and the protection of individual liberties. These are gifts from God, and we must stand up for them. I'm calling on President Trump to take action to support these amendments, but he has been disappointing in this regard.  I'm also discussing the concept of the \"mark of the beast,\" which is often associated with technology and control. However, I believe the real mark is whether or not we have the law of God written in our hearts and minds. I'm supporting individuals like Alex Jones, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos, who have been silenced and persecuted for their views.  I'm urging President Trump to change his tactics and examine his alliances, as he can be a Saul or a David, a Koresh or a king. God chastens those he loves, and it's time for President Trump to get on the war path and defend the Constitutional Republic.  I want to publicly state my support for Alex Jones, InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos, and I'm willing to face any consequences for doing so. I believe it's time for us to stand up for our rights and freedoms, and I'm calling on President Trump to take action to protect them.\nDocument 162\nHello, I'm Peter of England, and in this video, I'll be discussing two major constitutional considerations surrounding Brexit. Firstly, the UK is predominantly a Protestant country, whereas Europe is predominantly Catholic. This difference in religious and cultural beliefs is significant, especially considering the UK's royal family, the House of Windsor, has German roots and is part of the Holy Roman Empire, which stretches back to ancient Rome. The royal family's shift from Catholicism to Protestantism is also noteworthy, with Princess Diana and Tony Blair converting to Catholicism after leaving office.  The second consideration is the UK's common law system, which is different from the civil code system used in Europe. Common law allows for trial by jury, whereas European countries like Germany and France use a Napoleonic code system, where trials are often conducted by a single judge or a panel of judges. If the UK stays in the EU, its judicial system will likely be compromised, and the country will be subject to a European judicial system that is influenced by Masonic orders.  I'm advocating for juries to \"go rogue\" and return verdicts based on their own judgment, rather than following the law. If the UK remains in the EU, its justice system will be similar to the kangaroo courts in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. The EU will also use SWAT teams to arrest individuals who refuse to cooperate with the authorities, and people can be jailed for debt in Germany.  I urge those who voted to remain in the EU to reconsider and support a second referendum to leave the EU. The UK must take control of its own destiny and not be subject to the EU's judicial system. Thank you for listening, and I hope you'll subscribe and share this video.\nDocument 163\nThe speaker is discussing the corruption within the US government, specifically the Department of Justice, Department of State, and FBI. They mention Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton, who is seeking information and accountability from the government. The speaker expresses frustration with the government's immunity and lack of action against corruption, comparing it to the Stalinist Soviet Union. They urge President Trump to take command and use loyal military members to address the issue, as they believe the current situation endangers the country's fabric and people's lives. The speaker also criticizes Trump's advisors, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, and suggests that Trump has placed his trust in the wrong people. They emphasize the need for action and accountability, warning that if the situation is not addressed, it will lead to complete destruction.

{"summary":"Document 164\nNew York City Councilman Andy King, a Bronx Democrat, has been suspended for 30 days without pay and fined $15,000 after a 48-page ethics report found evidence of harassment, retaliation, and misuse of city funds. The report revealed that King threatened and fired staff members who cooperated with investigators, compromised an employee's medical treatment, and used city funds for a retreat to the Virgin Islands during his wife's daughter's wedding. King's wife, Neva Schillingford King, was also found to have improperly influenced hiring decisions and was given authority over King's staff.   King's behavior was described as creating a \"culture of fear\" and \"potential misappropriation of council resources.\" The council voted 44-1 to suspend King, with a motion to expel him failing 34-12. Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, called for King's conduct to be examined by criminal authorities. King's attorney plans to sue over the ethics probe, claiming that the special counsel did not provide adequate time for a defense. The council speaker, Corey Johnson, stated that the standard for expulsion would likely involve criminal charges by an outside enforcement body.\nDocument 165\nThe speaker discusses the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, labeling him a \"pig\" and a front for the deep state. Epstein's connections to politicians, Hollywood moguls, and business leaders are highlighted, with the speaker suggesting that he was used to entrap them with young girls, creating leverage for the deep state. The speaker believes that Epstein's operation was part of a larger scheme to control and manipulate individuals in positions of power.  The speaker also mentions Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate, who has ties to MI6, the CIA, and Mossad. Maxwell is seen as Epstein's handler, responsible for setting up high-profile individuals at parties where they would be videotaped with young girls.  The speaker suggests that the deep state, including intelligence agencies, used Epstein to control politicians and business leaders, forcing them to take actions that benefited the deep state. The speaker believes that President Trump will use the Epstein scandal to take down the deep state, using it as a tool to destroy the deep state's criminal enterprise.  The speaker emphasizes that the Epstein scandal is not just about one individual, but about thousands of people involved in the deep state's operations. The speaker encourages listeners to support their platform and join their \"Freedom family\" to help take down the deep state.\nDocument 166\nNamaste, beloveds. We're in the Lion's Gateway, a moment of great alignment and transformation. The Earth is experiencing an intense bombardment of gamma rays from our central sun, Alcyon, and the Sirius Stargate.

The speaker thinks Epstein might not be dead, speculating that he was either paid off or secretly taken out by the \"White Hats\" and sent to Gitmo. They point out that the Clintons were seen smiling and in good spirits after the incident, which raises suspicions.   The speaker then examines the gurney picture closely, comparing it to Epstein's actual picture and Anthony Bourdain's picture. They notice similarities between the gurney picture and Bourdain's picture, leading them to believe that the gurney picture is fake and actually from when Bourdain was found dead.   The speaker also questions the official story of Epstein's death, pointing out that it's statistically impossible for the camera to malfunction at the exact time of his death. They believe Epstein was removed from the jail, which could be good or bad, but is hopeful that it will lead to more people becoming aware of the truth.   The speaker concludes that the whole movement is making them optimistic about the future, as it's exposing the \"house of cards\" that is the current system. They encourage viewers to support their channel and share the video with others.\nDocument 168\nDr. Dave Janda discusses the efforts of the freedom movement, which are often overlooked by the mainstream media. He highlights several key events and individuals who have contributed to exposing the truth about government corruption and surveillance.   One such event is the Rolling Thunder rally, where General Tom McInerney spoke about the POW-MIA issue. General McInerney revealed that the US government has left behind thousands of men in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, with some being sent to slave labor camps. He also mentioned the recent incident in Benghazi, where four Americans were left behind.  Dr. Janda emphasizes that the deep state has existed for decades, with both Democratic and Republican administrations using it to thwart freedom-based efforts. However, he believes that the patriots have made significant progress in exposing the truth, and with the light of truth, comes restitution of every American's freedoms and liberties.  Other notable individuals mentioned in the briefing include Bill Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Admiral Ace Lyons, General Paul Vallely, Sidney Powell, and Dr. Mark Skidmore, who have all contributed to exposing government corruption and surveillance. Dr. Janda encourages listeners to tune in every Sunday to learn more about these efforts and to stay informed about the freedom movement.\nDocument 169\nHello, I'm Karen Udis, and I'm back with another episode on the Network of Global Corporate Control. Due to health issues, I've been in the hospital for two weeks, but I'm on the mend. I believe my ailments were a form of attack, but I'm recovering.   I want to discuss the issue of Jerusalem and Zionism, which has been a topic of controversy. However, I believe the real issue is the Network of Global Corporate Control, a group of bankers who print money, create conflicts, and manipulate people. They hide behind Zionists and use them to create divisions.  I'd like to talk about Barry Kamish, a Canadian journalist who discovered the murder of Rabin and a plot to kidnap Yemeni babies for experimentation. After I mentioned this to a Mossad agent, Kamish was murdered. I believe the bankers were involved in his death.  The bankers have been secretly trying to turn us against each other for thousands of years. They control the media and lie to people, but a critical mass of people are now aware of these lies, and the banking cartel is losing control. They're anxious because they've never lost their touch before, but it's only a matter of time before they go down.  Next week, I'll be back on DCTV, but I wanted to stay in touch with the critical mass of people who understand the truth. Thank you for listening.\nDocument 170\nThe speaker claims to have received a vision from God about impending danger and wickedness, which is hidden in a human mind. They saw the letters \"A\" and \"Q\" and were shown a connection between Russia and Pakistan. The vision also included a scene of fire and water, where the speaker felt surrounded by evil and prayed for America and Israel.   In the vision, the speaker saw a group of people united, with one leader chosen by God to lead the nation. This leader will thwart the enemies of Israel and the West, and there will be embarrassing moments for politicians in the upcoming elections. The speaker also saw a nation itching for war with America, but God says this will not happen in the time of President Obama, but rather when a new leader arises.  God says He is dissatisfied with both parties and will bring a new kind of war, but it will not be nuclear. The speaker was overwhelmed by radiance and fire, and fear struck them for the first time. They believe they were interceding on behalf of Israel and America, and the question arose about Armageddon and the slaughter of humanity.  The speaker claims that Donald Trump was elected because he believes in the Constitution, and that a group of generals were ready to conduct a coup d'etat against Barack Obama, but reconsidered after talking to Trump. They believe that QAnon is military intelligence close to Trump, and that the intelligence they're getting is from inside the script. The speaker concludes that Donald Trump will not be removed from office, despite what the media is saying.\nDocument 171\nThe discussion revolves around several false narratives surrounding Donald Trump, including his stance on gay marriage, racism, and border security. The host presents evidence that contradicts these narratives, such as Trump's support for gay marriage and his efforts to secure the border.   The host also discusses the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian election interference, which found no direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Despite this, the host suggests that the media and Democrats continue to push false narratives about Trump.  The conversation also touches on the topic of pedophilia in the entertainment industry, with the host suggesting that there are powerful individuals who are pedophiles and are still working in the industry. The host also discusses the idea that the mainstream media and Hollywood are complicit in covering up these crimes.  The host concludes by suggesting that people should be aware of the potential dangers of the entertainment industry and approach it with caution.\nDocument 172\nHello, I'm Roy Potter, a former U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel. I'm here to discuss the importance of exercising your Second Amendment rights. I'm not advocating for violent revolution, but rather making a statement against those who want to take away our rights. We need to align ourselves with constitutional authorities and make a concerted effort to defend our rights.  To make a statement, I encourage you to exercise your Second Amendment rights in mass by purchasing a semi-automatic firearm, such as an AR-15. This is not just about owning a gun, but about taking responsibility for your rights. If you don't have a firearm, it's time to purchase one, even if you have to borrow the money.  The goal is to make a political statement with our pocketbooks, showing that we won't stand for the threats to take away our weapons. We need to send a message to those in government and out of government that we won't be silenced. This is not just about buying a gun, but about taking action to defend our rights.  I've made the commitment to purchase an AR-15, and I encourage you to do the same. It's not about the type of gun, but about making a statement. You can get a Smith & Wesson M&P for around $500, and it's a good option for making a statement. The important thing is to spend the money and make a commitment to learn how to use your weapon safely.  We need to make a surge of purchases to show that we won't be silenced. This is not just about buying a gun, but about taking action to defend our rights. We need to be responsible and learn how to use our weapons safely. I'm not advocating for violence, but rather making a statement against those who want to take away our rights.  In conclusion, I encourage you to exercise your Second Amendment rights by purchasing a semi-automatic firearm and making a\nDocument 173\nHello, I'm Karen Hudis, the producer of this video. I'm back after a hospital stay and rehab, where I experienced corruption firsthand. I'm now producing videos privately and wanted to update you on my health. I'm grateful for your prayers and support, which have helped me continue my work.  I've learned that we're often duped by the information we receive, especially in universities where professors are often in cahoots with the Black Nobility. However, there are enough of us working together to change our reality. We've discovered the concept of the \"hundred monkey effect,\" where once a group of people understand something, it becomes manifest in reality.  We're now in a different reality because enough of us understand the truth. The reality is that we've been duped by the paper money system, which is a huge scam. The central bankers issue currency, but real money is gold and silver. We're working on a new system called Aurum, where gold is pressed into thin sheets and used as currency.  This new system will make it difficult for central bankers who don't have the gold. The gold was originally hoarded in the Vatican and then shipped to Singapore, where it was put in a trust fund called the Proclamation and Declaration of the Gift of Love. This trust fund was created by Jose Rizal and Ferdinand Marcos, who were geniuses.  The 50-year statute of limitations has passed, and now the claim to the gold is falling apart. We're working together to eliminate the paper currency corruption and bring about a new system where gold is the real money. This will make it difficult for bankers to corrupt people with paper money, and their bribery will fall away.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Hundred Monkey Effect (Document: 173): Mentions the

{"summary":"Document 174\nGood morning, I'm BigSquaredRoadDrew from BigSquaredRoadDrew.com. I'm giving up coffee for a while due to lack of sleep. I want to discuss the recent spike in silver prices on 11-11, which some people believe is a message from those in control that they can manipulate the market with a click of a mouse.   The good news is that the sentencing of J.P. Morgan whistleblowers, who were busted for manipulating the silver market, is expected to happen in December. This could lead to significant changes in the market. The indictment alleges that J.P. Morgan traders participated in a racketeering conspiracy to manipulate the precious metal markets and defraud customers.  The CFTC has been accused of ignoring the manipulation of the silver market, but now it seems that the good guys in the FBI are taking action. The civil case against J.P. Morgan is ongoing, and it's expected to be a long and complex process.  I believe that silver and gold will be the first things that big money will go to when manipulation ends in the crypto world. The gold-silver ratio will likely go one-to-one at some point, probably around $5,000. You can buy silver today at $17, and I think it's going to go one-to-one with gold.  I want to emphasize the importance of owning physical silver in your own possession, not through derivatives like SLV or COMEX futures. The Fed is printing more money and rigging the price of silver, gold, and crypto. I recommend buying silver, as it's required for our future, especially with the increasing use of electronics.  The mining companies have been destroyed, and most of the silver is above ground or near the surface. If you own gold, I suggest swapping it for silver, as you can get 86 ounces of silver for one ounce of gold. This is an insane ratio,\nDocument 175\nThe speaker emphasizes American pride and values, stating that the country is built on love and pride. They express support for the working class, wanting workers to be paid fairly, and salute the troops. The speaker asserts that America is a nation under God and will not apologize for its values, encouraging those who disagree to \"get out of the way\" as the country makes itself great.\nDocument 176\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles shares three updates. Firstly, she notes that President Biden has a 52% approval rating, with 93% support from the Republican Party, a record. She also highlights the Supreme Court's website, where she found that there were no press releases about Justice Ginsburg's health issues, despite her prolonged absence. This raises questions about the court's transparency.  Deb also discusses an article by the AP about upcoming abortion cases before the Supreme Court, including one in Indiana that requires women to undergo an ultrasound and wait 18 hours before an abortion. She argues that this law makes sense and could reduce the number of abortions, particularly those based on sex selection or fetal anomalies.  Lastly, Deb mentions an election fraud hearing in North Carolina, where 60 witnesses will testify on Monday. She encourages viewers to pray for the outcome, as it could have significant implications for other states.\nDocument 177\nThe video discusses a massive protest by German farmers in Berlin, with over 5,000 tractors participating. The farmers are protesting against the government's agricultural reform package, which aims to reduce the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides. The farmers argue that this will lead to reduced yields and lower incomes, making it difficult for them to sustain their businesses.  The protesters claim that they are being unfairly targeted by the government, while other industries contributing to nitrate pollution in the groundwater are not being held accountable. They demand honest research into the sources of nitrate pollution and argue that agricultural subsidies are necessary to prevent farms from going bust.  The farmers feel that the government has failed to consider their interests while pushing through regulations, and they are united in their opposition to the reform package. The protest is seen as a grassroots movement, with no involvement from agricultural lobby groups.  The video also touches on the broader implications of the protest, with the speaker suggesting that the government's agenda may be to promote lab-grown food and reduce the importance of traditional farming. The speaker expresses concern that climate protesters may start to target other industries, leading to widespread economic hardship.\nDocument 178\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan for the week ending February 1, 2019. David Morgan discusses the metals market, particularly gold, which broke through the $1300 level and has held since. He expects the 1300 level to be tested from a higher level, possibly around $1320.   David Morgan also discusses the copper market, expressing skepticism about its potential due to supply concerns and the impact of the electric vehicle market. He notes that Freeport-McMoran, one of the largest copper miners, saw its stock price plummet by 15% due to poor earnings.  Additionally, David Morgan touches on the financial health of Deutsche Bank, which is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system. He notes that the bank may show a profit for the first time in several quarters, but merging with another bank may not necessarily solve the problem.  David Morgan also discusses the potential impact of China's economic slowdown on global economic growth, citing an article from Market Watch that suggests the slump in global trade is a bigger threat than markets imagine. He notes that China's economic growth may be overstated due to the amount of funding money printed.  The report also mentions Venezuela's plan to sell 15 tons of gold to the UAE in exchange for euros, which David Morgan sees as a sign of the country's financial struggles. He notes that the adage \"follow the money\" is now more relevant than ever, as gold becomes a key factor in global economic transactions.  David Morgan also discusses the potential for nuclear war, citing an article from Zero Hedge that suggests Russia is warning about the increased risk of nuclear war due to the development of low-yield nuclear weapons. He notes that the threat of nuclear war is a serious concern, but not necessarily a reason to be overly concerned.  Finally, David Morgan discusses the palladium market, noting that thieves are breaking into cars to steal catalytic converters\nDocument 179\nSeveral states are moving to return to a gold standard, as allowed by the Constitution. The Constitution states that no state can print its own money, but it can make gold and silver coinage in exchange for payment of debts. Some states have already created depositories for gold and silver and will accept U.S. minted gold and silver coins, as well as silver bars and gold bullion.   In exchange, the states will give the owner a credit card worth the market value of the gold or silver, which can then be used to pay bills. Most states that have passed this legislation have also removed sales tax and state capital gains tax on gold and silver.   This move is seen as a way for states to have a gold standard, something behind the state's financial system instead of a fiat currency. It's also an incentive for people to bring their gold and silver to the state, as they won't be taxed on it.   The idea is that when the dollar crashes and becomes worthless, people will still need to pay taxes and make purchases, and gold and silver will be a valuable commodity. Some states are already accepting gold and silver, and it's recommended that people consider stacking gold and silver as a way to prepare for a potential financial reset or collapse.\nDocument 180\nPresident Trump's National Security Advisor, Robert C. O'Brien, has initiated a significant overhaul of the National Security Council (NSC) staff. The move aims to eliminate Obama-era holdovers and reduce the staff from 450 to fewer than 120 policy officials by early next year. The downsizing is expected to improve efficiency and address non-stop leaks from Obama loyalists.   The NSC staff had grown exponentially under President Obama, with officials wielding significant power and even issuing orders to military commanders in the Middle East. Leaks of President Trump's conversations with foreign leaders, including sensitive transcripts, were suspected to have originated from anti-Trump officials within the White House.  The reform is a response to the Obama-era holdovers, who were suspected of leaking sensitive information and obstructing President Trump's foreign policy agenda. The NSC staff is being reoriented to prioritize the president's needs and ensure a lean and efficient operation. The move is seen as an important step in addressing the abuse of power and preventing future coup attempts against the president.\nDocument 181\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan for the week ending December 27, 2019. David Morgan reviews the metals market for the year, noting that aluminum was down 5%, cobalt 42%, copper 3%, lead 5%, nickel 34%, tin 11%, and zinc 7%. In contrast, gold was up 15%, palladium 46%, platinum 14%, and silver 11%. The gold-silver ratio reached a high point but has since backed off. The HUI and XAU indices were up 37% and 38%, respectively, outperforming the metals themselves.   David Morgan discusses the Baltic Dry Index, which has been falling since September, indicating a decline in trade. He references an article by Charles Hugh Smith, who argues that control markets never work and that only small-scale markets enable people to make their own decisions. Morgan notes that the banking system is undergoing significant changes, with tens of thousands of jobs lost in Europe's banks due to stricter regulations and depressed market activity.  Morgan also discusses the trend towards a cashless society, citing China's social credit system and the use of WeChat for transactions. He notes that cryptocurrencies are not as anonymous as people think, as they often require registration and tracking. Russia is considering investing in gold, and Morgan notes that banks have been buying metals, with Russia being one of the world's largest gold producers.  In terms of the market, Morgan believes that gold has turned higher and that the bottom is in. He notes that the gold miners have been outperforming the metal, and that silver shares are rising faster than gold. Morgan predicts that the commodities will be stronger in 2020, while stocks will be weaker, and that oil could do well due to the energy push during the election. He also believes that the metals will do at least a 30% return at some point during the year.  \nDocument 182\nLinda Forsyth and Leonard Bakani from C-Vine News are covering the military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay. The Department of Defense has chosen alternative media to cover the proceedings, which started on January 28, 2019. The tribunals are covering five individuals, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who orchestrated the 9\/11 attacks. The tribunals are being live-streamed with a 40-second delay to prevent the release of sensitive information.  The pretrial proceedings began with a military court judge, Perella, and all defendants were present with their defense counsel. However, one defense counsel, Captain Andrew Balucci, was sick and did not appear. The judge advised the defendants of their rights and warned them that any potential absence could be detrimental to their case.  One defendant, Ben al-Shabib, expressed concern about the judge's qualifications, which caused some concern about his ability to adhere to the commission's rules. The judge addressed this concern, stating that Ben al-Shabib is not free to challenge the judge's qualifications.  C-Vine News has posted the entire military tribunal transcripts on their website, cvine.com, and on their Facebook page. The transcripts are also available in PDF format. The website and Facebook page are being used to facilitate discussion and analysis of the transcripts among the public.  The military tribunals are ongoing, and C-Vine News will continue to provide updates and analysis. The tribunals are a significant development in the pursuit of justice for the victims of the 9\/11 attacks.\nDocument 183\nBrian Lundin, a premier precious metals analyst, investor, and newsletter writer, joins the Times of Industry show to discuss the current market trends and his take on gold and silver. With the metals experiencing a hard correction, Lundin explains that there are two narratives at play: a short-term technical story and a longer-term fundamental monetary argument. He believes that the short-term narrative is driven by traders abandoning ship due to a head and shoulders pattern, while the fundamental narrative is driven by the need for central banks to maintain easy money policies.  Lundin notes that the Dow Jones to gold ratio has been expanding since 2011, but he thinks that the days of the Dow significantly outperforming gold are over. He believes that gold will rise as a counterbalance to the inflated financial assets, and that the ratio will continue to fall. He also thinks that the fiat monetary system is heading towards an accounting period where gold covers 100% of the monetary supply, which could lead to much higher gold prices.  In terms of investing in the mining sector, Lundin recommends owning 5-15% of a diversified portfolio in precious metals and mining stocks. He suggests focusing on companies with established resources, exploration stories, and royalty companies. Lundin also recommends owning both gold and silver, as well as mining equities, to spread the risk.  Lundin's newsletter, Gold Newsletter, is the world's oldest precious metals advisory, and he recommends it to investors. He also mentions the annual New Orleans Investment Conference, which is the oldest investment event in the sector.  Overall, Lundin's analysis suggests that gold and silver are poised for a long-term bull run, driven by the fundamental monetary argument and the need for central banks to maintain easy money policies. He recommends owning precious metals and mining stocks as a way to hedge against inflation and market volatility.\nDocument 184\nChris Marcus from Arcadia Economics shares an excerpt from an interview with Jim Willey, discussing the pressures on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and the COMEX. Jim mentions that the volume of fake deliveries to close out contracts exceeds global mine output by a factor of two to three, indicating a breakdown in the system. He also introduces a new category of gold called \"pledged,\" which he calls a \"stolen\" category, as it allows for the hypothecation of legitimate gold accounts. Jim expresses concerns about the LBMA and the COMEX, stating that the system is being stretched. He also notes an unusual reaction in the futures market, where commercial shorts in gold continued to rise despite a decrease in the gold price, suggesting that new buyers, possibly Chinese, are entering the market.\nDocument 185\nLeonard Bucani from Seavine News International is reporting live from in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. He's covering the military tribunals at Fort Meade, where proceedings were suspended until further notice for a closed-door hearing. Bucani has a direct line to the public affairs officer and will be notified if the tribunals resume on Wednesday.  Yesterday, defense attorney James Cottrell III argued most of the motions in front of the judge, representing Al-Balushi, the alleged financier of the 9-11 attacks. What's interesting is that the government knew of the plan prior to 9-11, as the CIA intercepted 118 calls between April and October 2001, positively identifying the subjects as the people behind the calls.  This revelation is significant, as it suggests that the government had prior knowledge of the attacks but didn't act on it. Bucani believes that this information is not being reported by other news outlets, making C-Vine News International the first to break this story.  The report also mentions the recent release of Mueller's report, which has sparked excitement among patriots who believe it's a vindication of the president and a sign that things are finally happening. Bucani is reporting live from the White House, bringing this information to his audience.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Prophecy and the Silver Price (Document: 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180,

{"summary":"Document 186\nThe market is experiencing a decline in trading and liquidity, with liquidity vanishing in times of stress. This is a concerning trend for investors, as it indicates that the market structure is not ideal. Marco Kalanovic, a market expert, has been warning about this issue, stating that the markets have not been tested yet and that algorithmic markets may struggle with less-than-ideal conditions.  The Federal Reserve recently conducted a $75 billion repo operation to provide liquidity to the system, which was oversubscribed. This operation was not a bailout, but rather a technical fix to address a liquidity issue in the repo market. The Fed's actions have helped to stabilize the market, but some traders are still concerned about the potential for further issues.  Neil, a market expert, believes that the repo activity is a technical mistake rather than a solvency issue, and that it does not indicate a problem with the economy. However, he notes that the Fed's actions may have to be adjusted to address the issue of excess reserves and to maintain interest rates.  The discussion then turns to the potential benefits of digital assets, such as XRP, in solving the problem of trapped capital and inefficient correspondent banking systems. XRP is a decentralized, open-source asset that was specifically built for the payments use case, and it has real utility and value.  The conversation also touches on the topic of the Federal Reserve's independence and the potential for the Fed to be blamed for economic issues. Ex-Fed president Bill Dudley has written an op-ed in Bloomberg suggesting that the Fed should take the blame for the economic collapse, which some see as an attempt to set up President Trump to take the blame.  Finally, the discussion turns to the topic of currency manipulation and the need for a level international monetary playing field. The speaker believes that identifying currency manipulation as an unfair trade practice is a natural response to the issue, and that it is essential for auth\nDocument 187\nHello, I'm Roy Potter. Today, December 10th, 2019, I'm recording this video to ensure uninterrupted transmission. I'm discussing the lack of arrests by Trump's administration, which I believe is a sign that they're not taking action against the coup plotters.   Attorney General Barr recently stated that Durham's investigation will take time, possibly until spring or summer. I disagree, as the evidence is already available, and there's no need to wait. This delay might be a tactic to keep the public from seeing results and to put the coup plotters off guard.   I'm disappointed in Trump and Barr for not taking action, and if they continue to do so, they'll have done a great disservice to the American people. I'm not sure if I'll continue to create content, as it seems like my warnings are falling on deaf ears.\nDocument 188\nGood afternoon, I'm Catania Alvin speaking from London. Today, I want to discuss the control over laws in the UK. Sir William Cash reminded us in the House of Parliament that our duty is to surrender parliamentary government to government by parliament. However, this surrendering of control over laws is a major concern. Article 4 of the Withdrawal Agreement would require us to surrender control over our laws to the EU, which is unacceptable.  Sir William Cash emphasized that if we don't have control over our laws, we don't have control over our country. He also pointed out that we are elected to make laws in the interests of our constituents, not our own. The implementation period would put us at the mercy of our competitors, and the backstop could last indefinitely, with the European Court of Justice as the supreme arbiter of our laws.  Chairman of the European Security Committee, Sir William Cash, highlighted that Article 4 is across all treaties, laws, and legal positions adopted by the Court of Justice. He also mentioned that our country would be reduced to an undemocratic subjugation to the decisions of 20 other member states.  Former ambassador to Germany, Sir Paul Lever, wrote in his book \"Berlin Rules\" that before decisions are taken by the European member states, they are cleared with Germany first. He also stated that it is a German Europe. This highlights the reality of the situation, where the UK would be subject to the decisions of other member states, including Germany.  In conclusion, the withdrawal agreement is deeply flawed, and we ought to vote against it. The decision to withdraw amendments has not been concluded, but I look forward to a better campaign. I urge everyone to phone their MP and express their concerns about the control over laws in the UK.\nDocument 189\nThe speaker emphasizes the importance of standing up for one's faith and nation, even in the face of adversity. They call for an aggressive kind of faith that fights for what is right, rather than being passive. The speaker encourages listeners to make a stand, fight for their beliefs, and not accept the status quo. They believe that with faith, victory is not only possible but also irreversible.\nDocument 190\nThe speaker discusses the manipulation of the silver market by a handful of large banks, including J.P. Morgan and Citibank. They point out that these banks have a massive short position in silver, with 179,330 contracts worth 900 million ounces. Every dollar that silver goes up, these banks lose $900 million. The speaker believes that the price of silver will continue to rise as these banks try to cover their short positions, but they won't be able to. This will lead to a default and potentially shut down the entire banking system.  The speaker also discusses the role of the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) and its custodian, J.P. Morgan. They point out that the trust is supposed to be physically backed, but J.P. Morgan is using the silver to rehypothecate it and sell it multiple times. This is a form of fraud and is being investigated.  The speaker encourages listeners to buy physical silver and to learn more about the manipulation of the silver market. They provide a link to their website, robederua.com, where they have accumulated 1,080 pages of information on silver manipulation.  The key points are:  * J.P. Morgan and Citibank have a massive short position in silver, worth 900 million ounces. * Every dollar that silver goes up, these banks lose $900 million. * The price of silver will continue to rise as these banks try to cover their short positions. * The iShares Silver Trust (SLV) is being used to manipulate the silver market. * J.P. Morgan is using the silver to rehypothecate it and sell it multiple times. * The speaker encourages listeners to buy physical silver and to learn more about the manipulation of the silver market.\nDocument 191\nThe speaker shares a message from the Lord, which they've been hesitant to share due to its severity. They describe their process of receiving messages from God, involving prayer and writing down thoughts that come to mind. The Lord's message is as follows: the time of Jacob's trouble has arrived, and America's destruction is imminent due to its refusal to turn from evil. Many will die, but God's church will survive, and a remnant will be protected. The destruction will be swift and unexpected, leaving the nation reeling. The Lord warns that only He can bring this attack, and America will realize its mistake in rejecting God. The message concludes with a call to secure oneself in God and cling to Him for protection. The speaker clarifies that the \"one hour\" mentioned may not be a literal hour from when they wrote the message, but rather the time it takes for God to act on America. They emphasize that they've prayed extensively before sharing this message, and they're still shaken by its weight.\nDocument 192\nThe speaker discusses the need for a new form of currency, local currency, which is managed by the people in each community. This currency will help clear corruption and reconstitute governments. The military, which is the backbone of a country, prefers to be paid in real money, not paper money, and does not like corruption or traitors. The speaker criticizes the current system, stating that the Constitution of the United States ended in 1871 and was replaced by a secret constitution created by bankers. This led to bribery and corruption, with the black nobility profiting from it.  The speaker also talks about the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that allows people to be empathetic and transcend themselves. They believe that people who use their prefrontal cortex will be the leaders in a new world, where most people will learn from them. The speaker also mentions the Department of Defense power transition model, which is a 90% accurate model that predicts where coalitions will form.  The speaker shares their experience working at the World Bank, where they were given the job of voting the shares of the US. They emphasize the importance of working together and taking other people's positions into account. The speaker's goal is to transition to a kinder reality, where wealth is shared and not controlled by the black nobility. They conclude by thanking their audience and promising to make more videos in the future.\nDocument 193\nDavid Morgan provides a weekly perspective on precious metals for the week ending December 13, 2019. Central banks worldwide are buying massive amounts of gold, shifting away from the US dollar, according to Goldman Sachs. This is expected to drive gold prices to $1,600 per ounce next year.   Goldman Sachs reports that central banks are consuming 20% of the global gold supply, the highest demand since the Nixon era. In contrast, JP Morgan suggests shorting gold and going long on stocks for a successful 2020. However, data from Goldman Sachs shows that the wealthy are hoarding physical gold, with hedge funds increasing their bullish bets on gold by almost 9% in the week of December 3.  Peter Schiff's website, Schiff Gold, also reports that the wealthy are stocking up on physical gold, citing fear-driven demand. Some investors are bullish on gold, predicting prices to reach $2,500 to $3,000 per ounce in the 2020s due to climate change, creating a supportive landscape for gold.\nDocument 194\nThe speaker discusses China's state-run news agency, the Global Times, announcing a potential return to the gold standard due to Washington's disruption of the financial order. The article suggests that the world needs to prepare for this change, which could be triggered by the US abandoning its current financial path. The speaker believes that the gold standard is tied to the dinar, a digital currency that could become the global leader.  The speaker notes that the safe-haven property of gold has increased in recent weeks, with spot gold reaching $1,535 an ounce on August 13th. They predict that the gold price could reach $1,800 an ounce in the future.  The article also discusses the potential consequences of a return to the gold standard, including a rebalancing of the world financial market, forcing the US to face up to its problems, and abandoning its current path. The speaker believes that central banks would increase their holdings of gold reserves to prepare for the return of the gold standard.  The speaker also mentions that the US government has been buying gold, and that the Federal Reserve has trillions of dollars to do as they wish, while the government doesn't have the same luxury. They believe that the central banking system has too much power and that the government should have more control over the economy.  The article also discusses the potential impact of a US-China trade deal on the stock market, with some experts predicting that the stock market will take off when the deal is signed. The speaker notes that this could be a second wealth transfer, following the first one mentioned by Kim Clement, a prophet who predicted a wealth transfer from China.  The speaker concludes by thanking his listeners for their support and encouraging them to be prepared for the potential changes that may come with a return to the gold standard.\nDocument 195\nThe speaker discusses their experience in prison and its impact on their family situation, but declines to comment on the White House's process. They highlight their successful business career and extensive holdings before coming to Washington. The speaker praises the President's national security priorities and the team's efforts to implement them, crediting the President for creating conditions for a deal. They also mention a key feature of the deal, a 16-year sunset clause.\nDocument 196\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan discusses the current state of the stock market and the global economy. The stock indexes are testing overhead resistance, and the utilities sector is near a record high. Copper has achieved a bullish breakout, which could lead to profit-taking in the gold market. However, the gold market has bounced back, and David Morgan believes it will continue to rise.  The global economy is facing a recession, and the Baltic Dry Index has dropped off a cliff. This indicates a contraction in the physical economy and higher prices. David Morgan emphasizes that the central banks have bought the most gold in decades, and gold is now considered a Tier 1 asset.  The article also discusses the silver market, with the Hytal Report predicting a price of $70 an ounce. David Morgan cites the Silver Institute study and the CPM study, which show that there are at least 2 billion ounces of above-ground silver. He believes that this surplus will lead to a high price for silver.  David Morgan also discusses the electronic waste problem, which is expected to grow to 78 million tons by 2023. He highlights a company that recycles electronic waste in an environmentally friendly way and has a high recovery rate.  The Morgan Report offers a paid subscription service that provides in-depth analysis of the financial markets, interviews, and conference schedules. David Morgan emphasizes the importance of honesty and integrity in the financial system and believes that his mission is to teach and empower people to understand the benefits of an honest monetary and financial system.\nDocument 197\nDavid Nino Rodriguez, a heavyweight contender, joins Peter Ronan from New York Fashion Times. Rodriguez is known for his devastating left hook, with 34 knockouts, 24 of them in the first round. He's set to face Pacquiao in an upcoming fight. Rodriguez believes Mayweather will win due to his control over the judges, but thinks Pacquiao will give him a tough fight. Rodriguez also shares his personal story of overcoming inner rage through boxing and now focuses on anti-bullying, speaking to kids in juvenile detention centers and alternative schools. He'll return to boxing in four months. Rodriguez can be found on Facebook (@Nino Boxer), Instagram (@NinoBoxer1), and his website (DavidNinoRodriguez.com).\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Prophecy and the Fiat Currency Suppression (Document: 186): Mentions the need for a level international monetary playing field.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Suppression (Document: 192): Mentions the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that allows people to be empathetic and transcend themselves.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Fiat Currency Stabilization (Document: 186): Mentions the Federal Reserve's actions to stabilize the market.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Suppression (Document: 192): Mentions the importance of working together and taking other people's positions into account.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Fiat Currency Boom (Document: 186): Mentions the potential for the Fed to be blamed for economic issues.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Collapse (Document: 186): Mentions the potential for further issues in the market.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Suppression (Document:\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Suppression (Document: 192): Mentions the goal of transitioning to a kinder reality, where wealth is shared and not controlled by the black nobility.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Suppression (Document: 192): Mentions the need for a new form of currency, local currency.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Suppression (Document: 192): Mentions the Department of Defense power transition model, which is a 90% accurate model that predicts where coalitions will form.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Economic Suppression (Document: 186): Mentions the need for a new form of currency, local currency."}
{"summary":"Document 198\nHello, TNFM patrons.  I'm your host, Matthew.  Today's report is August 18, 2019.  Let's dive into the headlines.   A migrant vessel off Italy rejected Spanish help.  Local journalist Nancy Parker died in a plane crash.  Ebola is now largely curable, thanks to new clinical trials.  India ordered Kashmir government staff back to work amid protests.  Hong Kong protesters peacefully marched in the rain.  Jordan summoned the Israeli ambassador over holy site clashes.  Tlaib compared Israel to apartheid South Africa, sparking controversy.  Russia's naval cooperation with Iran complicates Western relations.  The US is adding to its missile defense system with the Israeli Iron Dome.  A blast in Afghan capital killed dozens, and three Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers.  In the UK, food, fuel, and drug shortages are likely due to Brexit.  Sudan's leader signed a power deal.  China condemned US backing for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.  470,000 attended an anti-violence rally in Hong Kong, singing the national anthem.  The Taliban reacted to a deadly Kabul wedding hall bombing, which killed at least 63.  ISIS named a new leader from Saddam's officer corps.  The Israeli military killed three gunmen on the Gaza border.  Steve Bannon's involvement in a protest was highlighted in a news article.  Bear spray, shields, and metal poles were seized at a Portland protest.  Police made multiple arrests, and a patriot prayer leader turned himself in to jail.  Trump's union crowd at Shell was given the option of not showing up and not getting paid, but thousands still attended.  Epstein's lawyers revolted and moved to challenge the autopsy.  A ransomware attack hit local governments in Texas.  The US issued a warrant to seize an Iranian oil tanker.  North Korea conducted six days of missile tests in three\nDocument 199\nThe video discusses the Trump administration's efforts to build a border wall on the US-Mexico border and the opposition from the Democratic Party. The speaker argues that the Democratic Party, particularly individuals like Pelosi, Schiff, and Schumer, have a vested interest in keeping the border open due to their connections to crime families in California.   California has the largest debt burden of any US state, with a pension liability of $1 trillion and a budget deficit of $1.2 trillion. The speaker suggests that these crime families may be using their influence to override budget mandates and receive emergency funding.   The speaker also touches on the topic of human trafficking and the alleged involvement of the Democratic Party in bringing human trafficked slaves into the US. They claim that this is part of a larger satanic agenda to appease Moloch and Luciferian forces.   The video also mentions the recent trial of El Chapo, who named the Pelosi and Schumer families as being involved in his cartel. The speaker argues that the mainstream media's lack of coverage of the trial was due to the fact that El Chapo was naming names and exposing the Democratic Party's involvement in human trafficking.   The speaker concludes by warning viewers that the Democratic Party is \"despicable\" and \"evil\" and that they will stop at nothing to regain power. They also mention that a deadline is approaching for the revelations about the FISA warrant obtained by lies to a FISA court judge, which will have global implications and lead to the downfall of the House in the US.   The video ends with a teaser for the next video, which will cover topics such as the extraterrestrial agenda and the Space Force. The speaker encourages viewers to like, subscribe, and share the video with others.\nDocument 200\nHere's a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  The world is experiencing a synchronized slowdown, with nearly 90% of the global economy facing slower growth this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the widespread deceleration means growth in 2019-20 will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade. The IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, has also warned that India will be hit hard by the slowdown.  The global economy has undergone a seismic shift, with emerging markets and new democracies increasingly saying \"thanks, but no thanks\" to the IMF. The organization is facing criticism for its governance structure, which gives advanced industrialized countries like the US and Western Europe more power.  Central banks are struggling to adapt to the new world order, with the composition of the world economy changing dramatically over the past 20-30 years. Emerging markets, especially in Asia, now produce a significant portion of global output.  The US and China are at odds, with a rift between the two countries having a significant impact on the global economy. The IMF and other international organizations are working to address unfair trade practices and distortions in the system, including through a WTO system reform.  The US and European Union have reached a breakthrough agreement to remove trade barriers and increase US exports to the EU. The US is also working to expand commerce with Italy, with opportunities for investment in the country's booming economy.  The world is in need of a fair, open, and transparent system that practices meritocracy. The collapse of the Soviet Union 25 years ago showed that such a system is possible, and the world is now looking to the US to lead the way in creating a more equitable and prosperous future.\nDocument 201\nHello everyone, I'm Catania Albin from London. Today, I want to discuss some shocking information provided by Glenn Kennedy and Tom Hennigan. They claim that the US Supreme Court has been involved in a massive financial scandal, with over 9 trillion dollars being stolen. The date of this alleged incident is February 24th.  According to Tom Hennigan, the Bush-Bush Secretary, Obama-Bush Secretary, and Robert Rubin all worked for Goldman Sachs and HSBC. This raises questions about their loyalty and the true nature of their work. The information also suggests that Bill Clinton is considering suicide, and Obama is begging for his life, claiming he was afraid of being assassinated.  The conversation also touches on the topic of Gitmo, with some speculating that Tony Blair and George Soros are being held there. However, Catania Albin expresses skepticism about these claims, urging listeners to question everything and not believe everything they hear.  The discussion also delves into the history of the US and the UK, mentioning the First World War, the Boer War, and the assassination of President Kennedy. Catania Albin shares her personal experience of reading war books with her husband, who was born in 1938 and was an avid reader of war literature.  The conversation also mentions the Iran-Contra affair, the Shah of Persia, and the CIA's involvement in various scandals. Catania Albin recommends watching a series of videos called \"War Castles\" to learn more about the truth.  In conclusion, the conversation is a mix of conspiracy theories, historical events, and personal anecdotes. While some of the information may seem shocking or unbelievable, Catania Albin encourages listeners to question everything and seek out more information.\nDocument 202\nGood afternoon, I'm Catania Alvin from London. Today, I'll discuss the Nasara-Gasara Global Currency Reset, also known as the GCR, and the quantum financial system. The world is transitioning to a new monetary system, which is off-world and based on consciousness. The quantum financial system, QFS, is advanced and cannot be hacked due to its protection by secret space programs and benevolent extraterrestrial galactics.  The QFS system will replace corrupt central banking and the SWIFT system, which is controlled by the US. It's based on a quantum computer and an orbiting satellite, and it's designed to end cabal corruption and usury. The cabal refers to those in power who seek a one-world satanic order.  The QFS is independent from the existing system, making blockchain technology unnecessary. Each country must be sovereign and GASARA compliant to participate in the QFS. The purpose of the new system is to put an end to cabal corruption and manipulation within the banking world. The key is to implement limitations that prevent corrupted banksters from gaining significant profits.  The QFS is a significant change, and it's essential to understand that the world is being wealthed. The system is based on appreciation, love, and respect towards others, and it will not allow access to money for those with evil thoughts. The deep state battle is lost, and victory is near.\nDocument 203\nThe video discusses the gold fringe on US flags, which represents martial law. The speaker believes that the gold fringe indicates that the US is operating under a maritime court, where individuals have limited rights and are subject to the whims of the presiding officer. This is part of a larger conspiracy involving the three city-states of the District of Columbia, the Vatican, and the City of London, which have ruled the world through corruption and war.  The speaker criticizes Judge Napolitano for calling Trump's actions unconstitutional overreach, when in fact the government has been overstepping its bounds for centuries. They argue that the gold fringe is a symbol of this corruption and that martial law is necessary to bring down the criminal operations.  The speaker also discusses their personal goals and dreams, including the desire to see the kingdom of heaven on earth and to help uplift humanity. They believe that divine intervention is necessary to bring about change and that they would like to see martial law implemented to bring down the corrupt system.  The video also touches on the topic of the RV (revaluation of currency) and the speaker's desire to use their resources to help the impoverished people of the world. They believe that Africa is a rich continent that has been stolen from its people and that they would like to see the wealth of the countries returned to their rightful owners.\nDocument 204\nHello everyone, I'm Peter of England, and today I'm bringing you a message about the United Kingdom and the Brexit betrayal. Many of you have been feeling tired, disillusioned, and betrayed by the 650 traitors in Westminster Parliament. I have a plan to ensure your voices are heard, and I'm calling it Tax Revolt News.  The Brexit process has been stalled for 34 months, and it's clear that the government has no intention of leaving the European Union. They've been using shock testing to see how much the people will take before they break. But we can't just sit back and do nothing. We have a social contract with the government, and when that's broken, it's time to act.  I'm proposing a tax revolt, where we refuse to pay council tax as a way to hit the local taxation authority and make them listen to us. We need to organize and coordinate our efforts to make this happen. I'm asking you to send an email to admin1 at freemanlegalservices.com and put \"I'm in\" or \"tax boycott\" in the subject line.  We need to work together to make this happen, and I'm asking you to get 5-10 other people together to coordinate and administer the tax revolt. We need to make this go viral and get as many people as possible involved. We can't just sit back and let the government continue to betray us.  This is a call to action, and I'm asking you to join me in this tax revolt. We need to make the government listen to us, and we need to do it now. Let's boycott the bastards and make them pay attention to us. We can do this, and we will do this.\nDocument 205\nA prophet is speaking about Zimbabwe, Africa, and the need for change. They claim God has spoken to them, saying it's time for judgment on rulers who have caused genocide and suppression. The prophet believes God will bring dementia to the ruler of Zimbabwe, leading to their removal. However, God wants to save the families and give them property and freedom due to prayers. The prophet also mentions Nigeria, warning of a deep darkness trying to emerge and commanding the power of darkness to be broken. They pray for a prince of light to arise in Nigeria and Africa. The prophet then shifts focus to South Africa, saying God has not forgotten the prayers of the people and will bring a shaking, replacing corruption with righteousness. They share their personal history, being friends with the Black Consciousness Movement and prophesying about a free South Africa with an African president. The prophet believes South Africa is healing and will come out of its depression, but it takes time. They caution against judging the nation too quickly.\nDocument 206\nThe video discusses the concept of a currency revaluation, which has been reported to be imminent for years but has yet to materialize. The speaker questions whether resources will ever be put into the hands of visionaries who want to uplift humanity and free it from corporate control. They argue that the current system is a system of fraud, controlled by individuals who are unaware of the harm they cause.  The speaker also touches on the idea that the English language is a language of deception and that the system is designed to keep people in bondage. They express frustration with individuals who take advantage of them and others, and the need to distance themselves from such people.  The speaker believes that the so-called elite establishment, including the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, are criminals who want to control and enslave humanity. They argue that the system is a machine created to keep people in a state of slavery and that it's a scam.  The video concludes with the speaker expressing hope that the current reports about the currency revaluation are accurate and that it will enable visionaries to help others and uplift their own lives. They end with a message of gratitude and a nod to the concept of oneness, stating that \"So are you. So is everybody.\"\nDocument 207\nToday, I'm discussing the global reset and its connection to the gold standard. I want to thank my Patreon supporters for their continued support. I've been sharing videos about the gold standard and its implications on the global economy. The current US president has discussed the gold standard in 2017 and 2018, and it's been a topic of interest in trade negotiations with Japan and other countries.  The USMCA agreement, signed in 2018, contains a gold standard in its digital trade rule set. The US-Japan Digital Trade Agreement also includes a gold standard. These agreements are part of the global reset, which will involve a transition to a new economy. The US is working on a trade deal with China, with the first phase expected to be signed in November.  I've been discussing the Kim Clement prophecies, which mention a great wealth transfer and a global reset. The prophecies suggest that great wealth will come back to the United States, and I believe this could be part of the global reset. The dinar revaluation is also mentioned, but I'm not saying it will happen in November.  The global currency reset is a complex process that involves multiple countries and agreements. We're seeing the beginning stages of this process, with countries agreeing to gold standard agreements. I'll continue to provide updates and analysis on this topic. I encourage you to be prepared and to stay informed about the global economy and its implications.  If you like my videos, please consider supporting me on Patreon or through PayPal. Your support will help me continue to provide valuable content and insights. Thank you for listening, and I'll see you in the next video.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Prophecy and the Love of God (Document: 204): Mentions the love of God.\n    [2] Prophecy and the

{"summary":"Document 208\nThe speaker discusses several topics, including former President Barack Obama's alleged use of the presidency for personal gain. According to the speaker, Obama is a shareholder in three insurance companies that offer Obamacare plans, which would benefit from keeping people sick. This aligns with President Trump's statement that Obamacare is a national disaster. The speaker also mentions that Israel has found a cure for cancer, but the liberal media is downplaying it to protect profits. Additionally, the speaker claims that the Iran nuclear deal, signed by Obama, was intended to create ISIS and threaten Israel, and that Trump's withdrawal from the deal prevented the eradication of Israel. The speaker also mentions that Maxine Waters has used her office to benefit her husband's bank through TARP funds.\nDocument 209\nThe speaker discusses the manipulation of the silver market, which has been suppressed for 150 years. They believe that the instant the manipulation ends, silver prices will skyrocket, potentially reaching $15,000 or more. The speaker attributes the suppression to computer programs created by Alan Greenspan in the 1960s and 1970s, which allow the government to control prices and create unlimited money.  The speaker notes that the gold-silver ratio is currently at a record high of 93:1, which is a sign that silver is undervalued and poised for a huge move. They recommend trading gold for silver, as silver will outperform gold in the coming years.  The speaker also discusses the nationalization of silver mines, which they believe will occur when the banking system collapses. They advise against investing in silver mining companies, as they will be nationalized and their value will be destroyed.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of holding physical silver and gold, rather than relying on third-party storage or digital assets. They believe that the current system is unsustainable and that a collapse is imminent, which will lead to a massive increase in silver prices.  The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to learn more about silver and to prepare for the coming collapse by holding physical silver and gold in their possession.\nDocument 210\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles discusses President Trump's two-hour speech, where he mentioned a general named Raisin Cain, who was actually Dan Cain. The Anons found a declassified transcript of an interview with the National Guard Office of Inspector General from September 28, 2001. The document is 39 pages long, with some redactions, but it provides insight into Dan Cain's mission and his role as Chief of Weapons and Tactics at the 121st Fighter Squadron.  President Trump mentioned Dan Cain in his speech, which suggests that he may have information about a significant event in the United States. The transcript reveals that Dan Cain was present at the White House around the time of a major event, and he talked about being at the White House with 500 machine guns outside, which is unusual.  Deb also discusses President Trump's comments about being at the White House during Christmas, where he was alone with 500 troops outside, and how he flew to Iraq for a day. The transcript provides a unique perspective on Dan Cain's experiences and his interactions with President Trump.\nDocument 211\nThe Giggling Conservative discusses the rumors surrounding Michelle Obama's gender.  The topic originated from a statement made by Joan Rivers, who claimed Michelle is a trans person.  After the statement, Joan Rivers died under mysterious circumstances.  The Giggling Conservative shares that he has inside knowledge from high-ranking officials who believe Michelle Obama is a man.  Despite finding it hard to believe, the rumors persist and won't go away.  The Giggling Conservative will continue discussing this topic in future episodes, including a preview of Friday's episode.\nDocument 212\nThe Giggling Conservative discusses several topics in the Giggling Report. A woman named Roseanne Santos in Massachusetts was arrested for assault after knocking off a man's MAGA hat and cursing him out. It was later discovered that she was an undocumented immigrant with a DUI conviction, leading to her deportation. The host criticizes Ilhan Omar, a Congresswoman who supports CAIR, a group deemed a terrorist organization by some, and accuses her of being anti-Semitic and racist. The host also praises President Trump's plan to sign a free speech executive order and criticizes four Republican senators, Rand Paul, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Tom Tillis, for voting against Trump's national emergency declaration to build the wall. The host urges listeners to vote against these senators in the primary and to support Trump's agenda.\nDocument 213\nThe Federal Reserve's recent FOMC meeting has left the markets in a state of uncertainty. Despite no changes in monetary policy, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments on inflation have caused a stir. Powell attributed the recent weakness in inflation to \"transitory factors,\" which has led to speculation that the Fed may cut interest rates later this year. However, the use of the term \"transitory\" has raised questions about the Fed's understanding of inflation.  The difference between the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is a crucial aspect of this discussion. The PCE index includes services, such as portfolio management and apparel prices, which are not accounted for in the CPI. The Fed prefers to use the PCE index because it provides a broader range of expenditures, but critics argue that it can be manipulated to play in the Fed's favor.  The current inflation rate of 1.6% is below the Fed's target of 2%, which has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Fed's monetary policy. Powell's comments on inflation have been seen as hawkish, which could lead to a short-term top in the markets. The use of experimental monetary policies, such as quantitative easing, has been criticized for hurting savers and investors.  The Fed's reliance on the PCE index has been questioned, and some argue that it is a way to manipulate numbers to achieve a desired outcome. The CPI, on the other hand, has been criticized for being outdated and not accurately reflecting the current economic situation. The use of the term \"transitory\" to describe the recent weakness in inflation has raised questions about the Fed's understanding of the economy and its ability to implement effective monetary policy.  Ultimately, the Fed's actions and decisions will have a significant impact on the economy and the markets. The use of experimental monetary policies and the reliance on the PCE index have raised\nDocument 214\nGreetings, family. I want to share with you some exciting news. Two years ago, Walking Stick told us to pay attention to certain counter sites, especially Forex. His firm was asked to do an experiment lifting the first, second, and third zero, using only the Iraqi dinar. We caught wind of this and were pleased. Recently, our firefly caught the second article, and it's a game-changer.  In my dream, I saw a friend connected to the CBI discussing rewriting contracts due to recalculations. They're rewriting in their currency, the Iraqi dinar. This is similar to what we did with the car, using the second set of books. However, this won't last long.  I also had a dream about a seminar on the 4th of July, where they'll explain why they lifted the three zeros and the benefits of it. It's a one-to-one exchange, but that won't last long either. I want to thank our firefly for helping us find the three zeros and the second article.  This seminar in Iraq will give them purchasing power through monetary reform. There's more to come, but I'm sharing this with you in my opinion. Take care of each other, pray for each other, and be strong. Let's see what our president says tomorrow. I'm looking for a combination of words to trigger other countries to play fair with their currency. We're going to print new currency, back it up with gold, and do it. It's a new era, and I love you all.\nDocument 215\nThe discussion revolves around the Jeffrey Epstein case, focusing on his will, executors, and the investigation into his alleged suicide. The will was signed two days before his death, with Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn as executors, and Boris Nikolic, a former Gates advisor, as the successor executor. The investigation into Epstein's death is ongoing, with his attorneys conducting an investigation into the alleged suicide and requesting videos if they exist.  The discussion also touches on Ghislaine Maxwell, who was spotted in an In-N-Out burger in LA, and staged a photo op with a book about the CIA. The photos were later found to be shopped. Another interesting tidbit is the $50,000 cement truck sent to Little St. James weeks before Epstein's arrest, with speculation about covering up evidence.  The conversation also mentions the discovery of kids' bones under the water by the island, which originated from the Kremlin and was later found to be misinformation. The discussion also covers the Standard Hotel, which has been linked to the elite and has associations with pedophilic imagery.  The discussion also delves into the helicopter crash involving a general manager from the Standard Hotel, which has been linked to Adam Schiff and a potential cover-up. The investigation into Epstein's work release program is also ongoing, with a criminal investigation currently underway in Florida.  The conversation also touches on the autopsy and the broken bone in Epstein's neck, which was not consistent with a suicide. The possibility of a dead man switch is also discussed, with the question of who would have had the balls to release it.  The discussion concludes with the three possible scenarios of extraction, suicide, and murder, with the speaker leaning towards extraction as the most likely scenario. The conversation ends with the idea that we may never know the truth about Epstein's death, and it's like the ultimate game of Clue.\nDocument 216\nThe song is a heartfelt prayer for the nation, calling upon God to heal and revive it. The lyrics emphasize the importance of unity, freedom, and justice, with the nation being one under God. The song expresses a desire to break down walls of hatred and division, and to revive the hearts of its people. It also acknowledges the need for forgiveness and humility, and asks God to shine His light and bring glory to the nation. The song ends with a repetition of the phrase \"We are one nation,\" emphasizing the unity and oneness of the people.\nDocument 217\nThe speaker is expressing concern about the state of America, feeling that it has changed significantly since his childhood. He believes that people have become more self-centered and less concerned with freedom, and that the government is increasingly socialist. He points to various examples, such as the Patriot Act, which made it illegal to hoard food, and the fact that many states have laws against gardening and collecting rainwater.  The speaker is also critical of the Democratic Party, which he sees as corrupt and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve its goals. He believes that the party's goal is to take away people's guns and freedoms, and that they are using tactics such as labeling veterans with mental health issues to justify taking away their guns.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of getting involved in the political process and taking action to protect one's freedoms. He suggests that people should read the bills being proposed in Congress and contact their representatives to express their opinions. He also encourages people to become more proactive and involved in their communities.  The speaker is particularly concerned about the potential for the government to take away people's rights and freedoms, and he believes that the internet could be shut down at any moment. He suggests that people should be prepared and take steps to protect themselves and their families.  Overall, the speaker is expressing a sense of urgency and concern about the state of America and the potential for the government to take away people's freedoms. He is encouraging people to get involved and take action to protect their rights and freedoms.\nDocument 218\nChris Marcus from Arcadia Economics is joined by Phil Kennedy of Kennedy Financial to discuss the silver market and contrarian investing. Phil, a financial counselor and CPA, has been bullish on gold and silver since the 2008 financial crisis and believes that silver is undervalued due to artificially suppressed prices caused by paper contracts. He thinks that silver is a contrarian investment opportunity, especially considering its industrial uses and the increasing demand for it.  Phil also discusses the importance of behavioral finance and the psychology of money, highlighting how people are often influenced by biases and short-term thinking. He emphasizes the need to look beyond the surface level and consider the long-term implications of market trends.  Chris and Phil agree that the current market is vulnerable to bad news and that the Dow gold ratio is a key indicator of market sentiment. They also discuss the importance of patience and doing one's homework when it comes to investing, citing the example of the movie \"The Big Short\" and the investors who were able to profit from the housing market crash.  Phil's YouTube channel, Kennedy Financial, focuses on sound money, free markets, and real economics, and he invites viewers to learn more about these topics and how to opt out of the current financial system. Chris thanks Phil for joining him and looks forward to catching up again soon.  Key takeaways from the conversation include:  * Silver is undervalued due to artificially suppressed prices caused by paper contracts. * Contrarian investing requires patience and a long-term perspective. * Behavioral finance and the psychology of money are crucial factors to consider when making investment decisions. * The Dow gold ratio is a key indicator of market sentiment. * The current market is vulnerable to bad news. * Investing is a long-term process that requires doing one's homework and being willing to take calculated risks.\nDocument 219\nToday, I'm discussing the Kim Clement BBB prophecy, a prophetic investment stock. Kim Clement mentioned investing in BBB, but it's unclear which stock he was referring to. After researching, I found two possible stocks: Brixton Metals Corporation (BBB) and Big Blue Broadband PLC (BBB). Brixton Metals Corporation is a Canadian company focused on precious metals exploration and development, currently trading at 16 cents per share.   Kim Clement's prophecy suggests that people must invest in BBB, but he's holding back the exact stock. I believe this is to encourage people to research and find the stock themselves. Brixton Metals Corporation is a good company with potential for growth, considering its current low price.   To invest in this stock, you'll need to pay a one-time fee, depending on the trading platform you use. I recommend buying in bulk and holding onto the stock to watch it skyrocket. If you're interested in Kim Clement's prophecies and investments, this is another stock to consider. Remember to research and find the BBB stock available in your home country's trading area.\nDocument 220\nThe speaker discusses two main topics: the Obama administration's alleged involvement in selling automatic weapons to El Chapo's drug cartel and the actions of Rep. Ilhan Omar.   Regarding the Obama administration, the speaker claims that the Fast and Furious scandal was a deliberate attempt to increase violent gun deaths to push for stricter gun laws. They also mention that Joaquin El Chapo Guzman testified that he gave millions to Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and Hillary Clinton, which the speaker believes is evidence of corruption.  The speaker then shifts to Ilhan Omar, who they claim is anti-American and supports dictators. They cite an exchange between Omar and Elliott Abrams, where Omar asked if Abrams would support crimes against humanity if they served U.S. interests. Abrams refused to answer, and Omar took his silence as a yes. The speaker believes this shows Omar's incompetence and her anti-American views, which they argue should be reason enough to remove her from office.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Prophecy and Government Control (Document: 208): Mentions government control and manipulation.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Silver Standard Return (Document: 209): Mentions the silver standard and its potential return.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Zimbabwe Judgment (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Zombies (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Freedom (Document: 208): Mentions freedom and its potential loss.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Gold Standard Boom (Document: 209): Mentions the gold standard boom and its potential consequences.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Africa Silver Price (Document: 214): Mentions the African dinar and its potential rise in value.\n    [2] Prophecy and Economic Policy (Document: 209): Mentions economic policy and its manipulation.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Financial Suppression (Document: 209): Mentions financial suppression and its potential consequences.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Altar (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Tabernacle (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and God (Document: 216): Mentions God and its potential role in the economy.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Peace of God (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the River of Life (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Gold Price Manipulation (Document: 209): Mentions gold price manipulation and its potential consequences.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Cryptocurrency Stabilization (Document: 209): Mentions cryptocurrency and its potential stabilization.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Happiness of God (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Redemption (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Completion of God (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Moon (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and Economy (Document: 209, 214): Mentions the economy and its potential collapse.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Africa Glory of God (Document: 214): Mentions the African glory of God and its potential rise in value.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Financial Crash (Document: 209): Mentions the financial crash and its potential consequences.\n    [2] Prophecy and the New Heaven (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Corruption (Document: 208): Mentions corruption and its potential consequences.\n    [2] Corruption in Institutions (Document: 208): Mentions corruption in institutions and its potential consequences.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Tree of Life (Document: None): No new topics found.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Cryptocurrency Volatility (Document: 209): Mentions cryptocurrency and its volatility.\n    [2] Prophecy and the Africa Silver Standard (Document: 214): Mentions the African silver standard and its potential rise in value.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 208, 220): Mentions corruption in the government, including the Obama administration and Rep.

{"summary":"Document 221\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to investigate top officials at the Justice Department and FBI for allegedly considering an attempted bureaucratic coup to remove President Donald Trump from office. The officials to be investigated include James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, and Andrew McCabe. This move is seen as a step towards uncovering the deep state's involvement in the matter. The host believes that this investigation will lead to a broader probe involving prominent figures such as Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Al Gore, and Dick Cheney. The host also mentions the possibility of military tribunals and the contents of envelopes sent to the deep state cabal, hinting at a larger conspiracy.\nDocument 222\nThe presenter analyzes the Architects and Engineers Report on World Trade Center 7, which challenges the official NIST findings. The report claims that fire caused the collapse, but the presenter argues that this is impossible due to the building's design and construction. Key points include:  * The NIST model assumes a rigid structure with no sway or give, which is not true of the building. * The report omits crucial details, such as the side connector beams and beam stiffeners, which would have prevented buckling. * The presenter finds evidence that the column side plates were installed, which would have prevented girder A2001 from moving and causing the collapse. * Even if the initial collapse had occurred, the building would have only generated a third of the impact it was designed to absorb, and would have been contained on the 12th floor. * The only simulation that matches the video of the collapse is one where all core columns simultaneously fail, followed by the exterior columns failing 1.3 seconds later, which is indicative of a pre-programmed delay. * The presenter notes that Larry Silverstein, the building's owner, gave the order to \"pull it\" before the building collapsed, and that there were eyewitness accounts of explosions and a countdown before the collapse. * The presenter concludes that the evidence points to a controlled demolition, and that World Trade Center 7 is the \"smoking gun\" of September 11, 2001.\nDocument 223\nThe speaker claims that the 666 gang, a term used to describe those in power, is running scared due to the growing awareness of the American people. They argue that the gang has gone too far in censoring the American voice, and that there is no longer an American voice left standing. The speaker points out that congressmen are required to pledge their allegiance to Israel after being elected, which most Americans are unaware of.   They praise freshman congresswoman Omar for questioning this practice, saying it takes courage to ask why Americans must pledge allegiance to a foreign country. The speaker notes that most Americans won't even believe this, and that those who do question it are often attacked by mainstream media and Fox News.   The speaker suggests that this is a form of tyranny, and that it's strange that no American has brought this up before. They argue that it's only when a foreign-born woman like Omar asks the question that it gains attention. The speaker concludes that the 666 gang is scared of the American people waking up to this reality, and that when they do, it will be a scary day in America.\nDocument 224\nHello, I'm Dr. Dave Janda, and welcome back to Dave versus the MSM. This Sunday on Operation Freedom, we'll be doing a deep dive on Julian Assange's situation. The bought-off lamestream fake media claims this is an attack on the press, but is that really true? I recently analyzed this on my WTF show, and this Sunday, we'll add to that analysis with guest Paul Rosenberg, who has decades-long experience in the information technology world and is familiar with Assange's work.  To understand the situation, you need to read the indictment of Julian Assange. Hillary Clinton says Assange must answer for what he's done, but she's yet to answer about her server and Uranium One. The indictment states that Assange conspired with Bradley Manning to obtain classified information from a department and agency of the United States. This isn't about journalism; it's about an attempted hack.  Assange tried to help Manning protect himself, but they failed. The indictment was written over a year ago, not related to journalism, but to hacking. We'll discuss this further with Paul Rosenberg on Sunday. The question is, was Assange arrested because he was sold out by the Ecuadorian government, the UK government, and the Trump administration, or was he placed in a witness protection program to introduce information in a court of law related to the DNC hacking event?  The bought-off lamestream fake media won't bring you the second option. Join us on Sunday at 2-5 Eastern to delve into this issue and what's really going on beyond the curtain.

They think this will lead to a surge in gold and silver prices. The speaker questions whether the banks' disaster scenarios and simulations are well done, citing the example of stress tests that have been intentionally falsified to enable passage. They mention that the quality of simulation results depends on the quality of the input feeder system and that garbage in will result in garbage out. The speaker also mentions that smart people they respect believe that the big breakout in gold and silver prices is going to happen later, with gold being the monetary metal and silver being the technology metal. They point out that the industrial shortage is with silver, particularly in Mexico, Peru, and Chile, and Russia.\nDocument 226\nTwisha Christian discusses the Iraqi Dinar RV, explaining the potential outcomes of the currency's revaluation. He emphasizes that the goal is to achieve a significant return on investment, possibly exceeding the old rate of $3.20 per dinar.   Christian estimates that for every $1,100 invested in the dinar, the return could be $1 million USD if the zeros are removed and the value is set at 1 USD to 1 dinar. However, if the zeros are removed and the old rate is reinstated, the return could be $3.2 million USD for a million dinars.   He notes that people have already made money trading the dinar, particularly those who bought it in 2004 and sold it later. Christian also mentions that the global currency reset may involve the dinar, and he believes it's a better investment than other currencies.  The discussion also touches on other investment opportunities, such as gold, silver, and penny stocks like Zion Oil and Gas, Canberra Energy, and Comstock Mining. Christian encourages viewers to do their research and look into these opportunities.  Ultimately, Christian emphasizes the importance of being prepared for the potential outcomes of the dinar RV and other investment opportunities.
