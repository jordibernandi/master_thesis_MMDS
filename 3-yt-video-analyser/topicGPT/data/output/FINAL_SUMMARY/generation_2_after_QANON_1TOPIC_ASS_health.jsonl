{"summary":"Document 1\nThe UK's Track and Trace app is contracted to and run by private companies, including AI firm Faculty and software data company Palantir. Faculty's involvement raises questions about its selection, given its lack of experience in the NHS and ties to Dominic Cummings. Palantir's contract allows it to negotiate intellectual property with third parties, sparking concerns about data security.  Serco, an outsourcing giant, has been contracted to train, recruit, and manage contract tracers, as well as run test centers. However, it has a history of failure and has been fined for ripping off the public purse. Serco has also been involved in various controversies, including breaching responsibilities of handling nuclear waste and manipulating results to show it met NHS targets.  The company's CEO, Robert Soames, has been accused of hypocrisy after being photographed on a boat during lockdown, despite claiming to show solidarity with frontline workers. The government's handling of the pandemic has been criticized for being secretive and lacking transparency, with billions of public money being handed to private companies without competition or accountability.  The leader of the House has been asked to condemn the private sector companies undermining the test and trace system, but has refused. The whole system \"stinks\" of corruption, with Conservative baroness and business executive Baroness Harding appointed as the head of track and trace, and Serco's CEO having ties to the Tory party.\nDocument 2\nHello, I'm Frank's wife.

He notes that Italians are not as fearful as people in the UK and France, with many not wearing masks and interacting freely. He questions the need for lockdowns and the accuracy of statistics provided by the medical community.   Peter suggests that the UK government's actions are unjustified and that there may be a political motive behind the lockdowns. He also questions the concept of a second wave, suggesting that it was planned.   He references the upcoming US presidential election and the potential for controversy and violence. He believes that the Democratic Party and other groups may try to remove Donald Trump from office, which could lead to further unrest.   Peter also discusses the potential for 5G technology to be activated, which he believes could have negative health consequences. He encourages viewers to be creative in their dissent and to take action against the government's policies.   He invites viewers to contact him to discuss organizing meaningful demonstrations and to subscribe to his channel for future updates.\nDocument 4\nThe President discussed the US-China trade deal, stating that China agreed to spend $250 billion in the US, with a significant portion going to farmers and manufacturers. He expressed hope that China would honor the deal. The President also addressed the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming that the US was prepared but the media was not. He stated that he was the first to call for a ban on people coming from China and that other countries are now following his lead.  The President then took questions from the press, including one about Joe Biden's willingness to have a phone call with him to discuss the pandemic. He agreed to take the call and expressed a desire to speak with Biden. The President also questioned the press about their connections to China, specifically mentioning a reporter from Hong Kong Phoenix TV.  The President then shifted the conversation to his own actions during the pandemic, stating that he was called xenophobic and racist for his early response to the crisis. He claimed that Joe Biden later acknowledged that he was right to take action. The President also discussed his son's joke about advocating for a pardon for Joe Exotic, the star of the Netflix show Tiger King, who is serving a 22-year prison sentence for allegedly hiring someone to murder an animal rights activist.\nDocument 5\nMatt Jonah Jones, a former Royal Marine, created a video to address the issue of people pretending to be veterans, known as \"Walter Mitty\" syndrome. He was inspired by a conversation with his friend Chris Thrall, a well-known YouTube personality, who had been called out for not serving in the military. Jones decided to create 10 questions that only a Royal Marine could answer, to test Chris's authenticity. The questions included topics such as military terminology, food, and locations.  Chris Thrall, who had not served in the military, was able to answer some of the questions correctly, but struggled with others. Jones used the opportunity to discuss the importance of mental health and the potential harm caused by challenging people's claims of military service. He emphasized that former servicemen are not bothered by people pretending to be veterans, as long as they are not causing harm or dishonoring the memories of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice.  Jones concluded the video by thanking Chris Thrall for participating and encouraging viewers to subscribe, like, and share. He also emphasized the importance of empathy towards those with mental illness and the need to understand the complexities of military service. The video aimed to promote a positive and supportive community among former servicemen and to raise awareness about mental health issues.\nDocument 6\nThe speaker discusses the current state of the world, specifically the stock market and the COVID-19 pandemic. They believe the markets will shut down and that the US will lock down for two weeks, potentially longer. The speaker emphasizes the importance of being prepared, having food, water, and medicine, and being in a safe location.  The speaker also discusses the silver market, stating that it's the endgame for silver and that the price will skyrocket when the markets reopen. They believe the government will freeze the markets before they crash to zero and that the Fed's repo operations will be useless.  The speaker mentions various news articles and events, including the IMF preparing a $1 trillion bailout, the S&P Brent price dropping 10%, and European banks hitting all-time lows. They also discuss the potential for a global economic collapse and the role of the \"bad guys\" in rigging the markets.  The speaker concludes by urging listeners to be prepared and to stay informed, and to be aware of the potential for chaos and disruption in the coming days and weeks. They will continue to provide updates as long as YouTube is running.\nDocument 7\nThe speaker had a surprise visit to the animal pen and found a new addition - a baby bunny born to one of the resident rabbits, Callie. The baby bunny is adorable and currently safe in a Rubbermaid container with a nest made of fur and wood shavings. The speaker plans to get another container to provide a safe space for the baby bunny to grow. The father of the baby bunny, Issachar, is getting fixed to prevent any more unwanted litters. The speaker has already scheduled a vet visit to check on the baby bunny's health, specifically a joint issue that has been noticed. The speaker is excited to share the news with the community and welcomes the new addition to the sanctuary.\nDocument 8\nDunagan and Melody Kaiser, hosts of Liberty and Finance and Reluctant Preppers, are seeking help from their subscribers to find a new place to live.

Today, we're reviewing the SinoHeart blood pressure monitor. We'll compare it with another monitor to see if the results are similar. Checking blood pressure is crucial, and it's essential to understand its importance, especially for first responders and EMTs.   The SinoHeart monitor comes with four AA batteries and has a user-friendly interface. To use it, you need to insert the batteries, place the cuff on your arm, and ensure the cord is over the artery. The monitor is easy to read, and it has a sound feature that guides you through the process.   We compared the SinoHeart monitor with the Vive Precision blood pressure machine. Both monitors showed similar results, but the SinoHeart monitor is smaller and more compact, making it easier to carry around. The Vive Precision monitor has a lit screen, but it's harder to insert the cuff.   It's essential to understand that blood pressure can affect your mood, health, and overall well-being, especially as you age. Drinking water is a simple way to lower blood pressure, and it's essential to be mindful of your supplements and medications.   In hospitals, patients often don't receive the proper care they need, and this can lead to stress, medical problems, and a decline in overall health. It's essential to prioritize proper nutrition, sleep, and staying at home as much as possible.

The start date for Tier 4B, US, could be any time between now and Monday 13 April, dependent on the three days of darkness from 7-9 April.  The military, National Guard, and Special Operation troops were rescuing child victims of trafficking out of tunnels beneath major US cities.  President Trump and his Q-team were stopping eugenics, baby-making, trafficking, sex slaves, body parts, and cannibalism.  Trump had agreed that the RV, GCR funds for all tiers would parallel the stimulus package in one unique system for good.  Stimulus checks and paycheck protection program payments were going out.  A worldwide fast on Good Friday the 10th of April was called for relief from the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Thousands of horrifically abused children were being rescued by military personnel from cabal tunnels across the US and into Canada and Mexico.  The Pentagon pedophile task force has been involved in child rescue operations since 2017, attacking drug and child trafficking in South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.  The elite own homes in the Caribbean, Epstein Island, and were doing slow exposure on child trafficking.  General Miley described a young girl rescued as the worst thing that could happen to a person.  Coronavirus made to look worse than it is, been lied to, hydrocophene drug approved for use on patients last week.  Numbers of patients going down in hospitals.  Convention centers in New York and Texas outfitted as makeshift hospitals to take in large amounts of children.  Soldiers training for underground operations.

We'll discuss the coronavirus, supply chains, markets, bonds, and precious metals.  Charles: The origin of the coronavirus is difficult to trace due to its rapid mutation rate. The Chinese authorities and scientists have sequenced the genome, but it's challenging to identify its exact source.  Host: Why is the global supply chain so fragile? Charles: The supply chain has been optimized for perfection, but this has led to a lack of redundancy and alternative sources. When a disruption occurs, it can have a ripple effect, impacting multiple layers of the supply chain.  Host: Do you think quarantining 400 million people in China was the right decision? Charles: It's hard to judge with partial information, but it's possible that the Chinese authorities made the decision based on facts that weren't known to the rest of the world.  Host: Why did gold and silver rally hard, then sell off hard into the weekend? Charles: The metals are prone to huge sell-offs, possibly due to intervention from authorities who don't want the signal to go out that things are not right with the world.  Host: What does the Fed's rate cut mean for real estate and the stock market? Charles: The 10-year treasury bond now yields 1.06%, the lowest of all time. This could signal a reflation era, and the Fed's rate cut may lead to a permanent flow into precious metals and dollar-denominated bonds.\nDocument 13\nWelcome to the Daily Injection Program, show number seven. Today's topics include an upcoming interview with Ron Paul, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the economy. The host debates whether the current market is a bear market, considering factors such as the potential for mini rallies and liquidity issues. He also discusses the importance of thinking about opportunities in the market, depending on age and risk tolerance.  The host highlights the risks involved in the pandemic, including a resurgence in China and Europe's handling of the situation. However, he also notes the federal government and the Federal Reserve's efforts to address the crisis. He suggests that the market may not be as bad as it seems, with low oil prices and potential for a V-shaped recovery.  The host also discusses restrictions on corporate America, including buybacks, which he believes will be problematic. He suggests that younger investors may benefit from buying shares of great companies when they're not rallying, while older investors may need to look at other ways to create income from their portfolio.  Additionally, the host talks about gold and silver shortages, with banks defaulting on physical deliveries. He suggests that mining stocks look good, especially with mines shutting down around the world. He recommends checking out the gold playbook on wealthresearchgroup.com for more information.  The host also discusses nibbling, or buying stocks in companies that are minimally affected by the coronavirus. He suggests focusing on companies that are well-known and have a good track record, and starting to nibble on them.  Finally, the host talks about the Easter deadline set by Trump, which he believes is a good psychological boost for the economy. He suggests that the country should focus on state-by-state and municipality-by-municipality restrictions, rather than a nationwide lockdown. He also notes that Trump's approval ratings are moving up, which could be beneficial for businesses and the economy.  The host concludes by expressing appreciation for the current state of\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] Mental Health (Document: 5, 9): Mentions the importance of mental health and the potential harm

{"summary":"Document 14\nA hospital employee in Florida reported that their hospital system is preparing for a COVID crisis, expecting to convert part of the anesthesia recovery unit into a COVID patient ward. The employee expressed frustration and concern, questioning the sudden announcement and the potential impact on their work. They also criticized the hospital system, stating that they can't stand the corruption and are considering speaking out.\nDocument 15\nHello everyone, I'm Justin from The Unboxing Authority. Today, we're going to show you how to easily decarbonize your internal combustion engine and clean your fuel injectors. Before you start, make sure to consult your car's manufacturer or a mechanic for guidance.   To decarbonize your engine, you'll need seafoam oil. Pour it into the vacuum line on the left-hand side of the engine, making sure it's at full temperature first. Then, disable the fuel pump and use an injector cleaner through the fuel rail. This tool allows the seafoam to drip gradually into the engine, controlling the flow.  After 10 minutes, open the seafoam valve to allow it to flow freely, and you should see smoke coming out of the tailpipe. Shut the engine off and let it sit for another 10 minutes. Then, take the car for a drive on a steep hill or highway to burn off the carbon buildup.  Remember to disconnect all tools and replace any caps before driving. This process can give you more power and better mileage. However, if you have a carbureted car, you may need to clean your carburetor instead.  Some people think electric cars are more environmentally friendly, but they're heavier and require more energy to move. The most efficient way to transfer energy is through combustion. Electric cars also have to be recharged, which can be a challenge.  Don't let decarbonizing your car discourage you from doing it. It's a necessary process to keep your engine running smoothly. If you have any issues, consider taking your car to a NAPA repair shop.  Thanks for watching, and don't forget to check out the links in the description for more resources and deals. Please like, comment, share, and subscribe for more videos. God bless you and your family.\nDocument 16\nThe video discusses the speaker's struggles with conflicting stories and the chaos in the world. They mention listening to a two-hour conversation with Laura Eisenhower and Cyrus A. Parsons about the Second Wave Extinction, AI, ETs, and the Force, but found no clarity. The speaker also shares a video of Ravi Zacharias speaking at the Mormon Tabernacle, highlighting his struggles with suicidal thoughts and the importance of finding answers within oneself.  The speaker expresses frustration with the current state of the world, citing a criminal running for president, mainstream news lying, and riots breaking out. They mention the concept of \"hopium\" and the idea that people are holding onto the hope that something will make sense in their lifetime.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of separating the \"in here\" and \"out there,\" suggesting that they are interconnected and that people are seeing conflicting realities. They also discuss the idea of med beds that can turn back the clock and rejuvenate the body, as well as the issue of doctors not making people well and lawyers not bringing justice.  The speaker criticizes the elite for protecting their own and mentions reports of crisis actors and clones of public figures. They express concern about the riots and the lack of self-protection in rural areas, particularly in Illinois.  The video concludes with the speaker questioning the effectiveness of an RV that puts money into the hands of visionaries in bringing positive change and asking how to get to the bottom of the chaos in the world. They express a desire for real change and end with a message of \"Namaste.\"\nDocument 17\nThe Crypto Warriors are on a mission to change the world, starting with a 21-day raw food reboot. They're eating only organic, raw food for three weeks, and the benefits include weight loss, improved vibration, and feeling better. The reboot is led by Amy, and her website, Raw21Reboot.com, provides recipes and information on how to participate.  The group then discusses silver, highlighting a beautiful chart showing the manipulation of the silver market. They explain that the COMEX has dumped 13.5 billion ounces of electronic silver contracts on the market, but the price has barely moved. This is unprecedented and a sign that the manipulation is ending.  The host emphasizes the importance of getting physical silver, as it's the only way to break the manipulation. He recommends buying small denominations, pre-65 coinage, and one-ounce rounds, as they'll be easier to sell when the price rises.  The group also discusses Warren Buffett, who has been buying gold and selling banks. They believe he's part of the Silver Army, working to destroy the banking cabal. The host references his research on The Wizard of Oz, which he believes is a metaphor for the silver standard.  The host concludes by emphasizing the importance of getting physical silver and joining the fight against the bankers. He believes that silver will free humanity from the unbacked fiat money system and that the price will rise to a one-to-one ratio with gold.\nDocument 18\nThe speaker discusses a leaked document allegedly from the World Health Organization (WHO) that outlines a plan to create a pandemic and use it as a pretext for a one-world government. The document, known as Operation Firesign, suggests using a fake alien invasion or a massive floating city to unite the world against an outside threat. The speaker believes that the WHO and other globalist organizations are using the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve this goal.  The speaker points out that the pandemic has been used to distract from other issues, such as the impeachment of President Trump, and to alter the debate structure and public aid in exchange for the Green New Deal. They also suggest that the pandemic is being used to hold hostage public aid and to appease radical leftists.  The speaker also discusses the benefits of keeping the public in mass hysteria, including the ability to alter voting and to produce voter fraud through mail-in votes. They point out that the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths are being inflated, and that the media is being used to panic the public.  The speaker also mentions the Durham report, which was supposed to be released but has been delayed, and suggests that the WHO and other globalist organizations are using the pandemic to distract from this report.  The speaker concludes by saying that the pandemic is a scam and that people are waking up to the truth. They believe that the globalist organizations are overplaying their hand and that people are seeing through their scams. The speaker encourages people to take action and to resist the tyranny of the one-world government.\nDocument 19\nThe speaker expresses frustration with the new normal of social distancing and lockdowns, feeling that it's a form of imprisonment. They question the science behind the measures, pointing out that the numbers of potential deaths from COVID-19 are inconsistent and that the lockdown policies are not supported by evidence. They argue that the lockdowns are illogical, citing Sweden's approach as an example, where life is almost normal despite not having a lockdown.  The speaker criticizes the mainstream media for promoting a narrative that is not supported by data and for not discussing the negative consequences of lockdowns, such as the impact on non-COVID related deaths, child abuse, and loss of revenue. They also question the motives of scientists who are promoting the lockdowns, suggesting that they may be influenced by funding and fame.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence, particularly when it comes to new information. They argue that the definition of science is the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment, and that the current measures do not align with this definition.  The speaker also criticizes the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for their handling of COVID-19 data, pointing out that they count both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 as deaths, which can lead to an overestimation of the real death numbers.  The speaker concludes by emphasizing the need for an open and honest discussion about the lockdowns and the science behind them, and for a platform where scientists can share their findings and discuss the issues in an open dialogue. They also express concern about the potential for a second wave of COVID-19 and the impact it could have on the economy and society.\nDocument 20\nThe creator of the YouTube channel has returned after a 21-day absence due to a stroke. They express gratitude to their audience for their prayers, comments, and financial support.

The creator also shares that they were not afraid during their near-death experience and that they were ready to move on to the afterlife. However, Jesus told them to return and share their experience with others. The creator believes that this experience has given them a new perspective on life and that they are now more determined to share their message with their audience.  The creator thanks their audience for their support and for reaching out to their family while they were in the hospital. They also express gratitude for the financial support they received through Patreon and YouTube donations. The creator plans to continue creating content and sharing their message with their audience, and they encourage their viewers to stay vigilant in the face of spiritual warfare.\nDocument 21\nThe 1619 Project aims to reframe American history by examining the country's origin story and addressing systemic racism. The project has sparked conversations and inspired events like the 1619 Project Brunch.   In other news, the NFL's Washington team is retiring its controversial nickname, and the Aunt Jemima brand is being erased due to its racist connotations. Uncle Ben's Rice is also getting a new brand identity. The Phoenix City Council has voted to change the names of streets deemed offensive.  Publishers are reimagining classic novels with diverse characters, and Twitter is dropping programming terms like \"master\" and \"slave\" from its code. Merriam-Webster has updated its definition of \"sexual preference\" to be more inclusive.  A 15-year-old girl from Louisiana expresses her frustration with her family's views on racism and police brutality, comparing Trump to Hitler. A Harvard study found no racial bias in police shootings, but another study showed that cops are 18 times more likely to be killed than unarmed black men.  The conversation turns to the gender wage gap, with one person suggesting that businesses should pay women equally to attract more female employees. However, others argue that this approach could lead to gentrification and displacement of low-income communities.  The topic of cancel culture is also discussed, with one person cautioning that social media posts can have long-lasting consequences and affect one's professional image. Cancel culture is defined as a form of boycott or public shaming of individuals who share questionable or unpopular opinions.\nDocument 22\nHello everyone, I'm excited to share this video with you. As we're in the Equinox gateway, I want to talk about the intense energies we're experiencing. Many of us are feeling ascension symptoms, and I've had to call on my higher self to slow down the symptoms. One of my top tips is to talk to your higher self team and ask them to reduce the intensity.  I recently had a reading with a top astrologer, Gregory, who told me that the 21st of December 2020 marks the end of the age of crises and the beginning of the age of Aquarius. This is a significant event, and we're currently in the Equinox portal, preparing for the solstice portal.  We're going to be working with the Arcturians, who are overseeing this planetary ascension, and the portal of Glastonbury Tor. Our goal is to transition from a third-dimensional carbon race to a fifth-dimensional crystalline race. We'll be using the momentum of our collective energy to support DNA restructuring and the activation of our 12-strand DNA.  We'll also be clearing interference in the fourth dimension, which will enable a clear alignment with the fifth dimension. This is connected to the next wave of twin soul unions, which are intricately linked with the ascension. When true twin souls come together, it activates the codes of rapture and bliss within our consciousness.  I'm facilitating a global ceremony, the Equinox transmission, at 8:08 pm UK time. We'll be working with the sacred portal of Glastonbury Tor, the fairies, and the unicorns to cleanse and lift the fourth dimension. We'll also be working with the Ascended Masters and Archangel Michael to seal a layer of protection within the fourth-dimensional field.  This work is crucial, as it will create a golden gateway to the fifth dimension. I invite\nDocument 23\nThe speaker is recording a video on Brighton Beach, discussing their recent experience with Facebook being taken down for three months. They believe this was a divine orchestration, allowing them to focus on writing their book and becoming a published author. The speaker emphasizes the importance of unity and coming together as the \"ground crew\" during this spiritual war between good and evil.  They mention the upcoming 2-2 transmission, stating that it's a crucial time for the collective to come together and reach critical mass. The speaker shares their plan to host a ceremony on Tutu, working with Bridget, the goddess of the sacred isle of Britain, and activating the Magdalene flame within individuals.  The speaker also discusses the importance of age regeneration codes, which can help individuals live up to 2,000 years or more in their current vessels. They mention the healing machines, which they believe can shift one's vibration and lead to purging old programs.  The speaker shares their perspective on the current state of the world, suggesting that it's a \"white hat controlled movie\" and that the light has already won on the higher dimensions. They encourage viewers to stay awake and aware, and to participate in the ceremonies to help reach critical mass.  The speaker also shares their experience with the healing machines, stating that they can help clear third-dimensional programming and up-level one's vibration. They believe that the transmissions can help individuals become one with their higher self and achieve ascension of consciousness.\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] Healthcare and Near-Death Experiences (Document: 20): Mentions a near-death experience and the importance of sharing one's experience with others.\n    [2] Healthcare and Personal Safety (Document: 14, 20): Mentions health concerns and personal safety during a pandemic.\n    [2] Healthcare and Wellness (Document: 17): Mentions the benefits of a raw food reboot and the importance of getting physical silver.\n    [2] Healthcare and Social Justice (Document: 21): Mentions systemic racism, police brutality, and the importance of addressing these issues.\n    [2] Healthcare and Mental Health (Document: 16): Mentions suicidal thoughts and the importance of finding answers within oneself.\n    [2] Healthcare and Pandemics (Document: 18): Mentions the COVID-19 pandemic and the plan to create a pandemic and use it as a pretext for a one-world government.\n    [2] Healthcare and Ascension (Document: 22): Mentions ascension symptoms, DNA restructuring, and the activation of 12-strand DNA.\n    [2] Healthcare and Spiritual Warfare (Document: 23): Mentions spiritual warfare, unity, and coming together as the \"ground crew\" during this spiritual war.\n    [2] Healthcare and Alternative Medicine (Document: 15): Mentions decarbonizing a car engine and cleaning fuel injectors as a form of alternative medicine.\n    [2] Healthcare and Lockdowns (Document: 19): Mentions the impact of lockdowns on non-COVID related deaths, child abuse, and loss of revenue."}
{"summary":"Document 24\nThe speaker claims to have information about a secret cloning station where the Illuminati and other powerful individuals meet to transfer consciousness into clones. They describe two types of cloning: replication cloning, where a baby is created, and duplication cloning, where a person is grown in a tank. The speaker mentions different grades of cloning, including Mark I to IV, with Mark II being REM-driven.  The speaker alleges that the Illuminati use clones for sex slaves, torture, and other purposes. They claim that Britney Spears was involved in a cloning program and that her song \"Break the Ice\" is about breaking into a cloning station. The speaker also mentions that Queen Elizabeth, Vladimir Putin, and other world leaders are involved in the cloning program.  The speaker describes a type of lizard called Vril, which is said to be parasitic and can take over a person's body. They claim that these lizards are used to control people's minds and that they are involved in alien abductions. The speaker also mentions that the Illuminati videotape alien abductions using Hollywood makeup and that they clone people to use in these abductions.  The speaker claims that the Illuminati believe in inbreeding, pedophilia, and other forms of deviant behavior to gain power and good luck. They also mention that rich people can use microchips to body snatch people and that the cloning program is used to control world leaders.  The speaker concludes by stating that they have seen evidence of the cloning program and that they are trying to expose it to the public. They claim that the technology is too advanced for people to believe, but that they have to tell the truth because people are being killed by the lizards.\nDocument 25\nIt's June 8th, 2020, and the speaker is discussing the concept of \"fat shock\" and its relation to anesthetics and sleep. Scientists have discovered that anesthetics work by disrupting the arrangement of fat platelets in neurons, leading to unconsciousness. This understanding has implications for psychedelic drugs, which can transport consciousness without disrupting it.  The speaker then discusses their own product, Pure Sleep, which they developed after researching biochemical analysis and biopharmacology for seven months. The product is designed to promote sleep and aid the body during sleep, and it works by interacting with the body's natural processes. The speaker notes that the body can only heal and build muscle mass while asleep, and that Pure Sleep helps to facilitate this process.  The speaker also discusses the importance of taking hormones and supplements in a gentle and natural way, rather than directly. They wanted to create a sleep aid that would not have a hangover effect or interact with other substances like alcohol. Pure Sleep has been consistently effective for users, and the speaker has been working with Pure Bulk to produce the product.  The speaker notes that they have been working on a new grind for the product, which involves testing each batch to ensure consistency and quality. They are pleased with the progress and have received positive feedback from users, with many reporting that the product works within the first half hour. The speaker concludes by mentioning their own experience with the product, which helped them get a great sleep after a long day of repairing their tractor.\nDocument 26\nHello beautiful souls, welcome back to my channel. Today, I want to share my knowledge about the coronavirus, but with a different perspective. I'm not here to spread fear or panic, but to share love, knowledge, and wisdom. I believe the news is not there to uplift us, but to control us and create fear. The hype behind the coronavirus is absurd, and I think it's psychotic.  I've studied various subjects, including sociology, psychology, and government, and I believe the coronavirus was released on purpose to control people. Governments use fear to gain power, and when they feel threatened, they create a crisis to regain control. The news is responsible for the chaos, and it's not just about the virus, but about the way it's being presented.  As humans, we become what we consume. If we surround ourselves with negative energy, we'll become negative. I want to encourage you to stay calm, not let the media dictate your life, and do your own research. Look at the statistics, most people who died from the virus were 80 years old. We've had worse diseases and situations, but we don't talk about them.  I want to remind you that you are what you consume. If you consume positive energy, you'll become positive. You can turn off the TV, go outside, and do something uplifting for your mind, body, and soul. My personal suggestion is to stay calm, have integrity, and make a decision to not let the virus dictate you.  This is a beautiful time to reflect within yourself, find truth, and find peace. Without darkness, we don't have light. I hope this video gave you a little bit of light, knowledge, and awareness. Try to avoid negative conversation, surround yourself with positivity, and do what you love.  I wish everybody a healthy, positive day, week, and month ahead. My mission is to inspire\nDocument 27\nThe speaker, Vicks, discusses the current state of silver deliveries and the potential for economic chaos. He mentions that the August contract has ended, and notifications for silver deliveries have been sent out. Vicks notes that many people are asking about the status of silver deliveries, and he provides an update on the Comex first day of delivery.  According to Vicks, there are approximately 14,000 contracts that have stood for delivery, but the numbers may be higher due to discrepancies in notifications. He highlights several entities that have been short on silver, including BMO Capital, Wells Fargo Securities, and Barclays, which may face significant losses.  Vicks also mentions that JP Morgan has paid off its physical silver obligations and will not be delivering any more metal into the market. He notes that the big banks are getting \"pain on both sides\" due to their losses in the silver market.  The speaker encourages viewers to join the Road to Ruta, a platform that provides access to exclusive content, including interviews with experts like Cliff High and Jenny Moonstone. He also offers a promotion, providing 50 Theta and 50 Theta Fuel to new subscribers.  Vicks concludes by discussing the potential for economic chaos and the importance of being prepared. He notes that the physical silver market is out there, and the banks will eventually come up with the metal, either by leasing it or buying it off someone outside of the Comex market.\nDocument 28\nThe stock market experienced a rally in the first part of the week, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 clearing their 50-day moving averages. However, by Friday, Amazon was clobbered, and consumer cyclicals were trending lower. David Morgan believes the rally is over and the stock market will downtrend, while precious metals will uptrend.  In financial news, Italian car sales plummeted 98% in April, and more than one in five Singapore firms are considering cutting their workforce due to the coronavirus. The European Central Bank is stepping up efforts to cushion the economy against a record downturn.  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread financial distress, with 41% of working-age adults experiencing job loss or income decline. Millions of Americans are struggling to pay rent, mortgage, or utility bills.  David Morgan also discussed the potential for a worldwide monetary reset due to the COVID-19 panic, citing a deliberate destruction of the monetary order. He believes a prosperity fund called NESRA will be released, which will buy out oil corporations, banks, and pharmaceutical cartels, and distribute funds to the people.  The plan outlined in the NESRA fund includes forgiving mortgage, bank debt, and credit card debt, eliminating the Federal Reserve, abolishing income taxes, and establishing a flat rate sales tax. David Morgan notes that this plan sounds too good to be true, but it may be the next step in the old problem-reaction solution.\nDocument 29\nHello, YouTube family. I'm Diana, Frank's wife. I'm sorry for not posting in a few days. Frank had a stroke during his initial crisis, but it was undiagnosed until Monday. Thankfully, the area affected is the best for minimal damage. He might have peripheral vision issues, but it shouldn't affect his motor skills or cognitive ability.   Frank's been having trouble regulating his temperature, which has caused chills and made him look like he was having seizures. However, those symptoms have stopped, and he's showing signs of improvement. He's been able to move his head, lift his hands, and even pull out his tube.   I visited him today, and he responded to me, turning his head towards me and trying to open his eyes. I reassured him that he's going to be okay and that God has him. He got emotional, and I knew he was comprehending everything I said.   The plan is for Frank to have an MRI tomorrow, and I'm hoping that all the tests and results will be over soon. I want to thank everyone for their kind comments and support. It means the world to me and my family. I'm reminded that we're all part of God's family, and it's beautiful to see how He's arranged everything for us.   I want to read a psalm that God gave me when I was in the hospital. It's Psalm 31, and it talks about God's protection, rescue, and unfailing love. The verse that stood out to me is how great is the goodness you have stored up for those who fear you. I see all of you in this psalm, and I'm grateful for your love and concern for Frank and our family. Thank you for being such a blessing, and I hope you have a good week.\nDocument 30\nIt's April 1, and the speaker is not joking. They've been blocked from Twitter and can't reach out to Twitter to resolve the issue. The speaker will be focusing on a short video about horseshoe bats, which were being studied at the Wuhan bio labs. The Chinese scientists wanted to understand how these bats, which carry a high viral load, don't get sick. They discovered that horseshoe bats make vitamin C, but not in the same way as humans. Instead, they produce it on demand through a pseudogenetic structure.  This discovery is crucial because it explains why vitamin C is essential in fighting the CCP virus. The speaker believes that the Chinese Communist Party adopted a high vitamin C regimen to combat the virus, and this strategy can be used by individuals to stay healthy. The speaker also mentions that Chaga mushrooms, which are extracted from birch trees, can be used as an augmenting agent for vitamin C.  The speaker wants people to understand that the CCP virus is a bioweapon and that vitamin C is the primary key to fighting it. They encourage people to download and share the video, especially with military personnel, to help them understand the importance of vitamin C in fighting the virus. The speaker also mentions that there are two signaling molecules that turn the virus on and off, which the Chinese are hiding.  The speaker will be focusing on YouTube and encourages people to send them an email if they have something pertinent to share. They believe that by working together, people can defeat the CCP virus and reconcile with the Chinese Communist Party.\nDocument 31\nThe Stop It Now helpline in the UK has seen a 119% increase in calls and website visitors, with 94,342 people seeking help to stop sexual feelings towards children. The organization provides anonymous and confidential support to help individuals understand the reasons behind their behavior and how to get support. However, there are differing opinions on whether this helpline is effective in preventing child abuse.  Some argue that providing support to individuals with these thoughts can be beneficial, while others believe it can be detrimental, creating a sense of validation and community among individuals who may go on to commit abuse. The hosts of the podcast discuss the complexity of the issue, citing studies that show a significant portion of individuals who view child pornography go on to become contact offenders.  They also discuss the need for stricter laws and punishments for those who commit these offenses, as well as increased awareness and education about the issue. The hosts believe that by elevating this issue to the top of the mind awareness and pressuring governments to take action, we can start to see results in preventing child abuse.  The conversation also touches on the idea that certain subcultures have normalized and even institutionalized child abuse, citing examples such as the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts. The hosts emphasize the need to expose these subcultures and create stricter laws and punishments to deter child abuse.  Ultimately, the hosts conclude that while we may not be able to fully eradicate child abuse, by working together and increasing awareness and education, we can make a start in preventing it.\nDocument 32\nHello YouTube family, I'm Diana, updating you on Frank's condition. Due to personal preference, I'm sharing updates on Facebook instead of YouTube. I'm happy to report some good news: Frank is off the respirator and feeding tubes, and in under 24 hours, he's made significant progress.\nDocument 33\nHere's a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  The speaker introduces the RITMED auto scanner, a device that stimulates the body to heal itself naturally and quickly. The scanner has various applications, including pain management and stress relief. The speaker shares information about the device's history and its use in Russia, where it has achieved fantastic results.  The speaker then shifts the topic to the Global Currency Reset (GCR) and the launch of a new international internet free from corrupt corporate control. This new internet will be a new international Internet free from corrupt corporate control, free from internet censorship, and devoid of special interests and deep state retaliation.  The speaker mentions the launch of over 600 satellites in one payload, which is rumored to be part of a man-made constellation of over 40,000 industrial and military-grade satellites. This technology is being called the quantum financial system (QFS) and will enable dynamic, instantaneous transactions, an unhackable system, and foolproof technology.  The speaker also discusses the concept of ascension, which refers to the increase of frequency that is happening on the planet and in the universe. This increase in frequency is causing people to awaken and become more conscious, and is also leading to the manifestation of negativity that has been stored in the unconscious.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding how life works and how we can use our thoughts and energy to create our reality. They mention the importance of rooting out corruption and evil in the world, and the need for a new system that is fair and just.\nDocument 34\nCat Alvin is continuing his conversation, thanking viewers for their comments and donations. He introduces Sherry Edwards, a well-known expert in sound healing, who will discuss the novel approach of using sound to clear negative thought forms and ascend to a higher state of consciousness.   Sherry Edwards explains that she worked with a composer who had a severe intestinal condition and was given a short time to live. She used sound healing to help him, and he was able to recover and even act in a pilot for Twin Peaks.   Cat Alvin then shares his own work on the Institute of Bioacoustic Biology and Sound Health, where he has been studying the connection between sound and health for 40 years. He explains that everything in the universe is frequency, and that sound can be used to heal and balance the body.   Cat Alvin discusses the difference between the standard tuning of A at 440 Hz and the tuning at 432 Hz, which he believes is more in harmony with the planetary frequency. He encourages viewers to learn more about the musical revolution and how sound can be used to improve health and well-being.\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] Mental Health (Document: 29, 31): Mentions

{"summary":"Document 35\nCatania Alwyn, a natural health practitioner, shares her personal experience with health and her approach to treating illnesses naturally. She discusses the effectiveness of oxygen therapy in treating coronavirus patients and highlights the importance of building a strong immune system through vitamin C and oxygen.   Alwyn references John Rapoport's work, which questions the accuracy of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) flu death statistics. Rapoport points out that the CDC combines flu and pneumonia deaths into one category, making it difficult to determine the actual number of flu-related deaths.   Rapoport's analysis reveals that between 1979 and 2001, the CDC reported an average of 1,348 flu deaths per year, but only 18 of those deaths were confirmed to be caused by the flu virus. Alwyn suggests that this is a similar scam to the one being used in China to inflate the number of coronavirus cases.  Alwyn emphasizes the importance of being aware of the potential for misinformation and deception in the medical field. She encourages viewers to take control of their health and to seek out alternative approaches to treating illnesses.\nDocument 36\nThe host, Trish Regan, was fired for her segment criticizing the left's response to the coronavirus, which she believes is being used to demonize and destroy President Trump. She argues that the left is creating mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off and to stop the economy dead in its tracks. Regan believes that a recession is a survivable event, but what Trump is doing to the country is not.  The host also criticizes the liberal media for using the coronavirus to create a narrative that Trump is incompetent and unable to lead. She points out that the media is using fake footage from Italy to make it seem like the situation in New York is worse than it actually is.  Regan also discusses a study conducted by the Department of Defense in 2018, which found that people who had received the flu shot were more prone to getting the coronavirus. She also notes that the FDA approved a high-dose flu shot in November 2019, just weeks after the Event 201 coronavirus pandemic simulation, which took place in New York.  The host also criticizes Governor Cuomo for creating hysteria and panic by saying that New York needs 30,000 ventilators, when in fact, thousands of ventilators were already available but not distributed. Regan believes that Cuomo's actions are calculated to create a narrative that Trump is dropping the ball and that he is incompetent.  Overall, the host argues that the left is using the coronavirus to create a narrative that Trump is incompetent and that he is responsible for the country's problems. She believes that this is a calculated effort to destroy Trump's presidency and that it is not based on facts or reality.\nDocument 37\nGreetings, beloveds, from the Most High.

The market is plagued by oversupply, lack of storage space, and plummeting oil prices. As a result, counterparties are facing financial ruin, and the intercontinental exchange (ICE) is at risk of being destroyed. The collapse is attributed to the massive oversupply of oil, which has led to a record contango, where the price of oil for delivery in the near future is lower than the price for delivery in the distant future.  The collapse is also linked to the failure of banks, such as Gusher National Bank, which was mentioned in a 1987 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston document. The document explained how banks can fail due to poor decisions, fraud, or changing economic conditions. The collapse of the oil derivative market is seen as a repeat of the 1987 scenario, where banks failed due to their exposure to the energy sector.  Bix Weir also mentions the role of derivatives in the collapse, highlighting the case of Heng Long, a Singapore-based company that failed to declare $800 million in losses. He also mentions ABN Ambro, a Dutch bank that has filed claims against Heng Long Group due to irrevocable letters of credit.  The collapse of the oil derivative market is seen as a catastrophic event that will have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Bix Weir emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying causes of the collapse and the role of derivatives in the market. He encourages viewers to learn more about the topic and to subscribe to his channel for free emails and updates.\nDocument 39\nHello, I'm Franklin, and today is Franklin 5, a series where I share my journey of recovery. I'm currently at Minnewaska State Park, taking a short hike with my wife's help due to my eye injury. I want to thank everyone for their prayers and encouragement, which has been overwhelming. I've received messages from South Africa, Sweden, and Belfast, showing how God's love is shared through people.  As I navigate this challenging time, I want to share a lesson I've learned: being prepared for unexpected events in life. A song I'll link in the description, \"Going for a Hike Without a Map,\" resonates with me. I've also been inspired by the story of Prophet Elijah, who found God in the still, small breeze after seeking his will.  I'm grateful for the nurses at Vassar Brothers in Poughkeepsie, New York, who were kind and patient with me during my recovery. This is day 23 of being home, and I'm getting stronger. I want to thank my friends and supporters, especially those who are brothers and sisters in Christ, for being part of my life and making this journey easier.\nDocument 40\nThe speaker is sharing a concerning update about the current situation in their hospital due to the expected rise in COVID-19 cases. They were supposed to attend a mandatory customer service class but it was canceled as the hospital is preparing for the uptick. Starting next week, family members will no longer be allowed to visit patients undergoing surgery due to the increased COVID-19 cases.

Remain faithful to your partner and don't let the newfound wealth lead you into temptation. 3.  Protect your kids from the money by building trust funds for them and keeping the original investment safe. 4.  Follow the 5% rule, which means spending only the returns of invested funds to make your money last forever. 5.  Pay attention to your health and take care of yourself to enjoy your money. 6.  Prepare for changes, such as getting sued, scammed, or emotionally blackmailed, and don't let it hurt you. 7.  Don't begin a business immediately, as nine out of 10 businesses fail, and start small instead. 8.

Today, we're discussing QE to infinity, the repo market, and the lender of last resort concept. The Federal Reserve is acting aggressively, with open-ended QE and swap lines to Europe. This is unprecedented, with $12 trillion in money markets and a trillion dollars a day in repo markets. The system is under strain, and QE to infinity is necessary to prevent a collapse.  We're seeing a risk-off event, but people are selling stocks and bonds, which is unusual. The system can't handle the amount of cash in money markets. The repo market is working at a trillion dollars a night, which is unprecedented. Direct deposits to every family of four, $3,000, and small business loans will add to the cash pile.  The primary dealer facility will allow the use of collateral as junk or toxic assets, without ascertaining their value. This is unprecedented in its effect on the economy. Gold is having a historical day, going from under $1,500 to over $1,630 in one day. The main reason is reflation and mine shutdowns, which will reduce the physical gold and silver supply.  Tax exempts and buybacks, dividends, and accountability from companies will be restricted. Companies will have to be accountable for the financial situation and stability of their company if they want taxpayer money. This is a big deal and will make mining more attractive and profitable.  The SLV option chains for January 21st at $13 had a premium of $2, but two days later, it was already at 260, a 30% gain. This is the type of opportunity that will be available. The gold playbook is an A to Z guide to the mining industry, and the book is available for free download.  Trump is making a hard line decision, considering hot spots and quarantining the elderly.

With a future full of hope, Andrew thanks everyone who supports rescue and aftercare efforts, allowing children like him to heal and thrive.\nDocument 44\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles discusses the ongoing election controversy and potential meddling in the 2020 US presidential election. She references Sidney Powell's claims of election fraud and Dominion Voting Systems' alleged involvement. Deb also shares an interview with Ron, who points out that Dominion machines are capable of manipulating election results, which could delegitimize the entire election.  Deb mentions that if the courts rule Dominion Voting Systems' machines unconstitutional, millions of potentially fraudulent votes could be discarded, affecting the election outcome. She also notes that the House of Representatives could potentially vote on the election outcome, with each state having one vote based on its number of representatives.  Deb shares various threads and articles, including one about Dominion Voting Systems' membership in CISA's Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council, which authored a statement denying election fraud. She also discusses a former Dominion project manager who executed a $25 million contract with the state of Michigan while serving as a Democrat vice chair.  Deb then shares her personal experience with COVID-19 symptoms and her decision to create a video despite feeling unwell. She also discusses the loss of subscribers and the importance of prayer in the face of adversity. Deb concludes by encouraging viewers to stay positive and pray for Sidney Powell, Trump's lawyers, and the outcome of the election.\nDocument 45\nHello everyone, I'm Richard, and welcome to If You Only Knew. Today, we're discussing several topics, including the reduced police presence in New York City, the US withdrawal from the World Health Organization, and the COVID-19 vaccine.   The US has officially left the World Health Organization, following a strong letter from President Trump requesting major changes. Despite this, the US has awarded Novavaxine $1.4 billion for a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness International, which was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.   The article also touches on the topic of health and vaccines, mentioning that the average person in the UK is aware of Bill Gates and his plan to vaccinate and chip the planet. The article also discusses the inevitable lowering of death counts, which will lead to the deep state needing to stir fear in any way they can.   The article also mentions the new procedure for counting infected and cases, which assumes that one individual can result in a larger number of cases, regardless of precautions taken. This will likely continue until the election.   The article also discusses the recent news of a homemade torture chamber found, which reminds one of the movie Hostel. The article speculates that this could be related to adrenochrome and asks for the viewer's opinion.   The article also discusses the New York Attorney General's call to cease and desist fundraising in New York State for BLM. The article speculates that BLM may be trying to start a civil war and that the mainstream media is focusing on white-on-black crime to fit their narrative.   The article also discusses Kanye West's decision to run for president and how it may benefit or hurt President Trump. The article also discusses Tom Hanks' recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, which some believe may be a glitch or a sign that he's not at home.   The article also\nDocument 46\nThe scene begins in a hospital where a character undergoes an operation after his first fight. He realizes his limitations and struggles with his sight.

They're trying to get Noble to exercise and lose weight by giving him a healthy diet of vegetables, fruits, and pig feed. During the walk, Noble gets distracted by various things, including a stream, weeds, and a bag of grapes. The family also discovers an abandoned bird's nest, which they find interesting and consider reusing. The video is a lighthearted and entertaining look at a family's nature walk with their pet pig, showcasing the beauty of nature and the unique bond between humans and animals.\nDocument 48\nHello everyone, I'm doing a live video today because Instagram was glitching. I wanted to share a message with you all, especially on Boxing Day. I've been getting strong feelings about the quantum financial system, the gold-backed currency, and Jasara Nasara. It feels like things are shifting, and I believe 2021 will be a year of significant change.   In 2020, I feel like we were clearing out the old, toxic roots, and now it's time to clear the space and plant new seeds for a new earth. This process takes time, but it's happening. I'm getting a vision of a gardener clearing out the old to make way for the new.   I want to encourage you all to stay positive, keep a high vibration, and avoid mainstream media. Our joy is being targeted, so let's focus on gratitude, creativity, and staying in alignment. This is the opposite of what the dark forces want us to do.   I also want to share with you my experience with the Tesla healing machine. I've been working with it, and it's been amazing. I've even made money back within 24 hours by selling the devices to my community. I highly recommend it, especially for those with chronic pain or issues that mainstream medicine can't address.  Let's stay connected and support each other in this new year. I'm excited to see what's to come, and I'm grateful for all of you. Blessings, and I'll see you all in the new year.\nDocument 49\nThe speaker, a former member of the band Take That, shares their experience of auditioning and building a reputation through relentless performances and data collection. They amassed 70,000 cards with people's information, which was later bought by their record company, BMG. The company exploited this data to promote the band, and they eventually had a hit with \"Only Takes a Minute Girl.\" The speaker left the band and released solo material, but it wasn't until the success of \"Angels\" that they gained widespread recognition.  The speaker reflects on their journey, stating that they worked tirelessly to achieve success and that their authenticity and soul are genuine. They express frustration with the impact of online comments on their mental health, feeling that they can't escape the negativity and pain caused by strangers' words. The speaker acknowledges their addiction to seeking validation through criticism and aims to release this burden to live a happier life.\nDocument 50\nHello everyone, it's Amanda Grace from Ark of Grace Ministries, and I'm here with Noble the Pig for a fun unboxing video. We're going to open three oink boxes filled with treats and goodies for Noble. The first box contains Snooty Snacks for piggy snack jars, Corn on the Cob IQ toys, and treats. Noble loves the treats the most, and we have to motivate him to sit down to try them.  The second box has a beautiful blanket, holiday cookies, and piggy treats. Noble is excited about the cookies, especially the ones shaped like gingerbread men. He's a bit stubborn and doesn't want to sit down, but with some motivation, he finally tries the treats.  The third box has a piggy snout mask, organic lavender fresh calming spray, oatmeal pumpkin drops, CBD supplemental chews, and antioxidant bites. Noble is not interested in the mask, but he loves the calming spray and the treats. He's a bit mischievous and keeps pushing for more treats.  Overall, Noble enjoys all the treats and goodies in the oink boxes, and we have a fun time unboxing them together. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next video.\nDocument 51\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. Today's call will be a bit different as I'll be listening to an international call from Brussels regarding the situation in Iraq and the upcoming election. This call is relevant to the currencies, particularly the dinar, and I'll be sharing some key information with you.  We're looking at a plausible date for the reinstitution of the dinar in January 2021, but there's also a scenario for October. The two key issues in Iraq are banking reforms and Iranian interference. The new governor of the CBI, Mustafa Galeb Mahef, has announced the release of a white paper addressing the reeducation of Iraqi citizens, the deletion of zeros, and the stopping of auctions.  The auctions have not stopped due to the 90% of revenue generated from them. The government is working to find alternative revenue sources by expanding the private economy and liberalizing banking regulations. They're also eliminating 90% of private banks and initiating 20,000 individual contracting programs to rebuild infrastructure.  The government lacks sufficient US dollar reserves to pay salaries and fund contracts, making the reinstatement and revaluation of the currency the most plausible solution. Regarding the Iranian issue, corrupt officials are being neutralized, and the accountability and justice law will be implemented after the elections in June.  The Trump sanctions have crippled Iran's economy, and they're likely to try to hang in until after the US elections. If Joe Biden wins, Iran may be back in business, but if Donald Trump is reelected, they'll be forced to come to the table and cut a deal, including Iraq's exit from Iran's internal affairs.  After the meeting between al-Khazemi and Donald Trump, Khazemi visited NATO, and it seems that NATO will replace the US as the spearhead of coalition forces to force Iran to exit Iraq. This is good news, and everything\nDocument 52\nThe hosts of Liberty and Finance and Reluctant Preppers review the Outlaw II Gear Slinger Backpack from 3V Gear. This tactical backpack features a lifetime warranty, rugged construction, and multiple compartments. It has external straps, handles, and a deep water bottle pouch. The backpack is durable and breathable, making it suitable for long trips.   The hosts had two guests test the backpack, including a young man who used it for an intercity bicycle trip and forgot it was on. His personal trainer, Josiah Johnson, also reviewed the backpack, praising its ability to hold its shape and its smooth zipper action. He noted the backpack's sturdy construction, including the X-stitched straps and the insulated attachment method.  To win the backpack, listeners can email the hosts with their name, address, and phone number by this Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern. The hosts also offer a promotion for physical precious metals, including gold and silver, through their partnership with Miles Franklin.\nDocument 53\nThe speaker discusses a timeline of year zero, which is a projection of future events based on data analysis. The timeline starts in January 2021 and spans the year, with various waves of energy and emotional components influencing the events. The speaker notes that the data has an error rate of 19 months, which means that the actual events may occur 19 months earlier or later than predicted.  The speaker identifies several key events, including a cultural revolution, economic issues, and a collapse of the rule of law. The cultural revolution is expected to be a major driver of change, with the economic wave and social disruption wave following closely behind. The speaker also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have an impact throughout the year, with each wave of the disease bringing more deaths and disruptions.  The speaker mentions several specific events that are forecast to occur, including a surprise from officialdom, the release of secret tech, and riots that spill over into secret bases. The release of tech is expected to be a major game-changer, potentially leading to the liberation of information and a shift in the future of social unrest.  The speaker notes that the data sets are accurate in terms of correlation with current events, but the timing is off. They plan to continue examining the data sets and creating videos to share their findings. The speaker also mentions that they are working on other projects, including applying the theory of Boscovich to physics and material design.  The speaker encourages viewers to check their website, halfpasthuman.com, for updates and to support their work by purchasing Pure Sleep products. They also note that they are keeping a low profile due to concerns about Twitter and YouTube's policies.\nDocument 54\nWelcome to the Day on Injection program, show number three. Today, we're discussing the current state of our way of life and the potential consequences of recent events. I'll share a personal story about my birth, where I was delivered using a vacuum and suffered from deformities, but with the help of my mother, I made a full recovery.  We're now facing a global crisis, with the coronavirus spreading rapidly. The US government is considering sending two $1,000 checks to most American individuals, but this will likely come with restrictions and an expiry date. The Federal Reserve is also considering buying corporate debt, which could lead to a loss of our capitalistic society.  The coronavirus strategy involves restricting people for 14 days to allow the healthcare system to prepare for the influx of patients. However, this won't be enough, and we'll likely see a surge in cases once restrictions are lifted. The government is preparing for this by setting up mobile hospitals and emergency response systems.  We're also facing a dollar short squeeze, with the Fed pumping $500 billion into the market daily. This is a sign of hyper-deflation, where many things change, and we need to re-evaluate our values and priorities. I encourage you to think about your own values and what's most important to you as a family member, friend, or individual.  In Italy, we've seen armies taking bodies due to a lack of preparedness for crisis. I urge you to learn from this and take steps to prepare, such as having a duffel bag of cash, considering a second residency or passport, and thinking about your life insurance and career.  The markets are unlikely to close unless there's a significant escalation, and we're in an in-motion event with no reason to close it now. There are opportunities in forced selling, and I'll cover this in my upcoming newsletter. My new ebook is also available for free this month\nDocument 55\nRestored Republic update as of April 14, 2020.

Tier 4B Internet Group, ARS, 800 numbers release would be sometime Monday, April 27th to Wednesday, April 28th, with appointments beginning before Trump's big announcement about restoring the economy on Friday, May 1st. The cabal's deceitful misuse of 5G was imitating coronavirus, which they used to lock down the US and global economies. Two California ER doctors nuked Fauci's pandemic fraud as an indictment against.  President Trump and the Pentagon pedophile task force used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the Cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation. Trump was expected to call off the lockdown and ask Americans to come back to work this Friday, May 1st. The top 27 white dragon Chinese elders and the grandfather insisted that the final RV, GCR release be finished, and began completion of the final release last Sunday night, April 19th, into Monday, April 20th.  The US had no choice in the matter because the RV, GCR monies were released and are moving in a way that couldn't be stopped.

{"summary":"Document 57\nDavid Morgan is speaking with you from his backyard on April 9th, 2020. He's discussing the current economic situation and how it's affecting people's lives. He believes that the economic collapse or crisis has already begun and will continue to unfold. Morgan emphasizes that things have changed globally, including the supply chain, businesses, and personal safety.  He explains that the economy is stalled, and no matter how much money governments or the Federal Reserve throw at the problem, it won't solve it. Morgan predicts a contraction that will affect various aspects of life, from food to entertainment. He advises people to be mentally prepared for the new normal, which will be substantially different from what we're used to.  Morgan also discusses the importance of self-reliance and adapting to the changing circumstances. He notes that people can learn new skills using the internet, such as gardening, cooking, and other practical skills. He believes that there will be a movement towards a more agrarian culture, similar to the Great Depression era.  In terms of investments, Morgan discusses the stock market, real estate, and agriculture. He believes that the stock market is in a long-term downtrend, and real estate will be reset. He's concerned about the agriculture sector due to disruptions in the supply chain, water shortages, and climate change.  Morgan also talks about the metals market, specifically gold and silver. He believes that gold has performed well, but silver has underperformed. However, he expects silver to outperform gold in the future. He notes that both metals are highly coveted and held tightly, with little selling and mostly buying.  Morgan concludes by emphasizing the importance of being gentle with oneself, accepting the new reality, and being productive. He encourages people to learn new skills, reach out to old friends, and explore new interests.

I was able to watch a portion of the movie, but it stopped after 17 minutes.   Many people were upset about the technical issues, and some claimed that the movie was a scam. However, I'm skeptical of these claims, especially since the people making them had very few followers on Twitter.   Corey Feldman has promised to tell the truth about his experiences with abuse in Hollywood, and I believe he's for real. The movie is supposed to have another showing today, and I'll try to watch it and let you know what happens.   In other news, a man in San Francisco was caught on camera leaving a dead raccoon on a table at a McDonald's. The incident is bizarre and raises concerns about cleanliness and safety. That's all for tonight, and I'll see you Wednesday morning with something more interesting.\nDocument 59\nIn the age of bioweapons and global depression, food supply certainty is crucial. The speaker shares a personal experience of a store in their area that adapted to the crisis by reaching out to the wholesale market that supplied restaurants. They discovered that by buying in bulk, they could access food items that were not available in local stores. This concept is called \"grouping food\" or \"Gruppen food,\" where individuals or groups purchase food in bulk from restaurant supply stores, bypassing the traditional retail market.  The speaker suggests that this approach can be replicated in local areas, where individuals can contact restaurant supply stores and purchase food items in bulk, such as frozen vegetables, meat, and other essentials. This way, people can build a more certain food supply and avoid relying on traditional retail stores.  The speaker also emphasizes the importance of learning from past experiences and adapting to the current situation. They mention that people in the past have used bartering, local buying co-ops, and other strategies to cope with economic crises. By applying these lessons, individuals can recover the 47% of food that is currently not making it into the retail market.  The speaker concludes by emphasizing the need for initiative and action in the face of the current crisis, which they attribute to the Chinese Communist Party's bioweapon. They encourage listeners to take control of their food supply and adapt to the new reality.\nDocument 60\nThe UK government has ordered 30 million doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, with the potential for 100 million doses by the end of the year and 1.3 billion doses next year. Pfizer aims to apply for emergency use authorization by late November. The vaccine will not be mandatory initially, but the government plans to implement a gradual plan to persuade people to take it, with restrictions and shaming campaigns for those who refuse.  Pfizer has a concerning track record, including:  - Receiving the largest criminal fine in US history for mispromoting medicines and paying kickbacks to doctors. - Pleading guilty to misbranding the painkiller Bextra. - Being involved in defective heart valves that led to over 100 deaths. - Settling a class action suit over a diabetes medication that caused liver failure. - Being fined \u00a390 million in the UK for unfair pricing to the NHS. - Paying millions to doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin. - Committing racketeering fraud in its marketing of the drug. - Bribing overseas doctors to increase foreign sales. - Being sued by Nigerian families for testing a new antibiotic on children without consent.  The speaker questions whether Pfizer is trustworthy enough to develop a safe and effective vaccine, given its history of unethical behavior.\nDocument 61\nWelcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings. Today's presentation is \"Turn off the lamestream fear machine.\" Dr. Dave Janda argues that the bought-off lamestream fake media is a tentacle of the deep state, misinforming and disinforming the public to keep them in fear and panic. He calls the coronavirus the \"freedom-stripping virus\" due to its impact on American freedoms.  Dr. Janda compares the flu and the coronavirus, citing CDC data that shows 34 million Americans suffered from the flu between October 2019 and March 2020, resulting in 20,000 to 50,000 deaths. In contrast, less than 5,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, with less than 100 deaths. He questions why the country was shut down in response to the coronavirus, but not during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.  Dr. Janda highlights the importance of addressing the situation with a rational, measured approach based on facts and data. He recommends focusing on the symptoms of the illness, which are similar to those of the flu, and looking at the case fatality rate, which is 0.1% for the flu in the US and 0.9% for the coronavirus in South Korea.  He also criticizes the media for exaggerating the case fatality rate, with some outlets claiming it's 3%, 6%, or 9%. Dr. Janda argues that people over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions are more vulnerable to the virus, but that the overall risk is still relatively low.  Dr. Janda concludes by suggesting that the deep state is using the fear and panic surrounding the coronavirus to further their own agenda, and that the public should be aware of this and take a more rational approach to the situation.\nDocument 62\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 28, 2020. The elders took over the GCR, RV release, and revalued the Iraqi Dinar on April 22nd. Iraq was scheduled to formally announce their new Dinar 8 on April 29th, while the U.S. would start Tier 4, the Internet Group. The rollout was stopped on April 25th due to a problem with honesty found with a Tier 1 bank.  President Trump and the Pentagon Pedophile Task Force used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the Cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation. The operation was ongoing, with more tunnels discovered.  Sealed indictments, including those for genocide, healthcare fraud, human trafficking, and crimes against humanity, were being served. Billionaires George Soros, George Bush Jr., and Barack Obama were rumored to be arrested and headed for Gitmo.  The COVID-19 pandemic was being used to gain a deliberate lockdown of U.S. and global economies. Inaccurate statistics on COVID-19 deaths were reported, and the CDC was pushing scare tactics to force misdiagnosis of CV-19.  The redemption process for currency exchange and ZIM bonds would be done in two parts. The first appointment would last 20-25 minutes, and a debit credit card with millions would be provided. The second appointment would involve a wealth manager and private banking team to assist with humanitarian and job creation project outlines.  President Trump has given U.S. banks a list of 250 humanitarian and job creation projects to invest in. ZIM holders could negotiate for higher rates in a second appointment with their wealth manager and private banking team.  The default ZIM rate of $11 million per 100-T ZIM note would be offered at the first appointment. If a humanitarian project was presented, higher rates could be obtained. If\nDocument 63\nThe speaker discusses a video they found that highlights the true nature of the world and the agendas being pushed by those in power. The video describes a \"dark winter\" that occurred after the first pandemic, where a massive cyber attack was executed, collapsing the world's internet and cutting off access to information. This led to a loss of confidence in government, civil unrest, and a worldwide economic collapse.  The speaker believes that this event was intentionally orchestrated to bring about the Great Reset, a plan to control people's consciousness and limit their freedom. They argue that people have been conditioned to follow a script created by those in power, and that many have been broken down by the constant abuse of control.  The speaker encourages viewers to wake up and take control of their lives, to question their power and where it's going. They highlight the importance of community and speaking the truth, and encourage viewers to support creators who are sharing their message.  The speaker also mentions a new video premiering on the channel, called \"The Deep State,\" and encourages viewers to subscribe and share the content. They believe that there are many people out there who see the world for what it is and are working to break the illusion.\nDocument 64\nThe speaker believes that COVID-19 will eventually become a manageable disease, either with or without a vaccine. They suggest that without a vaccine, it will take time for the population to develop immunity, but with a vaccine, the disease will disappear quickly. The speaker emphasizes that this process will happen naturally, like a \"herd mentality,\" where the population develops immunity over time.\nDocument 65\nBeijing is using its economic leverage and large marketplace to advance its influence over American businesses. The Chinese Communist Party requires American joint ventures in China to establish party organizations, giving the party a voice in hiring and investment decisions. Companies that stray from Chinese policy on Taiwan and Tibet face threats and punishment.   Beijing also demands that Hollywood portray China positively and censors movies that criticize China. The Chinese Communist Party spends billions on propaganda outlets in the US and around the world, including China Radio International and the China Global Television Network. The Department of Justice has ordered the China Global Television Network to register as a foreign agent.  The Chinese Communist Party has also threatened and detained the family members of American journalists who pry too deep, blocked US media websites, and made it harder for journalists to get visas. The party seeks to foster a culture of censorship across academia, including through the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.   China exerts academic pressure by providing funding to universities and scholars with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. Scholars who contradict Beijing's talking points face visa delays or denials. The Chinese Communist Party is trying to undermine academic freedom and the freedom of speech in America.\nDocument 66\nThe speaker shares their personal experiences and insights about the corrupt banking system and the military's involvement in fighting against it. They mention seeing a unique aircraft flying low over their neighborhood, which they believe is a sign of the military's efforts to show that they are not following the instructions of corrupt brass.  The speaker also talks about their involvement in the World Bank, where they discovered that the gold and wealth of the world were deposited, and that the Treaty of Versailles Bonds, worth over $2 quadrillion, were issued to the elites. They explain that they have been filing liens against these bonds to benefit all of humanity.  The speaker discusses the Situation Room and how they have put commercial liens on many of the people involved in deciding whether to start World War III. They also mention the difference between common law and admiralty law, and how the Constitution of the United States went out of effect in 1871.  The speaker shares their personal story of being poisoned by arsenic and how they have been fighting against corruption their whole life. They explain that they are not going to give up and will continue to expose the truth, despite the risks.  The speaker concludes by announcing that they will be making a second video and encouraging viewers to respond in the comment section. They want to have two comment sections to track the progress and engage with their audience.\nDocument 67\nThe West Point Mint in New York has shut down due to an abundance of caution, joining the Canadian Mint in Ottawa, which is operating at a limited capacity. This has led to concerns about the fragile supply chain of precious metals. The US Mint is the largest supplier of precious metals in North America, and its shutdown, combined with the Canadian Mint's backlog, has created a significant shortage.  The host of Finance and Liberty and Reluctant Preppers notes that this is not an isolated incident, as other major mints around the world are also struggling to keep up with demand. The host believes that this is a new reality that people must adapt to, and that waiting for premiums to come down may be a mistake.  Andy Schechtman, CEO of Miles Franklin, joins the show to discuss the impact of the shutdown on the precious metals market. He notes that the US Mint produced 450% of its April 2019 output in the first two weeks of this month, but still fell short of meeting demand. Schechtman believes that the market is experiencing asset price inflation changing to price inflation, and that people are turning to precious metals as a safe-haven asset.  The host and Schechtman discuss the potential for a second wave of the pandemic, citing the Spanish flu of 1918 as an example. They also note that the Fed's easy money policies have created asset price inflation, which is now manifesting as price inflation in the precious metals market.  The host concludes by encouraging viewers to consider acquiring physical precious metals to protect their financial future. He has become a licensed dealer's representative for Miles Franklin and can provide physical delivery or storage options for viewers who are interested.\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] COVID-19 and the Great Reset (Document: 62): Mentions the COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Reset, a plan to control people's consciousness and limit their freedom.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Personal Safety (Document: 57): Mentions the importance of self-reliance and adapting to changing circumstances.\n    [2] COVID-19 and Herd Immunity (Document: 64): Mentions the COVID-19 pandemic and the process of developing herd immunity.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Global Events (Document: 57): Mentions the global economic situation and its impact on people's lives.\n    [2] Precious Metals and Supply Chain (Document: 67): Mentions the shutdown of the West Point Mint and the Canadian Mint, leading to concerns about the fragile supply chain of precious metals.\n    [2] China's Influence and Censorship (Document: 65): Mentions China's influence and censorship in the US and around the world.\n    [2] Banking System and Military Involvement (Document: 66): Mentions the corrupt banking system and the military's involvement in fighting against it.\n    [2] Food Supply and Security (Document: 59): Mentions the importance of learning from past experiences and adapting to the current situation to build a more certain food supply.\n    [2] COVID-19 and Misinformation (Document: 61): Mentions the spread of misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of addressing the situation with a rational, measured approach.\n    [2] COVID-19 and Vaccination (Document: 60): Mentions the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of a vaccine by Pfizer."}
{"summary":"Document 68\nHello everyone, I'm Julius Twisha Christian. We're in a critical moment, similar to past experiences, especially with the dinar in 2011. However, this time it's different. With the US election just a month away, we're seeing a lot of uncertainty. The president's recent quarantine has caused market fluctuations and raised concerns about the global currency reset.  There are multiple events that need to happen for the Dinar RV to occur, including the banking system, peace agreements, and more. I've shared my concerns about potential incidents before the election, similar to the George Floyd incident. However, racial tensions have calmed down, and I expect October surprises from both sides.  The Epstein files and Maxwell's testimony are expected to be released soon, which could be a game-changer. The virus rates are increasing, and I've advised people to be prepared with at least 30 days' worth of food.  The global currency reset is a complex process, and it's not just about the Dinar. Countries like Vietnam and Iraq will benefit from the reset, and it's essential to understand the implications. The banking system is also under scrutiny, with the FinCEN files revealing money laundering and other illicit activities.  I've discussed the potential for a gold crash and the stock market's volatility. The idea of \"burning it all down\" is a possibility, and it's essential to be grounded and prepared. Don't focus on dates or specific events; instead, focus on being ready for the major event.  I've also discussed the potential attack on Israel, which could happen before the Dinar reset. This is a critical time, and people who want to destroy the nation and Israel must make their move. Be prepared, be prayerful, and get ready for a wild ride over the next 30 days.\nDocument 69\nRick is a dog trainer specializing in search and rescue dogs. He's training Odin, a refined shepherd, to find cell phones hidden on a property. Odin's task is to locate the phones, signal to Rick, and then bring him back to the found item.   Rick throws two cell phones into the property, and Odin begins his search. He uses his nose to follow the scent, getting accustomed to various smells, including those from animals like pigs. After some time, Odin signals to Rick that he's found one of the cell phones.   Rick rewards Odin with a treat and praise, emphasizing the importance of his training for search and rescue missions. Odin is also trained for cadaver work, finding dead people, and wilderness work. He's a highly skilled dog, capable of detecting human scent and tracking specific individuals.\nDocument 70\nThe speaker believes COVID-19 is a bioweapon, not a natural virus, based on its genome and RNA packing. They argue that the virus's rapid spread and devastating effects on the global economy and China's manufacturing sector are evidence of its engineered nature. The speaker suggests that the virus was created in a Wuhan bio lab studying horseshoe bats, which have a unique vitamin C system that allows them to survive with high levels of lethal organisms.  The speaker proposes a strategy to reduce the viral load by duplicating the bats' approach: continually dripping vitamin C and other compounds into the saliva. They recommend using lozenges containing vitamin C, zinc, and Sambucus (elderberry extract) to achieve this. The lozenges should be designed to slowly dissolve in the saliva, releasing a high dose of vitamin C over a long period.  The speaker emphasizes that this strategy is not a cure but a way to adapt to the bioweapon's presence. They argue that the virus is designed to accumulate in the trachea, where it can evade the immune system, and that the bats' vitamin C system is key to controlling the viral load.  The speaker also mentions the importance of zinc and Sambucus in reducing the viral load and suggests that these compounds can be used in combination with vitamin C to achieve better results. They recommend using lozenges that can last for several hours and contain a high dose of vitamin C, such as 500 milligrams per hour.  The speaker concludes by urging nurses and doctors to adopt this strategy, which they believe can help reduce the viral load and prevent severe cases of COVID-19. They emphasize that this is not a time for \"stupid thinking\" and that the strategy can be effective in adapting to the bioweapon's presence while a more permanent solution is being developed.\nDocument 71\nLinda Forsyth from C-Vine is discussing the website's rating process through fact-checkers, specifically NewsGuard. C-Vine was chosen to be rated, and the process involves a multi-part series where Linda shares the steps and interactions with NewsGuard.   The first question from NewsGuard's Annika Schlotzka concerns opinion content on the C-Vine website. Linda agrees that some articles lacked clear labeling of opinion content and has since added the word \"opinion\" to the titles.   NewsGuard requires websites to disclose their political leaning, but Linda argues that this assumes people can't think for themselves and creates division. She points out that many mainstream media outlets, which are left-leaning, don't follow this criteria. C-Vine has added a declaration of its political leaning to its About Us page.  Annika's second question concerns a story about the CDC lowering the COVID-19 death count. Linda clarifies that she was referring to NewsGuard's investors and lobbyists who have a left-leaning agenda. She also mentions that some health experts used as sources by NewsGuard have been vocal about their disagreements with the organization's stance.  Linda offers Annika the opportunity for a taped Zoom discussion debate to address concerns about fact-checking and transparency. She also shares an example of a fact-checker declaring a report false without providing clear evidence, which she believes is a case of censorship.   Linda concludes by emphasizing the importance of fact-checkers bringing unbiased truth to the public and encourages viewers to discuss the topic in the comments.\nDocument 72\nToday, we're making Power Balls, a healthy breakfast alternative to commercial power bars. The main ingredients are rolled oats, peanut butter, and maple syrup. You can customize with various add-ins like flaxseed, sliced almonds, shredded coconut, raisins, chocolate chips, walnuts, hemp hearts, and chia seeds.   To make Power Balls, combine 3 cups of rolled oats, 1 cup of peanut butter, and 1\/2 cup of maple syrup in a bowl. Add a handful of chia seeds, a tablespoon of shredded coconut, and a pinch of salt. Mix in crushed walnuts, raisins, and flaxseed. Finally, add a few chocolate chips and mix well.   The fun part is letting the kids mix everything together with their hands. Once the mixture is combined, scoop out small balls and place them on a tray. Refrigerate until solidified, then store in a Tupperware container for a quick grab-and-go breakfast or snack. This recipe is perfect for a family activity and allows you to control the ingredients and sugar content.\nDocument 73\nThe Japanese biological warfare program, led by Unit 731, conducted human experimentation and genocide during World War II, resulting in the deaths of up to 580,000 people. The program was overseen by the Japanese Imperial Army and involved the use of anthrax, bubonic plague, cholera, and other deadly pathogens. Researchers injected diseases into human subjects, often disguised as vaccines, and observed their effects. Victims were also subjected to vivisection procedures, freezing temperatures, and other forms of torture.  After the war, members of Unit 731 received secret immunity from U.S. authorities in exchange for their biological weapons research. The U.S. War Department provided payments to unnamed members of the unit, and the information obtained was used to develop the U.S. biological warfare program.  China's biological warfare program arose from the Japanese program and has continued to this day. China agreed to the Geneva Protocol in 1952 and the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention in 1984, but the U.S. has raised compliance concerns due to China's continued development of biological agents and toxins. The U.S. believes that China has not abandoned its offensive biological warfare program and has expressed concerns over China's burgeoning biological weapons program.  The U.S. has also raised concerns over China's military medical institutions and their potential dual-use applications. The U.S. assesses that China possessed an offensive biological warfare program from the early 1950s to at least the late 1980s and has not taken steps to fulfill its treaty obligations under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.\nDocument 74\nThe speaker emphasizes the importance of wearing masks to prevent the spread of infection. They warn that failure to comply will result in consequences, including fines and arrest. The speaker also expresses pride in their community's journalism, but criticizes the spread of biased and false news on social media, calling it a dangerous trend. They highlight the need for fact-checking before sharing information.\nDocument 75\nChild trafficking is a prevalent issue, with hundreds of children being killed, mutilated, or stabbed. The speaker has personally witnessed and worked with many of these children, but the issue seems too big to tackle alone. A child named Andrew was rescued and brought to the United States for medical care. His care was beyond the speaker's scope of orthopedics, so they contacted the Shriners Hospital, which provided the necessary care pro bono. The doctors involved have given their time, hearts, and emotions to help Andrew. Andrew will be non-weight-bearing for several weeks until his bones heal, and then he can start moving his extremities. The speaker emphasizes the importance of organizations like OUR intervening in child trafficking cases, as every step or child helped makes a difference. With collaborations between organizations, businesses, individuals, politicians, and governments, it's possible to stop child trafficking.\nDocument 76\nOn December 21, 2020, a significant cosmic event occurred, marking the end of the Kali Yuga and the beginning of the Sat Yuga, a golden age of light. This event was predicted by ancient prophets and seers, and it was the culmination of a series of major cosmic cycles and epochs. The Great Conjunction occurred in the morning hours, and the exact date of the end of the Mayan long-count calendar was reached.  At this time, a new higher vibrational sunlight from the central sun shone on the Earth, permeating the realm with exotic cosmic particles that instantly upgraded DNA to a higher order. This led to a huge leap in evolutionary consciousness for humanity, with DNA changes happening first to beings who resonated close to the fifth dimension.  The Pleiadians, as helpers and messengers, played a crucial role in assisting humanity in their evolution and creating a better world. They worked with the Earth Alliance to spread the word about a massive planetary global meditation that occurred on December 21st, 2020. This meditation achieved a level of critical mass and global conscious energy cohesion, triggering a total compression breakthrough on the planet.  A flash of blinding white exotic light propelled the entire realm into the fifth dimension, triggering an instantaneous DNA upgrade and eradicating all darkness and low vibrations from the Earth. The complete liberation of planet Earth was thus achieved on December 21, 2020, marking the beginning of a new era of peace, freedom, and love.\nDocument 77\nThe speaker, Peter from England, expresses disappointment with the UK government's recent announcements. Boris Johnson is extending support to key industries by lifting restrictions on certain businesses, but also increasing fines for not wearing masks in public areas to \u00a33,200. The speaker believes this is an overreach of power, especially during a recession. He also notes that the virus is not subsiding as expected, despite being supposedly susceptible to hot temperatures. The speaker suggests that the global New World Order agenda is behind the ongoing pandemic, using fear to control people. He mentions new travel restrictions and quarantine rules for people returning from certain European countries. Additionally, the speaker expresses concern about vaccinations, comparing the medical profession to a \"Gestapo\" and suggesting that people are being coerced into receiving vaccinations.\nDocument 78\nThe speaker compares the government's response to the pandemic to a bad horror movie, where the outcome is predictable due to a poorly written script. They claim that the government will blame individuals for the rise in cases and implement lockdown measures. The speaker argues that the evidence supporting the idea that the pandemic is by design is overwhelming and that the government's narrative is flawed.  The speaker notes that the government is using technology to control the population and that the pandemic is just the beginning of a five-year attack on individual freedoms. They emphasize the importance of waking up the majority of the population to the true nature of the situation.  The speaker also discusses the censorship of conservative views on social media platforms, including Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter. They claim that these platforms are suppressing free speech and that the internet is being used as a tool for psychological warfare.  The speaker encourages viewers to take action and resist the fear campaign being promoted by the government. They emphasize the importance of doing the right thing for one's health, children's future, and society as a whole. The speaker concludes that the power to stop the government's agenda lies with the people and that information is the key to resisting the psychological attack.\nDocument 79\nThe speaker discusses various topics, including climate change, global warming, and the manipulation of information by powerful groups. They claim that we're not experiencing global warming, but rather, we're about to enter another ice age due to our orbit around the sun. They suggest that a group of powerful families uses climate change to disrupt trade and business, and that we need to be aware of this to prepare for the future.  The speaker also talks about the number 666, which they claim is not the number of the devil, but rather the number of electrons in carbon, representing humanity. They believe that the Bible was written after this corrupt group came into power and was designed to confuse people.  Additionally, the speaker discusses spirituality, religion, and the importance of empathy and human love. They mention that they were raised in a Jewish household but later became a Lutheran and developed their own spiritual beliefs. They emphasize the need to rise above our differences and work together to create a peaceful and beautiful reality.  The speaker also touches on the topics of reincarnation and communication with the dead, sharing a personal experience of feeling connected to a deceased friend. They believe that we have the capacity to communicate with the other side and that we should live up to our spiritual capabilities.  Finally, the speaker expresses their gratitude for their audience's feedback and support, and looks forward to continuing to communicate and work together towards a peaceful and beautiful future.\nDocument 80\nThe speaker is teaching people how to get out of bad situations by changing their perspective and making conscious choices. He suggests writing down things in life that are not liked, such as a bad relationship, a negative mom, or a crappy car. Then, choose to stop tolerating these things, and they will no longer be a part of life. The speaker emphasizes that people often tolerate things because they are afraid of the unknown or fear losing something, but this is a choice.   He uses examples of people who have written down things they don't like and then chose to stop tolerating them, such as getting rid of a bad car or ending a toxic relationship. The speaker also notes that some things may be difficult to change, but it's still a choice. He encourages people to examine their lists and choose to stop tolerating things that are not serving them.   The speaker's main point is that people have the power to choose what they tolerate and what they don't, and by making conscious choices, they can change their lives. He emphasizes that it's not about being perfect, but about making progress and taking control of one's life.\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] Healthcare and Pandemics (Document: 70, 74, 78): Mentions the response to and management of pandemics.\n    [2] Healthcare and Emergency Preparedness Policy (Document: 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions emergency preparedness policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Ascension Policy (Document: 76): Mentions ascension policy and spiritual growth in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Community Safety Policy (Document: 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions community safety policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Technology Policy (Document: 69, 71, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80): Mentions technology policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Government Policy (Document: 68, 71, 74, 77, 78, 79): Mentions government policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Wellness Policy (Document: 72, 79): Mentions wellness policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Wellness (Document: 68, 72, 79): Mentions alternative health practices and wellness.\n    [2] Healthcare and Environment (Document: 73, 79): Mentions the relationship between healthcare and the environment.\n    [2] Healthcare and Government (Document: 68, 71, 74, 77, 78, 79): Mentions government policies and responses to healthcare issues.\n    [2] Healthcare and Global Health (Document: 73, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions global health and healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Ascension (Document: 76): Mentions ascension and spiritual growth in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Global Health Policy (Document: 73, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions global health policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Wellness (Document: 72, 79): Mentions wellness and self-care in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Alternative Medicine (Document: 70, 73, 79): Mentions alternative medicine practices in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Environment Policy (Document: 73, 79): Mentions environmental policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Community Safety Policy (Document: 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions community safety and policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Personal Safety (Document: 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions personal safety and security in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Technology (Document: 69, 71, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80): Mentions the use of technology in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Economy (Document: 68, 73, 79): Mentions the economy and healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and International Relations Policy (Document: 73, 77, 78, 79): Mentions international relations policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Social Issues Policy (Document: 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions social issues policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Ascension Policy (Document: 76): Mentions ascension policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and International Relations (Document: 73, 77, 78, 79): Mentions international relations and healthcare.\n    [2] Alternative Medicine (Document: 70, 73, 79): Mentions alternative medicine practices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Social Issues (Document: 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions social issues related to healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Human Rights Policy (Document: 73, 79): Mentions human rights policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Human Rights Policy\n    [2] Healthcare and Human Rights (Document: 73, 79): Mentions human rights issues related to healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Economy Policy (Document: 68, 73, 79): Mentions economy policy in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Emergency Preparedness (Document: 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79): Mentions emergency preparedness and response in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Alternative Medicine Policy (Document: 70, 73, 79): Mentions alternative medicine policy in healthcare."}
{"summary":"Document 81\nIt's January 20th, 2021, and the speaker is expecting a peak in emotional tension tonight, with potential drama extending to the 28th or 29th. They predict a resolution won't be seen until February. The speaker advises viewers to keep a low profile, not react to unfolding events, and not participate in the drama. They mention strange energies from space affecting Earth's magnetosphere and the vagus nervous system, which can cause emotional tension and affect thought processes.  To mitigate these effects, the speaker suggests grounding oneself by walking barefoot on wet grass or sand, using red light, or sunbathing to alter hormones and electrical charges. They also mention the use of magnetic bracelets, but caution against wearing them for extended periods.  The speaker shares a story about a French friend, Henri, who spoke to a psychic about the fate of David Wilcock, Simon Parks, and other \"woo-woo\" individuals. The psychic predicted they would still be around, which the speaker finds intriguing. They conclude by advising viewers to stay low, recognize their limitations, and not participate in the drama, as humanity is moving into a sci-fi world.\nDocument 82\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 24, 2020.  The exact RV date was unknown, but the latest intel indicated an hour-to-hour basis.  The House passed a $484 billion stimulus bill, and the Iraqi stock market would reopen with a new dinar rate on Sunday, April 26.  Tier 4 was set to be funded at 2:30 am on Friday, April 24, with intermediates paid out and completed by Monday morning, April 27.  The 800 numbers should go out around lunchtime on Monday, April 27, and Tier 4 could start with appointments on Monday or Tuesday, April 28.  Appointments for contract rates would go until Friday, May 15, and the new money could come out on that Friday.  The fiat dollar would be good for 90 days after that, or by August 15.  The gold standard could be announced on Sunday, April 26, and the central banks were sending out uncirculated US bills stamped from 2009 to 2013.  Q hinted at the upcoming RV date with \"C before D,\" meaning saving the children would come before disclosure.  The Navy hospital ship Comfort returned to its home base in Virginia, where it was used for emergency care for traumatized and abused children found in a deep underground tunnel beneath New York.  Disclosure was made on Wednesday, April 22, with Wikileaks releasing all their files on the internet.  The Clinton Foundation was connected to the tunnel, and the Comfort was docked in New York Harbor.  The oil crash put 23 banks out of business and crashed the petrodollar, leading to the gold standard announcement.  A sealed indictment was issued on Dr. Forsey, and the US government lost a landmark vaccine lawsuit.  The lawsuit demanded government documents proving vaccine quality over the past 32 years,\nDocument 83\nResearch suggests that music exercises the prefrontal cortex, strengthening the brain. In fact, studies have shown that people who sing or dance are less likely to develop Alzheimer's. This is because the brain can create new connections, allowing for recovery and adaptation. The speaker experienced this firsthand when they lost their ability to read music due to illness, but were able to regain it through practice and using tools like a metronome.\nDocument 84\nCongress can work together to significantly lower drug prices, with Senator Chuck Grassley committed to this goal.\nDocument 85\nToday's video is about how much silver we should stack in case of financial hardships. The host was inspired by a subscriber who asked how much silver is the target goal. The host explains that they're not stacking silver for short-term solutions, but rather for long-term preservation of wealth and as a hedge against inflation.  To calculate how much silver is needed, the host suggests adding up monthly expenses, including rent, mortgage, groceries, car, phone, tuition, and other expenses, and then dividing that number by the current spot price of silver. The host also emphasizes the importance of diversification, not putting all eggs in one basket, and preparing for at least 3-6 months of expenses.  The host also shares their personal experience of stacking food and medical supplies, and how it helped them during the lockdown. They emphasize that it's not just about the money, but also about having a stockpile of essential items.  The host concludes that every person's situation is different, and it's essential to figure out what makes sense for each individual. They also stress that relying solely on silver is not a good idea, as its spot price fluctuates, and it's essential to have a diversified portfolio.  The host encourages viewers to share their thoughts on the topic, including their target goal for silver stacking, diversification, and preparing for emergencies. They also invite viewers to subscribe to their channel and check out their merchandise, which includes precious metal-themed items and supports charity organizations.\nDocument 86\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 27, 2020. Judy Note reported that Sunday, April 26th, would be a day to remember as the final weekend of this journey. The IMF and Iraq situation, along with news from elders and officials, indicated a redemption and exchange start in different countries on Sunday, April 26th. All must be completed prior to Friday, May 1st, meaning the US had to start this week. The elders took over the GCR, RV release, re-release of Dubai funds, and RV'd the Iraqi dinar on Wednesday, April 22nd, with public announcements scheduled for Monday, April 27th.  Tier 4B Internet Group, AS, 800 numbers release would be sometime Monday, April 27th to Wednesday, April 28th, with appointments beginning before Trump's big announcement about restoring the economy on Friday, May 1st. The cabal's deceitful misuse of 5G was imitating coronavirus, which they used to lock down the US and global economies. Two California ER doctors nuked Fauci's pandemic fraud as an indictment against.  President Trump and the Pentagon pedophile task force used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the Cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation. Trump was expected to call off the lockdown and ask Americans to come back to work this Friday, May 1st. The top 27 white dragon Chinese elders and the grandfather insisted that the final RV, GCR release be finished, and they began completion of the final release last Sunday night, April 19th.  The US had no choice in the matter because the RV, GCR monies were released and are moving in a way that couldn't be stopped. On Monday, April 20th, there began a 10-day paradigm shift, Monday, April\nDocument 87\nHello everyone, I'm Kim Cohen, and I'm grateful to have you here. I want to address the response to my last video, where I announced that I'm no longer creating content on YouTube due to a hacking situation. I appreciate those who have joined me on Patreon, where I'm now uploading content without censorship. I'm uploading 2-3 videos a week and will be focusing on Patreon.  I understand that some of you disagree with my decision, but I hope you can have compassion and understand the risks I took to expose the truth. My physical life was threatened, and I had to deal with hacking into my personal accounts, including my bank and email. The hacking situation took a toll on my mental health, and I developed a weird skin condition, which the doctor thinks might be shingles caused by stress.  I've been in survival mode for a long time, and when I finally had a moment to breathe, I got sick. I've noticed that this pattern has happened to me before, where I'm in survival mode, and when I calm down, I get sick. I've been on meds and taking cream for my skin condition, and it's starting to improve. However, I'm still scared that it might spread to other parts of my face.  I want to thank those who have supported me and wish me well. I'm focusing on my health and well-being, and I hope you can understand my decision to prioritize my safety. Please pray for me that my skin condition doesn't worsen.\nDocument 88\nAs of April 9th, 2020, the Restored Republic via GCR update indicates that patience is a virtue, and good moral beings have the power to overcome evil and change the world. The decision-makers plan to release full payouts and adjustments to adjudicated accounts from Wednesday, April 8th, forward, and then all other accounts, including Tier 4B redemptions, between April 8th and April 14th.  Q mentioned that it's all about the children, referring to a military operation that rescued thousands of children caged in underground tunnels in New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Many perpetrators have been killed or arrested, and over 150,000 indictments have been issued, mostly for pedophilia.  The Dubai 1 and 2 accounts funded the Tier 1 government's $2 trillion stimulus bill, and the RV in the US and new rates would be fully paid out. However, the release of funds was delayed due to security audits and the removal of Pentagon Inspector General Glenn Fine, who was flagged as an Obama-era bureaucrat interfering with the plan.  The Zurich PM Contact expected D1 holding account funds to be released on Wednesday, April 8th, and Tiers 4A, B may start from D2 holding account funds later this week or on April 14th. The SBA-related contact Daniel D. should hear that the government has released SBA loan funds for issuing funds as early as today or tomorrow.  The Deep State has no other move in their playbook to fight Trump, the Alliance, and the RV, GCR release, except for Pelosi pushing mail-in voting to try to oust Trump through voter fraud in the fall 2020 election. The MSM will continue to push their global coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic fear informational war for the rest of this month and beyond.  Trump and the Alliance have turned the pandemic on its head\nDocument 89\nOn March 13, 2020, a trusted source reported a potential shutdown of the entertainment industry in Hollywood due to a rumored national quarantine. If implemented, this would severely limit access to essential services like pharmacies and grocery stores.   To prepare, it's crucial to stock up on basic supplies, including prescriptions, water, and non-perishable food items. This should be done as soon as possible to avoid crowds.   The host emphasizes the importance of taking care of oneself and one's family during this time, especially if living with other family members.   Additionally, the host encourages viewers to consider acquiring physical precious metals, such as gold and silver, to protect their family's financial future. They have partnered with Miles Franklin, a reputable and family-owned precious metals dealer, to help facilitate this process.\nDocument 90\nGood morning, I'm Karen Hudis, and this video is called \"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning.\" I'm excited to share my thoughts on the current situation, which I believe is a new beginning. However, not everyone understands this, and it's going to become apparent soon. The coronavirus is not making sense, and it's not an epidemic of the proportions that would call for this kind of response. I believe it's a false flag event, designed to unsettle and frighten people.  The mainstream media is owned by the culprits we're fighting, and they're trying to misinform us. The coronavirus was developed with a patent, and it's not an illness that warrants the response we're seeing. Schools are closed, businesses are shutting down, and politicians are telling us to protect ourselves. But I believe this is all part of a larger plan to panic people and get them to accept a vaccine that contains an RFID chip.  This chip would allow the government to keep tabs on us, and it's already being used in various forms of surveillance. The mainstream media is owned by a small group of families, including the black nobility, who are behind the central banks and Wall Street. I've worked at the World Bank for over 20 years and have seen firsthand the corruption that exists.  I'm documenting my experiences and sharing them with you, so you can understand the extent of the corruption. The key is to recognize that things are not normal and to use our critical reasoning capabilities to see that nothing adds up. People are starting to wake up and realize that we're living in a society that's not what it seems. We're being separated from each other, and we're being made suspicious and uncomfortable through the media.  But I believe that we can stand up to this corruption by recognizing the truth and taking action. We need to be aware of the RFID chip and the surveillance that's\nDocument 91\nGreetings, this is Indian in the Machine.  A message from the Intergalactic Alliance of Beings on the MedBed technology has been channeled by Canadian psychic medium, Tracy Milne.  The message is from Kai Miara, who wishes to inform about the first technology to be released to the world's population with the announcement of Nisara and Jisara.  This technology includes new free energy systems, anti-gravity and replicator devices, and holographic medical beds or med beds.  These med beds will have diagnostic support, surgical repair, and cellular and DNA reconstruction and rejuvenation.  They will be an integral part of health care and health maintenance, changing the industry as we know it.  The beds will provide options and methods to return physical health to optimal health with trained medical supervision and automated medical stations.  They will be rolled out in every country that wants them, with enough beds to begin the rollout.  The med beds will have unique features such as diagnostic support, surgical repair, and cellular and DNA reconstruction and rejuvenation.  They will work on a quantum level using vibration and frequencies, 3D scanners, and refracting lenses.  The beds will also have diagnostic and monitoring technologies that keep the practitioner informed throughout diagnostic and repair sessions.  They will use tachyon particle and plasma energy to work with the human vessel for maximum repair with minimal invasion.  The beds will be able to perform live scans of the body for diagnosis and treat any illnesses with much greater accuracy and far less time.  They will also be able to perform surgery, including appendix, heart surgery, and C-sections.  The beds will have features such as airtight see-through operating shields, comfortable limb rests, liquid spray anesthetics, and laser scalpels.  They will be built with a very advanced but strictly limited artificial intelligence that needs human connection to\nDocument 92\nThe video shows a morning routine at an animal sanctuary. The host is feeding and caring for various animals, including rabbits, chickens, ducks, and a turkey named Ruth. The animals are all unique, with some having disabilities or health issues. The host mentions that they are expanding the sanctuary by spring and that the animals will have new living spaces.  The host highlights the friendships between the animals, particularly between Salvador and Ruth, who have become an unlikely pair. The host also talks about the animals' molting process, where they shed their old feathers and grow new ones.  Throughout the video, the host interacts with the animals, calling out their names and providing them with food and water. The host also mentions the help of volunteers, who assist with caring for the animals.  The video ends with the host giving a full pen report, updating viewers on the animals' well-being and the sanctuary's activities. The host expresses gratitude and encourages viewers to keep the faith.\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] Healthcare and Personal Safety Policy (Document: 89): Mentions preparing for emergencies and personal safety practices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Ascension Policy (Document: 91): Mentions ascension and spiritual health practices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Ascension (Document: 91): Mentions ascension and spiritual health practices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Technology (Document: 83): Mentions the impact of technology on healthcare and brain\n    [2] Healthcare and Global Health (Document: 91): Mentions global health and wellness practices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Government Policy (Document: 84): Mentions government's role in healthcare, specifically lowering drug prices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Wellness Policy (Document: 84): Mentions government's role in promoting wellness and healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Technology (Document: 83): Mentions the impact of technology on healthcare and brain health.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Personal Safety (Document: 81): Mentions grounding techniques and personal safety practices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Emergency Preparedness (Document: 89): Mentions preparing for emergencies and stockpiling essential items.\n    [2] Healthcare and Environment (Document: 91): Mentions environmental health and wellness practices.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Wellness (Document: 81, 91): Mentions alternative health practices and wellness techniques.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Economy Policy (Document: 85): Mentions the importance of diversification and preparing for financial emergencies.\n    [2] Healthcare and Surveillance Policy (Document: 90): Mentions surveillance and RFID chips in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Emergency Preparedness Policy (Document: 89): Mentions preparing for emergencies and stockpiling essential items.\n    [2] Healthcare and Human Rights (Document: 90): Mentions human rights and healthcare.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Alternative Medicine (Document: 85): Mentions alternative health practices and alternative medicine.\n    [2] Healthcare and Wellness (Document: 92): Mentions animal health and wellness practices.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Community Safety Policy (Document: 81): Mentions grounding techniques and community safety practices.\n    [2] Healthcare and Surveillance (Document: 90): Mentions the potential for surveillance and RFID chips in healthcare.\n    [2] Healthcare and Technology Policy (Document: 83): Mentions the impact of music on brain health and technology's role in healthcare."}
{"summary":"Document 93\nToday, I'm discussing how to be your own bank with silver, gold, and cash. I don't believe in going completely bankless, but I do think it's a good idea to have a bank account for convenience. However, I prefer to hold onto my cash and convert it into silver and gold for long-term security.  I was inspired by a friend who introduced me to the concept of silver stacking, which involves converting cash into silver and gold to store at home. This idea resonated with me, especially after experiencing issues with banks in the past, such as during Hurricane Sandy when power was out for two weeks and ATMs were inaccessible.  I've been stacking silver and gold for a while now, and I believe diversification is key. I prioritize silver over cash and gold, but I also make sure to have a little bit of each for emergencies. I store my cash in a safe or at home, rather than in a bank account, to avoid the risk of cybercrime and theft.  In my opinion, having a bank account is like asking a friend to hold onto your money for you. I see no purpose in putting my cash or precious metals in someone else's pocket. I'd rather take care of my own money and be self-sufficient.  I'm curious to know your thoughts on bank accounts and being your own bank. Do you think bank accounts are the safest way to store your cash, or do you prefer to hold onto it yourself? Let me know in the comments.

They argue that the initial lockdown was based on the assumption that the virus would spread rapidly, but this has not been the case. The speaker suggests that the government's approach is to create divisions and implement a new infrastructure, including a cashless society.  They point out that the Bank of England replaced paper notes with plastic ones in 2019, which could be used to spread the virus. The speaker believes that the government is planning a second, more deadly pandemic to silence voices of dissent and take away more freedoms.  The speaker compares the current situation to the post-9\/11 era, where terrorism was used to justify surveillance and take away rights. They argue that the current pandemic is a new upgrade to this plan, using a universal fear of a virus to control the population.  The speaker calls for people to wake up and question the government's actions, pointing out that the number of deaths from non-Covid related illnesses is higher than those from Covid. They suggest that the public should be more critical of the government's version of science and hold them accountable for their actions.\nDocument 95\nThe speaker discusses the topic of masks, vaccines, and what they consider \"stupid people\" in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. They argue that masks are not a political issue, but rather a necessary measure to prevent the spread of the virus, which they claim is a bioweapon. The speaker notes that some protesters are not wearing masks, which they believe will lead to illness. They also claim that masks do not affect oxygen intake, citing personal experience in boat building and the use of oxygen measuring devices.\nDocument 96\nBrandon Smith, the founder of alt-market.com, joined the Times of Industry show to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic implications. Smith believes the government's response to the virus is an abuse of power, using it as a distraction event to centralize power and remove civil liberties. He thinks the virus is a serious issue but not an excuse for martial law.  Smith discussed the economic collapse, stating that it's a long-lasting disaster that will affect more people than the virus itself. He mentioned the supply chain collapse, with corporations like Walmart unable to order specific items from warehouses, and a possible credit freeze or liquidity crisis leading to a bank holiday.  Regarding the vaccine, Smith believes it will take at least a year to develop, and the mainstream media has given false hope to the public. He thinks the government is hinting at narratives to slow down the economic crash.  Smith's primary concerns are the supply chain collapse and a possible credit freeze or liquidity crisis. He thinks a bank holiday is coming, which will be blamed on the virus, but is actually due to a credit crisis.  When asked about President Trump's crisis management, Smith expressed skepticism about the upcoming election, wondering if it will even happen. He believes Trump is playing a role, being the bumbling conservative who screws everything up, and thinks this is part of a bigger agenda to make conservatives look ridiculous.

He emphasizes that the gold-silver ratio is not as out of whack as people claim, and that the characterization of silver as an industrial metal is a myth. Nielsen points out that in India, jewelry is a form of savings, not an industrial good, and that the majority of silver demand comes from monetary purposes.  Regarding oil prices, Nielsen attributes the current weakness to the global economy's demand picture, particularly in the West. He notes that oil demand peaked in the US and is now below previous peak levels, raising questions about the existence of a US recovery. Nielsen also discusses the Federal Reserve's actions, stating that they are treating crazy interest rates and money printing as normal. He suggests that the Fed may have been preparing for the COVID pandemic before it appeared.  On the COVID pandemic, Nielsen expresses uncertainty about the true nature of the virus and the policy responses. He notes that the virus is particularly contagious, has a long incubation period, and has a significant but unknown percentage of asymptomatic carriers, making containment difficult. Nielsen also questions the assumption of herd immunity, citing mixed reports on whether people automatically develop immunity.  Finally, Nielsen discusses his current work, having left the precious metals space for a few years to work in the market side. He is now retooling his plans to get back into precious metals and will be adding new content to dynamicwealthresearch.com.\nDocument 98\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan discusses the stock market and its potential for volatility. The Dow experienced a significant sell-off on June 11th, and while it has shown some strength in its comeback, it may see more volatility. David Morgan notes that the overall equity markets in the US are overvalued, but this doesn't mean they can't continue to rise. The Nasdaq has hit an all-time high, and the stock market is receiving a boost from the increased money supply.  International trade is expected to shrink by 27% in the second quarter, with developing countries being hit harder than developed ones. China's exports have grown by 3% in April, but Germany's car manufacturers are facing significant challenges as they emerge from the coronavirus crisis.  David Morgan believes that the world is in a contraction, and this contraction is accelerating. He thinks that the stock market will not experience a V-shaped recovery and that it will take longer than expected to recover. He also notes that the US debt has increased by $1 trillion in one month, which is a concerning trend.  The report also discusses the potential for silver to be used as a monetary asset, citing an article by Jeff Clark. David Morgan notes that silver has a long history of being used as money and that it is a store of value in times of crisis. He also mentions that there are efforts underway to rethink the use of silver in Latin America for energy conservation purposes.  David Morgan concludes by emphasizing the importance of speaking the truth, even in difficult times. He encourages listeners to be true to themselves and to stand together in the face of adversity.\nDocument 99\nThe speaker claims to be a Planet Potentiary Judge and Chief Federal Postal Court Judge, stating that all debts and mortgages are forgiven due to a profound statement made. They ask viewers to share the video with others, as the information is crucial for the entire world to know. The speaker explains that the world is transitioning to a gold-backed economy, where gold is the new currency, and that this will lead to the collapse of the current fiat currency system.  The speaker claims that corporations and governments use coded language to manipulate people, but they have cracked the codes and will educate viewers on how to understand them. They explain that the current system is based on a shadow world of fiction, where corporations and governments hold power over people, but this will change with the introduction of the gold-backed economy.  The speaker warns that the pension funds of baby boomers are in danger and that they should take control of their own pensions. They also claim that the use of the word \"virus\" is a form of mind control and that it will be banned.  The speaker explains that people have the power to become beneficiaries of the world's ecosystem, financial system, and bureaucratic system by taking responsibility and performing their social contracts. They encourage viewers to share the video and descriptions with others and to take action to protect their rights.  The speaker also mentions that the British Broadcasting Corporation has been disqualified due to false and misleading statements, and that people can email them for more information. They conclude by thanking their teacher and mentor, David Wayne Miller, and encouraging viewers to take action to spread the good news and perform their social contracts.\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] COVID-19 and Government Policy (Document: 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99): Mentions the government's response to the pandemic, including lockdowns, mask-wearing, and vaccine policies.\n    [2] Precious Metals and Economic Policy (Document: 97, 98): Discusses the gold-silver ratio, the characterization of silver as an industrial metal, and the potential for silver to be used as a monetary asset.\n    [2] Government and Economic Policy (Document: 99): Mentions the transition to a gold-backed economy, the collapse of the current fiat currency system, and the importance of taking control of one's own pension.\n    [2] COVID-19 and Economic Implications (Document: 96, 97, 98): Discusses the economic implications of the pandemic, including the potential for a credit freeze or liquidity crisis, a bank holiday, and a long-lasting economic disaster.\n    [2] Alternative Health and Personal Finance (Document: 93): Discusses the idea of being your own bank with silver, gold, and cash.\n    [2] Stock Market and Economic Volatility (Document: 98): Mentions the potential for volatility in the stock market, the overvaluation of equity markets, and the impact of the pandemic on international trade."}
