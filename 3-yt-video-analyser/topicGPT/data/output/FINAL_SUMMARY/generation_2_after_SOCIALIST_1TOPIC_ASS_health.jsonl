{"summary":"Document 1\nThe lyrics describe a reckless and self-destructive lifestyle, where the speaker engages in substance abuse and reckless behavior, seemingly without concern for their own well-being. They express a desire for a mother figure that can provide them with a sense of escape or euphoria, and appear to be willing to risk their life in pursuit of this goal.\nDocument 2\nThe speaker is at a hospital, a common experience for many people, especially in Michigan, where hospital visits are a familiar occurrence.\nDocument 3\nThe speaker is expressing frustration and anger towards the decision to reopen schools in Georgia despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They argue that this decision puts teachers and educators at risk of contracting the virus and potentially dying. The speaker is also critical of people who downplay the severity of the pandemic and the risks associated with it.  They share a personal experience of being on a local Facebook page where people were arguing about the decision to reopen schools. The speaker tried to point out the risks and the potential consequences, but was met with denial and deflection. They were accused of being a troll and a YouTuber from Florida, despite living in the area and caring about the educators in their county.  The speaker is concerned about the long-term effects of COVID-19, including permanent respiratory damage and the potential for children to contract the virus and spread it to their grandparents and other vulnerable individuals. They are also critical of people who compare COVID-19 to the flu, pointing out that the death toll from COVID-19 is much higher than the flu.  The speaker is calling for people to take responsibility for their actions and to consider the impact of their decisions on others. They want to live in a world where people are less cruel and more compassionate, and where educators are valued and respected. They are willing to take a stand and speak out against injustice, even if it means losing subscribers.  The speaker concludes by saying that they are not happy with the state of the world and want to try to make it better. They are willing to shoot shots in the dark until they are dead, and hope that by doing so, they can make a meaningful difference in the world.\nDocument 4\nThe speaker appears to be expressing a sense of melancholy and isolation, possibly due to living near a hospital where they may witness suffering or loss.\nDocument 5\nThe creator, Alexander, is a non-binary individual who has been medically transitioning with testosterone (T) therapy. He started taking T again in August and has been on a low dose of 200 mg strength, administered weekly at 0.25 ml. His testosterone levels are within the average male range, while his estrogen levels are within the female range.   Alexander noticed changes in his hairline, with thinning hair, especially along the sides. He also experienced changes in his facial hair, with an increasing thickening of his mustache hair and the growth of blonde whiskers on his chin. He attributes these changes to his natal testosterone levels, which he suspects are higher than average due to possible polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\nDocument 6\nHello everyone, today we're discussing obscure mental illnesses. The first one is Alien Hand Syndrome, a condition that usually emerges after brain surgery, trauma, strokes, or tumors. It causes one hand to move involuntarily, often with a mind of its own. This is in contrast to Alien Leg Syndrome, which is a joke condition that makes you never skip leg day.  Next, we have Stendhal Syndrome, a disorder that causes panic attacks, physical pain, anxiety, disassociation, confusion, and hallucinations while viewing art. Then there's Cotard Delusion, where a person believes they're a zombie.   We also have Apodomenophilia, an overwhelming desire to cut off a healthy body part. These conditions highlight the complexities of the human mind and the various ways mental illnesses can manifest.\nDocument 7\nOver 100,000 Britons have died due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the economy is in turmoil. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been praised by the media and is the most popular politician in the country, but his policies have been criticized for prioritizing the economy over human lives. He introduced the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which failed to improve the finances of UK hospitality and was linked to a sixth of COVID clusters.   Sunak also refused to increase statutory sick pay, which is one of the lowest in the industrialized world, and imposed a real-terms pay cut on many public sector workers. He has a family fortune estimated to be greater than the Queen's and owns multiple properties, but fought to stop the 20 quid a week uplift of universal credit, which would have helped those struggling to get by.  Sunak has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic, including fighting against measures to suppress the virus and urging workers to go back to the office for the sake of the economy. He brought in lockdown sceptics and refused to extend the furlough scheme, contributing to hundreds of thousands of job losses. His ideological desire to place the economy above human life has catastrophically failed, and now he is briefing Conservative MPs that spending cuts and tax rises are to come to help solve the disaster he is jointly responsible for.\nDocument 8\nPhilosophy is the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, and values. It's an attempt to understand the world, ourselves, and our place in it. Philosophy is often described as the love of wisdom, but it's not just about seeking knowledge; it's also about critically examining our beliefs and assumptions.   There are three main areas of philosophy: metaphysics, which deals with the nature of reality; epistemology, which studies knowledge and how we acquire it; and ethics, which explores morality and how we should live. Philosophy also involves reflection, modesty, and a recognition that we may be wrong about our beliefs.  Philosophers like Socrates and Confucius emphasized the importance of examining our assumptions and seeking wisdom. They believed that understanding the world and ourselves requires digging down to the root of things, rather than just accepting surface-level appearances.  Philosophy is not just an abstract discipline; it's also practical. We use philosophical questions and concepts every day, whether we realize it or not. Philosophy helps us make decisions about how to live our lives, how to interact with the world, and how to think about our place in it.  The aim of philosophy, as described by philosopher Wilfred Sellars, is to understand how things in the world hang together in the broadest possible sense. This involves relating different aspects of the world to each other and forming a comprehensive image of reality. Philosophy is like constructing a large-scale map that shows how different disciplines and areas of human inquiry fit together.  In essence, philosophy is about understanding how the world works, how we fit into it, and how we should live in it. It's a quest for wisdom, a critical examination of our assumptions, and a pursuit of knowledge that helps us navigate the complexities of life.\nDocument 9\nThe current pandemic has exposed the incompetence of governments in the UK, US, and Australia, led by individuals who have made careers out of denying public health and environmental science. These leaders, including Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, and Scott Morrison, have been influenced by neoliberal ideology, which prioritizes the market over human life. They believe that the market will solve problems, but this magic doesn't work in reality.  The UK government, for example, is filled with individuals from think tanks and lobby groups that promote deregulation and profit over people. Dominic Cummings, the head of Vote Leave, is a key figure in this network. In the US, Trump has dismissed climate science and now calls the virus a Chinese virus. Morrison, who has been at war with climate scientists, ignored public crises in the past and is now in charge of dealing with the pandemic.  These governments have been phenomenally inept in tackling the virus, starting late and entertaining crazy ideas like creating herd immunity. Their mindset is focused on kicking problems into the long grass, leaving it to the market to sort out. However, this approach has been proven to be disastrous, prioritizing money over human life.  The pandemic is a warning that our current system is not fit for purpose. We need a new political and economic system that values human life and the environment above profit-seeking motives. It's essential to be well-informed and seek out diverse viewpoints, as the mainstream media often repeats government lines, even when they are false. Supporting independent news sources like Double Down News is crucial in this time of crisis.\nDocument 10\nThe speaker shares their personal experience of being a drug addict, highlighting the complexities of addiction and the challenges of recovery. They started using drugs in adolescence, initially to cope with emotional and spiritual needs, and escalated to more serious substances like heroin and crack. The addiction accelerated quickly, leading to physical dependence, emotional chaos, and a sense of hopelessness.  The speaker emphasizes that addiction is not just about the substance, but about the emotional state and the need for a coping mechanism. They describe addiction as a \"strategy for survival\" and a \"religion\" that becomes the addict's belief system. The speaker notes that telling an addict to simply \"stop\" is not enough, as it requires a deeper understanding of the underlying issues.  The speaker references the Vietnam veterans who returned with opiate addiction, highlighting that a significant percentage were able to overcome their addiction without assistance, while a smaller group struggled to let go. They suggest that this mirrors the tendency towards addiction in some individuals, which can be exacerbated by conditions of deprivation, negligence, and isolation.  The speaker also touches on the concept of environmental influence in addiction, noting that conditions such as economic deprivation and emotional neglect can contribute to the development of addiction. They also mention the rise of behavioral addictions, such as tech addiction, and how our environment is being created to stimulate addiction.  Ultimately, the speaker shares their own experience of recovery through abstinence-based programs, where they work on replacing addictive behaviors with healthier ones and addressing underlying issues such as self-obsession, despair, and disconnection. They emphasize that recovery is not just about stopping the addiction, but about facing the underlying problems and finding solutions beyond drugs.\nDocument 11\nThe American people are demanding action from their government in response to the ongoing healthcare crisis, economic meltdown, and struggle for racial justice.  The Senate, led by Republican Leader McConnell, has been criticized for doing nothing to address these issues.  Historians have compared the current Senate to the Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor Nero, who at least provided entertainment while Rome burned.  The Senate is failing its constituents, and every member should be ashamed.  People across the country are demanding an end to police killings and brutality, racial justice, and economic relief.  The Senate must stand up for working families struggling with the pandemic, economic crisis, and emotional anxiety.  It's time to reaffirm faith in government by addressing these pressing issues and working towards a better future.\nDocument 12\nThe argument that socialism killed 100 million people in the last century is often used to discredit the ideology. However, this figure comes from the unreliable \"Black Book of Communism,\" which has been widely criticized for its methodology and accuracy. The book counts deaths from World War II, civilian casualties from the American invasion of Vietnam, and even unborn children as victims of communism.  In contrast, the death toll of capitalism is often overlooked. Capitalism is defined by the existence of markets, private ownership of the means of production, and wage labor. The drive for profit is the primary concept that drives capitalist systems, leading to ruthless competition and exploitation. This results in millions of deaths each year due to preventable illnesses, lack of access to clean drinking water, and malnutrition.  Using conservative estimates, it's possible that capitalism kills over 10 million people per year, with some estimates as high as 20 million or more. This is due to the inbuilt components of capitalism, such as imperialism, environmental destruction, and inequality. The system requires new markets, monopolies, and the suppression of workers' movements to maintain its power.  The author argues that everything you hear about socialism is capitalist projection, and that those who promote capitalism will try to shift responsibility to individual actions rather than the system itself. The Black Book of Communism is a propaganda piece that reinforces the argument that socialism is inherently violent and oppressive.  In conclusion, the argument that socialism killed 100 million people is a flawed and misleading one. The death toll of capitalism is far higher, and it's time to have a more productive discussion about the consequences of capitalist systems.\nDocument 13\nThe gig economy has taken over the world, particularly in the food delivery and taxi industries. Companies like Uber Eats and DoorDash claim to provide a service by linking businesses and customers to self-employed freelancers, but this has led to workers being treated as independent contractors without benefits or protections.   These jobs are often insecure, unreliable, and pay less than minimum wage. Workers are paid per gig, with the intermediary taking a hefty cut, resulting in them taking home even less. Restaurants that use these services barely make a profit, and the convenience for consumers comes at a cost, with prices being higher than direct orders.  The author shares their personal experience working for Uber Eats, where they were paid significantly less than minimum wage and had to buy their own equipment. They were also not protected in case of an accident, which happened when they were hit by a car while delivering food. Despite being injured, the author was worried about losing their job and being homeless.  The author highlights how the gig economy is designed to exploit workers, with companies taking huge losses to alter the relationship between work and employer. They argue that workers around the world have fought for labor laws, and the gig economy is a loophole to get around these laws.  The author concludes that the gig economy sucks, and capitalism is flawed. They share their personal journey, from working for Uber Eats to becoming a full-time YouTuber, and encourages viewers to support them on Patreon or through other means.\nDocument 14\nA nurse in South Dakota, Jodi Doering, shared a shocking experience on Twitter about treating COVID-19 patients who deny the virus's existence even as they're dying. She described how patients would scream at her for a \"magic medicine\" and claim Joe Biden is to blame, despite being on 100% oxygen and gasping for breath. Doering's tweets went viral, and she appeared on CNN to discuss her experience.  She explained that even when patients are critically ill, they refuse to believe they have COVID-19 and often look for alternative explanations, such as influenza or lung cancer. Some patients even refuse to call their families to say goodbye, as they believe it's not possible for them to be dying from COVID-19.  The nurse's experience highlights the deep-seated denial and misinformation surrounding COVID-19, particularly among some Trump supporters. Doering believes that this denial is not just a talking point, but a genuine belief that people have, which can be damaging and heartbreaking to witness.  The situation is further complicated by the fact that people often take their cues from leaders, and politicians' rhetoric can have a significant impact on public perception. The nurse's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible leadership and the need for accurate information to combat misinformation and denial.\n","topics":"[1] Health\n    [2] COVID-19 (Document: 3, 4, 7, 14): Mentions the pandemic and its effects on individuals and society.\n    [2] Well-being (Document: 8): Mentions the importance of well-being and the need for a comprehensive understanding of reality.\n    [2] Addiction (Document: 10): Mentions the complexities of addiction and recovery.\n    [2] Mental Health (Document: 6, 10): Mentions mental illnesses and addiction.\n    [2] Trauma (Document: 6): Mentions the impact of trauma on individuals and society.\n    [2] Public Health (Document: 9, 14): Mentions the importance of public health and the need for responsible leadership.\n    [2] Substance Abuse (Document: 10): Mentions substance abuse and the challenges of recovery.\n    [2] Healthcare (Document: 11): Mentions the healthcare crisis and the need for action from the government."}
{"summary":"Document 26\nRichard Wolff compares the US government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and military preparedness. He argues that private capitalist enterprises cannot afford to produce and stockpile necessary equipment for both medical and military purposes due to the high risk and low profit.   In the defense sector, the government steps in to buy and stockpile military equipment, taking the risk and cost onto itself. This allows private companies to make a profit by producing and selling equipment to the government.   In contrast, the government did not intervene in the medical sector, allowing private companies to prioritize more profitable ventures. The medical industry, comprising doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies, lobbied against government intervention, fearing it would undermine the private capitalist system.   As a result, the US lacks a comprehensive medical system, despite being one of the most expensive in the world. Wolff concludes that this system is \"crazy\" and that the government should have taken a more active role in medical preparedness, just as it does in the defense sector.\nDocument 27\nA private report commissioned by JPMorgan Chase Bank concludes that climate change is a significant threat to the world, with enormous economic effects. The report advises JPMorgan Chase to reevaluate its investments in the fossil fuel industry, citing market failure. The report suggests that the capitalist system has been flawed in not accounting for environmental costs, which would have made many projects unprofitable if included. This is a significant recognition that markets often overlook important costs, including psychological costs to workers. The report's findings are a departure from the Trump government's stance and align with BlackRock's previous decision to reevaluate its fossil fuel investments.\nDocument 28\nHello, I'm the Incredible Thinking Soup, and I'm here to share my experience working at Winners, a Canadian discount store. I worked there for four years, and it was a wild ride. The store buys surplus merchandise from other retailers and sells it at a discount, but the prices are often arbitrary and inflated. I worked at the return counter, where I dealt with customers who would buy tons of stuff and return what they didn't want. The rules were strict, but the manager would often override them, making me look like the bad guy.  The store was chaotic, with merchandise scattered everywhere, and customers would often trample the items. During final clearance season, the store would be marked down, and huge sections would reach their final price, causing a nightmare for employees. We had to put everything back on the shelves before we could go home, which often took hours.  I also dealt with shoplifting, which was a big problem at the store. The management would make us put our safety on the line to defend their merchandise, which I didn't agree with. I remember one incident where a woman returned Christmas gifts that had been stolen from her car, and it didn't feel good.  The store was also a mess during Christmas, with endless Christmas music and a huge influx of returns on Boxing Day. The amount of returns was staggering, and we had to deal with customers who were angry and frustrated. I also had to deal with customers who would return items with feces in them, which was a regular occurrence.  Working at Winners was a difficult and thankless job, and I was paid minimum wage for four years. The store's management took advantage of us, squeezing us for as much as they could while paying us as little as possible. This is the inevitable trajectory of the working class under capitalism, where we're exploited and cheated, and then rewarded with more debt and less pay.  If you\nDocument 29\nHello, I'm Kay, and this is Skittles, Head of Sanitation. We're reporting from quarantine, analyzing the government and company responses to the pandemic. The situation is rapidly developing, and we'll focus on the UK and US responses.   In the UK, the first confirmed case was on January 31st, but the government didn't take action until March, when they suspended football matches and closed schools. They initially refused to close schools, citing a 3% GDP loss. The government's plan was to let 60% of the population get infected to develop herd immunity, which could result in 800,000 deaths.   In the US, the Trump administration's response was described as \"shit.\" Trump referred to the virus as a hoax before the first US death, and his administration refused German-made test kits, slowing down their response. The Republicans blocked a bill providing 14 days of paid sick leave, and the Democrats compromised it, exempting large and small businesses.   Our society is structured to make it difficult for people to take necessary precautions, and the government's measures are too little, too late. Many people cannot afford to take time off work, and gig economy workers are often excluded from accommodations.   However, companies like Google are now permitting people to work from home, and some governments are providing paid sick leave and other accommodations. This shows that these improvements are possible, but it's about having the will to do it.   The pandemic has exposed the failures of our economic system, and the fact that profits of CEOs and shareholders were always the first concern resulted in governments being weeks behind the curve. Only when things got out of control did they start to make concessions.   I encourage you to get involved with mutual aid groups, unions, and strikes to fight for workers' rights and better living conditions. The pandemic will end, but the day will come when employers\nDocument 30\nThe speaker discusses the golden age of rallying, a period of high-speed racing where drivers pushed the limits of safety. They explain that co-drivers would provide notes to help drivers navigate the track at high speeds, often exceeding 60-70 miles per hour. The speaker notes that this era was exciting to watch but also extremely dangerous, with a high risk of accidents and fatalities.  The speaker references the Tour de Corse, a notoriously dangerous rally, where a driver named Atilio Bottega was killed in 1985. They show a photo of the car, which was severely damaged, and highlight the constant near-misses of spectators and drivers.  The speaker also touches on the safety concerns of the era, noting that drivers often drove recklessly, with one hand on the wheel and the other on a cigarette, and sometimes under the influence of substances like cocaine. They mention that the Ford Works team was involved in a cocaine smuggling racket, using their cars to transport the substance across Europe.  The speaker concludes by highlighting the risks and consequences of this era of rallying, where drivers and spectators alike were often at risk of serious injury or death.\nDocument 31\nThe video discusses the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a South Korean church that has been linked to the spread of the coronavirus. The church, led by Lee Man Hee, has been accused of negligence and refusal to cooperate with health authorities. A 61-year-old woman, Patient 31, who was a member of the church, is believed to have been the source of the outbreak in the region of Daegu, South Korea. She refused to undergo coronavirus screening, citing her church's belief that getting sick is a sin.  The church has been criticized for its secretive nature, with members allegedly being discouraged from seeking medical help. The church's refusal to provide a list of its members and its leaders' refusal to undergo testing have contributed to the spread of the virus. The church has been accused of trying to recruit members from other churches, including the Church of England and the Baptist Convention in India.  The video notes that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus has a history of controversy, including allegations of cult-like behavior. The church's leader, Lee Man Hee, claims to have access to secret knowledge of scriptures, and members are encouraged to withdraw from their friends and family and focus on recruiting new members.  The outbreak in South Korea has resulted in over 5,000 cases of coronavirus, with 60% of the cases linked directly to the church. The Seoul city government has asked prosecutors to press charges against the church's founder and senior members for murder, causing harm, and violating the infectious disease control act. A petition has been signed by over a million people calling for the dissolution of the church.  The video concludes by warning viewers about the dangers of extremist cults and the importance of prioritizing health and safety over religious beliefs. It encourages viewers to wash their hands, get tested if they show symptoms, and not listen to extreme cults that tell them not to.\nDocument 32\nJoe Biden delivered a speech in California after the Super Tuesday results, expressing his excitement and relief at the campaign's resurgence. However, his speech was marred by moments of confusion, including a mix-up between his wife and sister. Critics have raised concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, with some comparing him to Ronald Reagan, who struggled with early stages of Alzheimer's during his presidency.  Biden's campaign has been criticized for its lack of coherence, with some accusing him of being incoherent on stage. His struggles to finish sentences and recognize his wife have raised concerns about his fitness for the presidency. The Democratic establishment has been accused of propping up Biden's campaign, with some comparing it to the film \"Weekend at Bernie's,\" where two men pretend a dead man is alive.  Despite these concerns, Biden has managed to win a primary, and his campaign has been boosted by his image as a \"cuddly Uncle Joe.\" However, this image may be at odds with the reality of his campaign's struggles. Biden's performance in states where he hasn't campaigned has been better than in states where he has been on the ground, suggesting that his presence may actually be a hindrance to his campaign.\nDocument 33\nHello everyone, I'm Luxander, a transmasculine person who's been assigned female at birth. I'm here to talk about my thoughts on top surgery, which is a broad term that can refer to various procedures for transgender people. I've had conflicting feelings about my chest over time, but I've come to realize that my social dysphoria is a major factor in my desire for top surgery. I've learned that I don't feel dysphoric about my chest when I'm alone, but the pressure to be perceived as male in public is overwhelming.  I want to emphasize that I don't think top surgery is necessary for trans people to be valid. The medical consensus is that you don't need dysphoria to be trans, and the goal of transition should be to make you happier, not to hate your body. If you have a chest and you don't like it, or if you're like me and you have intense social dysphoria, then there's no shame in getting top surgery.  However, I also want to caution that surgery is a big decision that requires careful consideration. It's not something to be taken lightly, and it's not something that you should do just to please others. You should think about what's best for you and your body, and make a decision that aligns with your values and goals.  I've been thinking about bottom surgery a lot lately, and I'm more likely to have it than top surgery. But that's a conversation for another time. My goal is to empower people to make their own decisions about transition, and to be happy with who they are. You don't have to prove your transness to anyone, and you don't have to drop thousands of dollars on surgery to be valid.  I hope that my willingness to be vulnerable about this will help someone out there feel like it's okay to be who they are. You are\nDocument 34\nJane Doe, a $60,000 earner, is unaware that nearly 20% of her paycheck goes to healthcare. The US spends double what similar countries pay per person on healthcare but has worse health outcomes. Last year, the US spent over $3 trillion on healthcare. Jane's $1,300 ambulance ride cost $250 out-of-pocket, and her hospital visit, including tests and ER doctor's bill, cost $4,211. Her insurance covered most of it, but she still owes $4,211 due to a $4,000 annual deductible. This is a common issue, as nearly half of insured Americans struggle to pay medical bills before meeting their deductible. The high costs are largely due to insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the healthcare industry being able to charge what they want and increase prices.\nDocument 35\nThe speaker discusses the COVID-19 vaccine and the various ways people are being nudged to take it. They mention paying people to take the vaccine, using incentives rather than sticks, and the role of government and corporations in promoting vaccination. The speaker notes that some countries have compulsory vaccination or stop benefits for those who don't get vaccinated.  The speaker also talks about the cynicism and mistrust towards government and big business, which they believe is justified due to the dubious relationships between the two. They suggest that the government should have no agenda other than aiding and assisting the people they serve.  The speaker mentions the private sector's role in promoting vaccination, citing the example of Qantas considering requiring immunity passports for international flights. They express concern about the new environment where public health and safety are being leveraged to implement new ideas, which seem to have another component due to the involvement of corporations.  The speaker concludes by hoping for a viable vaccine to emerge, but not for a return to normal. Instead, they hope for a move towards a fairer, more just world where power and decisions are closer to the people affected by them, and there is less cynicism and suspicion.\nDocument 36\nThe UK currently has the highest death rate in the world due to Boris Johnson's late lockdown. Home Secretary Priti Patel refused to accept government responsibility for the human disaster, instead blaming comorbidities and ethnic minorities. However, a doctor and frontline worker, Sonia Adesara, disagreed, stating that the government's incompetence and failure to learn from mistakes have led to the high death toll.  Adesara criticized Patel's response, saying it was \"callous\" and \"brazen,\" and that she was essentially appealing to a conspiracy theory by suggesting that the UK's data collection methods were superior to others. Adesara emphasized the need for an honest appraisal of the facts to ensure that the UK can learn from other countries and improve its response to future pandemics.  A hospital worker, who wished to remain anonymous, shared similar concerns, stating that doctors and nurses are frustrated with the government's failure to provide adequate financial support for people to isolate, leading to continued transmission of the virus. The worker also expressed frustration that the government is not learning from other countries, such as Vietnam, which has had a successful response to the pandemic.  The conversation highlighted the need for the UK government to take responsibility for its mistakes and implement policies that can help suppress the virus, such as providing adequate financial support for people to isolate. The participants emphasized that it's not just about following rules, but also about providing the necessary resources for people to stay safe.\n","topics":"[1] Capitalism\n    [2] Economic Solidarity

{"summary":"Document 37\nHello, I'm Russell Brand and I'm Laura Brand. We're here for Hope From Home on World Health Day. Today, we're making squishy soap, a fun and educational activity for kids. It's like Play-Doh that can be used to clean hands. We're using cornflour, liquid soap, cooking oil, and food colouring to make it.   We're adding a half cup of cornflour, four tablespoons of liquid soap, four teaspoons of cooking oil, and a drop of food colouring. We're mixing it all together until it forms a central mass. The result is a delightful light pink soap that can be used to encourage kids to wash their hands.   This squishy soap is perfect for World Health Day, as it promotes hand hygiene and is a fun way to engage kids in this important habit. We're breaking it in half and using it to wash our hands, and we're storing the rest in an airtight container.   This squishy soap works brilliantly, and it doesn't leave a hideous stain. We're grateful for the opportunity to do some crafts and raise awareness for frontline workers and medical teams serving for us all. If you want to donate, please visit HopeFromHomeTiltify.com. Thank you for watching, and we appreciate your support.\nDocument 38\nThe speaker is about to vote against Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination, citing that it's not the right time due to the ongoing presidential election.
