Tonight, the president says he is calling up, quote, thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers in Washington.  And calling on all of the nation's governors to deploy the National Guard to, quote, dominate the streets. We start with another night of violence in Portland that police officers declared a riot. unrest across America.  Here in the nation's capital, violence taking place just steps from the White House. Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman, one of the most well-informed and respected voices on police training and military experience, categorizes our society into three distinct types of people.  Sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs.  Most of us are sheep, in a good way.  We just want to get on with our lives.  We want to live in peace, and we don't want to hurt nor disturb the pasture.  And then there are the wolves, who prey upon the sheep without mercy, the violent criminals, the murderers, who have no interest in peace, but instead, destruction and savagery.  Luckily for the flock, there are the sheepdog.  Those who have dedicated their lives to defending the herd, to maintaining order and harmony.  And for a long time, that's what's happened.  Yes, there have been sheepdog who have gone rogue, who have stepped out of line and done the unthinkable.  But almost always, they were immediately removed from the pack.  But what happens when the sheep start to feel the sheepdogs are indistinguishable from the wolves, writing them off entirely with their shaggy hides, sharp teeth, low growl, and vicious bite?  What happens when the relationship between our citizenry and those we have entrusted to keep us safe collapses?  It's undeniable.  our world is at a crossroads. Eleven police officers have been shot, five killed.  Others want to go even further or disband, dismantle local police agencies. There are fires raging across towns and cities with people losing everything they have worked for in their lives in an instant. People who live in public housing!  You think about what it's like to be a black woman in this neighborhood!  And people just kept coming by.  We basically just had to shut down.  Life savings into opening this sports bar, cleaning up. What does it mean to be the person who protects your society when it no longer wants you?  When does state power go too far? We've had some problems, and we have an obligation, Republicans, Democrats, to work to make sure that police officers are celebrated, but bad cops are held accountable. How should we respond in the face of these abuses?  What degree of freedoms?  should we sacrifice for a sense of security?  What is it like to truly face the wolves in our society on a daily basis?  What is it like to actually live in one of these broken communities, rife with poverty, hopelessness, and state corruption?  And what does the data actually tell us about these issues we are debating?  From the heart of broken communities who demand change, to the violent activists raging in the streets, to the nightly patrols with officers risking their lives and the deadly consequences.  And then to those who are simply caught in the crossfire, the shop owners and the family members who have lost everything that they love.  While some people see law and order, others see oppression and tyranny.  And I'm going to find out why.  Thank you.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The nation is on edge as protests continue across America, with the president deploying thousands of heavily armed soldiers in Washington and calling on governors to deploy the National Guard.

For the most part, Green Parties in the West support and celebrate mass immigration to Western countries.  But this wasn't always the case.  Environmental groups in the 1960s and 70s often took strong stands in favour of population stabilisation.  In 1969, for example, the board of directors of the Sierra Club urged the people of the United States to abandon population growth as a pattern and goal, to commit themselves to limit the population of the United States in order to achieve a balance between population and resources, and to achieve a stable population no later than the year 1990.  In 1978, the club's board of directors urged the federal government to conduct a thorough investigation of US immigration policies and their impact on US population trends.  But in 1996, under pressure from immigration activists, the club's board adopted a position of neutrality.  Around the same time, the group Zero Population Growth dropped most of its work on US population issues and altered its stated goal from stopping to slowing world population growth.  ZPG also changed its name, one of the most vivid and well-recognized among non-profit advocacy groups, to Population Connection.  In 2013, the Sierra Club and other groups actually supported an immigration bill in the Senate that would have greatly increased annual immigration levels, describing it as an immigrant's rights bill while carefully avoiding any mention of its demographic implications.  In this video, I will mostly focus on mass immigration's impact on the United States, but keep in mind all of these arguments apply across the Western world.  Population growth in the United States is almost entirely driven by the federal government's immigration policy.  The Census Bureau predicts that the nation's population will grow from 325 million today to 403 million by 2060, and 96% of that increase of 78 million people is due to the currently starkly high level of immigration.  As outlined in the National Environment Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies are supposed to weigh the environmental impact of any new policies they introduce.  Strangely enough, federal agencies have almost completely ignored these laws when it comes to immigration.  even though immigration-driven population growth has a huge impact on the environment.  A New Yorker journalist called Osita Noanevu once mocked Americans who are concerned about immigration, given that Middle America is full of vast and mostly empty country where 40% of the land is for cows.  A common argument in favour of immigration is to point to the vast open spaces still available in Western nations, or to give examples of how everyone in the US or another country could be crammed into one state or county.  But this ignores the multitude of often unseen environmental impacts individuals have, and the clear evidence from the natural world that we are already overpopulated, on both the global and national level.  The key point about immigration to the West is captured in the fact that when immigrants come to the West, they do not maintain the traditional lifestyle of their home country.  Rather, they quickly adapt to the Western lifestyle.  As they do, they become greater consumers and polluters.  Their individual ecological footprint increases.  For example, the carbon footprint of the average immigrant in the United States is 302% higher than it would have been had he or she remained home.  As well as the obvious increase in their ecological footprint, there are a myriad of debilitating effects immigration has on the environment.  These include, number one, the loss of biodiversity and species extinction.  Overpopulation directly threatens a wide range of endangered animal species in the United States, as human consumption of resources crowds out and poisons other animals.  The Center for Biological Diversity listed the top 10 US species being driven to extinction by overpopulation.  This includes the San Joaquin kit fox, a native of California, which has lost almost all of its habitat as grasslands were converted into farms.  And the Florida panther, whose habitat has been destroyed by urban sprawl from the city centers in Florida.  Florida is also home to 95% of the US breeding population of loggerhead sea turtles, whose nesting area has been converted into recreational beaches.  Both of these species are being wiped out by urban sprawl because Florida's human population has doubled in the past 30 years, due mostly to immigration.  Over 20% of Florida's population are first-generation immigrants, Florida also has the highest net migration of any US state.  Overall, there are 1,300 endangered or threatened species in the United States today, and as a growing population demands more and more resources, from farmland to residential real estate to urban sprawl, these species will have fewer places to live.  Number two, water shortages.  As immigration continues to drive the United States population higher, the demand for water continues to rise, yet the availability continues to decline.  For example, a study out of Columbia University found that massive droughts in the southeastern United States in 2007-2008 were due to the region's exploding population.  which posed the root of the water supply problem.  Georgia's population grew from 6.5 million in 1990 to 9.5 million in 2007, and has now reached 10.5 million.  Nearly a quarter of total water use in Georgia is for public water supply, meaning a higher population puts a larger strain on water availability.  Immigration is also leading to the destruction of freshwater habitats and rivers.  According to the EPA's most recent wadeable streams assessment, which looked at the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the nation's rivers and streams, 28% of US stream miles are in good condition.  compared to the best available reference sites in their regions, 25% are in fair condition, and 42% are in poor condition.  Significantly, less densely populated parts of the country tended to have biologically healthier rivers and superior water quality.  While 45% of western rivers were found in good condition, in the more populous eastern highlands, only 18% were found to be in good condition and over half were in poor condition.  3.  Urban Sprawl.  Urban sprawl, or the expansion of cities, leads to the conversion of farmlands and grasslands into cities.  Sprawl is an environmental problem for lots of reasons, including increased energy consumption, water consumption, air pollution, and habitat loss for wildlife.  Habitat loss is by far the number one cause of species endangerment in the United States.  Between 1982 and 2001, the United States converted 34 million acres of forest, cropland and pasture to developed uses, an area the size of Illinois.  The average annual rate of land conversion increased from 1.4 million acres to 2.2 million acres over this time, and continues on an upward trend.  A paper from the Public Library of Science found that the southeastern United States will expand urbanization by 101 to 192% over the next 50 years.  The number one cause of sprawl, by far, is population growth.  New houses, new shopping centers and new roads are being built for new residents.  In recent decades, cities and states with the highest population growth rates have also shown the most sprawl.  Number four, overcrowded cities.  While the overcrowding of cities could possibly be mitigated by more immigrants moving to rural areas, the reality is that for a whole host of cultural and economic reasons, most settle in or near cities.  Indeed, according to the census, immigrants are currently driving the increased population in most American cities, and the foreign-born population is heavily concentrated in the country's 10 largest metro areas.  On top of the geographic expansion of cities, the actual number of residents in those urban areas will put growing levels of strain on public utilities such as trains.  As immigration continues to fuel population growth, more and more cities will feel the strain of overcrowding making mass transportation more arduous.  For example, In London, passengers wasted almost 400,000 hours because of delays in their journeys in 2017, caused by overcrowding.  In the same year, it was estimated that New York had 75,000 subway delays monthly.  In a 2017 article, the New York Times noted that the major cause of subway delays is a factor that basically did not exist 15 years ago, overcrowding.  But the Times ignored the elephant in the room, the immigration variable in the city's population growth.  In 2015, more legal and illegal immigrants lived in New York than in any city worldwide, 3.2 million.  Solving subway overcrowding when thousands of new immigrants arrive year after year is impossible, regardless of how much new rail is put down.  California has the highest immigrant population in the US, so it's no coincidence that it also has 8 of the 10 most polluted cities in the US.  Number 5, carbon emissions.  Immigration transfers population of people from lower polluting parts of the world to the United States and other Western countries, where CO2 emissions are far higher per person.  According to a CIS study, US immigrants produce an estimated 637 million tonnes of CO2 annually, which is 482 million tonnes more than these immigrants would have produced had they remained in their home countries.  In other words, immigrants more than triple their emissions when they moved to the United States.  Number six, energy consumption.  93% of US energy comes from a non-renewable source, and each source degrades the environment in some way.  The average immigrant more than triples his energy consumption when he arrives in the United States.  Number seven, cattle production.  While cattle production may seem benign, it's not.  Cattle emit methane, cause soil erosion, pollute streams, and require the conversion of forest into rangeland.  Immigration more than quintuples the average immigrant's effect on the production of cattle.  And this is related to number eight, fertilizer consumption.  Although fertilizer increases short-term crop yields, it also salts the earth, poisons the land and water systems.  Fertilizer use is the main contributor to nitrogen pollution.  In Europe alone, the environmental and human health costs of nitrogen pollution are estimated to be anything between 70 and 320 billion euros per year.  Nitrogen emissions such as ammonia, nitrogen oxide and nitrous.","channel.id":"clxmi0nny01tecdvi8ps3cteu","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCGe8kzr_18FIOzjkmzGzzuA","channel.name":"Keith Woods","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/Jyv3LE8oiaGC6Ao0M-rtBOQG5Pz3HKdg4Tb_YLYyYl9e--8tFqlPMmMCK93HmzAhGHydGPu1=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Environmentalists in the West often ignore the impact of mass immigration on the environment.

It is what we use to learn to still the mind so that we might hear the faint whispers of the sublime and come to know our true Self.\n\n(Repeat viewers may wish to skip ahead to 0:57 )\n\nThe modern person's mind is like an untrained puppy dog, jumping all over everyone and barking constantly. Most people think they are in control of their own minds, but one of the first realisations you come to in meditation is the parasitic nature of the mind. For how many counts of breath can you stay focused only on the sensation of the breath without any thoughts creeping in? One? Two? Maybe three? Most people are amazed to discover how little control they have over their own minds! It is a sad fact that most of us are slaves to our minds.\n\nIs this an acceptable condition to you? Would you not prefer to be the master of your own mind? To be able to direct it with laser focus when and where you tell it to go? Meditation is something that starts delivering benefits almost immediately with regular practice. Have you ever been so anxious that you can't sleep because you can't stop the endless flow of worrisome thoughts? Are you ever unable to focus on something you needed to work on because your mind kept wandering off onto something else? Have you ever emotionally lashed out at someone when you didn't mean to? Do you have a mental chatter filled with negative self-talk, a broken record habitually playing on repeat that prevents you from growing into your potential? These are all symptoms of an undisciplined mind.\n\nThis meditation is designed for a total beginner, but you can still enjoy it even if you are more advanced. The goals here are 1) to give you something that you can do every day as part of your routine. It is only about 15 minutes and it is not hard to find 15 minutes in the morning or evening to do a simple meditation. Building up the daily habit is half the battle. And 2) to help guide you through a process of learning to focus your mind where you tell it to go, without leaving too much space in the meditation for your mind to start analysing the experience. You cannot ever turn off your thoughts completely. Just treat them as passing traffic. You would look pretty silly if you got up and started chasing after one particular car, wouldn't you? So treat your thoughts the same and just let them pass by without giving them any interest as you maintain your focus on the meditation.\n\nOnce you have become the master of your own mind, then you will be able to open yourself up to deeper transcendent experiences in meditation. But even if you never get that far, you will still find that you benefit greatly in life from developing greater mental discipline.\n\nWe hope you find this meditation helpful and of course, if you have any questions or struggles, please let us know in the comments and we will try to help as best we can. Some of you may find that you do not like to close your eyes. If this is the case, just stare into the mandala on the screen so that you are not getting distracted by your eyes wandering around the room.\n\nSome further resources for meditation:\nhttps:\/\/dhamma.org - Free 10 day intensive Vipassana meditation courses offered worldwide\nhttps:\/\/www.wccm.org\/ - Meditation resources specifically for Christians\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/Yfore_lHczo - An excellent introductory video on why and how to meditate\n\"Doctrine of Awakening\" by Julius Evola (this book was personally a big influence on me in my own meditation journey)\n\nA big thanks to XURIOUS for the idea for this video and for the soundtrack.

Do not listen to this recording while driving or operating machinery.  Only listen when you can safely relax.  Practice this meditation at a time when you will not be disturbed.  Turn off your phone and any notifications and try to ensure you have a private space where you will not be interrupted.  It is best to use headphones if you can and either sit or lie down in a position you find comfortable with your arms by your sides.  Use the next minute to ensure you are ready to relax and are in a position you find agreeable for the duration of the meditation.  Leave all of the outside world behind you for this session.  In the silence of stillness, we seek deeper knowledge.  By clearing the mind, we seek the primordial wisdom that comes to us on a level that is beyond rational thought.  Whatever challenge the outside world presents to us, those challenges will still be there when we return to them.  But for now, we train the mind to become stronger, to help us face our challenges with greater confidence.  We seek a clear and calm mind, alert but free of thought.  We will observe but not analyze.  now the meditation will begin.  close your eyes inhale deeply filling your lungs completely with life-giving breath and hold it in feeling the oxygen move through your body and now exhale fully.  repeat again inhale deeply Hold it in and as you exhale, release all the tension in your body along with the breath.  Allow your breathing to return to normal and simply observe your breath.  Notice that you are breathing in.  Notice that you are breathing out.  Follow your breath in your own time, concentrating on the sensations of the flowing air.  Moving away from the breath, take your attention to your toes.  Be aware of how they are feeling.  Allow them to relax.  Now bring your attention to the soles of your feet.  Become aware of any sensations there and allow them to relax too.  Bring your awareness to the heels of your feet.  Notice how they feel.  Let any tension you notice here simply disappear with the exhalation of your breath.  Now move your focus to your calves.  Feel what is happening here.  Notice the muscles, and again, allow them to relax, releasing all tension with the breath.  Take your attention to your thighs.  Notice any sensations here.  Feel any tension.  Simply let go.  Let go.  Let go.  Imagine you can take your focus deeper inside your thighs.  Notice that you can feel the deeper muscles inside letting go too.  Imagine you can feel all the way down to the thigh bone, relaxing deeper as you go.  Perhaps you can even feel inside the thigh bone, right down into the marrow of the bone.  Imagine you can allow the bone marrow to relax too.  Feel it happening.  Already you are in a deeply relaxed state.  Now take your attention to your pelvis.  Feel any sensations in this area and breathing in deeply and breathing out deeply.  Let any tensions simply fade away.  Move your awareness to your stomach and lower back.  Draw your breath deeply into your lower abdomen and exhale all your tension.  Imagine you can let your attention go deep inside your torso.  Allow all the organs to relax.  Everything is just easing off, breathing in and breathing out.  Now take your attention to your chest and upper back.  Notice the gentle rise and fall of your breathing.  It is happening all on its own.  You do not need to do anything.  You can simply let this area relax and know that you are fine.  Bring your awareness now to your shoulders.  Feel them letting go as your attention rests there.  With each breath, the muscles loosen and relax.  Allow the tension to release little by little with each breath in your own time, breathing in and breathing out.  Now become aware of your throat and the back of your neck.  With each breath, let any tightness here melt away.  Breathing in, find the tension.  Breathing out, let it go.  Bring your awareness to your jaw and allow it to relax.  Allow your mouth to open slightly and relax your entire face.  Move your attention to the back of your eyes.  Let your awareness rest here for a moment.  Allow the eyes to relax and loosen your forehead muscles.  Finally, bring your attention to the area of your nostrils and upper lip.  Feel the air moving here as you breathe in and breathe out.  Notice how the air feels.  Take several breaths in your own time, paying attention to the sensations in this area.  You are now in a very relaxed state.  Tensions have eased off and you can simply be.  Notice that you have become very still.  You can just rest.  Observe your breath rising and falling.  You may feel a comfortable tingling throughout your body.  This is your body healing and repairing.  The more you relax, the more you are able to relax.  It is very natural, the most natural thing in the world.  You are simply coming back to where you are, to who you are.  feeling sensing and knowing being aware of your own presence you are here now feeling the inner stillness the stillness that is always there beneath everything else timeless and eternal.  Know that having accessed this state you find it easier to access it again.  Each time it becomes easier for you to find this stillness because it is always there for you.  Take a few moments to observe the stillness and to observe your own being.  Now it is time to return back to ordinary awareness.  Gradually bring your attention to the room you are in.  Becoming aware of your fingers and toes, wiggle them slightly.  Breathe in more fully if you need to, drawing breath deeply into your abdomen and gently stretch your body.  Open your eyes when you are ready and face the rest of your day with renewed vitality.","channel.id":"clxmi0p4m02uvcdvipkmqi9in","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCfYgocARmndnLrO5HHMXqrg","channel.name":"PhilosophiCat","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVq4jSOOKUdHCkDnRY80XTs2SW2b1cQCrgdrldX=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"This guided meditation aims to help you achieve a relaxed and alert state.

Pretty obvious, whether it be because you prefer it here, or maybe it's just necessity, or you're in a lockdown city where you'll get curb stomped by the police for leaving your house.  In the face of all this, we need to discuss our digital image because we are no longer given the same human graciousness of meeting face to face and judging an individual right there and then.  Even if we do meet in person for a job interview or a date, usually there's a bit of pre-meeting research done and we become a series of Google image searches and Facebook profile results.  God forbid someone find your cringy DeviantArt profile, or even worse, a potential employer sees a tagged photo of you from a party in 2007 where you dressed as Beyonc\u00e9 and wore a little too much bronzer.  Of course, I am well aware of the fact that my digital image is a total mess all over the place.  I've semi-made peace with it.  But in my understanding of having a widely defamed, praised, and overall controversial reputation online, I have some warnings and predictions I feel are necessary to make as the rest of your images become ever more archived on the internet as well.  Initially, when I got into media, I had this very naive view that if someone lies about you, that's illegal.  If someone publishes something that's false, that's illegal.  We hear it all the time.  If your image is tarnished, sue, complain, go to the courts.  This is basically a farce.  If you don't know, I'm just going to use this as an example.  I'm in a bit of a tiff with Wikipedia at the moment.  Currently, there are a number of editors monitoring my page and ensuring it is as horrifying as humanly possible to any normal person who may go read it.  And it's not just me.  There are activist users such as Grayfell who seemingly spend all their day obsessing over pages of people like Andy Ngo, Jack Posobiec, Douglas Murray, and others just to... Name a few I've seen edited recently.  Grayfowl even removed all mention of violence from Antifa's Wikipedia page.  Clearly a very reliable and bipartisan encyclopedia.  My introduction doesn't include anything about me being a filmmaker or an author or basically what I'm known for.  They just straight up decide to say, alt-right white nationalists.  And in fact, if you looked at the page a month ago, it said straight up white supremacist, full stop.  No references, no proof, no links, nothing.  If you try to edit the page to fall in with Wiki's own guidelines, such as including my rejection of far-right labeling and identification as a conservative, you'll actually just get banned from editing the page altogether.  I won't get into all the violations and defamation in there because it would be a whole video in and of itself, but it got to the extent at one point where for a decent stretch of time my page actually said I was an advocate for nuking the city of Melbourne.  Just throw genocidal maniac in there for a few months, why don't you?  Wikipedia.  But this, I mean, once again, this isn't exactly what I wanted to talk about today.  The reason I bring this up is because any sane person would say that shouldn't be legal.  You can sue them.  Imagine if a potential employer thought I genuinely wanted to nuke cities.  That's... That might be an awkward conversation.  It might hurt some opportunities.  And while of course I have sent a notice to Wiki's legal team, suing Wikipedia isn't actually an option for people.  They are considered a platform, not a publisher.  So that means the people who publish content are responsible for said content.  not the platform itself, i.e.  Wikipedia.  Some of you may have heard about this under section 230.  Now, when it comes to any one Wikipedia page, it's like a giant quilt work of people's writing.  It's not like you can go and sue one person for an entire page.  hundreds of people have stitched that page together, hundreds of people using anonymous usernames.  So you'd first have to go and file for a Norwich order, which costs a lot of money to find out who an editor was, and then you'd have to do that for potentially hundreds of editors, which costs even more money.  Then you'd have to actually file a defamation suit, which costs insane amounts of money, especially if you're going to do that against hundreds of people.  which makes this course of action essentially impossible for the average person and even the more upper middle class person.  So when individuals say, well, you can't just lie about people, that's illegal.  No, defamation is only illegal against rich people.  And that's just the damn truth.  You have to be able to afford to enforce this law.  And perhaps you're thinking, well, that's just Wikipedia.  What about a normal publisher?  I have had the most cut and dry cases in the world.  Such as Channel 7 saying I self-identify as a fascist and a racist.  Maybe you could get away with calling me those things as your opinion because I'm a public figure, but you certainly can't claim.  that's how I describe myself.  I couldn't afford the case at the time.  Costs thousands to even begin the process.  Then around $500 per hour for... whoever is working on your case, and that may be multiple people, and these cases can and do take years upon years.  I got into media as a teenage cocktail waitress who had to search for a change in her car seat just to fill up gas in the car.  And there are many dissident voices out there who are in the same position as me.  Many commentators who have had article after article with completely false information just build up over time without any recourse and even if you are extremely lucky and you're able to find a lawyer to do things pro bono or you get to a point where you can afford to combat articles lying about you in the past the statute of limitations is typically one year so essentially defamation is legal as long as your victim is too poor to combat it and you never have to worry about them saving up the money one day because after a year you're in the clear.  What blows my mind about this is if you asked the average person on the street, whether they'd prefer a journalist, call them a pedophile in a popular newspaper or get punched in the face, I reckon.  most people would opt for getting punched in the face because you can just put an ice pack on it and move on with your life.  Whereas that article will follow you around through your relationships, your job prospects, all of it.  Yet if you assault someone, you'll go to jail.  But if you're a journalist who defames and destroys someone's life, there's almost no punishment.  And there's very little recourse for the average person who is the victim of their lies.  I'm just using myself as an example, and some of you may think, well, you asked for this attention, happens to every public figure, boo-hoo, Lauren, get over it.  Fair enough, but it's important to remember.  this happens to regular people who aren't political, who didn't ask for any attention at all, all the time.  I read a horrible story just before making this video about a Polish photographer who took photos of a Santa sleigh crash and was then quoted in the UK media as saying the couple who crashed were drunk and were putting other people in harm's way.  The only problem was they were not drunk, it was a horrible incident, and the photographer Molandinsky had never given them any quote at all.  But these English clickbait sites needed some context for the wild photo they had found and wanted to publish, so they just invented the context and bigger and bigger outlets continued to republish the story.  The photographer's reputation was destroyed in his town.  People hated him, thought he had intentionally slandered the couple.  The poor guy didn't leave his house for a year and had to go on medication to deal with his anxiety over it all.  He begged the outlets to correct things and never got any response.  The couple who were accused of being drunk had their business severely damaged and also attempted to get the stories taken down by trying to sue, but the case was considered not to be a public interest by the prosecutor they approached.  Polish media have extremely strict standards for quotations and accuracy, so many people in the town just refused to believe their side of the story.  All of their lives, the photographer, the couple, their mental health, just completely destroyed and No punishment for any of the outlets that did this to them.  Now, to tie this all in with my warnings and predictions for the future, it's important to look in contrast at the other side of this, those who are able to fight defamation battles.  You look at someone like Ben Shapiro, for example.  He said some things that I wouldn't even think to say, like... Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage.  While this is certainly an offensive quote, we as people are not the sum total of the most offensive tweet or quote you can find that we've made.  And while it has been brought up once or twice by media, Ben Shapiro certainly is not summed up by quotes like this.  He's judged and reported on as a mainstream conservative figure, whereas newer dissident figures are given a much harsher judgment, certainly if they were to say something like this.  The reason is, realistically, if a mainstream paper even thought to call Ben Shapiro alt-right or racist, he'd have a lawyer on retainer that would deal with it instantly.  I'm glad he can do this.  I want this to be done to papers more.  But should the laws around something as important as people's reputations really be a buy-your-way-to-justice system?  And this would be a bad enough problem as it is, but with the internet, we're now seeing a whole new sphere of reputational manipulation being created.  The wealthy don't just have more of an ability to stop defamation, they have the ability to stop criticism in some cases and even scrub their indiscretions entirely.  Of course, a famous example is Harvey Weinstein.  Although this didn't last forever, Harvey was able to blackmail and literally hire spies to threaten women to protect his reputation and prevent the release of negative articles.  And once you've achieved these preliminary steps of avoiding defamation, preventing actual criticism, and even covering up crimes, as a wealthy elite, you can even invent an entire world where you have a fake spotless reputation.  In a fascinating article called How the 1% Scrubs Its Image Online, the Wall Street Journal investigated the story of a man named Jacob Gottlieb.  who was trying to start a new hedge fund but having troubles because his last one had totally failed and was mired in scandal.  So what did he do?  He hired a Texas-based company which specialized in reputational management called StatusLab.  Articles started popping up all over the web about what an incredible man he was and what a stunning reputation he had, some saying he had even donated to hospitals and charities.  The problem was none of this was true.  And even the details which were, were simply fake articles written to whitewash his reputation.  And StatusLab were able to push SEO and ensure these fake articles were at the top of Google instead of his scandals.  Once again, he was obviously exposed, but there are many, many people who hire these firms who never get caught.  And the cost?  Well, tens of thousands of dollars.  It was a friend of mine who told me about this story in the first place after he inquired with Status Labs and told me their just beginning quote fee was 20 grand.  Which, that seems huge for you and I, but for the wealthy... a small price for a perfect reputation because reputation is everything in the world right now.  One Google search means you get the job or you don't, you get the date or you don't, but it doesn't really matter anymore if you're actually decent or not because decency is up for sale.  Consider this.  The media write a story about some high schooler making a racist comment.  Turns out, they got the details wrong or exaggerated what happened, and that high schooler and their parents cannot afford for the life of them to sue for defamation.  By the time they can, it's past the statute of limitations, And this follows the kid around for the rest of his life.  Meanwhile, there could be a total asshole bully from his school who beat people up and, I don't know, was a serial blackfacer like Justin Trudeau or something.  But that kid is able to have their parents pay to threaten a newspaper and almost certainly get an article removed if it's exposed.  And if that doesn't work, they'll just hire an organization like Status Lab.  to scrub their child's image on Google and social media.  They'll then buy their child followers and likes to ensure they seem popular and well-respected in the community, which doesn't even cost that much if you're willing to throw your integrity out the window.  The kid will probably then put vegan influencer and social rights activist in their bio and add the link to their Instagram with 20,000 followers on all their resume.  If you thought we had it bad with simply a wealth divide, now we're going to have a total reputation divide.  One that is entirely held up by lies, fake followers, false reputation scrubbing, false articles defaming individuals, and censorship of any defense those people may have had.  Which is terrifying because what this is going to result in is the elites are going to increasingly be able to paint themselves as saints and gods in the eyes of the public.  while anyone who questions them will be pummeled to the ground with false defamatory articles, pummeled by bad SEO ratings, banned from even giving their side of the story, and unable to have any recourse to any of this.

The World Health Organization has declared coronavirus a global pandemic.  We begin tonight with the U.S.  and our nation on the brink.  Terrifying scale.  Scaling bushfires.  Unemployment to its highest level since the Great Depression.  Overnight, Minneapolis on fire.  Good year to take off, I suppose.  Seriously, though, I hope you all have been keeping relatively safe and healthy throughout all of this chaos.  Now, it's been just over one year since I stepped away from social media.  Some of you may not have even noticed that I was gone.  I dropped borderless, left a small note, and dipped.  And I suppose because I was so vague, I really left room for people to impose their own narratives on my departure.  A lot of things have been said about me since I left, some far more slanderous than others, and I'm sure I'll address that at some point.  However, I don't want to waste this video in particular mud wrestling with pigs, especially when you just get dirty and they just get happy.  So instead, how about we talk about where I've actually been and what my actual motivation was for leaving politics?  Well, firstly, I have some really exciting news that many of you had no idea about last year which is that I was married and pregnant and I just found out about my son right before the release of Borderless.  I have always kept my cards close when it comes to my family because unfortunately the modern political coliseum seems to have zero boundaries whatsoever or respect for people's privacy.  But I did decide to share a tiny bit this January on my Instagram just because it's something that has brought me so much joy and is such a blessing in these crazy times.  It was pretty hard to not at least put a bit of it out there for you.  But definitely it was a very special thing for me and an important thing for the first part of my son's life and his birth to be just for myself and just for my family.  None of the social media or the world's eyes on it.  That was just for us.  Another thing I did was I took some time to get back into education and to nurture a more contemplative part of my soul and my faith and really recenter what was important in my life like family, friendships, and community.  It is definitely an interesting experiment to take a step back from the internet for at least a few months.  See what's left of your life when you take away the social media, the internet fame, and the online tribes you're a part of.  Have you built something meaningful outside of that?  Is your purpose still there when the screen is off?  There was definitely a point where I don't think I could have said yes to this.  And there are probably far too many people that are Gen Z or millennial like me that have been in that boat before.  which brings me to another point, and that is family was not the only reason I took a step back, although it was a main one.  I had planned to take an extended break from the internet and media for a while anyways, just to get my head out of the fishbowl and observe with a sober view the world that I was a part of.  And to be real with you guys, the world I was a part of, especially earlier on in my YouTube career, was a very unhealthy one.  And I mean, To be fair, most of you have probably been on Twitter before, so pointing out the toxicity of political or even just internet culture in general is probably the least shocking thing you have heard this year.  Wow, the internet is toxic and it's bad for you.  Shocking revelation, Lauren.  Seriously, though, I do want to be clear, actually, that when I'm talking about this toxic culture, especially in politics, I am not talking about regular everyday conservatives or regular liberals.  What I am talking about is the forever onliners.  The people who have lost themselves to a character or entire personality composed of partisan talking points.  The extremists who can no longer see the humanity in their political opponents or even just other groups based on race or gender.  The leaders of all these movements that are fighting over the last shreds of a dwindling social talking point market.  And the cults that have seemingly formed where Everyone views themselves as the hero in the story whilst anyone on the other side is irredeemable scum.  Then of course there's just the 24-hour news cycle in general which seems to make anyone involved.  just focus in on people's worst moments, their mental breakdowns and bad arguments like a shark searching for blood.  We have entered an age where your worst two minutes will define you for the rest of your life because that's what people want to click on.  A world void of nuance one where even serious political debate has just been substituted for partisan sneering and mockery.  argumentum ad cringe if you will where we seem to have taken the position that if something can be mocked that it can't possibly be right as if human instinct about what's laughable is somehow divinely inspired.  this whole mess this whole just disaster that I was a part of.  It is something that I began realizing in people around me, and then I started to see within myself as well, that I was actively assisting in creating this culture of entertainment and hot take politics.  So, I think it was mid-2018, I decided I wanted to change the way I approached things and do only documentaries instead.  A more meaningful deep dive into the issues that I cared about.  And I truly loved how this experience went.  Instead of some big dramatic closing paragraph to my last documentary borderless concluding the situation one way or the other, we concluded that there were two sides to every story.  That perhaps everyone involved was a victim of political and business corruption.  That these big polarizing issues are so often far more gray than we realize.  That the migrants we sat with in the camps and on the shores of Turkey That were taking dinghy boats to what they saw and believed was going to be a better life promised to them by traffickers and politicians.  That that was a human story, a human struggle worthy of being told.  The same human struggle that I've always recognized amongst people in Europe who feared the loss of their culture and the economic and social impacts to change in their home.  too often in media is treated as if these experiences are mutually exclusive.  And I used to have this perspective as well, that because the mainstream media or the leftist media was already telling one side of the story, that it was my job to tell the other.  But in reality, it should be everyone's job to show both.  And just because you see others not doing it doesn't mean you should partake in a childish tit for tat.  Otherwise, you're not going to get the real story at all.  You need a full picture in order to come to meaningful, insightful conclusions.  And this is one of the big reasons that I've decided to come back now.  I am seeing absolute chaos going on in the world and very little room for nuance or genuine thoughtful content.  Our news is getting summed up by spliced Twitter videos made to promote one cause or another name calling, doxing, hashtag wars.  It's really hard to watch and I really believe that people are longing for a more sober approach because the world is a lot more complex than just all cops bad, all cops good.  Post black square or you're a racist or black people are all just looters and rioters.  I'm not some radical centrist here but I think we all know deep down These massive cultural issues have human stories to them, to every side of them, and too often we prefer to just ignore the humanity in the stories that don't quite fit with our narrative.  And you know, in my traveling and my on-the-ground work with Borderless, even just life experience over this last year, a big way that I've changed personally, and one of the best things I've learned, is to approach things with a sense of, I don't know everything.  because none of us do.  I think the people in charge of public discourse in our society too often are expected to be experts in everything.  Celebrities, politicians, social commentators were literally coached to avoid ever saying the phrase, I don't know.  You find a way around it, you give a super general answer or you read the answer your publicist wrote for you and you better be able to give a smile and a word to every social and political crisis.  the news pops out that week or you're a moron or you're cancelled for being silent.  And what this has led to is this bizarre culture at the moment where everyone has to take a stance on things even if they feel completely uneducated on a subject.  I have friends of mine posting black squares on their Instagram and messaging me after saying, I have no idea what this means but I don't want people to hate me.  I have other friends of mine in acting and media who have had their publicists or agents force them to make statements through gritted teeth on recent political issues because it's bad for their career if they don't.  And quite frankly, it doesn't matter what your cause is to me, even if it's something I'm extremely supportive of, even if it's something super basic that we should all understand and agree on, at no point in a well-functioning society Should every single person, every single corporation, every single politician, beauty guru, appliance shop, and even your Xbox feel the need to put out a political statement for fear of the masses taking their silence as betrayal and socially or even financially ostracizing and destroying them?  Compelled speech just never really ends well.  Because what happens when that message isn't so kind?  What happens when you create a culture like this and that message becomes one that is violent or oppressive and no one is allowed to question it and everyone is afraid of speaking up, let alone to even be silent on an issue?  It's not like things like this haven't happened in history before.  And when people get into lockstep, it is very hard to get them out because no one wants to take that fall.  It's creating an extremely dangerous precedent and I don't want that precedent to ever be set one way or another.  And this is why going forward in documentary making, I don't plan to be a part of any political groups.  I want to be open to any conclusion when I investigate an issue.  We have got way too much egoistic certainty in media.  And that's something I really hope to work to pull myself away from.  And you know, I just want to leave it at that with going forward because I was initially thinking about doing this video where I clarify my beliefs.  I explained that I'm not this extremist that people think I am, that I'm just curious for the truth without hate.  And I wrote this whole thing explaining it.  And then I kind of thought to myself, I'm like, Why do I care so much about these people that are misrepresenting me?  When the kind of growth that I'm pursuing as an individual and as a creator isn't one forced by a crowd of progressives demanding an apology tour and that I change my opinions on videos I've made or they'll ban me and cancel me.  Because that's not growth.  That's just more appealing to a mob and it's not real.  And I know people that can chant progressive slogans through gritted teeth to keep their jobs... or because their agents told them to do it.  And it's just not something I can do.  I don't see it.  It's not genuine.  It's not real.  And I think people should know that.  I think they should know that a lot of the celebrities and the people they look up to in media and politics and their YouTube heroes that make posts about politics, they don't always believe those things in private.  They're doing it because they don't want to be axed or guillotined by the public right now.  And you know, I also want to mention that I also don't see the possibility for growth when I'm constricted by the expectations of an online right-wing tribe.  That I hold certain beliefs or that I'm not a part of them anymore.  Because I also have questions and criticisms within the right as well.  There are some issues there.  I want to just genuinely look at the world even if it bursts my bubble of what my preconceived notions may have been.  So, maybe because I've been gone so long and I've kind of made these statements, people will want some sort of statement on where my views are at now.  Well, I am growing as a person.  I don't know everything and I am excited to learn more and I want to let my work speak for me going forward.  If anything, I'd say I've taken the real life pill.  I think people are multidimensional, complex beings, and they are worthy of trying to understand.  You can't sum them up in a tweet you found six years ago, and you can't sum them up as a race or a gender, which too often polarizing political internet communities try to do.  It really sometimes feels like we are just caught up in this massive maelstrom of lies and I mean, Peterson has mentioned this before too.  We just need to, we need people to start speaking honestly and a lot of the problems we're facing could be fixed.  We need to stop with the carefully constructed statements to avoid social and political landmines or the chaotic partisan talking points.  Anyways, I could talk for ages on this subject, but I do want to eventually get to the big ticket item here.  And that is that after a year of being away and considering all of this and looking at the absolute state of the world right now, I want to make documentaries again.  And I want to make some damn good ones because I've seen how valuable it has been for my own life and how valuable it is for so many others.  I still to this day get tons of emails telling me how Borderless really changed people's perspectives and how people wish I'd make more content like that.  I get your messages.  I read them all.  I appreciate them.  I know I can't always reply, but I do read them all and genuinely they really convinced me that I should come back and try to change some of the things in this world instead of being so jaded by media.  So, coming back into media I really want to go forward approaching the world with a genuine open mind.  Open to both the rational and emotional aspects of being human.  Not facts over feelings but facts and feelings because facts help us operate in this world but love and compassion are what make it worthwhile.  We have to show people why the statistics and graphs matter.  Rather than commentating with such confidence and zealotry from the stands, I want to enter the arena and give those on the ground a voice.  Instead of taking down the straw men, I want to highlight the steel men on both sides, offering the best and brightest to challenge your mind.  I don't want to set my eyes on any exact documentary yet because there are at least a dozen I'm considering.  Definitely what's going on in the States is a big one.  However, I really want to invite you guys to be a part of the documentary making process as well.  helping me narrow down and decide which documentary I'm going to make, seeing how the creation, filming, and editing occurs behind the scenes.  Plus, this will really help finance the creation of these documentaries themselves.  I often think about how it would be significantly cheaper, less stressful, just doing four-minute videos, social commentary with my webcam on the latest terrible Vice article that came out.  There's definitely... No overhead cost, security, flights, hotels, sleepless nights, or getting arrested by the Turkish police or military.  Hell, I mean, man, documentaries are stressful.  There was one Airbnb we stayed in in Spain where we literally had to boil like four pots of water for an hour if you wanted to take a bath that week.  And that was just... how it went.  You know, I'm going to be real.  It's not easy making documentaries.  They are stressful.  They are hard work.  And there are a lot easier things to do in media.  But it's doing something meaningful.  It's not just taking shots from a comfortable studio or living room.  It's really exploring what's going on on the ground.  And that's what makes it worthwhile.  So I really do hope some of you consider joining me on that mission.  If you'd like, you can go and check out the links below this video and join me on Subscribestar because I can't really be on Patreon, can I?  I also know, though, that it is tough times, so if you can't support me, no worries.  I always intend to make my documentaries free to watch because the intention of them is for as many people to have their perspectives broadened as possible.  So I suppose going forward, I will see some of you on my next live stream on Subscribestar, where I'll be answering your questions and chatting about my pitches.  And as for everyone else, I'll probably see you at my next documentary announcement once it's confirmed.  I am now going to go sing the Bananas in Pajamas theme song for the 400th time this week to my son, and probably get covered in sweet potato mush, but... While I'm not doing that, I really look forward to doing my second favorite thing, which is creating again and hopefully bringing back some meaningful, sane conversation into this crazy world.  Genuinely, I hope for the best for you all and God bless.  I'll see you soon.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello everyone, it's been a year since I stepped away from social media, and I'm back to share my experiences and thoughts on the world.

Odin, the chief god of the Vikings, had an eight-legged horse called Sleipnir, and pre-Viking age depictions of Odinic warriors are sometimes mounted.  The association of Odin with horses is very old and not limited to Norse sources.  In Germany, he was called Wotan and is invoked in the second Merseburg charm to heal a horse's leg.  Horses were valuable possessions, so it makes sense that an aristocratic god like Odin was the patron of a horse cult, and it's easy to understand why horse owners were anxious about their prized possessions being injured.  The charm was written in High German by a cleric at an abbey in the 10th century, but is certainly of pagan origin.  Foll and Wodan were riding to the woods, and the foot of Baldr's foal was sprained.  So Synthkund, Suna's sister, conjured it, and Freya, Vola's sister, conjured it, and Wodan, conjured it as well he could.  Like bone sprain, so blood sprain, so joint sprain, bone to bone, blood to blood, joint to joints, so may they be glued.  Now this same exact formula survived up in Sweden as recently as the 19th century in several different versions.  This one was written down in 1860.  A very similar charm is found in the Atarvaveda, which was compiled in India between 1200 BC and 1000 BC.  It uses basically the exact same formula.  That bone of thine which, injured and burst, exists in thy person, Datar, shall kindly knit together again, joint with joint.  Thy marrow shall unite with marrow, and thy joint with joint, the part of thy flesh that has fallen off, and thy bone shall grow together again.  thy marrow shall be joined together with marrow.  the skin grow together with skin.  thy blood thy bone shall grow.  thy flesh grow together with flesh.  fit together hair with hair and fit together skin with skin.  thy blood thy bone shall grow what is cut.  join thou together o plant do thou here.  rise up go forth run forth as a chariot with sound wheels.  firm fellow and strong knave stand upright firmly.  similar versions also exist in a christian form in ireland where they are preserved in very recent accounts collected in the folklore archives of university college dublin.  this one for example was contributed by a schoolchild in county cork.  in nineteen thirty eight.  our Lord God went a-hunting through moors and through mountains.  his foal's foot rested.  he sat down and blessed it saying from bone to bone from flesh to flesh every sinew in its own place.  now this Irish example was not borrowed from the Vikings or the Norse who invaded Ireland.  Rather, it is an indigenous version and derives from the story of the Second Battle of Maiturid, where Mirch heals the arm of Nuada, the king of the gods, called Tuadadana, using the same Indo-European magic formula as was normally used on horses elsewhere.  I should point out that variants of the spell in which Jesus is invoked can also be found in Scotland.  And there's also a variant found in Finland.  Going back to the Norse, they also used horses for curses too.  namely the N\u00ed\u00f0stang or shame pole.  In two Viking sagas, Egilsaga and Vatnsdala saga, a ritual is described in which a horse's head is severed and placed on a pole and then faced towards an enemy so that it serves both as an insult and as a type of curse to harm them.  The runes carved on the pole seemed just as important as the horse head in this ride, with the runes describing and causing the harm itself, while the head served to direct that harm in the desired direction.  I urge you all to go and watch my much longer video on horse sacrifices in Indo-European religion if you want to understand why horses were the most important animal in the Indo-European religion of the Bronze Age steppes.

Welcome back to my channel.  Somewhere amidst watching the world go to hell over the past few months, I've often found myself considering the question of obedience, particularly in the context of a government citizen relationship.  Essentially, I was wondering why is it that so many people choose to submit to an authority specifically when the people are discontent with said authority?  And the reason I asked this question is because it seems to me that people both on the left and the right in the United States and in many other countries as well are becoming increasingly unhappy with the state of their governments.  and their societies overall.  Undoubtedly, we have seen a lot of leftists from movements like Antifa and Black Lives Matter manifesting their discontent through acts of violence recently.  But what about the millions of other people who are equally unhappy, perhaps due to COVID restrictions, the collapsing economy, the Black Lives Matter riots, being unable to attend church or a loved one's funeral?  What about these people who aren't even so much as peacefully protesting?  Why aren't we seeing more acts of civil disobedience?  Naturally, the first and most obvious answer that jumped out at me was fear.  People fearing repercussions either from the authorities or even from their own peers.  For example, I've seen multiple videos now of people harassing and assaulting other people as punishment for not wearing a mask.  On the other hand, however, I didn't think that the reason that people were obeying despite their discontentment extended to fear alone.  Human beings are just not that simple.  Fortunately, I happened to get a much more satisfying answer while reading part one of Jean Sharpe's, The Politics of Nonviolent Action, because I'm very interested in the process of nonviolent action, and this is what I advocate for.  In this book, Jean Sharpe goes through the seven reasons why men and women, of course, obey.  And I'm going to briefly quote from each of them.  But if you're interested in reading the full book, which I highly recommend you do, I will link it in the description.  Starting off, the first reason for obedience is habit.  As everybody knows, habits are extremely difficult to break.  And even if we do have gripes about the state of things, accepting our imperfect reality seems better to us than taking on the daunting prospect of change.  Conversely, the book explains that habit ceases to be a reason for obedience in times of political crisis, kind of similar to what we're experiencing now as a consequence of COVID.  Despite many of us not wanting to alter our habits, our habits were forcibly altered for us.  Many of us could no longer go to work, visit our friends, attend church, and so on.  The second reason for obedience is moral obligation, which is obviously a motive that is very often found in religion.  But politically speaking, the book suggests that some see it as a moral obligation to, one, obey for the good of society, two, due to the ruler having superhuman factors such as being a supernatural being or a deity, which isn't something that I think applies to too many Americans, although I have seen a few boomers here and there refer to Trump as some kind of chosen one.  Three, people see it as a moral obligation to obey because they perceive the command as being legitimate owing to its source and issuer.  For example, a mayor or a police officer.  And four, people see it as a moral obligation to obey due to conformity of commands to accepted norms.  For example, most people believe that a command such as not committing murder is a moral command and therefore they obey it.  The third reason for obedience is self-interest.  And this is perhaps one of the more common motives nowadays.  For example, most big corporations are amoral and seek to piggyback off of current social and political trends in order to gain money status and approval.  Just look at all the corporations that suddenly became champions of social justice after the death of George Floyd.  None of them gave a crap about police brutality and Black Lives Matter until it became in their interest to care.  This self-interest can of course also extend to individuals.  Famous and non-famous people have a lot to gain by falling in line.  Or as the book points out, there is also a negative self-interest wherein the person doesn't obey simply because they're going to gain something but so they won't lose everything.  Their reputations, jobs, social standing, and future career prospects.  The fourth reason for obedience is psychological identification with the ruler.  meaning that people have a close emotional connection with the ruler, regime, or the system.  I imagine you would have encountered a lot of this in, for example, communist Russia or Nazi Germany.  The fifth reason for obedience is an extremely common one today, and that is zones of indifference.  meaning that even if people are not fully satisfied with the state of things, they have a margin of indifference or a margin of tolerance for the negative aspects of their society and government.  The sixth reason for obedience is the most obvious reason, and it's the one that I mentioned at the beginning of this video, and that is fear of sanctions, which generally involve the threat or the use of some form of physical violence against the disobedient subject and induce obedience by power merely coercive, a power really operating on people simply through their fears.  And lastly, the seventh and final reason for obedience is the absence of self-confidence among subjects.  Meaning that many people simply don't have sufficient confidence in themselves, their judgment, and their capacities to make themselves capable of disobedience and resistance.  Thanks to the internet, I observe this motive quite often.  Thousands of people decry on the daily that they're miserable with the state of things and yet they do nothing because they have no confidence in their personal ability to lead, to organize a peaceful protest, to start a movement, and so on.  One consequence of the lack of self-confidence is a tendency to avoid responsibility, to seek to delegate it upward, and to attribute greater authority to superiors in the hierarchy than is in fact merited.  People lacking self-confidence may seek a ruler, a leader, a despot, a tyrant who will relieve them of responsibility for guiding their present and their future.  Wrote Rousseau, slaves lose everything in their chains, even the desire of escaping from them.  They love their servitude, as the comrades of Ulysses loved their brutish condition.  Even where subjects wish to alter the established order, they may remain submissive because they lack confidence in their ability to act effectively in bringing about the desired changes.  As long as people lack self-confidence, they are unlikely to do anything other than obey, cooperate with, and submit to their rulers.  Even if Gene Sharp missed a few of the reasons why people choose to obey, I certainly think that he hit upon the fundamental ones, which I think that many of us can use to better understand our own motivations.  It seems that in many countries, people regard their governments as immense bastions of power, far too powerful to ever be challenged, for example, by a nonviolent resistance from its people.  But where does this power of government come from?  Is the power inherent and self-perpetuating?  I fully agree with Jean Sharp's argument that a government's power is dependent on the goodwill, decisions, and support of the people.  In other words, a government only has power because people give it power through their cooperation and obedience.  Therefore, if we are unhappy with the state of our governments and overall societies, It's our duty to rectify the issues that are plaguing them.  Where we will end up is our own responsibility and will be the result of our own choice, conscious or unconscious, of whether or not we are going to obey.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.

So we're talking about immigrants from Jamaica, Barbados, other places in the West Indies.  and specifically their children, their American-born children.  So these are people you could not tell apart from black, like you couldn't tell if I didn't tell you that I wasn't the child of a Jamaican immigrant or something, right?  Mm-hmm.  And the thing about these is that these two populations differ in many ways.  Some ways are very hard to quantify, but they differ culturally.  They differ for all kinds of reasons, partially because the kind of immigrant who gets out of a Jamaica differs systematically.  It's going to be disproportionately intelligent, disproportionately hardworking.  Whatever the traits are that get you from Jamaica to New York, say.  That's a cluster of attributes that makes that population differ.  But there's one thing that is not different, which is they are subjected to whatever level of systemic racism exists.  So Thomas Sowell has done good work on.  Back in the 70s, he showed that second-generation West Indians living in the same city as black Americans were earning 58% more.  So they're both being treated to whatever degree badly by white people.  Whatever system you want to suppose is holding black people back is equally affecting both of them.  The Columbia sociologist Van Tran has a great essay in which this difference is brought out, you find neighborhoods of black Americans right next to neighborhoods of black West Indians in New York, they're equally segregated from white people.  So it gets rid of the idea that being segregated by a cell or living around people who only look like you is inherently a disadvantage.  It gets around the policing issue because these populations are being, the police can't tell the difference between a second generation West Indian and a black person.  It gets around whatever level of systemic racism is or isn't in the pipeline with regard to schools.  And you find wildly different outcomes.  You find, you know, Rate of high school graduation, much higher for black West Indians.  Rate of enrollment in college, much higher.  Rate of professional occupations, much higher.  Crime, lower, right?  So this suggests to me that there are, that the role of systemic racism, to whatever degree it exists, is minimal at this point.  And there's a whole narrative built around the idea that this is the primary obstacle facing black people.  And it's worth noting, I don't think most black people actually believe this because, I mean, there are various polls to cite here, but there's one from Pew that asked black people without college educations, has your race held you back at all in life?  60% said no, it's a recent Pew poll.  Another Gallup poll asked, is bias the main issue facing you in jobs and housing?  60% again said no.  The Harvard sociologist Ethan Foss has done extensive polling of the black community and found that disconnected black youth, black youth who aren't in schools and don't have jobs, the people on the lowest rung of society, something around 30% of them think the system is rigged and 70% don't.  So what we're getting is we're getting the voices of black people who believe the systemic racism narrative promoted to the most powerful media positions in our country, so we're getting the impression that this is a uniform view, and it's not. Right, so this is sort of the Jesse Jacksons, Al Sharptons, they get moved up because they're given sort of simple answers.  So I guess it hearkens the question then, I could ask this either way, what is it that the West Indian immigrants are doing right?  or what is it that the other folks are doing wrong?  yeah you i mean you can answer that in either direction you want to go first. well i mean part of it is just immigration selection factors that i mentioned right.  so the the kind of jamaican or barbadian who makes it off the island to new york is likely to be disproportionately hard-working disproportionately X for whatever X factor is, and so in that sense, the direct comparison can be misleading, but just analyzing why these two populations differ, you find West Indian immigrants more likely to come from a two-parent home, more likely to have had a more classically, socially conservative upbringing, which is you don't talk back to your parents, parents are rather strict.  There are downsides, of course, to that style of parenting, but Basically, what I'm saying is that there are cultural factors that are important that differ between these two groups, right?  You find there are many, I mean, this is where the conversation for many people gets especially uncomfortable, right?  It's the idea that every culture, every subculture is identical in the behavioral patterns that are inculcated.  wherever there is a disparity in some outcome, it's not possible that culture accounts for some or most of that disparity, which I think is a very silly idea. Well, it's completely nonsensical.  Cultures are different.  Different people in different groups put different emphasis on certain things.  Some put more on family, some put more on education, some put more on sports or whatever the hell it is.  So when you hear Larry Elder make the argument, you know, something around until 1972, the black family had a higher rate of staying in marriages.  And then he lays out the reasons that he believes policies of the Democrats destroyed all that.  That obviously resonates with you, right?  Because you're giving me some piece of this.  Both answers, I think, resonate.  or went back to family rates of... marriage and some sort of conservative ideals right? well yeah I mean that that's a very complex people hate when you talk. when anyone talks about yes about family people just absolutely hate it. it is a fact that black that the rate of two-parent homes and marriages was pretty similar to the white rate until the 60s.  It's a matter of scholarly dispute as to what was the cause.  I think it's certain at this point there was no one cause.  Welfare state may have had something to do with it, but I think it may have just been changing norms in the culture, because we're seeing the same thing happen in the white working class as well now, with the decline of two-parent homes, to a lesser extent than has happened in the black community.

The Caesars or Juli's could trace their line from Iulus the High Priest of Rome. Caesar's grandmother could trace her ancestry to the Roman Kings. He therefore had the bloodline of both the Kings and Priesthood.\n\nOriginally the ruler was both the King and High Priest, however a confrontation arose over who should succeed Aeneas. It was decided Iulus would gain the Priesthood and the Kingship passed on to another. This is where we get the Kings of Alba Longa and later on Kings of Rome with Romulus being the first.\n\nIt should also be known that were infact many Gaius Julius Caesar's over the centuries. There family tradition passed on the same names using Gaius\/Lucius\/Sextus Julius Caesar over and over again.\n\nA few different branches emerged, originally they were Gaius\/Lucius\/Sextus Julius Iulus.

Where will I live?  Where will I go? Here are the shipwrecks, and I am there.  Where will I live?  Where?  So I gather... You've been hearing some internal music for months, years, or possibly decades, and you're a little bit curious as to what it means.  The majority of people sort of don't know what to do with it, and that's why we classify them as semi-gnostics.  Because the actual internal music you're hearing, whether it be Ave Maria or even some beautiful pop music, is in fact signalling you and all you have to do is reframe your understanding of what's producing the music and you'll be able to reply to it, respond to it.  It's something well worth doing and it's free.  I'll stress for you right now that it's not your mind accidentally producing lovely elevator music for you because you never asked for that, did you?  And you often wonder why the music turns up at inappropriate times.  That's kind of fascinating, isn't it?  Well, I'll tell you.  You're actually being signaled by your own divine spark.  And how to respond to it and what to do and take advantage of this second great attribute of the divine spark, that is, physical evidence that the divine spark makes itself physically known to you.  so that you know you're not making this up and it's not your own mind-producing elevator music.  You can learn all this in just a 20-minute lesson at TrueBlueHealer.com.  It takes about 20 minutes.  You're given some immediate physical evidence.  Within a week, you will have some vivid messaging dreams and you'll be able to start replying to the messaging music.  So that's all very easy, straightforward, and all of your questions will be answered there, even if you've got extra questions after the 20-minute formal lesson.  The formal lesson only sort of reframes your thinking a little bit, so you'll be able to see exactly what to do, know exactly what to do instinctively when you hear this messaging music, which is reported by millions of people.  Now, what if you're listening to this lovely music video right now and you can safely say that you don't remember ever hearing internal music?  Can I tell you that after a 20-minute visit to TrueBlueHealer.com you will begin to hear spurts of communicating music.  Sometimes the music will have lyrics floating upon it, won't it?  The lyrics have some meaning and they will gradually clarify and become solid music.  And you'll get the same lesson as the Seminostics.  The Seminostics are the people who have heard music for years but never knew what to do with it.  and never went as far as to think that something's signaling me.  Well, that is the truth.  That's what's happening and you can verify this with physical evidence at TrueBlueHealer.com.  If you're not hearing it, you soon will hear some musical signaling and you will also get some vivid messaging dreams and other types of signals that you've literally never thought of.  So that's why you've been hearing music such as what we've just been listening to in this beautiful video.  There's a reason why you hear internal beautiful music.  You are being signalled.  That's really all you need to know.  Truebluehealer.com, 20-minute beginner's tour, all questions answered.  It's a wonderful world ahead of you, a better world.  This suits religious people and secular people also.  Whatever you're doing, any kind of self-improvement, devotions, continue doing them.  Everyone benefits from this, secular and religious.

Something we endlessly have been subjected to, we can't seem to stop, no matter how much we beg and plead and cringe and laugh and demand, it just won't go away.  And that is the phenomenon of TikTok nurses.  They just won't stop.  Now some of you may be out here thinking, Lauren, why do we want TikTok nurses to stop?  Everyone should be allowed to have fun.  Everyone needs a break.  Why are you being the fun police?  Well, let's consider a few things.  For the last year, all of us have been told, stay inside, save lives.  If you leave your house, you're literally going to kill grandma.  Quit your job, shut down your business, don't visit your family, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no New Year's, no going to the pub, no seeing your elderly grandparent.  that is close to dying and You may never get to see again if you don't see them this month or the next and they're desperate for human touch, love and affection.  Don't see your girlfriend, your long distance partner, your friends, all of these things.  Lose your entire livelihood.  Don't be there for the birth of your child.  Stay at home with your abusive partner and watch abuse rates around the nation go up and suicide rates around the nation go up, depression around the nation go up and do it all so we can support an overwhelmed family.  healthcare system.  All for that.  So when we sit here and all of us do this for a year, and then we watch healthcare workers on TikTok dancing through empty hallways, it's just a bit of a slap in the face.  No one is saying don't dance, don't have fun, don't be happy, don't take breaks.  Absolutely do those things.  You need to.  I think people who are upset, who maybe just take issue with these videos, feel it's just, yeah, a bit of a slap in the face.  It's saying all of these things we did for a year were for nothing.  Were so that you could dance down a hallway because you actually aren't overwhelmed.  Or we're staying at home.  so Your hospital is empty and you have nothing to deal with and you are now spending that time dancing.  And if your hospital is overwhelmed, you sure as hell should not be making TikTok videos.  And that's the scary thing.  is this isn't just a case of it being bad taste.  You know, the videos where people are on break and doing it, that's just bad taste in my opinion.  But sometimes it's actually like negligent.  We have seen videos come out.  of nurses dancing while they do have people waiting in triage, while they do have people waiting in emergency.  What are they doing?  That's why we've been waiting so long.  We were down here with a bunch of mops.  This is really happening.  Am I really witnessing this?  What other job are you allowed to do this?  What other job can you just stop working to dance?  And you know, some of these videos are seriously coordinated.  It's not just like, hey, I picked up my phone and we had a silly moment for five seconds.  It's stuff that would have taken weeks to coordinate and prepare.  And the idea that people that are working in massively overwhelmed environment, so stressed, so scared all the time would be able to coordinate a giant dance party for weeks and then film it in empty hallways.  Once again, a slap in the face and a total negation of this idea that hospitals are overwhelmed.  So if you are a healthcare worker and you want people to take this seriously, you shouldn't be doing this.  If you are a healthcare worker and you have some semblance of, you know, understanding of optics, some semblance of understanding of the suffering that everyone has been going through, you shouldn't be doing this.  No one else in a normal job, let alone a job that is being taken so seriously right now and has the world's eyes on it, should be doing this kind of stuff.  And one more thing, I really respect our healthcare workers, absolutely important work, we need it no matter what country you're in, save lives, awesome stuff.  However, This deification of healthcare workers we have been seeing this year is something that is really disturbing me.  They're editing nurses and doctors into photos of Marvel superheroes.  They are photoshopping angel wings onto them and just being like, you are gods right now.  No, why are nurses and doctors any more important than our farmers who feed us?  We'd starve to death without them.  We all have important jobs.  And we all have important jobs that unfortunately many lost this year.  People who are plumbers, teachers, janitors who clean the streets, garbage men, mechanics, these things all keep our countries running and yet they're not being deified.  And in fact, they're being forgotten in a lot of cases where tons of people are just losing their jobs, losing their business.  Meanwhile, we are acting like being a healthcare workers, the most brave job in the world.  And we can't believe these people are going through all of this while they're making TikTok videos.  And I know tons of people who could genuinely say, I wish I were a healthcare worker right now, because then at least I would have a job.  At least I would be able to put food on my kid's table right now, but no, instead I lost my job to keep healthcare workers and hospitals from being overwhelmed who are now making TikTok videos in empty hallways.  So, I'm sorry, but if you can't understand why people are frustrated with that, I can't help you.  I'm perfectly happy for healthcare workers, nurses, whoever, to make TikTok videos and enjoy their life, but perhaps just consider not doing it well in your scrubs and giving a massive slap in the face to everyone who has shut down their entire lives for a year.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the phenomenon of TikTok nurses, who continue to post videos despite the overwhelming stress and workload of healthcare workers during the pandemic.

Buses are even transporting people from Istanbul to the border of Greece and Bulgaria.  Turkey is now waging demographic warfare against Europe.  This is being used by Turkey as an attempt to extort European support for its military ambitions in the Middle East.  Right now, Turkey is engaged in combat all across northern Syria.  They are sponsoring hardcore Salafist groups that are widely recognized as terrorists by the international community.  They are also sponsoring militant Turkic ethno-nationalist groups like the Grey Wolves.  A very large percentage of these militants are foreigners and not native Syrians.  NATO just issued a press release expressing solidarity with Turkey, but they are refusing to get involved.  They say they will only take action to protect Turkish airspace, but will not intervene directly in Turkish combat operations in Syria.  Meanwhile, economic migrants are trying to bum-rush the Greek and Bulgarian borders, as well as several Greek islands.  Turkey keeps calling these people terrorists.  Syrian refugees, according to mainline media such as the German government-run Deutsche Welle, the people currently attempting illegal crossings hail from all over the world.  Mainline European media admits that the people currently attempting illegal entry include people from Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Of course, it has also been well established over the years that people who enter Europe illegally routinely lie about being from Syria.  Bulgaria just announced that they are sending 1,000 soldiers to their border with Turkey.  Greece is also beefing up their land border with Turkey.  The Greek Coast Guard says they are working at their absolute best highest capacity to prevent crossings by sea.  However, hundreds of economic migrants have successfully reached Lesbos and Zamos over the past 12 hours.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.

Under these conditions, the current situation is usually active, serious, exceptional and asymmetric threat against the national security of the country.  The targeted people are used as pawns by Turkey for the exercise of diplomatic pressure. Greece has suspended the asylum process for one month.  Anyone caught entering Greece over the course of the next month without the proper paperwork will not be allowed to apply for asylum.  and will be deported.  The Greek army and navy are being deployed.  There is a live-fire military exercise going on near the border right now.  Turkey is also waging a two-front information war.  On one hand, the Turkish government is telling people locally that hundreds of thousands of migrants are on the move and that they are successfully pouring across the borders of Greece and Bulgaria right now.  This is false information, but this narrative is being used to continue to entice more people to join the mob at the border.  Turkey is trying to make the situation as dangerous and violent as possible.  Secondly, the Turkish government is broadcasting claims internationally that the Greek authorities are brutalizing innocent and desperate refugees.  An army of people on social media are amplifying these claims in numerous languages.  These include blatantly fake stories.  The Turkish government claimed that the Greek Coast Guard purposely capsized a rubber dinghy, causing a small child to drown.  The Greek government issued an official statement saying this never happened.  Greece says that around 25,000 people are massed at the border now.  Thousands are involved in rioting.  They have started fires and they're throwing rocks at the border guards.  While the economic migrants travel with little to no luggage, many have been seen using gas masks and cutting tools.  Of course, you also have the never-ending supply of rubber dinghies and life jackets along the coast.  It is also being alleged that Turkey is releasing people from prisons and busing them to the border.  There is also new video of Turks rioting in a Syrian immigrant ghetto area.  Many can be seen flashing the gray wolves hand gesture.  This is actually not a new thing.  There have been anti-Syrian riots in Turkey before, but this time it is being claimed that the motive is to drive more people to join the mob at the border.  In Lesbos, there was an arson attack on a reception center.  It is also being alleged that residents of the Greek islands have physically assaulted members of the leftist NGOs as well as journos.  There is video showing two migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa being coached to act hysterical by a gaggle of journos.  This is a usual tactic and the staged, choreographed video they took has already ended up in European media clips.  Once again, the reason that Turkey is doing this is to try to extort Europe into supporting Turkey's military adventures in the Middle East.  Turkey is currently engaged in two different military conflicts in Syria, as well as military conflicts in Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Libya, not to mention the occupation of Cyprus.

I'm currently waiting for an IVF transfer and it's the final stage of a very long and heartbreaking, expensive road to have a second baby.  But guess what?  These clinics that create life have been forced closed during coronavirus.  Fertility, even though it's very time contingent, is not deemed an essential business in Ontario and for Canada.  So my husband and I have spent an insane amount of money on IVF and all of our hard work is sitting in a freezer in downtown Toronto and we don't have access to it.  That by itself doesn't seem so shocking until you considered what is deemed essential, including abortion clinics.  Yes, they are essential liquor stores as well.  And in Canada, pot shops are essential.  The government tried to close them, but now it was reversed.  So right now you can go to a medical clinic to end a pregnancy, but you can't start one.  Interesting priorities, right?  I can still get drunk and high, but I can't go to a controlled clinic to do IVF.  Under our lockdown, I also can't take my son to a park even if it's empty.  He can't even go on the swings, but I can go to the grocery store and stand fairly close to other shoppers.  My point being is that you can kill your baby, but you can't make one.  Um, okay, paging Satan.  Of course, there's also the financial factor.  IVF is paid out of pocket, mainly, so the government doesn't profit off of that.  But the government does make billions off of liquor and pot.  Hmm, starting to make a little bit more sense now, right?  Stopping non-essential medical procedures and surgeries is pretty ridiculous.  I know a lot of people who can't even get prostate cancer treated.  My mom's friend needs a mammogram and she can't get one.  Just because the government doesn't deem a certain medical procedure essential doesn't mean that it isn't.  So what if you need eye surgery and can't function without it?  What if your condition is deteriorating and turning your slight problem into a major one because you weren't allowed to have your regular medical maintenance.  Where is the government's priorities exactly?  Churches are also deemed non-essential.  Really?  I thought our charter rights included freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom of association.  So I can go to the LCBO, stand in a line, walk around the store in close proximity to others, touch bottles that others have touched, touch debit card machines that other people have touched, but I can't sit in a pew at a church and celebrate the Lord even though I can social distance in that environment very easily.  Hmm?  Newsflash, the government is not God.  I don't genuflect or pray to politicians.  This article also shows you that you have a much higher percentage of getting COVID from the grocery store than at church.  In times of crisis, people look to and seek solace in their faith, and now that's being denied by the government?  Huh?  I think if you can social distance at the grocery store, you can during Mass as well.  Jesus is essential.  And what about the government priority about springing criminals from prison?  They're in quarantine in jail.  Why are you going to release them, especially if they have nowhere to go?  Why am I being forced to social distance, self-isolate, limit the amount of people I gather with, but the government is setting convicted felons free?  What?  They went to prison for a reason.  Why am I an innocent person being treated more like a criminal than the actual felons that they're releasing from prison?  Are we really expected to believe that criminals are going to follow the rules?  And no, these people are not just petty thieves.  Okay.  Some of them have been convicted of violent crimes like assault and in the U S they let out a guy because of COVID and guess what?  He allegedly murdered someone.  Who couldn't see that coming?  What the is going on?  It's really weird to see what governments are prioritizing in this emergency.  In Oakville, Ontario, which isn't far from me, a guy and his kids were ticketed for rollerblading $880.  And in the UK, cops broke down a door to investigate social distancing in a private residence.  This is an insane level of government overreach.  In fact, I've seen police going up and down my street over the past couple of days.  I've also heard stories where police are ticketing people in the city of Toronto for standing too close together if they're strangers.  Our civil liberties are being erased right in front of our eyes.  Quarantine is supposed to restrict the movement of sick people, but tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people.  The question of personal liberty is going to be huge after this all comes to an end.  Does the government have the right to force you in your home over a somewhat lethal virus?  Let me put it another way.  If you're worried about an illness, you can lock yourself in your house and be scared for 50 years.  That's your liberty.  But forcing those who are healthy to stay in their homes seems a little bit of an overreach to me.  People don't get it.  The more authoritarian governments get, the worse the long-term backlash is going to be.  And here's some salt in the employment wounds of some Canadians.  If you're one of the millions that just lost your job when the PM loser shut down our economy, take a look at this.  Trudeau is importing foreign labor right now during this crisis.  Yep, that's right.  The government is bringing in thousands of temporary workers to help on farms and in food processing.  They're quarantining these people and giving them 1500 bucks a piece.  Our unemployment levels are sky high right now.  Millions have been forced out of the workforce and the plan is to bring in foreigners to do jobs that we can do at an even lower wage.  How is that beneficial to Canadians?  This is not Canada first.  This is replacement migration.  Don't forget, all of those temporary workers get a path to citizenship.  If you really cared about the health and wellbeing of citizens and the borders are closed, why are you still allowing flights in from China and Italy?  The whole thing is completely suspect.  If I didn't know better, I'd say they're taking advantage of the coronavirus situation to force their agenda of more immigration forward.  What are the priorities of the Canadian government?  What matters to them?  Oh, and by the way, government workers don't care about the lockdown order because they're still getting paid.  I wonder how fast this lockdown would be over if suddenly they didn't have their salaries.  Only the entrepreneurs, small business owners, and private sector workers that are being affected by this shutdown.  The government workers are just status quo as usual.  Anyways, what do you think about the government's priorities?  Let me know in the comment section below.  And of course, thank you for liking and subscribing.  And I appreciate hearing from you.  I hope you're staying safe.  And I hope, I pray, that we get this economy going once again, because you know what?  It's time to start living our lives again.

In today's video, we're going to look at a crazy clip that recently aired on the Today Show wherein the Australian hosts take it upon themselves to dogpile a lovely mother of four children for basically caring too much about her family. i want to take you back to the 1950s or at least that's what i thought when i read this brisbane mum's facebook post.  brooke smith shared her routine online.  here's what she said i always make sure i don't go to bed until everyone's lunches are packed their clothes are set out for the next day including my husband's and the house is clean.  dishwasher is on and a load of washing is on.  i always get up early 4 30 with my husband to make his breakfast and coffee.  um Go Brooke, whatever. How is it being 1950s to simply want to care for your husband?  Most of the women I know do the exact same, including my mom.  Even after being married almost 35 years now, she's still awake at 5 a.m.  cooking breakfast for my dad and she even makes him a lunch as well to take to work.  My dad doesn't force her to do this, of course.  She does it out of the kindness of her heart because she loves him and because she's well aware that he has a very demanding job that would be made just a little bit easier if he didn't have to drive into town during his lunch break to get his own food. I mean, I tell you what though, Chris, I mean, a lot of people online are saying, well done, are praising her. Who?  Who are these people?  Who?  Who could these people possibly be?  Well, at least in the US, an article from 2018 states that more millennial women are choosing to be stay-at-home moms.  And as for the stats, the most recent Pew research seems to be from 2014, which shows that the number of women who are becoming stay-at-home moms has risen.  While 71% of moms do work outside the home, 29% are staying home.  That number is up 6% from 1999.  Also, I've got to say, I absolutely love how you have the token male feminist type thrown in there in order to assure the snobby woman that yes, yes, in fact, your opinion is completely right for every single woman on earth and any woman who might disagree with you belongs in the 1950s.  Oh, has he hypnotized her or something?  Who does this stuff?  Making his breakfast and then putting his clothes out of a night?  Is he disabled or something?  Like seriously, get a grip, get off your bum and do stuff yourself. Okay, seriously, this guy is going above and beyond, totally overcompensating.  I'm sorry that his wife doesn't want to take care of him if he even has a wife, but it's no reason to insult and belittle the wives who do.  And no, wives don't cook for their husbands because their husbands are useless or can't do it for themselves, but because many of these men have extremely grueling jobs that actually require hard work, unlike this man's job where he basically just sits in a studio all day on a nice cushy sofa and criticizes people. My only theory is that she might actually like her husband and she might actually like to get up at 4.30 and spend some time with him. I mean, I like my husband, but make your own bloody breakfast and coffee. I mean, you know.  And here it is, the admission.  Clearly the show host never cooks for her husband.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if she never does any sort of household work at all.  And the reason it makes her so angry to see a woman who is able to do it all is because it makes her feel less about herself.  Naturally, the only way to ease this feeling of inadequacy is to attack the caring wife, to try to bring her down to her level. Apparently this couple run an MMA fighting gym.  Mixed martial arts.  Mixed martial arts, and they also breed bulldogs, so they can do whatever they want. You're not arguing.  Hey, you know what, if it makes her happy, but, I mean, nothing in that list of things there, you know. And she's got four children under the age of six. I guess it's finally occurred to the show host.  what an absolute jerk she's being.  Do what you want, she says.  It's a little bit too late for that.  You've already gone and exposed yourself as a jealous and insecure woman, which is once again confirmed in the next clip.  Somehow, the caring wife is able to co-run an MMA gym, breed bulldogs, raise four children, and take care of her husband all while maintaining her fitness and beauty.  On every front, she totally blows the show host out of the water.  Also, did you happen to catch that moment at the end where the man says, Women attacking women.  Terrible. But did you see her photos too?  She still had time to, like, make her hair look beautiful and put her makeup on. She looks gorgeous.  I think she looks gorgeous. Um, sorry sir, but you participated in this attack just as much as your jealous co-host, so are you saying that women attacking women is totally unacceptable, but Men attacking women?  That's okay?  Look, it really doesn't affect me one way or the other.  whether or not a woman chooses to be a stay-at-home wife or mom.  That's up to them.  Some women might hate the lifestyle while others might be denied even the option due to the fact that their families can't be supported on one income.  Everyone has their own unique situations which can't always be properly judged by the outside world.  But to belittle and insult women who do choose to stay at home, or not even that, but who simply want to provide extra care to their husbands and children, is lower than low.  Once again, the feminist narrative of claiming to support all women is exposed as a pitiful lie.  The same types of competitive attitudes, the same types of jealousy and resentment that exists among many women are clearly more alive than ever.  Personally, I think the caring wife sounds like a wonderful person.  not to mention a solid model for what a lot of other women aspire to be.  She has a very lucky husband and children, and I sincerely hope that she doesn't for one second allow these jealous attacks on her to make her feel inferior.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.  I really hope you enjoyed.  Also, just as a quick note, the last several videos I've made, they've all been demonetized.  So if you would be kind enough to support my work, there are links to PayPal and Stripe in the description of this video.  Thank you once again for watching and I'll see you next time.","channel.id":"clxmi0ohw02ehcdvi3iglu7wl","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCesrUK_dMDBZAf7cnjQPdgQ","channel.name":"Brittany Sellner","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AT","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU5TvTw9o5vWAhQPsDHzc8k46cKZHRbE2ECRAqy-Q=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The video discusses a clip from the Today Show where an Australian host, Brooke Smith, shares her daily routine, which includes taking care of her husband and four children.

I made a previous video with Peter where we discussed some of the parties, so if you want more information about the various political parties of Slovakia, check out that video.  I'll post a link to it below.  Also, I have a lot of material about other topics in the community section of this YouTube channel, so if you haven't seen that, Check out the community section and I have stuff about the ongoing situation in Turkey and Syria and whatnot.  Now, here's what happened in the general election in Slovakia.  So, the first big takeaway is the progressive party was completely humiliated.  So this was a big question.  Early 2019, Slovakia had a presidential election.  This blind woman, Zuzana Cepunova, I'm probably saying that totally wrong.  She comes out of nowhere, no one knows who she is.  She's using this English language term, progressive, that a lot of people don't even know what it means.  She tweets in English instead of Slovakian.  and for whatever reason she ends up winning.  However, president of Slovakia doesn't actually mean very much and voter turnout isn't very high either.  So here you have progressive Slovakia and then this is the Together Party.  Now immediately after the presidential election these two run as a coalition for the EU election and they only get twenty percent of the vote.  well this time they got seven percent.  now the minimum threshold is five percent but if you run as a coalition the minimum threshold automatically doubles to ten.  so running as a two-party coalition in a Slovakian general election doesn't even make any sense.  but they did it.  and Progressive Slovakia completely screwed themselves because they got 7%, zero seats.  The total parliament is 150 seats.  There was a whole bunch of other parties that did not make the minimum threshold.  28.5% voted for a party that didn't win any seats.  In my video with Peter, we talked about most hid a Hungarian minority party.  and the Slovakia National Party, which is a conservative party.  Both of those parties were part of the previous ruling coalition.  Neither one of them even made the 5% threshold, so they didn't win any seats either.  But there was a huge amount of parties running.  So the party that has dominated for the past 15 years was the social democrats.  smear and they're way down and this is the lowest percentage they've gotten in a long time.  now they are allied with a bunch with the social democrat parties of germany and scandinavia and the labor party of england except Whereas those parties are more interested in culture war, cultural Marxism, social justice.  They're still a more old school Social Democrat party where they actually are primarily concerned with socialism and a lot of their members are pretty conservative on social issues.  So things like gay marriage, abortion, immigration, they're actually conservative.  But the party has also gained a reputation of being the party of corruption in the establishment, and they've been going downhill.  So the Socialist Party got 18.3%.  Every other party that one seats is more or less on the right.  So the big winner is Ordinary People up here.  Now, Ordinary People ran as a coalition with three or four other smaller center-right parties.  They are part of the EPP.  Now, how conservative they are depends on who you ask.  However, Slovakia is a very conservative country compared to Western Europe, North America, and Scandinavia.  And then you've got, so the Socialist Party came in second.  Then you've got We Are Family, Shmi Rodina, 8.2%.  Now, this party is a nationalist populist party.  It's part of Matteo Salvini's alliance.  Then you've got CodeLabor with another 8%, which is an extremely hardline nationalist party.  Now, they actually got, I think, 14% in the EU election.  Basically, you could say that it's along the same lines of Golden Dawn, very hardline nationalist.  Then this is Solidarity.  They're basically a libertarian party.  Some of the members are conservative.  Now, I talked about SAS in a previous video about efforts.  by the EU to punish Poland and Hungary for supposedly violating EU core values.  And SAS actually stabbed their ally, the Polish Law and Justice Party, in the back and voted for it.  But I hear mixed things from people who actually live in Central Europe.  Some say they're conservative, some say they're not.  This is a brand new party.  that got 5.8% and it's basically a party started by the former president and it's basically a weak center-right party.  so basically you had the Socialist Party getting 38 out of 150 seats and even then the Socialist Party is fairly conservative on social issues And then you've got all the other seats being won by parties that are more or less on the right.  So the fact that a candidate from progressive Slovakia won the presidency last year, I think it was a flash in the pan.  And when the media was celebrating Slovakia's shift to the left, I think that was pretty premature.  Alright, once again, check out the community section of this YouTube channel for some more news.

It is the home of the Irish people. The only recovery that Fine Gael has brought in this country is recovery for the banks that broke this country.  I've seen the corruption in government in this country.  And it's not just in government, it's the parties in opposition as well.  Economics has to be secondary to who we are as a people, as a nation.  And if we don't cherish it and preserve it, it'll be an unbelievable tragedy. Tell them that we won't allow our children to be raised for export.  Our healthcare system and our education system, two of the most relevant indicators of the developmental stage of a country, are in an absolute shambles.  We are sending our extremely educated and our extremely highly skilled nurses and doctors abroad.  They're being trained here and then they're leaving.  They're emigrating because there's nothing for them here in Ireland.  Ireland is not somewhere that they want to be.  The nurses' working conditions are atrocious.  Tell them that we won't stand idly by and become strangers in our own country. We can't lose our identity.  We can't lose our character.  They want to cut you off at the roots for that.  They don't want you to have any roots or to think that, like, I mean, that you've got any attachment to your own country.  That's what that whole thing about, like, I mean, what's Irish?  We all know what Irish is. Tell them that the right to life of the unborn is absolute and should never have been taken away. To think that you desecrate a little child in the womb, a little baby in the womb... Hack it to death.  That's basically what they're doing.  And I'll just go as far as saying it's men and women that's been murdered in this country. Tell them that we don't need more asylum centres or co-living apartments or properties for vulture funds.  We need Irish homes for Irish families. How many Irish people will die homeless on the streets before change arrives?  I'm a stay-at-home mother with four children and I volunteer with the homeless.  I'm heavily involved in community activism.  I'm deeply committed to mental health issues.  I'd say in first hand how our community and other communities have been ripped apart from suicide and ordinary people like ourselves being forgotten about by our government.  There's an old saying, get your own backyard in order before you go trying to save the world.  And our country is in chaos with hospitalists, housing crisis, schools, everything, elderly, home care, all this.  We've got our own people to provide for.  We can't cope as a small country.  We're not a superpower.  We're not a world power.  We should look after our own people first, Joe.  Very wealthy developers in the area claim to have bought our private property.  This cottage here, which is about 300 years old, is supposed to be demolished.  We have been persecuted by the state.  for several years. Tell them that ordinary workers and the rural economy must not be sacrificed at the altar of the carbon tax agenda. It's time that Irish people and the people of this constituency in Longford and Westmead said no to carbon taxes.  Also the issue of USC, this universal social charge, which was introduced as an austerity tax to help pay for the bank bailout.  That tax for the banks must be abolished. Tell them that the Irish nation won't wait around for governments to unite us.  We are united. This is our land, the whole island of Ireland.

All right, guys.  I know, I know.  This is crazy.  Listen, listen, listen.  We have to be able to talk to one another.  And to be honest with you, when I watch Nick Fuentes' videos, I agree with like 90% of what he says.  And I think he might be surprised to hear me say that.  Are you surprised to hear him say that?  I don't think that's true.  You don't think that's true?  America first?  Yeah, that's fine.  But I mean, everything that you represent is kind of gross.  Why is it gross?  I mean a man dressing up like a woman in his life activates my disgust emotions in my brain.  Okay, he's honest.  That's why I like me gross.  What would you say if I told you I really honestly believe in your right to feel the way you do and I defend you?  I defend you.  I don't think that everyone, the reason I do this is because I think that the radical LGBT cult is out of control.  But see, the problem is not the radical LGBT, it's the LGBT community.  That's the problem.  Well, I don't identify with that community.  I'm just a gay man.  I think that's in there.  I think that's in there.  Okay.  We're against that.  It's a Christian concept.  It's not a Christian thing.  Okay.  I swear to you.  Hold on.  No, no, no.  Nick's a good guy.  I feel like he's a good guy.  He's a hater.  Listen.  No, leave him alone.  Leave Nick alone.  I really feel like he's willing to have a conversation with someone.  No, listen, Nick.  I just feel like... What we have in common, the person and the second in them to their arms, the freedom of religion, including this, they are not serving me.  I believe in that it's essential.  So what I'm saying is I really believe that we do have a lot in common.  We've got to work together and unite so that we can get President Trump re-elected.  He's our only weapon against the radical agenda.  You're part of that radicalism.  I mean, I'm not a traditionalist for, like, 1990.  I'm a traditionalist for, like, 1790.  My God!  I am in opposition to kind of risking a country that we want to promote.  While there may be overlap in some areas, in critical and foundational and essential areas, there's a contradiction.  That's why... You know, I would never, for example, be with somebody who's for abortion, because abortion... We neither.  I've done videos about people who have abortions.  And I also can't be with somebody who's for the normalization or promotion of homosexuality, gender-bending, or all this kind of degeneracy.  I mean, you can see the country and where we're at today.  The problem is the promulgation of degeneracy, DVC, homosexuality.  And, you know, if you just come around and parade yourself around and say, oh, no, but I'm like a MAGA drag queen.  I am.  It's completely tone deaf.  No, it's not tone deaf.  If this is what MAGA is, count me out.  I am pro-life.  I am pro-Second Amendment, I am First Amendment, and actually, as a drag queen, I stand up and defend your right to disagree with what I'm doing.  And other LGBT radicals don't do that.  So that's why I say, look, obviously, I don't really get your point of view, and you don't get mine.  But I really feel like right now, our one and only weapon to save America, after life, is going to come.  So, okay, we agree on that.  So I say, I think it's disgusting that you have a new platform.  I think it is anti-American.  Anybody's voice is a platform.  And even though I may have watched your videos and thought, okay, I want your voice out there, Nick.  I have a question for you.

Basically, I believe this is a desperate last-ditch attempt by Five Star Movement and the PD to derail Salvini, his Lego Party, and the Italian center-right coalition.  What this means is that Salvini could now be prosecuted for, quote, kidnapping.  The charge of kidnapping was manufactured after Salvini refused to allow a group of illegal aliens to disembark in Sicily.  The illegal aliens had to stay on an Italian Coast Guard ship for several days waiting for the European Union to take custody of them.  Salvini was the interior minister of Italy at the time.  He could not be prosecuted for any actions taken as a minister unless the Senate strips his immunity.  Salvini responded with a fiery speech in the Senate.  He basically threw down the gauntlet and told the left to bring it on.  He said that he was proud of his actions as Interior Minister and that once he is in power again, he will do the exact same things.  Now, keep in mind that Salvini's actions to stop illegal immigration were extremely popular.  So popular that support for his entire party was rose from 17% in 2018 to over 30% today.  In fact, Salvini's Lega party has been consistently polling over 30% for around 10 months now.  So this is no flash in the pan.  The center-right coalition, of which Lega is the main party, is collectively polling around 50%.  Five Star Movement and PD, who currently run the country, are collectively polling around 35%.  The English language media is celebrating.  They are bragging that Salvini potentially faces a very long prison sentence.  The media is pretending the charges are legitimate.  Of course, the same media outlets pretended like it was a real possibility that Trump was going to be forcibly removed from office.  So, What would actually happen if a very unpopular government places the leader of a far more popular political faction in prison on trumped up charges?  The first thing that popped into my head was the March on Rome of 1922.  Okay, I don't know if it would actually go that far, but this seems very short-sighted on the part of the Italian left.  Here in the USA, the Democrats just made Donald Trump more popular than ever with their convoluted, hard to understand, 100% partisan impeachment trial.  Meanwhile, Luigi Di Maio, who is deputy prime minister and the former leader of Five Star Movement, he recently resigned from as leader of the party, he was just in Libya to meet with General Haftar.  They discussed an arrangement for Haftar's government to crack down on people.  trying to illegally cross from Libya to Italy.  So even the current left-wing government has to at least pretend like they are doing something to stop illegal immigration.  Finally, I want to talk about a new ad campaign by Scandinavian Airlines, also known as SAS.  They published a video on YouTube declaring that Scandinavians have no native culture and everything they have is taken from other people.  The commercial is aimed at people in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.  The commercial very aggressively denigrates all Scandinavians.  It utilizes critical theory, which was developed by the infamous Frankfurt School.  The goal is to separate people from their culture, identity, homeland, religion, language, and family so that they will have a more favorable view of hardcore religion.  international Marxism.  Now, I am pleased at the public reaction to the SAS video.  People absolutely bombarded SAS with outrage on social media so much that SAS temporarily took the video down and issued a public statement.  Now, their public statement defended the video and claimed that SAS was the victim of a targeted harassment campaign.  hours later they made the video public again and people went straight back to down voting it in mass.  in fact people began down voting all their videos.  hundreds of replies started appearing on all their tweets.  some of them are actually quite funny.  It has now become a major media story with the Danish People's Party publicly denouncing the video.  In fact, the country of Denmark owns 14% of Scandinavian Airlines and the Danish People's Party is calling for the government to disinvest in this company.  Members of the Swedish Democrats have also denounced the SAS video.  However, Daniel Ryazat, an Iranian member of the former Swedish Communist Party, now known as the Left Party, publicly praised the video.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.

It is the middle of the night in Virginia, and my phone begins blowing up a couple of people messaging me about a dirtbag by the name of Matthew Heimbach who apparently has joined an anti-white organization called parallel networks darkness upon darkness.  of course they call it light upon light but we never give them the names of their taking because they always name their endeavors the opposite of their true intentions.  Well, who is this Matthew Heimbach?  This is a story of a shameless self-promoter who put himself ahead of our people's well-being, who never cared about white well-being, who never cared about recapturing our destiny, who never cared about the weakest members of our community, our children.  our elderly and our sick.  he never cared about these people though he paid plenty of lip service to it over the years didn't he?  this anti-white porpoise scumbag ten years ago decided to start something called the white students union at towson university in maryland And that is when I met him for the first time.  And I could tell from our first interaction that this person was not putting the well-being of our people first, that he was putting himself first.  He wanted in all ways to animate the ne'er-do-well, the bad guy himself.  the antagonist in the anti-white narrative.  He wanted in all ways to be that so that he could get the attention of the media, so that he could get the attention of the school's media, the greater media, the faculty, the teachers.  He wanted nothing more than attention.  If he cared about white people at all, it was ancillary, it was distant.  I could tell that he had no character, that he was deeply disturbed, that he was immoral, that he was unethical, that he was selfish.  Many people in the white positive sphere have said over the years that we need somebody who is selfish because they will push all of us forward.  They will push our cause forward by pushing themselves forward.  Well, Matthew Heimbach and plenty of others are great examples of why we don't need selfish people.  We need selfless people.  We need, ladies and gentlemen, to reject people like Matthew Heimbach when they show up.  And that is why i got up out of bed to do a brief video to teach you all about the likes of matthew heimbach and those like him who are more concerned about themselves and getting attention for themselves than they are for the well-being of our people run from such individuals.  he didn't like anything I had to say about white well-being.  he knew the way he knew how to handle this and of course he didn't like what I had to say about advocating for white well-being because that was not going to get him the attention that he wanted.  no he was only going to get attention from the media if he played the media's bad guy if he played that bad guy in the anti-white narrative.  So many other people saw something wrong with this character as well, different reasons.  I predicted at that time, after that first meeting, that he was going to, at a minimum, embarrass us, that he was going to harm the white positive sphere and those genuine advocates for white well-being with his antics by playing the bad guy in their narrative.  And that, possibly more, that he would or potentially could engender violence, now I don't know if that came about or not, but certainly the anti-whites could use his video and audio of him speaking and say this is how they speak and that is why violence is done.  But most importantly and the reason why I had to speak with you all briefly in this video is that I said after that first meeting that since this individual is a self-promoter as soon as he is not able to garner himself attention from the establishment media by way of being the bad guy in the anti-white narrative, he will turn against us to garner attention from the regime's media.  And that is exactly what he has done.  He has joined this anti-white network.  He called himself in this video that I put at double speed because I'm getting back in bed in a moment.  He called himself right at the beginning.  He said that he was the face of organized hate.  And now he is fighting for anti-whitism.  He is fighting for all the races.  He is going to tell the world the truth about the white positive sphere and how awful it is now.  That is how this fat, repulsive, sickening bastard is going to get himself attention now.  He then went on to say that he was kicked out of some... organization and they called him a communist and then he quipped that if the red star fits saying now that he is a communist he is an anti-white.  he went on after the white student union to create the traditionalist workers party or something like this and then some national socialist group where he made a fool of himself again and again and the media put a microphone in his face and a recorder in his face again and again so they could get the audio the real life evidence of their anti-white narrative the bad guy from their story.  well i came across this bastard several more times and since i knew what kind of person he was or i'd formed my assessment in the beginning i knew that i didn't want to be alone in a room with him because somebody with no character some shameless self-promoter would say that conversations took place or that they didn't take place that events took place or that they didn't take place whatever it took to get attention for himself.  so i never allowed myself to be alone with him in those couple other times that I was at an event that he showed up at.  I never went to an event that he held because I wanted nothing to do with him.  But he showed up at events that I was at.  And each time he showed up, he rejected white well-being, my arguments for advocacy, for our people, the recapture of our destiny.  And every single time he had a new prescription, a new formula for affronting the masses more.  that's all it was.  he said it was for our people to do x y or z. for us that would be good but it was always a lie.  it was always to aggrandize him.  and so what do we have here with the dirtbag matthew.  You have somebody who is only thinking about himself, only thinking about himself when he started that student union, only thinking about himself when he started that other organization, Traditional Workers Party, only thinking about himself.  all of those times he stepped in front of those cameras, stepped in front of that reporter from the local newspaper, stepped in front of another movie maker.  He was thinking about himself.  All that it was was thinking about himself when he cheated with his friend's wife, his right-hand man's friend's wife.  It was always about Matthew Heimbach.  It had nothing to do with our people.  And now he has finally proven himself nothing but the dregs of society.  The gavel has fallen on him, and he has landed in the place where the dregs of society always end up, and that is anti-whiteism.","channel.id":"clxmi0qxr044kcdvizhkl4gln","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCkY8CvV8WQFe87CZGmvuYHA","channel.name":"No White Guilt","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/0YucuojQg3vL5zFivzXCv6DZwmxOWS1QLEN9RRXD5xhaL5BObtCr6MqcnGGuopcNPp2ndmsvyM8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker shares a story about Matthew Heimbach, a self-proclaimed advocate for white well-being who has been exposed as a shameless self-promoter.

I'm sure that most of you are probably familiar with the children's folk tale, The Emperor's New Clothes.  But for the few of you that have never heard about this story before, I'll just offer a brief summary because I think that it perfectly encapsulates the deceitful situation that America seems to be collectively indulging in at the moment.  Two swindlers arrive at the capital city of an emperor who spends lavishly on clothing at the expense of state matters.  Posing as weavers, they offer to supply him with magnificent clothes that are invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent.  The emperor hires them and they set up looms and go to work.  A succession of officials and then the emperor himself visit them to check their progress.  Each sees that the looms are empty, but pretends otherwise to avoid being thought a fool.  Finally, the weavers report that the emperor's suit is finished.  They mime dressing him and he sets off in a procession before the whole city.  The townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear inept or stupid, until a child blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all.  The people then realize that everyone has been fooled.  Although startled, the emperor continues the procession, walking more proudly than ever.  The reason that this story perfectly encapsulates the current state of America is because millions of Americans seem to recognize that the narrative that the left is peddling is false, that it's riddled with colossal lies.  However, despite the fact that these lies are inflicting indescribable damage on our country, many of us are choosing to keep silent or even to publicly agree with the lies out of fear of societal backlash, shaming, and cancel culture.  The coronavirus is a deadly global threat, we're told.  People aren't allowed to open their businesses in order to pay their rent and to put food on the table for themselves and their families.  They can't attend the funerals or weddings of their loved ones.  and they can't visit their sick loved ones in the hospital either.  But meanwhile, Black Lives Matter and Antifa are given free reign to take to the streets by the thousands.","channel.id":"clxmi0ohw02ehcdvi3iglu7wl","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCesrUK_dMDBZAf7cnjQPdgQ","channel.name":"Brittany Sellner","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AT","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU5TvTw9o5vWAhQPsDHzc8k46cKZHRbE2ECRAqy-Q=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker draws a parallel between the children's folk tale, The Emperor's New Clothes, and the current state of America.

I can't stand Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump, and it's time to fire both of them.  Kushner is an evil serpent who looks like he escaped from a morgue or something.  No, really, not just to be petty.  What's going on with this guy?  He looks like Lurch, but trans.  Something's up, seriously.  This is what he used to look like.  Fairly normal.  Now here's his new Botoxed appearance.  I know.  But seriously, I want to talk about how this snake in the grass and his wife are upending the America First movement and all the goodwill behind Donald Trump.  When the president initially gave them starring roles in the White House, I was ambivalent, but I did think it was weird to give so much power to two people with very little experience in, well, anything.  Oh yeah, that's right, Ivanka did sell shoes, and Kushner did take over the family real estate business for a short time while his scumbag dad was in prison for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering.  But I knew that Trump valued loyalty above all else, so it made sense that his obvious nepotism was more of a way of protecting himself while he waded through the unfamiliar White House waters.  As time went on, I really started to notice that Jared and Ivanka did not share the same vision as the president and the America First movement.  Everything they promoted was very progressive, including Ivanka's $50 million initiative to boost women in the workplace across the world.  Yes, even the founder of a women's group in Malawi got money.  Nobody voted for this, of course, but I guess initially Trump supporters gave Ivanka a pass and said, okay, fine, let her have her feel-good pet projects with taxpayer money as long as the wall is being built.  Then there was Kushner's strong push for the First Step Act, criminal justice reform bill that has sprung over 5,000 inmates from federal prison, some of them violent felons.  It passed and America is definitely not as safe because that's what all those Trump supporters were chanting about at the rallies, right?  They weren't just screaming, build the wall, but let them out.  I swear I heard it.  How does this guy con Trump every time?  I feel like if you ask the president a no-nonsense question like, hey, do you think it's a good idea to let convicted criminals out of jail early for no reason at all?  He would say, no.  But enter Jared Kushner and his creepy charms, and boom, Trump signs off on the First Step Act.  This is a good example of the kind of weird influence this half-dead-looking dumbass has on the president.  Kushner was also put in charge of brokering a peace deal in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict despite having zero foreign policy experience.  And what do you know?  The Orthodox Jewish Kushner was criticized because his plan was too biased in favor of Israel.  He was accused of imposing too harsh requirements on the Palestinians.  Imagine that.  Now, just a few days ago, Trump tweeted the most beautiful tweet I think I've ever seen.  Quote, Finally, Trump is going back to his America First agenda and focusing on immigration, the reason he won the 2016 election.  However, the next day, journalists were reporting that White House staffers were telling Trump to backtrack on his immigration EO.  Then Trump held a press briefing and basically recanted on his total immigration moratorium by no longer suspending temporary visa workers and only putting issuance of green cards on hold.  The EO was only applicable for 60 days.  so what exactly happened?  oh i know.  and then it was revealed that you know who was pushing back on trump's immigration ban.  of course not only that.  he was supposedly the most outspoken naysayer.  instead carving out exceptions for refugees temporary workers under the h-1b visa program and farm workers under the h-2a program these provisions would actually hurt the average american worker unemployed by coronavirus So completely undermining the whole purpose of the ban.  Thanks, Jared.  So America First voters who have been screaming for an immigration crackdown to help actual Americans get jobs have had their hopes dashed again.  Trump announces a temporary suspension of immigration.  Then he talks to creepy Kushner and announces that it's ending very soon.  Last I heard, Jared Kushner was not president of the United States.  63 million Americans did not vote him into the White House.  Trump supporters do not want Jovanka running the show anymore.  If it's not obvious by now, Kushner is literally the antithesis to Trump's America First movement.  He and Ivanka are not conservatives, but globalists.  Not only are his policies unlikable, but so is his personality.  He's not charismatic, cool, well-spoken, or anything.  I think one of the problems is that Trump is blinded by the love for his daughter and, by proxy, his son-in-law.  Even though he's a total weasel neocon fraud, I don't think Trump can see it, honestly, sometimes.  I think his trust in Jared is being exploited by Kushner for his own nefarious purposes, whether it be more money for his real estate business, sheer power, or both.  Anyways, they both need their asses kicked out of the White House and bring back some Trump loyalists already.  You know, the ones that actually like America and want what's best for the American people, not the globalist elites.  Trump needs to surround himself with people loyal to his agenda.  Building the wall, deporting illegals, bringing manufacturing back to America from China, etc.  Not feminism, more legal immigration, Israel, and whatever else Jared and Ivanka want.  So let me know what you think in the comment section below.  I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Thank you, of course, for liking and subscribing.  And until next time, have a great day.","channel.id":"clxmi0lki00dkcdvieic0c63n","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCvQaTpHnhug8g47SDyoAgNw","channel.name":"Jill Colton","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXeomoV0GELjRe8HHLLXbwUVXTrAIcWCVwaZ8yPzQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-05-14T21:25:38.000Z","summary":"The speaker is critical of Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump, whom they believe are undermining the America First movement and President Donald Trump's agenda.

I wanted to make a quick video.  I know I've been posting a lot recently but I wanted to show off my sneaker collection.  It's not much but I know we got some sneaker head fans out there and my collection is like, it's really important to me that I keep it clean and organized and like minimal.  but crispy, you know what I mean?  I'm OCD, I don't let there be one speck of dirt on my sneakers and I make sure that they're showcased nicely.  Anyway, I wanted to make a video real quick because I got a message from a kid saying that they started smoking weed because of my videos and that's not a joke.  I have never once smoked weed.  I've never been high.  And that's not a lie.  That's a God's swear to God.  Okay, right hand to God, left hand to God, fucking two hands to God, hand holding a cigarette to God.  That's the truth.  And I've never met anybody who long term um, had a, that where weed was a longterm positive force, positive thing in their life.  Okay.  And that's dead.  This is a deadly serious topic, by the way, everybody I've talked to everybody, everybody I've interacted with who is, uh, into weed at all has, um, it eventually morphed Into a source of stress.  A thing that makes you mentally unbalanced.  A thing that gets out of control.  And I just... Someone posted a picture of the coronavirus shirt with a holding a joint.  And I don't look down on anyone for smoking weed.  But... It's... In my opinion, it's a bad idea.  Long term, it's a bad idea.  I don't think it goes anywhere good, man.  Like... The thing that people keep saying is that weed helps me get a grip.  Weed helps me feel whatever.  It does something positive short term.  Yeah, well, if we're being totally honest here, eating McDonald's makes me feel like I have a grip.  Eating French fries makes me feel good.  Okay.  Whacking off the porn makes me feel amazing.  All right.  So if you believe that, if you believe that that's in my longterm mental health, uh, benefits checklist, then keep smoking weed, man.  Puff, puff it, puff up, dude, puff it up.  Um, and the other thing people point to, people point to like, um, rich people, uh, and Joe Rogan as having, um, Joe Rogan's got a handle on it, right?  Joe Rogan smokes weed.  He's got it together.  He's got it together enough to do a podcast.  That's a lot of work.  Joe Rogan's all put together.  Joe Rogan has fucking $100 million, okay?  Joe Rogan in his off time, he's not busting ass.  He's not scrambling to make money.  He's in his backyard shooting a bow and arrow.  That's how he spends his time.  Sure, if you have enough money to go to Germany to get your blood swapped out, to get your blood purified at some experimental clinic and do a salt bath, fucking crystalline salt, and fucking be in a sauna all day, then yeah, you probably won't notice the detrimental effects of weed that much.

They also make blanket denunciations of Christians and heterosexual people.  This has become absolutely trendy in America, making casual statements dehumanizing all straight white men or old white men or straight white Christians.  is met with applause and laughter in the U.S.  media and left-wing social circles.  Well, it seems that a lot of Hungarians want no part of this taking root in their nation.  Recently, there was a big protest against a Hungarian mayor for doing this.  Peter Niederm\u00fcller is the newly elected mayor of the 7th district of Budapest.  He represents the Democratic Coalition, or DK.  This party was founded in 2010 as a splinter group of the Hungarian Socialist Party.  DK is currently the largest opposition party to the Fidesz-KDNP alliance, and Niederm\u00fcller is one of the party's three vice presidents.  Niederm\u00fcller is also a former member of the European Parliament, where he was vice president of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.  He had a sort of unusual role.  A lot of the parties in the S&D are becoming increasingly pro-Palestinian, and now some are even engaging in agitation against Israel.  Of course, the reason for this is so.  Muslim immigrants will continue voting for their parties.  So, Niederm\u00fcller, who is Jewish himself, was a point man for denying that the S&D had any taint of anti-Semitism.  while at the same time accusing rival parties of being secret anti-Semites.  For example, he once denounced Sebastian Kurz and Heinz Christian Stracke for scheduling an EU summit on a Jewish holiday.  He claimed that this was an intentional act of hostility against the Jewish people.  So, he is a man with a clear history of casually using incendiary rhetoric to attempt to dehumanize his political enemies.  Recently, Niederm\u00fcller was on a TV station called ATV.  This is a private station owned by a Pentecost megachurch in Budapest.  ATV is known for its support of the left-wing opposition to Fidesz.  Niederm\u00fcller said the Hungarian government's concept of the family was the same as that of, quote, white nationalism.  He said the government's policies would exclude people and leave a, quote, frightening formation left in the middle, white Christian heterosexual men and the women among them.  Well, this is exactly the kind of nasty remarks about white people and Christians that have become commonplace in much of the West.  However, a lot of Hungarians did not take it sitting down.  On Thursday evening, thousands of people protested Niederm\u00fcller in front of his office.  The Conference of Catholic Bishops in Hungary made an official statement condemning the remarks.  They called on DK and ATV both to denounce the remarks and for all parties to respect ethical norms.  Now, DK is simply brushing everything off and saying the protests are partisan motivated.  However, I find it nice to see that at least somewhere in the world, people are denouncing this kind of casual demonizing of straight white Christian males.  Meanwhile, the saga with Viktor Orban and the EPP is still playing out.  The former prime minister of Slovakia, Mikul\u00e1\u0161 de \u017dirinda, published an open letter to Orb\u00e1n.  He said he respects his opinions and his stances, but said issues like migration and climate change will not be saved by national conservative slogans, but through European-wide solutions.  He also criticized Orban for becoming too close to Matteo Salvini.  He did, however, invite Orban to attend a high-level meeting on immigration that will take place in Athens on April 2nd.  Orban made an official statement saying that he would attend the meeting.  All right, thanks for watching this video.

The crime?  Where was the crime?  Was it two hours ago?  Was it last night?  It's right there, baby.  There's no laws.  There's absolutely no laws.  What are they going to do?  They can't catch me because they're not the Brown police.  They're not the right department.  It's out of my jurisdiction.  As if that's real.  As if that's real.  That's from an 80s movie.

He just flashed her.  Go get him.  Go get him.  That's him right there.  Go get him.  Instantly!  Instantaneous!  .1 millisecond response!  The clock did not change the hand of one second before the female cop, the female cop said... What did she say?  She said something.  She said something out of a Philip K. Dick book.  Out of like a black comedy sci-fi dystopian book.  book.  she said something.  she said something like well did she file a report?  she made a statement because like she said and that wasn't what she said it was what she said was like it was astronomical whatever.  whatever it was that she said.  i don't want to pretend like.  i remember it word for word but it made me instantly instantly realize instantly lose faith in the cops.  She made it perfectly fucking clear that she was not about to go.  And why would you if you're a woman cop?  What are you going to do?  Run for cover.  That's what you're going to do.  Dumb bitch.  Fucking, I'll be a cop.  I don't know what to do.  They got good benefits.  They got good benefits.  They got good benefits.  I always liked the uniform.

That's what I keep telling people.  The law states that you have to take a report and be from a different jurisdiction.  There's no jurisdiction.  I don't see it.  These cops around here, there's cops everywhere.  They're wrong jurisdiction.  What are they going to do?  Call in the other jurisdiction?  It takes too much time.  I hope if I ever get pulled over in this thing, I hope it's Officer fucking Fuddlegum's.  What's that chocolate pudding called?  Fuddlement?  I hope it's old Officer Fumbledums.  Officer Dumbledore.  I hope it's him.  Man, you should have seen him.  He was sprinting to the scene of the crime.  And by the way, this was all instigated by some fucking guy.  There was this little fucking 12-year-old girl.  First of all, goddamn, man, this is the point.  You have to protect yourself, and you have to protect the people that are close to you.  And just start being a stand-up guy in public.  It's fun.  Go fuck with people.  If you see someone acting out of pocket, just go up to them.  It's the most fun shit ever.  You just have to get really huge.  You can't have a gun.  You can't have a knife.  That's not reality.  You go to jail right away.  That's what you will go to jail for.  You just got to get huge.  But that's the most fun thing in the world.  Hey, what are you doing?  I love saying it like that.  I think Nick, I think I got that from Nick.

That's what I used to think.  I used to think if you're going to mess with somebody in public, you had to be like, hey, faggot, want to die?  Like the type of shit that I would insult people with in like middle school.  Hey, hey, fuck face, you want to die?  That's not how it is.  The real thing to do, you just twist your face up like this and then go up to him.  I think I got this from Nick.  Twist your face up and go, what are you doing?  Like, say it like that.  What are you doing?  More, that's too surfer-ish.  That's too, like, innocent.  What are you doing?  Just hit him with that.  I love that.  Hey, excuse me.  Do you need help?  Asking, making your face super angry and then asking someone if they need help.  Excuse me, do you need help?  Ooh.  Anyway, this is all precipitated by, there was this guy asking a fucking, like, prepubescent girl where she lives.  And I went up to her and I was like, do you know that guy?  And she said no.  And there was a cop, like, right there.  So I went up to fucking Officer Busybone and told him.  And he sprinted to the scene.  He put on his magic cape and his Tony Stark Iron Man suit and sprinted to the scene.  I was amazed.  I just saw a blur moving.  No, he went into Walgreens.  He said, I'll call it in.  He went into motherfucking nigga Walgreens and got aspirin.  I watched him.  He got aspirin and some other cold remedy thing.  Stupid.  Fuck, man.  People everywhere.  You have to fucking protect yourself.  That's all there is to it.  All right, guys.  Whoa, whoa, she's a buckin' bronco.  That's what I say when I bog first gear.  I say, oh, she's a buckin' bronco.  We call that rock-by-baby mode.  All right.  That's all there is to it.  That was fun.  I like lawless mode.  I like to drive around when it's lawless, and we'll be doing that more soon.

My dad drove a Morris 1000 van.  It had a crank handle that you'd put in the front, just under the bonnet, under the grill.  And in the winter, it'd have to... And sometimes in the summer, too.  And it was just big enough out the back to put a mattress in it.  So me and my brother could be woken up at the crack of dawn, thrown in the back in our pyjamas with all the holiday stuff, and my dad would start the five-hour drive down there.  It was quite the vehicle to drive around in.  It was tank green.  And someone had clipped the offside wing at some point, and my dad, being a metal worker, worked in the foundry.  rather than pay out for a wing, and for a vehicle that old, almost impossible to get one, he made one out of a sheet of metal and riveted it on.  So not only was it tank green, but it had a riveted wing, so it was very tank-like, which to a four-year-old boy was amazing.  We'd get down to Swanage, and it was just amazing, just mind-blowing.  You know, I rarely left Dartford.  We didn't have... be holidays abroad or anything fancy.  It was just schlepping down to Swanage.  But going up to Corfe Castle, safe as houses, just running around the countryside.  Going down the beach, safe as houses.  Mum and Dad would just let us go.  We'd only come back when we were hungry.  Getting to the hotel.  Everyone knew everyone.  It's how it seemed to me as a child, but of course they didn't.  But they related to them because they were the same people.  They were all our people.  And I'd watch them as a little boy.  I'd just watch these adults drinking beers and drinking wines.  And they'd chat with these people.  they met in the hotel bar that night.  And they'd be laughing and performing and stories and all sorts.  It was quite the place to go.  In the street I grew up in, every single door on that road, there was about 25 houses each side.  Every single door would be open in the summer.  And as a young boy, six or seven years old, if I weren't playing tennis or football in the street with all the other kids, there was a good 15, 20 other kids lived on that road.  You had the gardeners down at the bottom, Pauline and Joe were the parents.  You had Amanda, Graham, Scott, Emma.  Amanda, Graham, Scott, Emma.  Oh, there was another one.  Amanda, Graham, Scott.  Amanda Graham, Scott, Aaron, Emma.  That's it, five.  You had Pete and Veronica.  He was a London cabbie.  And they had Kevin, Tracy, Karen and little Pete.  You had the Jarvis's.  They had two daughters.  You had David, Mark and Emma Horton.  You had a couple over the road.  Pauline and Alan Johnson.  With Wayne and Anthony.  Anthony.  There's more than that.  That's just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.  And we'd all play in the streets.  And you could go into anyone's house.  Everyone knew everyone.  I'd just go in as a little kid.  They'd be like, hello, Chris, what are you up to?  And I'd just sort of sit there, seeing them cleaning up or doing whatever they were doing.  If someone got locked out, because I was a little bit nimble and very small, there'd be a knock on my door.  Hello, Janet, can I throw Chris through the upstairs window?  My mum would be like, yeah, all right.  I used to love it.  Ladder up to the bathroom window, climbing up there, climb through the upstairs window, bounce off their bed, go downstairs and let them in.  Everyone knew everyone else's name.  And everyone trusted everyone.  1977 silver jubilee.  my dad he'd left the foundry by this point.  he was doing painting and decorating and he got a job doing all the redoing all the interiors for a flag making company and they gave him a union jacket.  it was about 60 foot long and we used it as a tablecloth.  and at the 1977 silver jubilee that flag.  when it was a tablecloth all the kids sat around it everyone chipped in Everyone put a few quid in, all food was bought and all the kids sat around with their hats on.  Everyone had painted their drain pipes and their fences silver for the Jubilee.  There was games and competitions, you know, running up the street with a balloon between your knees, having to pass it on to someone else.  My mum set up a street club.  Every week she'd go round every house and I think she collected something like 60p off of each of them.  Every week.  And then once there was enough money in the coffers, they'd have a street club committee meeting.  I think her, Veronica, Barbara, Pauline and Alice were on the committee.  And they'd decide what they were going to do with the money once they'd had enough.  It would be the usual sorts of things.  We'd have a disco down the RAF hall.  Or we'd jump in a coach and go to Margate.  Something like that.  And if we did jump in a coach and go to Margate, and there was three seats left over on the coach, my mum went to the local orphanage.  And she'd tell her, we've got a few seats on the coach if some of the boys or girls want to come with us.  And they'd just offload a few kids on us, and they'd come down to Margate with us.  And it was just wonderful.  And I knew it.  I knew it.  Even as an eight or nine or four, five, six, I knew this was... Just something special.  I was part of Cubs.  I went to Cubs.  Started a year early.  No one minded.  You know, keep it down.  But I loved it so much.  Stayed there for a few years.  Oh, loads of young boys went to Cubs from around the community.  Mum would come and pick me up.  She'd be chatting to all the other mothers.  Very few of the mothers worked.  No, they looked after children.  They raised children and looked after homes.  Fathers were out working.  And it worked, and people were happy.  It was a struggle.  I mean, when my mum and dad got married, first few days, I think, or weeks, sorry, and this is what my mum has told me, obviously I wasn't born, but for the first few weeks, my mum and dad sat there entering competitions, like 100, 150 a day, see if they could get any free stuff.  They used to grow button mushrooms in shoeboxes under the stairs.  Not magic ones, just mushrooms to eat.  Used to grow runner beans and mint out in the back garden.  Tomatoes, etc.  Rhubarb.  The amount of rhubarb, crumble and custard I ate as a kid.  Still makes my mouth water.  It was just, it was just, you know, for communities that had very little, it was remarkably happy, it was remarkably engaged.  Because we had the things that mattered.  We had safety.  We had a sense of communal security.  We had community.  We had family.  We had friendships.  And we had things to do.  We socialized.  And this is the sort of thing that's at stake because as I got older, I started watching this change.  And when I talk about these things in my streams or whatever or hint about these little odd things that we've done, I know the people around my age get a bit bleary-eyed, and I get sent emails all the time, people saying, I listen to your streams, I remember all that.  You know, even as I got a bit older, 11 or 12, off to secondary school, it wasn't a problem.  When I come home from school, we used to go around playing on the estates.  I lived on the oldest estate in Dartford, ironically called Newtown.  But it was no problem going over Temple Hill Estate.  It was no problem going up to Fleet Estate.  Fleet Estate thought they had a bit more money than the rest of us.  Temple Hill was the proper dogs.  But you could go over any of those estates.  They were safe.  You might have the odd little tear up with, you know, another kid, but that's because kids have little tear ups.  But there was a cohesive group unity.  There was something that identified us all as part of the same tribe.  And the effect that that had on that entire area was valuable, was operative, was necessary, and made life wonderful.  I saw it starting to change.  I couldn't believe it.  As I got to 15, 16, things started changing.  And it's not that I'm opposed to change.  Excuse me, on the contrary.  Change is inevitable.  Change is actually essential.  I don't think we should live in museums.  Nothing will crush a spirit like that.  But certain things need preserving because they don't actually require change.  They might differ in appearance.  They might alter aesthetically or superficially.  But at heart... things like family, things like security, safety, community.  They're essential to us.  And although there's corporations desperate, desperate to remove those things from us, why?  So they can sell them back to us in diluted, simulated forms.  But when I think about the way England's going... when I think about the direction it's moving and what's happening to it, I think back to how it used to be.  I think back to how lucky I was to inhabit a world that was so beautiful and so perfect for a young child to grow into, a place that responded to his curiosity.  that responded to his natural risk-taking, that allowed him to find his identity within groups of people who accepted him as one of them.  So when I think about this sort of stuff, when I think about what's happened to that incredible culture, the great British culture, These are the things that make me realize these changes have to be made.  We need to halt this ridiculous, liberal, multicultural movement that's just plowing forward with no regard for the people who actually have to inhabit its spaces.  And that's not just the native ethnic British.  That's the immigrants too.  This project fails for everyone.  And everyone involved becomes starved of the very basic things that make humans happy, that give humans the option of fulfilling their potential.  Safety, security, family, community, nation.  Because when I think about people having children, people raising families in England, When I see that they're not, when I see the birth rate plummeting, I'm not surprised.  Frightening places to breed.  Frightening places to put children.  How the hell are you meant to protect children in such an environment, in such a hostile environment, where you don't have community, where you don't have socializing, where you kind of know in advance?  the only way you can keep them safe is to keep them in the house.  And that does damage to children.  And that does damage to families.  We had an amazing country.  England was just wonderful.  We can have it again.  We can have it again.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker reminisces about their childhood in Dartford, England, where they grew up in a close-knit community.

Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  and blessed and blessed are the fruits of thy womb Ave Maria. So I gather you've been hearing some internal music for months, years or possibly decades and you're a little bit curious as to what it means.  The majority of people sort of don't know what to do with it and that's why we classify them as semi-gnostics.  Because the actual internal music you're hearing, whether it be Ave Maria or even some beautiful pop music, is in fact signalling you and all you have to do is reframe your understanding of what's producing the music.  And you'll be able to reply to it, respond to it.  It's something well worth doing and it's free.  I'll stress for you right now that it's not your mind accidentally producing lovely elevator music for you because you never asked for that, did you?  And you often wonder why the music turns up at inappropriate times.  That's kind of fascinating, isn't it?  Well, I'll tell you.  You're actually being signaled by your own divine spark.  And how to respond to it and what to do and take advantage of the second great attribute of the Divine Spark, that is, physical evidence that the Divine Spark makes itself physically known to you.  so that you know you're not making this up and it's not your own mind producing elevator music.  You can learn all this in just a 20-minute lesson at TrueBlueHealer.com.  It takes about 20 minutes.  You're given some immediate physical evidence.  Within a week you will have some vivid messaging dreams and you'll be able to start replying to the messaging music.  So that's all very easy, straightforward, and all of your questions will be answered there, even if you've got extra questions after the 20-minute formal lesson.  The formal lesson only sort of reframes your thinking a little bit, so you'll be able to see exactly what to do, know exactly what to do instinctively when you hear this messaging music, which is reported by millions of people.  Now what if you're listening to this lovely music video right now and you can safely say that you don't remember ever hearing internal music.  Can I tell you that after a twenty minute visit to TrueBlueHealer.com you will begin to hear spurts of communicating music.  Sometimes the music will have lyrics floating upon it, won't it?  The lyrics have some meaning and they will gradually clarify and become solid music.  And you'll get the same lesson as the Seminostics.  The Seminostics are the people who have heard music for years but never knew what to do with it.  and never went as far as to think that something's signaling me.  Well, that is the truth.  That's what's happening and you can verify this with physical evidence at TrueBlueHealer.com.  If you're not hearing it, you soon will hear some musical signaling and you will also get some vivid messaging dreams and other types of signals that you've literally never thought of.  So that's why you've been hearing music such as what we've just been listening to in this beautiful video.  There's a reason why you hear internal beautiful music.  You are being signaled.

The flu season is upon us.  It could make you very sick.  Which type will we worry about this year?  You'll want to be protected.  And what kind of shots will we be told to take?  The swine flu virus still spreading around the world this morning.  Kill it by washing your hands as soon as you can.  The World Health Organization has raised its alert level to five.  I have decided to raise the current level of influenza pandemic alert from phase four to phase five.  That means that all of humanity could be threatened.  The virus is spreading.  And they're worried about the potential for many deaths around the world.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Come here.  What do you think you're up to?  The swine flu.  It could knock you flat.  Local hospitals are bracing for a swine flu flood.  You got to hit it before it hits you.  Here at Emanuel Hospital, Legacy Emanuel Hospital in North Portland, they are erecting these overflow swine flu tents out in the parking lot just adjacent to the emergency room here.  Experts say you might not even hear the sneeze that could make you sick.  We are a significant step closer to a pandemic.  The Centers for Disease Control says H1N1 has spread to 46 states.  More than 1,000 Americans have died.  Experts say they are concerned that as the virus passes through populations, it could become more severe.  The scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met.  30% of the deaths are in healthy people with no underlying problems.  I have therefore decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert.  from phase five to phase six.  WHO reported that more than 10,000 people had died from H1N1.  The Centers for Disease Control this past week quadrupled its estimated H1N1 flu virus death toll.  Today's numbers are about four times higher than what the CDC reported.  Swine flu seems to be spreading at a great rate.  The president today declared the swine flu a national emergency.  The swine flu pandemic, it was expected to kill millions, and the CDC even predicted 40% of the population would be infected.  But we don't hear about it anymore.  Tonight, you've asked, what happened to the swine flu?  And KXY4's Melissa Lux says, good question.  Asian flu is expected this winter, according to the U.S.  Public Health Service.  See your physician about a flu vaccine.  She was training to be a pro football cheerleader and she got a flu shot.  The swine flu shot.  The earlier we get the vaccines, the better.  Absolutely.

Here's a quick message for you all.  I decided to come out to Blanchardstown to meet Pat Quinlan and help him do his petition to have Roderick O'Gorman, the Minister for Children, removed from his position and get him to resign.  I decided to give him a hand and we're out here and we've had an amazing response at the doorsteps here in Blanchardstown.  I would say at least 9 out of 10 people are quite happy to sign this petition to have this man removed.  So I think it's great work that he's been doing and I'm delighted to help out.  So Pat, how are you feeling? Absolutely fantastic, to say the least.  When I started on this endeavor, I didn't think I'd be getting that much of a positive response.  I thought people would just think all sorts, being honest.  I wasn't really sure what people would think of the party or what I'm doing trying to get rid of Roderick because there's a lot of other voices in that arena and they just kind of like bat you down with every type of word they can.  But what I'm finding the more and more I go to the doors and the more and more you actually chat to people and just break it down why you want them gone.  Children at the age of 16 being able to change the agenda.  No opposition to the RSE sex education.  Won't fully disavow Peter Tatchell.  And then recently, he's after making it easier for any Tom, Dick and Harry to foster a child.  It's been received with welcome arms.  Yesterday, out of 200 houses, we got 178 signatures.  That tells you where the people of Dublin West stand with this man.  They don't like his policies and they want them gone.  And I want him gone as well, and I'll be here for help until the end of time, collecting signatures until he's gone.  But thanks very much as well for coming out.  No bother.  And it's been great as well, just in general, the party membership, being able to help and come out whenever they could. Okay, guys, there you have it.  Feel free to come out and give us a hand here if you want to get in touch with Pat Quinlan, National Party, out here in Blanchardstown, and R2 and myself, Philip DeWire MP, on Twitter or YouTube or Facebook.

Thank you guys so much for blessing me.  I can't believe my dream car is only 30 grand.  Maybe you and me, we're going to be zipping around.  I'm hyperventilating because I'm surrounded by my dream.  I can't believe it, dude.  I'm so excited.  Oh, my God.  Yes!  I can't believe.  in five days I'm going to be taking delivery of this Fiat 124 Spyder.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  This is like getting a blowjob from a guy!  This car's like getting a blowjob from a guy!  Yes!  Yes!  Yeah!  Woo!  I love my car.  I love this car so much.  The Mazda MX-5 has one big problem.  You tell any girl that you just bought a Mazda Miata, she'll say, oh my God, how cute.  What's your boyfriend's name?  And is it okay if I bring my partner with me?  Sure, and what's your name again?  I'm sorry. My name is Sam Hyde.  What started as a YouTube riches-to-rag success story turned tragic when unmedicated online man Sam Hyde finally snapped, went loco, and took a car salesman hostage on a high-speed race chase.  Investigators raided this man's house and found videos of him confessing, all the while laughing at the fear and terror of this poor man.  Sorry, I think we spoke on the phone about driving the Fiat 124 Spider. Let's take a peek.  We got in the car, and right away, it was so uncomfortable, even before doing anything.  The guy, he's kind of portly.  He's on the bigger side.  I'm 6'4\", so we're shoulder to shoulder.  I mean, we could have been sharing the same condom, basically.  It sure is a tight fit in here.  You and me, we're in here.  We're crammed in like sardines.  Can you believe it?  I can tell visually just from his skin and the tensing of his muscles that even before we started driving, he really was not having a good time driving.  being stuffed next to, uh, Mr.  Huge F*** Mo.  Turn this radio off.  I just want to hear the music of conversation, right?  What was your name again?  Bobby.  I just don't want to ruin my audio.  Okay.  I'm just teasing you.  I'm kidding.  This is the other thing that people don't know, is that I smell.  I don't necessarily shower.  I never, I haven't worn deodorant in like six years, okay?  I have a strong fragrance to me.  I'm a big ass air freshener.  Can we go down and back on the highway real quick?  I just want to feel. We just passed the highway.  We only have time for a five minute drive.  You can't be driving it like this.  You have to drive it normal.  This isn't a race track. This is the speed limit.  You can't be driving it like that. Well, it's a fast one.  I think this is one of the first times where the vehicle has actually outrun the chopper. None of Rhode Island police could keep up with Hyde's flamboyant hell ride.  When we return, we'll see how our salesman's deal with the devil got him more than he bargained for, as he clocks out for eternity. CrimeWire Tonight. crime wire tonight back to our top story.  or transgender stunt driver puts the drag back in drag racism tonight we investigate. don't worry i'm a certified racer.  so the guy.  he tells me which exit to take and i started pretending like i didn't know what to do even though it's like very clearly obvious that you're supposed to take the exit on the right To the left or right here? To the right. Okay.  To the right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I freaked out and I didn't want to crash.  That added about 20 minutes to our journey.  Because we went right into traffic. We're going to be stuck in traffic for an hour. I think that's an exaggeration.  Just like Bruce.  There's a solid 20 minutes of just silence, like sitting with this guy.  that hates me.  I'm so sorry.  Maybe you should drive us back.  I was just fucking molested by the Fiat salesman.  He grabbed my crotch.  The camera was on my crotch.  This is like a clown test drive right now.  Well, I'm sorry, but I panicked because you were screaming at me.  I figured I had to turn off a GoPro. Here we see the salesman's last-ditch attempt to save his life and fight back by employing reverse psychology tactics taught by Joe Rogan, gay MMA. I hope you at least get some commission off that. I don't want the commission. Yeah, a 65-year-old man.  Can you imagine that?  Imagine he's going through the settings faster than I am. He's right there on the shoulder right now, passing that box truck. Little did this salesman know that his funeral would be conducted at 120 miles per hour, and his final car commission will be a bullet to the skull. CrimeWire Tonight.  Crimes. Welcome back.  Tonight we will watch deadly footage rated R for racing, in which we will see the hostage make a last-ditch attempt to save his worthless, pathetic life by calling the car dealership he works at.  All the while, the madman behind the wheel will continuously taunt him.  Has this comedian's ultimate joke gone too far? Yeah, Jess, I'm on a test drive.  We told him we couldn't go on the highway.  He goes on the highway anyway.  Starts taking the on-ramp like we're driving a Ferrari. Well, don't tell Jess. I tell him what exit to take, and he deliberately keeps going straight.  So I'm getting a little aggravated right now, and I honestly think he's recording stuff.  I am not recording this.  Because he's talking stupid, asking me if the car has a V8 engine.  So I'm getting pretty physical.  It's got a lot of pickup.  When we come back, I don't want to deal with it.  Because right now we're stuck on 295 with bumper-to-bumper traffic. 40 miles an hour. Deliberately.  Deliberately went to the left. You are a liar.  You're lying about me to Jeff. I have a feel in this bag he's got because I noticed a camera staring at me. There's not a camera staring at you.  I'm not recording.  This is the exit you want, right?  You sure picked a small car to get in an argument in, didn't you?  It's like I'm just being in a closet. The car was going so fast that our team of highly trained and professional cameramen could not bring you the final moments of this car chase. If you pull one more driving stunt, you're going to walk back. Don't say it so loud. Oh yeah, it's me. You're the one screaming at me.  I think you'd be the one walking back.  Oh really? Yeah.  I wouldn't push that if I was you. What are you going to do, have the police come right up here? No.  It's happened before. I don't believe you. But at least this tale had a happy ending. Well, I love the car. That's the good news.

Millions of Israelites just disappeared and vanished into history forever, never to be seen again.  Whilst around the same time period, millions of people just magically appeared, becoming what we call the Germanic tribes.  I'm sure it's all just a coincidence.  Welcome to the first part of a new series where we will uncover where each tribe of Israel is located today, where we will examine the evidence, explore the clues and uncover lost history and piece together what we can find out, starting with the tribe of Dan.  In the early Greek classical literature, Theodorus Siculus mentions a Moses leading his people, the Israelites, out of Egypt during the Exodus, into a region called Judea.  This shows that there are in fact records of the 12 tribes even in the Greek classics.  But also mentioned is that a vast number, instead of following Moses, rallied together and sailed for Greece.  So many of the Greeks were in fact Israelites, even though they didn't realize it.  They were led by Zarah's descendants, Dada and Chalcol, the kingly lion from Judah.  Now this was the beginning of the prophecy that all Adamic nations would gradually be replaced by Israelites.  The promises Yahweh God made.  Dada is known for settling the region that he named Dardania, and later his descendants set up Troy, whilst Chalcol is known for setting up the city Thebes and introducing the Hebrew-Phoenician alphabet.  But there is also another group that came with them called the Danans or Danoi.  They settled in Archaea, the northern part of the Peloponnesus Peninsula of Greece.  So they were also called Archaeans.  They were said to be descended from a Danaeus the Egyptian.  He was a legendary leader, and according to the legend, he was a son of Abellus, king of Egypt.  The truth no doubt got confounded a bit, and these were certainly the Israelite tribe of Dan, who was the son of Bela.  the island sardinia was even named after them.  sardinia meaning remnant of dan.  it still bears that name to-day.  how interesting that a place would bear the name of dan.  Jacob prophesied concerning Dan that wherever his descendants were to go they would leave a serpent's path.  The snake as it slithers along the ground it leaves a trail or a track.  In the same manner Dan's descendants would do this by leaving signs and waymarks throughout their travels and the migration routes they followed.  In other words, they would name the places they traveled and settled to after their patriarch Dan.  We even see this demonstrated in the Old Testament.  Dan originally lived in a territory next to Ephraim, Benjamin, and Judah, and also the Philistines.  During the Judges period, 600 Danonites sought a new territory in the north of Canaan.  And on their way they camped in a place in Judah which the Danalites called Manahan Dan, meaning Camp of Dan.  After they had smitten the people of Laish with the sword and burned the city, they called the new city Dan.  The children of Dan continued this practice throughout their migrations and we can find a trail of names all throughout Europe.  in hebrew there are no vowels so the name dan is written dn or its hebrew equivalent.  so words like dan din don dun den or dn correspond to the name of dan.  just take a look at the names of the rivers of europe.  we have the danube the Danyepa, the Danyesta, the Danau, the Desi, the Devi, the Dan, the Don, the Udon, the Eridon, and thousands of others, Dans and Dons of ancient and early geography.  However, it is not just limited to rivers, but also towns, cities, settlements, and as we will find out, even entire nations would bear the name of Dan.  Greece wasn't the only place with a people called Dan.  The early Irish history also tells us of a people called the Tuatha de Danann, which literally means the people of Dan.  They were said to be descended from a Dana, which is obviously Dan.  They arrived in several waves of migrations roughly between 1200 and 800 BC.  Now this would be around the Judges period, and when we examine the text of the Book of the Judges, this fits perfectly.  The Song of Deborah and Barak, during the ongoing battle, it asks, why did Dan remain in ships?  And Dan abode in ships.  Dan did not participate, so what were they up to?  The territory of the tribe of Dan had a major seaport, Joppa.  giving them easy access to ships, and some must have been seafarers.  Evidently, some chose to migrate rather than get involved in the battles, and some must have reached the coast of Ireland.  Upon their arrival, they conquered the Furbolgs, a race of people who were living in Ireland at the time, who likely were Geppethites.  The Danites ruled Ireland from then on until the arrival of the Malaysians.  who were another branch of the Israelites.  They had several battles until peace was established.  But from then on, Ireland was ruled by the Malaysian kings.  This demonstrates how far and wide the Danites were travelling to.  The Viper's Trail was not just the rivers, but many towns and settlements were also named after Dan.  In Northern Ireland, we have Donegal, which means Fault of Dan.  And in Scotland, we have the River Don.  throughout europe we have many guideposts and waymarks left by dan the city dunkirk meaning church of dan dundee dunbar dunraven edinburgh and even london.  if anything this demonstrates that the tribe of dan were continuously migrating into europe.  So did the tribe of Dan ever claim a country from themselves?  Is there any land in the world named after Dan?  Denmark, the name of the modern country in Europe, north of Germany, literally means Dan's mark, Dan's land, Dan's last resting place.  Its people are called the Danes.  According to their legends, they originated from a patriarch called Dan.  The first king allegedly to rule over Denmark was also called Dan, as well as many later kings were also named Dan.  In addition, because at one time Denmark ruled all the surrounding regions, the whole region took its name from them, the Scandinavian Peninsula.  Clearly, here are the remnants of the people of Dan who migrated westward overland from the Caucasus to the present location in Northern Europe.  The ships constructed by the Norse were long and slender.  They were very low down.  The shallow draught of the Norse warships had several advantages.  The Norse could raid well inland by sailing far up rivers that were normally way too shallow for typical sea-going vessels of the day.  the frankish kingdoms in present-day france were astonished by the north raids in unthinkable location hundreds of kilometres inland on rivers not thought possible to be navigable.  in addition they had a serpent or dragon head placed on the front.  thus in many ways they sailed like snakes or serpents down the rivers and through the oceans and seas.  when you consider this with the viper's trail prophecy of the danes it is startlingly accurate.  the long serpent or the ormond lung was the most legendary warship and the pride of the norwegian king.  It was built on special orders of Trigerson, who had captured a similar but smaller dragon ship.  This one had to be far larger and more carefully put together.  Snorri Sturluson wrote in Hames Kringler, it was exceptionally long, built on the model Drakkar, and its stem and stern were gilded.  The ship was long, broad, high-sided, and strongly timbered.  The ship was a dragon.  The other major prophecy is that Dan, which can mean to judge, would judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.  However, could this be a misunderstanding or perhaps a mistranslation?  You see, the word Dan can also have other meanings than simply judge or to be judged.  it can also mean to vindicate to govern to rule to strive against or to contend with.  now when it comes to prophecies quite often it's difficult if not impossible to tell what the prophecy is all about.  until centuries or even thousands of years after the prophecy has happened then you have the luxury of being able to look back and realize what the prophecy was all about.  so would a better translation have been dan shall strive against his people as one of the tribes of Israel, or Dan shall contend with his people.  Is there any European nation or people who at one period contended with and strove against all the other European nations, all the other tribes, collectively at one time?  Did the Danes raid, plunder and loot all the other tribes and nations of Europe by any chance?  The Viking raids which largely involved the Danes and Norse peoples hit virtually every country in Europe.  Most known famously.  they invaded England trying to completely take it over.  Also hitting Scotland, Wales and Ireland so all the British Isles.  They raided Brittany, Frisia and the Frankish Kingdoms.  sailing right up the rivers into paris spain was not safe either the iberian states all the coast right round and the italian states as well.  in the east of europe they made extensive use of the rivers so germany and poland even reaching the byzantine empire the middle east and persia.  but they also went north moving into finland and conquest as far as russia for settlements iceland greenland and there is evidence of america.  so when we look at the entire prophecy with this information Dan shall strive against his people.  The rage certainly did cause the nations of Europe to tumble backwards and civilizations stagnated.  But this also had a positive effect, it caused the nations of Europe to unify and homogenize under a Christian monarch.  If they wanted to remain Christian, well they'd have to fight for it and come together putting all their faith in God to overcome the pagan invaders.  for example in england around seven ninety a d before the vikings arrived it was a hodgepodge of petty kingdoms and warring states.  there were as many as at least eleven different kingdoms on the main island england wales and scotland.  They were continuously competing year by year, claiming territory back and forth from each other.  But once the Vikings arrived, this all changed.  As the raids increased, they also completely overwhelmed the Anglo-Sacculan populace.  By 875, they controlled two-thirds of England, and the only real holdout was Alfred de Grey in Wessex.  and for a time even he was hiding in the marshes.  by the time of his death.  however in eight ninety nine he had turned the tide and became the dominant ruler on the island the first known king of the anglo-saxons.  similar circumstances occurred all throughout europe.  eventually of course the nordic countries themselves would become christians but they were the very last ones.  Thus the last part of the prophecy, I have waited for thy salvation, can only be referring to them being the last to accept Christ at Christianity.  When you examine the various forms of Norse runes and compare them to the Hebrew-Phoenician alphabet, you will notice how strikingly similar to each other they are.  If we have an understanding that the Israelites migrated to Europe, and that we are all the same people as the old testament then it is certainly no surprise.  we brought our alphabet and language with us since our ancestors were deported by the assyrians and for a time had prolonged interactions With their society.  as well as the Medes and the Persians, our languages also picked up many of their words.  Greek also comes from the Phoenician alphabet and then Latin from Greek.  So whatever way you want to trace it, all of our languages share the same origin from the Hebrew from our ancestors.  Languages, dialects and alphabets are always continuously evolving and with the influence of the catholic church.  gradually all european countries homogenized their alphabets into the modern alphabet we have today.  one of the common questions you'll find is why is dan not in the book of revelation?  the book Book of Revelation chapter 7 tells us of 12,000 from each tribe being sealed.  To give a quick overview, this chapter is about the incoming destruction of Rome, and this part is where it is momentarily suspended while the tribes could be sealed.  This assures us that a sufficient number of Israelites would survive the judgement to come upon the empire.  And by this we know all the tribes of Israel are still alive today, they are not missing.  There is no tribe of Dan mentioned here, which gives us a historical clue as to the context of this sealing.  The tribe of Dan was not mentioned because the main body of the tribe, as Israel, existed in the world at this time, but it was not within the bounds of the empire, nor amongst those invading the empire, the Germanic tribes, but rather they were quite safe up in northern europe such as denmark and the other nordic countries since dan was for the most part up in scandinavia.  it is not mentioned by the author of the book of revelation for that reason but rest assured the tribe of dan is still with us today.  So if the tribe of Dan went to Europe and is still here and they were white, what did the other tribes look like?  Would they not all have been in Europe as well?  In future videos we shall take a look at all the other tribes, where they are, what their prophecies foretold and what it means today.  The Europeans are the same people as the Old Testament, the descendants of Jacob.  When you read the Bible you are reading your own family's book.  And the time is coming when our people will finally wake up.","channel.id":"clxmi0mkw0121cdviprmvy4pp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","channel.name":"TruthVids","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVAyptfys-UmOQ2qarn1fQod4Buiqcki0hctHTY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The enigma of the lost tribes of Israel has puzzled scholars for centuries.

Okay, I'm back with more info on Bill Gates.  I read this article in Zero Hedge, and well, I just had to do a story on it.  As a follow-up to the last report I did on how Gates is using his vaccine alliance to lobby the Canadian government to push for his coronavirus vaccine.  Anyways, we've gone through remarkable changes over the last few months to fight coronavirus, and we've lost most of our civil liberties in the process.  In fact, I would argue our countries look more like a communist wet dream now, including fines for standing too close to strangers, fines for being in a park, citizens forced onto a universal basic income because they've shut down the economy, millions out of work, business owners getting arrested and jailed for not complying with shutdown orders, etc.  The decision-making for quarantine, social distancing, and shutting down the economy have all been due to projections of computer models, and most of the West has imposed extreme China model lockdowns on their entire populations.  But how accurate is the science that got us here?  I would argue very, very corrupted.  There are two major models that are being used in the West to predict and respond to the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the USA and Europe.  One was developed at Imperial College of London, and the second one, which is more focused on the effects on America, was created by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, also known as IHME, and it's based in Seattle, near one of Bill Gates' homes.  So what's so interesting about both of these institutions?  Well, both groups owe their existence to mega funding by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Did you also know that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is not a charity?  Nope.  It's actually a private tax exempt foundation.  And as you know, Bill Gates is leading the coronavirus vaccine charge.  maybe because his foundation stands to make billions on vaccines and other drugs to treat coronavirus.  In early March, Professor Neil Ferguson, head of the MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, issued a widely discussed model that forecasts possible coronavirus deaths in the UK as high as 500,000.  Now, Ferguson works very closely with the World Health Organization.  Other than actual countries, Bill Gates' foundation is the biggest financial contributor to WHO.  That report pushed by Ferguson was the reason why the UK government went from a typical public health policy of isolating at-risk patients while not shutting down the economy and not trapping healthy people in their houses.  A few days after the UK went into lockdown, Ferguson's institute revised the death estimates several times and substantially.  His absurd predictions didn't happen and the UK economy has flatlined.  But that's not all.  Imperial College, along with Ferguson, have a serious track record for predicting doom and gloom with diseases.  In 2002, they said up to 50,000 people in the UK would die from mad cow disease, possibly even 150,000.  Guess what?  A total of 178 people were registered as dying from mad cow.  In 2005, Ferguson predicted that up to 200 million worldwide would die from bird flu.  By early 2006, only 78 deaths were linked to the virus.  Then in 2009, Imperial College anticipated that H1N1 would kill roughly 65,000 in the UK.  In the end, only 457 people died of the virus.  Now, why would the UK government listen to Ferguson when his group has a notoriously bad track record of predicting deaths that don't come to fruition and panicking people?  Ferguson was also the source of the insane forecast that 2.2 million Americans would be killed by COVID if the economy wasn't shut down immediately.  Ferguson's modeling caught the attention of Dr.  Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy Infectious Diseases, and another very close associate of Bill Gates.  And he put President Trump on blast by pressuring him to declare a national health emergency.  Once the damage to the economy began in the US, Ferguson sneakily lowered the US fatality estimates to between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.  That is one dramatic revision.  In both the US and UK cases, Ferguson's modeling relied on Chinese data, which has now been written off as unreliable.  Neil Ferguson and his modeling group at Imperial College are backed by WHO, but also receive millions in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Ferguson heads the Vaccine Impact Modeling Consortium at Imperial College, which lists as its funders the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Gates-backed GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.  From 2006 through 2018, the Gates Foundation has invested an impressive $184,872,226.99 into Ferguson's Imperial College modeling operations.  Now, why would Bill Gates invest so much money in a man and modeling system with an outrageous record for being wrong?  The second major institute to put out faulty models is the University of Washington and their Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IHME.  Their forecasts have been used to justify the draconian lockdowns imposed on the US public.  They also predicted the 2.2 million coronavirus deaths in the USA unless drastic measures were taken.  And by April 7th, they had revised the number down to 200,000 deaths.  Their latest correction put the deaths at roughly 60,000.  That's a far cry from 2.2 million.  IHME claims its revisions are a result of the lockdown taking effect, even though that would take weeks to show up.  Just like Ferguson at the Imperial College London, the University of Washington's IHME is another project of the Gates Foundation.  It was created in 2007 with a generous grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  IHME signed an agreement with WHO to collaborate on data used to estimate world health trends.  In 2017, they received an additional grant of $279 million from the Gates Foundation and another $210 million gift in 2016.  And like Ferguson, IHME has a terrible track record with overinflated models.  Data from one of their predictions found that 430,000 intensive care beds were needed across the U.S.  in March.  States went into a panic.  By the end of April, hospital beds were found empty all across the country and untold numbers of other operations had been canceled to make room for COVID-19 patients who never materialized.  There's also major issues with the testing itself.  A German lab recently reported that according to WHO recommendations, COVID-19 virus tests are now considered positive, even if the specific target sequence of the COVID-19 virus is negative and only the more general coronavirus target sequence is positive.  This can lead to other coronaviruses, such as cold viruses, also triggering a false positive test result.  That means you can have a simple cold and you are deemed coronavirus positive.  No wonder the number of people infected with corona has exploded.  And what about Dr.  Dan Erickson's claims that several U.S.  states have been pressured to issue death certificates mentioning COVID-19, even though they themselves did not agree?  All of it seems like they're intentionally pumping up the numbers to perhaps justify the tremendous devastation government intervention has caused when it wasn't warranted, or perhaps something more sinister is in the works, like mandatory vaccines or immunity passports for work and travel.  Anyways, what do you think about Bill Gates' influence on these models?  And I'm talking about financial influence.  Let me know in the comment section below.  I always love to hear from you.  Have a great day.","channel.id":"clxmi0lki00dkcdvieic0c63n","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCvQaTpHnhug8g47SDyoAgNw","channel.name":"Jill Colton","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXeomoV0GELjRe8HHLLXbwUVXTrAIcWCVwaZ8yPzQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-05-14T21:25:38.000Z","summary":"The article discusses Bill Gates' influence on COVID-19 models and lockdown policies.

So I'm about 10 weeks postpartum now and I've just sort of really needed to take a break from content creation here on my personal channel.  But if you've been following along over on my Motherland channel, you will have heard my birth story by now and you will have gotten a little bit of insight as to what my postpartum has been like so far.  If you haven't seen these videos yet, there'll be a link in the description of this video.  But for the sake of kind of a consistent timeline on this channel, I will be repeating some of those things.  Just so that they're here in case anyone who's not interested in the motherland channel You know hasn't heard these things and they just want to follow along with my personal journey.  They'll be here in this video.  This will also be hopefully the beginning of a more consistent upload schedule for me over on this channel.  I want to still make lots of mom content and And I've had the break that I needed.  Things have started to form somewhat of a pattern.  I can definitely find time at least once or twice in the week to make a video over here on my personal channel.  So yeah, I'm back and I'm very happy to be back.  So much has gone down since the last time I made an update.  I was doing live streams before and I plan on continuing to do live streams.  Just not today Was it wasn't something that I felt like doing today, but I will be doing personal streams still over here.  But yeah, that's really baby dependent a live stream with a newborn and It's not always the easiest thing to juggle, so I figured today I would just do a pre-recorded video.  In case you didn't hear my birth story over on the Motherland channel, I had an amazing experience with birth.  I had the home birth of my dreams.  It was exactly what I wanted.  I came out of my birth.  without needing a single stitch.  My body did exactly what it was intended to do.  I couldn't be more grateful.  I had a very fast labor as well.  It was only six hours with 45 minutes of pushing, which for a first time mom, that's pretty short.  I also was so grateful that I didn't experience the need to actively push my baby out.  My body did all of the work, which was incredible to experience.  It was nothing like what you see in movies and on television, you know, where you have a woman being coached, you know, one, two, three, push, and she's sort of screaming.  It was nothing like that.  It was a very peaceful birth.  And my baby came out screaming, It was a water birth, so he was screaming before he even broke the surface of the water, which was lovely.  Postpartum has been challenging and incredible.  Watching my little baby grow into the person that he's becoming is one of the greatest joys I think I've ever experienced in my entire life.  He's full of energy, my baby.  He's just got this kind of explosive kind of energy about him.  He's always kicking and punching the air and looking around and he's just great.  He also doesn't really cry unless there's a reason.  Of course he has fussy days, but normally if he's crying it's one of three things that needs to be sorted.  Once they're sorted he stops and so that's been fantastic as well.  One thing that I have been dealing with that has been really challenging for me is postpartum anxiety.  I don't have any feelings of depression, like I'm the happiest I've ever been probably in my whole life, but I do have a heightened sense of fear.  Just the other day, I was out for a walk in the woods with my husband and my baby in a sling, and we came upon a golden retriever.  And I literally felt like there was a bear coming towards me.  It was crazy.  I also still feel a very strong need to constantly check to see if my baby is breathing.  And yeah, it's difficult sometimes.  I have a lot of worries about his safety and about my safety and my husband's safety and so if there are any moms out there watching right now and you have some words of wisdom or tips for how I can Deal with my postpartum anxiety.  I would really appreciate that, you know, just leave them below and I am exclusively breastfeeding my baby and that's also very challenging.  It's extremely rewarding and I feel very grateful that I'm able to do that with my baby.  But it's hard work.  The sleep deprivation is real.  He's still very little and he needs to be breastfed quite often.  So it means that he's calling all the shots.  I'm working on his schedule 24-7 and that's a really big adjustment to make.  But I'm not going to judge anyone for not breastfeeding.  But for me, I could never just give up.  Unless I'm physically unable To breastfeed, I'm going to breastfeed my baby.  I know it's best for my baby.  And yeah, the alternatives are just, they're not, it would actually be, I think it would be worse for my mental health if I stopped breastfeeding because I would just feel so guilty.  Yeah, I mean, I am really happy.  I'm Doing a lot more content on Instagram now.  I feel like that's a platform where I just feel more comfortable.  I feel like there's a lot more joy over there.  It's a lot easier to connect with women who are like me over there.  And so if you haven't followed me on Instagram yet and you're interested in seeing pictures of the baby or following along with a more detailed posts, daily posts of my experience as a mom, You can check me out over there.  There'll be a link in the description to my Instagram.  And yeah, I mean, I don't want to make this too long of a video.  I would just like to say that I'm back.  I'm doing really well.  And there will be more mom content coming in the coming weeks.  If there is anything in specific that you would like to hear from me that you haven't heard from me on other platforms, please feel free to leave that as a comment in the description and I'll do my best to answer those things.  What you can look forward to over here, I think it would be great to do some birth specific videos, some postpartum specific videos.  I'm doing cloth diapering.  I would love to do a video on my experience with cloth diapering my baby.  And yeah, just kind of, you know, following along with the journey and, you know, hoping to find other women to connect with who are also either hopeful moms or new moms or very experienced moms.  So thank you so much for listening.  And yeah, talk to you soon.

Oh yeah, it's me. You know, it's been a long road starting on YouTube.  No subscribers.  And, you know, finally working up to the point where I can afford my dream car, the Fiat 124 Spyder, is truly awesome.  And I thank God every day.  I thank you guys.  I thank the fans.  Thank you guys so much for blessing me.  I can't believe my dream car is only $30,000.  Maybe you and me, we're going to be zipping around.  I'm hyperventilating because I'm surrounded by my dream.  I can't believe it, dude.  I'm so excited.  Oh, my God.  Yes!  I can't believe.  in five days I'm going to be taking delivery of this Fiat 124 Spyder.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  This is like getting a blowjob from a guy!  This car's like getting a blowjob from a guy!  Yes!  Yes!  Yeah!  Woo!  I love my car. I love this car so much. The Mazda MX-5 has one big problem.  You tell any girl that you just bought a Mazda Miata, she'll say, oh my God, how cute.  What's your boyfriend's name?  And is it okay if I bring my partner with me?  Sure, and what's your name again?  I'm sorry. My name is Sam Hyde.  What started as a YouTube riches-to-rag success story turned tragic when unmedicated online man Sam Hyde finally snapped, went loco, and took a car salesman hostage on a high-speed race chase.  Investigators raided this man's house and found videos of him confessing, all the while laughing at the fear and terror of this poor man. If you pull one more driving stunt, you're going to walk back. Sorry, I think we spoke on the phone about driving the Fiat 124 Spider.  Let's take a peek.  We got in the car, and right away, it was so uncomfortable, even before doing anything.  The guy, he's kind of portly.  He's on the bigger side.  I'm 6'4\", so we're shoulder to shoulder.  I mean, we could have been sharing the same condom, basically.  It sure is a tight fit in here.  You and me, we're in here.  We're crammed in like sardines.  Can you believe it?  I can tell visually just from his skin and the tensing of his muscles that even before we started driving, he really was not having a good time driving.  being stuffed next to Mr.  Huge Homo.  Turn this radio off.  I just want to hear the music of conversation, right?  What was your name again?  Bobby.  I don't want to ruin my audio recording.  Okay.  I'm just teasing you.  I'm kidding.  This is the other thing that people don't know is that I smell.  I don't necessarily shower.  I never, I haven't worn deodorant in like six years, okay?  I have a strong fragrance to me.  I'm a big ass air freshener.  Can we go down and back on the highway real quick?  I just want to feel. We just passed the highway.  We only have time for a five minute drive.  You can't be driving it like this.  You have to drive it long. This is the speed limit.  You can't be driving it like that.  Well, it's a fast one. I think this is one of the first times where the vehicle has actually outrun the chopper.  None of Rhode Island police could keep up with Hyde's flamboyant hell ride.  When we return, we'll see how our salesman's deal with the devil got him more than he bargained for, as he clocks out for eternity. crime wire tonight. back to our top story where our transgender stunt driver puts the drag back in drag racism tonight we investigate. don't worry i'm a certified racer. so the guy.  he tells me which exit to take and i started pretending like i didn't know what to do even though it's like very clearly obvious that you're supposed to take the exit on the right To the left or right here?  To the right.  Okay.  Right.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I freaked out and I didn't want to crash.  That added about 20 minutes to our journey.  Because we went right into traffic.  We're going to be stuck in traffic for an hour.  I think that's an exaggeration.  Just like Bruce.  There's a solid 20 minutes of just silence, like sitting with this guy.  that hates me.  I'm so sorry.  Maybe you should drive us back. Here we see the salesman's last-ditch attempt to save his life and fight back by employing reverse psychology tactics taught by Joe Rogan, gay MMA. Yeah, a 65-year-old man.  Can you imagine that?  Imagine he's going through the settings faster than I am. He's right there on the shoulder right now, passing that box truck.  Little did this salesman know that his funeral would be conducted at 120 miles per hour, and his final car commission will be a bullet to the skull. CrimeWire Tonight.  Crimes. Welcome back.  Tonight we will watch deadly footage rated R for racing, in which we will see the hostage make a last-ditch attempt to save his worthless, pathetic life by calling the car dealership he works at.  All the while, the madman behind the wheel will continuously taunt him.  Has this comedian's ultimate joke gone too far? Yeah, Jess, I'm on a test drive, and we told him we couldn't go on the highway.  He goes on the highway anyway.  Starts taking the on-ramp like we're driving a Ferrari. Well, don't tell Jess. I tell him what exit to take, and he deliberately keeps going straight.  So I'm getting a little aggravated right now, and I honestly think he's recording stuff.  I am not recording this.  Because he's talking stupid, asking me if the car has a V8 engine. So I'm getting pretty pissed off.  It's got a lot of pickup. When we come back, I don't want to deal with it.  Because right now we're stuck on 295 with bumper-to-bumper traffic. 40 miles an hour. Deliberately.  Deliberately went to the left. You are a liar.  You're lying about me. I have a feel in this baggie's gut because I noticed a camera staring at me. There's not a camera staring at you. I'm not recording this. This is the exit you want, right? You sure picked a small car to get in an argument in, didn't you? The car was going so fast that our team of highly trained and professional cameramen could not bring you the final moments of this car chase. You're the one screaming at me.  I think you'd be the one walking back.  Oh really? Yeah.  I wouldn't push that if I was you. What are you going to do, have the police come right up here? No.  It's happened before.

The penetrating silence is just audio, so you don't have to listen to it.  It could just be in the background, and you could just let the video play through, and you may even get a sense of when the video ends.  Maybe leave a comment as well, please, saying whatever you want.  For example... the five reasons why fallout 3 is better than new vegas or whatever.  leave a comment talking about something else like why dogs are better than cats or the advantages of a desktop pc over other computing devices Or the advantages of cords over wireless crap.  And why TJ needs to get cords.  Commenters tell TJ why he needs to use cords and stop using all that wireless crap that has connection issues.  Anyway.

This is Stuart to work for the National Party.  This is Patrick Quinlan from the National Party, Dublin West.

God help us.  We're going to do a little ring of the old doorbell and call these people and see what they answer us and we're going to ask for a comment from the Green Party about the new Minister for Children, Roderick O'Gorman.  and see has he got a comment to make about his association with Peter Tatchell.  How do you feel about this?  Are you aware of Roderick O'Gorman, the new Minister for Children?  Are you aware of who he has associates with?  It's all over social media.  And RT aren't, they're not reporting on it. There's a picture of him, there's a picture of him on his Twitter account with this associate.  The name's very interesting.  If only he looked at his Twitter account, he'd actually be able to go, oh. It's not somebody in their basement, it's his account.  So, my name's Philip Dore, by the way, from the National Park.  It's on its own account, but it's going to be exposed.  It's going to be a big story, and we're going to expose it.  So it'll be maybe a good story for you to expose, if you weren't afraid of the establishment. Probably, like, it'd be alright if the National Broadcast had actually done its job, you know what I mean?  As opposed to just spinning some narrative. Here's the Minister for Children, and it's associating with people who are sympathetic to paedophilia.  What do you say?  Do you see or catch it?  They'll do it.  They'll do it.  Yes.  So what that means for children associate with these people who are putting some kind of a walk justification around paedophilia, 9 to 13 year old kids that are having that have had sex with adults, he's trying to claim that this was normal, this was joyous for the kids, these people who are now grown-ups.  So we want to know why he's associating, what's his association with these people, and the RTE should be reporting on it.  So, as you can see, the building is suaded with these flags of the LGBT community. Strangely enough, there doesn't seem to be a tricolour outside the office at all, Philip. Yeah, well, as I said, this has nothing to do with the Irish people.  These flags represent globalism, they represent pro-abortion, they represent mass migration, they represent basically the destruction of Irish society as we know it.  And we're not happy about this in the National Party.  I'm not happy about this as an Irish citizen.  And we are disgusted about the appointment of this man as Minister for Children.  First of all, his qualifications, that he doesn't have any children of his own.  He's never reared children.  He's never brought children into the world.  And how does he get a qualification to be over the children of this country and making crucial decisions about their education and about their care?","channel.id":"clxmi0oem02c5cdvifvlaufkb","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxgY69mo_nUGuCDo1yPygng","channel.name":"The National Party \u2014 An P\u00e1irt\u00ed N\u00e1isi\u00fanta","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"IE","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU7ivwQD99tz4V9BIwbUF8E9SWhYm3UPSK5N4O2EA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Two National Party representatives, Stuart and Patrick Quinlan, visited the Green Party headquarters to ask for a comment from Minister Roderick O'Gorman about his association with Peter Tatchell.

I'm sure that a lot of you watching this video are probably parents, but for those of you who are not, just imagine for a minute that you are. Imagine you have a son or a daughter, a child that you've sacrificed an immeasurable portion of your life for, from all the love, time, energy, and money you've dedicated to their well-being, raising them with the best life that you can possibly offer, providing them with a house, clothes, food, entertainment, education, healthcare, and so on.  But then all of this winds up in you one day witnessing them exposing your private conversations publicly online and denouncing you as a terrible person. I literally hate my family so much.  They just tried to argue with me that George Floyd deserved, like, they just tried to tell me that, like, he deserved that because he did something wrong.  And that it was okay. That is not okay.  And it's just making me so upset.  I don't know why. I do not want to live here.  I hate living in Louisiana.  I hate living around these racist fucks.  I just want to leave. To be fair, some people likely have parents who genuinely do say horrible stuff.  I am not denying that this happens.  However, there are some lines that just shouldn't be crossed.  You can disagree with your parents, siblings, or whoever all you want on political and social issues, but this should be done in private.  If you really can't stomach living around them and in close proximity to their beliefs, then simply wait until you're old enough and can afford it and then move out.  Talking about familial disputes online can bring untold damage to your parents and family overall due to the fact that cancel culture has become so prominent and hostile.  As we've witnessed countless times, there are severe consequences to being the target of an online mob.  Personally, whenever I see these videos of young people exposing their parents online, I'm really not that surprised.  Young people, particularly teenagers, they often go through a rebellious phase.  What I find to be way more disturbing is the fact that so many people uphold these public denunciations as a positive thing, something to celebrate and revel in.  This trend of teenagers publicly denouncing their parents is actually more common than you might think.

That awareness is somehow a power from which all Christians sprang.  The spiritual deal that was the fuel and heart to our gallantry for decades.  To what God do we worship today?  Who do we admire as our spiritual stable?  To what do we allow rule over our lives from the shadows and with consistent control that cripples us to behave and conform to this new ideal of wealth, power, greed, among other self-destructive emotions?  What stepped in to fill this vacuum of spiritual surrender?  What's become the new incentive for the Irish people and for our nation?  What has captured the apparatus of influence and control?  The answer is money.  All pathways of influence have uniformly made its company.  The obscenely wealthy among us have begun to use their weight to push the narrative of mass immigration and the eradication of our borders as a means of insuring a ceased supply of door-cheap labour and the one-world, one-people assault on our tiny nation is well and truly begun.  Almost as subconscious as the effort to breed, people across this nation began to accept the narrative began to accept that narrative and the nationalist was driven to silence for worry of being marched to the gallows and excommunicated from society.  Instead it was found that a method to support these individuals in struggling regions to feed, close, house, educate and provide lasting solutions for them in the communities they've always called home.  A deeply corrupt union of the press and political elites has begun to craft the narrative that the only way to help these people is to import them and to have them live next door to us.  In our oblivious, albeit well-intentioned, charitable instincts, we have watched as well-funded, non-governmental organisations have introduced droves of immigrants with no investigation or evaluation into Ireland.  It's difficult to visualise, however, Ireland's people's altruistic instincts and our national assets have been seized to aid the never-ending demands of the morally corrupt.  Money, power, fame and an overall pursuit of a pure transcendence, a feeling of a my world, I'm God.  The result so far of this large-scale sociological experiment where scores of people seem arrogant to accept has been the soaring crime rates here and collectively to other Western nations.  Are we inherently vicious or have we merely adopted these new traits?  Most historically, rape and sexual assault have skyrocketed across all Western regions where such an experiment is taking place.  Large sections of nations once deemed safe are now off limits to young women and most of the local population.  We've seen an explosion of gang violence, where factions of youths deem themselves above the law and above the common civility of our nation.  To what deity do they worship?  To who do they answer?  Terrorist events have become normalised to the point that we hardly pay attention, or we do.  Perhaps for a short while, a post on social media, it's all to satisfy the interests of oneself, to promote ourselves in a way that we seem to care, but we don't.  We've seen an increased strain on the welfare system, and in particular housing.  As is with uncapped demand and not enough supply, property prices have naturally soared to unobtainable limits at profound economic and social costs to the Irish people, a fact most seem to want to avoid at all costs.  To simply question this you will be liable.  A sense of relation and commonality with one's neighbour has been replaced with restlessness.  The adoration of one's ancestors has been muddled into distortion.  Suicide and drug overdose rates are soaring.  One's glorious and triumphant cities are now littered with the faces of broken people.  Is this what we are?  A broken people whose principles would die on the altar of self-pleasure?  Is this an epithet even?  A recognition that we've squandered our inheritance, that our ancestors so painstakingly fought and died to preserve and protect, was involuntarily discarded through the hijacking of our good nature?  What if the morally corrupt never pushed this modern practice of shuffling human beings between nations as if peace is on a chessboard and we recognise this practice as destructive to the Persian culture and we understand the need for the Irish nation to remain as it once was, the stronghold of resilient people who throughout the ages have triumphed in the face of great adversity.  What if we recognised and understood a nation trying to represent everything all at once ultimately ends up representing nothing at all.  At the end of the day, policies that the government are implementing, I'm not going to name them, just government, typical politicians, not many of the people, have absolutely no interest for their home nation or their own people.","channel.id":"clxmi0oem02c5cdvifvlaufkb","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxgY69mo_nUGuCDo1yPygng","channel.name":"The National Party \u2014 An P\u00e1irt\u00ed N\u00e1isi\u00fanta","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"IE","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU7ivwQD99tz4V9BIwbUF8E9SWhYm3UPSK5N4O2EA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The Irish nation is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a loss of spiritual connection and a shift towards materialism.

Amongst other reasons, this was so that arrogant men would be blinded, whilst those who were humble and sought out the Holy Spirit of Christ would have their eyes opened and the truth revealed to them.  Even today, preachers, politicians, and so-called wise men are completely blind to the truth.  and absolutely do not understand the Bible.  so here are the top 10 parables.  Jesus Christ explained number one the old and new wineskins.  Christ said you can't put new wine into old wineskins.  when one has a true awakening where they come to the truth of Christ there's always going to be conflicts with old doctrines and old beliefs.  that person has already been taught.  you see there are teachings of the world and then there are the teaching of Christ.  it's one or the other.  it can't be both but most people simply can't choose.  so they instead do exactly what Christ tells them not to do.  they try to pour that new gospel of Christ the new wine into their old beliefs that old wineskin.  and what happens?  it bursts.  it simply doesn't work.  they are not compatible.  You have to discard all doctrines, be it Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and everything else the world teaches.  You have to get rid of it all, start completely over, and read the Bible for yourself.  Whatever it teaches, that is now your new wine and your new wineskin.  To the sower.  Now speaking of that new wine skin, some people, they hear the message, they like it, it sounds good, it resonates, it tickles the ears, but they never actually go and read the Bible themselves.  They don't take any time to study, to research history in order to validate it all.  so when they are challenged on their beliefs or when life gets hard they desert christ.  they flee from him and return to how they used to be.  others simply jump from teacher to teacher from this interpretation of the bible to that interpretation following different doctrines never quite knowing or being certain which one is true.  these people never built a firm solid foundation a true understanding of the gospel for themselves.  for them the seeds never grew.  they withered away but some or should i say a very small amount.  they do.  take that time and effort to study and their foundation becomes unshakable in this age where satan's deception is everywhere.  if anything it is even more important to plant your seeds in good soil or build your house on rock three the pharisee and the tax collector.  sadly many christians today are christians in name only.  they don't follow the law or christ's commandments.  they don't seek to do what is right.  they don't help their brethren yet they are convinced simply because they use the name christians.  they are good people.  These people will put themselves and believe themselves to be above other people in society because of their status or wealth.  So here Christ is explaining, don't worry about that.  In heaven they will be humbled and brought down low, whilst those in life who had little are low status, but did good and helped.  their brethren will be raised, they will be elevated.  So we should always be humble and never put ourselves above our brothers.  For the rich fool, the law of money can be hard to resist.  Even for Christians who are very awake and aware of the deception of Satan.  They understand and truly believe in Christ.  Yet they are still consumed by greed and I see this all the time.  How many times do you see Christian pastors only really interested in selling books?  How many friends do you have obsessed with investing in the stock markets?  Or following those truffa channels, advising them to load up on precious metals like gold and silver.  They need a pension one, a pension two, multiple residual incomes, a few holiday homes, it's never enough.  So here Christ is explaining, well what if you drop dead right now, this instant or tomorrow?  If you're in heaven, what good were all those years of pursuing wealth?  What does it really get you?  Absolutely nothing.  5.  The Good Samaritan.  This is probably Christ's most famous parable, but there's a lot more to it than people realize.  So first we have a Levite, a priest, and a Samaritan.  Now the priests were Levites, yet here we see they are distinguished.  By the time of Christ, Herod, who was an Edomite, was king.  He was putting his own people in power.  so anyone could now be a Levitical priest even the high priest.  you could just buy your way into it.  then we have the Samaritans.  a lot of these were real Israelites.  when the Assyrians deported the Israelites many in the region of Ephraim were able to flee and come back.  afterwards the region got renamed to Samaria.  later after babylon deported the people in jerusalem and they returned they refused to acknowledge those people in samaria as israelite brothers.  this shows what shambles the law had become at the time.  it had become completely distorted.  so how do you know who is who?  who is your brother or neighbor?  christ explains that you will know them by their behavior or by their fruits.  six the rich man and lazarus.  a lot take this one literally and on the surface it looks like there really is a burning hell where people go for eternal suffering.  but it is but a parable and there's a deeper message expressed by it.  when God revealed the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai to his people they later settled in the lands of Canaan amongst other people who tempted the Israelites to stray away from the law for they themselves never truly understood it.  most of the Pharisees at the time of Christ likewise were merely pretending to keep the law.  it was all show they didn't care for it let alone believe it while christ having performed miracles before their very eyes and even coming back from the dead being resurrected.  well if they didn't believe in the law of moses or the prophets and were just pretending all along then they would still even refuse to believe in christ.  they are permanently in darkness.  7.  The Ten Virgins.  The first thing that jumps out is why are they virgins?  Well, God married the Israelites collectively.  That's how he saw it and that's how he described his relationship with Israel.  And the law was the wedding contract.  So when they began to practice whoredom, worshipping Baal and other foreign gods, they collectively committed adultery.  The penalty was death.  so when Christ came he being God called himself the bridegroom because he wanted to remarry his people.  however the law forbade a man from taking back his adulterous wife.  so there was a way around that Christ had to die.  this way his wife the children of Israel would be released from the curse and the penalties of the law but upon his resurrection he could take them back and remarry them.  so when we accept Christ we are that virgin.  we're awaiting that supper of the lamb the marriage in heaven.  but some of these virgins don't have oil.  they're not actually doing good deeds keeping the law helping their brethren.  so their lamp is not burning.  so when they do get to heaven they will regret.  so get out and do good for your people.  get that lamp burning.  eight the divided kingdom.  Christ explains that no kingdom can stand when it is fighting itself.  We see that Satan over the centuries has certainly learned this lesson and taken it to heart.  They have turned our own countries against each other, creating endless wars and chaos to destroy us, always remaining behind the scenes as the invisible hand.  in the modern era creating party systems where you're either on this side or that side to keep us divided.  furthermore for those who do realize what's going on and seek out the truth the enemy has set up an endless amount of gatekeepers to pretend to help but in reality to control every possible opposition angle and this is all to keep our kingdoms divided.  the point is for us to truly unite.  the only way is under christ everything else is vanity and everything else is doomed to fail.  nine the mustard seed.  it starts off as the smallest seed in the garden which ends up becoming large and great.  adam and eve started as just two in a world of fallen angels giants and all their corrupt offspring.  The remnant of Noah was just 8 people when civilizations started anew.  The children of Jacob started out as just 12 and they grew to 12 tribes who against the world, against entire kingdoms and nations.  And yet over the centuries their numbers grew and they became many nations themselves.  We are indeed a people of humble beginnings.  Now notice the last bit how the birds of heaven came to nest in the tree.  Well, those are those fallen angels and their descendants.  10.  The sheep and the goats.  This is probably the most misunderstood parable ever.  Jesus explains that the sheep go to heaven and the goats to the lake of fire.  Now note that there are no good sheep who go with the good goats and bad sheep who go with the bad goats.  Rather, there are sheep, good or bad, and there are goats, good or bad.  A sheep cannot transform into a goat, and vice versa.  The destiny is predetermined by the origin.  If you descend from Adam, you are a sheep.  God created all the Adamites to be immortal.  If you are a corruption, well, you descend from the fallen angels.  Then you are a goat.  You don't have the Adamic spirit.  God breathed into Adam which was passed on through his descendants.  So if that's the case then, what is the point in doing good or doing bad?  Heavenly reward.  Simple.  Good sheep who do good towards other sheep get rewards in heaven, whilst bad sheep do not get reward, but shame and everlasting contempt.  This was the message Christ spread around from the beginning, the true gospel, which got him killed.  But as he showed up by his resurrection, we have nothing to fear.  Thank you.","channel.id":"clxmi0mkw0121cdviprmvy4pp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","channel.name":"TruthVids","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVAyptfys-UmOQ2qarn1fQod4Buiqcki0hctHTY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"When God came down in the flesh as a man, He revealed secrets through parables, some of which were hidden from the beginning of the world.

Now as the Dublin West representative, Roger Gargarman's in way earlier, I felt obligated to have something done.  Just send a nice little message to Roger Gargarman, his supporters, and people who support this train of thought in general.  We got leaflets done up.  called for Roderick O'Gorman to resign.  On the back foot we have three reasons why we want Roderick O'Gorman to resign.  His associations to Peter Tatchell is he wants to push children under 16 being able to change the agenda.  Absolute madness.  how any child under the age of 16 can make a decision of that nature is beyond me.  how these people even have belief that children under the age of 16 can make this decision.  The third reason then why we're calling for the resignation of Roderick O'Gorman is the RSE sex education that he's pushing into the schools.  In this sex education, he's talking, it's not even that he's talking, it's the legislation itself that's being pushed from somewhere else and it's being handed to the Irish government and it's being handed to governments all across Europe.  This is the ideology that we want you to implement into your skills.  It's policy, you just have to do it.  And Ellie Barnes, the keynote speaker of the INTO conference, she's quoted as saying, like, this is coming.  Like, this is in policy.  We have to implement it.  We don't get a choice.  And she's also then quoted saying that don't send the letter home to parents.  Don't ask them for their consent.  The last thing you want is 30 people showing up and screaming abuse at you.  Like, sure, who wants that?  I want that because I want to know if my daughter is being educated on these things because I don't agree with it.

PTSD is one of the biggest issues plaguing law enforcement. Nationwide, 188 have died by suicide so far this year.  Now that is twice the number of officers who have died in the line of duty. Another innocent child in our city has been taken from us.  I think every cop has a bucket, like a spiritual, emotional bucket. Robert Echevarria died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound last night. And what happens is just garbage just gets thrown in there.  So the first time somebody was killed in front of me.  Throw the knife!  Put the knife down!  The first time that a civilian was shot.  Don't move.  Stay here.  All the times that people didn't listen to me.  The times that I was almost killed.  the dead bodies I've seen, the dead animals I've seen.  My spiritual mental bucket was full.  About six months into the job, a 60-year-old had a stroke, and she crossed, like, six lanes of traffic and got T-boned.  And I processed it.  Uh, like a normal, like a normal crash.  Like I didn't care.  Like I was just like, oh, well, you know, shit happens.  Um, and so this lady was injured, um, possibly dying.  She was getting taken to the hospital.  I'm, you know, going to the hospital to cut a ticket to a lady in a neck brace.  And I just don't.  I just don't have an emotional reaction like these.  people are experiencing some of the worst days of their life.  And I don't.  I got nothing.  I got no no sympathy no empathy.  because I don't even have time to feel Anything I have to process the paperwork and get back on the road.  So that was the first time that, like, I had an alarm bell go off where I was just like, you're not feeling things the way a normal person feels.  You know, most people would be like, oh, well, you know, is the lady okay?  Is this person in a neck brace going to be okay?  Is, you know, what's going on?  How can I help?  Like all that kind of stuff.  And here I am just writing a report and cutting a ticket.  So that was like my first warning sign that, you know, I'm not psychologically normal anymore.  And then three years into it, a few fights and shootings and deaths and car accidents later, there's a crack baby who's dying.  And the mom had dropped off the kid with the grandpa, and the grandpa was already taking care of like six or seven kids.  And this kid's just fallen out.  And at the time, I didn't feel anything.  So I knew that wasn't right.  And I knew I was done.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Police officers are struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with 188 officers dying by suicide this year, twice the number who have died in the line of duty.

I'm sure that most of you probably have Twitter accounts.  Personally, I used to use my Twitter extremely often through 2016, 2018 or so maybe, but I rarely use it anymore because I just became far too disillusioned with scrolling through post after post after post of orange man bad, of drag queen story hours, of cringe virtue signaling, of anti-racist leftists acting far more racist than any of the other people they accuse of being racist, and of course, man-hating.  Not only of men in general, but very often straight white men.  There's a couple of different tweets and articles that I want to cover in this video, but one of the main tweets that inspired it is from a Total Sweetie, as she calls herself in her Twitter bio.  With a tweet that ended up garnering over 190,000 likes, the Total Sweetie wrote, hating men isn't a meme for me.  It's not an online persona.  It's a commitment.  It's a way of life.  Naturally, her tweet received a healthy amount of backlash, but some of the top comments actually did agree with her.  I hate men and I have a man.  Hating men is a lifestyle.  I literally hate having to interact with most men during my day.  Absolutely awful.  This tweet is but one among thousands that play into the same old tired yet fashionable trend of man-hating.  We want equality, the feminists say, even though they already have it.  And in the same breath, they go on to say that men are useless and inferior.  Of course, had a man with some kind of online following published such a tweet, instead saying that he hated women instead of men, Twitter would have banned his account within minutes.  At most, a few hours.  And then after that, you would have had a slew of mainstream media articles denouncing the man and using his tweet as some kind of evidence that yes, yes, in fact, misogyny, it's alive and well.  The double standard is both exhausting and infuriating, but it continues nevertheless on a daily basis.  Just in the past week or so, you had Jonah Hill come out and say that real change in Hollywood will happen when white men relinquish their power.  The 21 Jump Street star also does not feel that the change is happening fast enough.  And Jonah Hill has a solution to this problem.  Rid the industry of white men.  Real change, Hill told Adidas, is going to happen when everyone running the studios and running all these streaming companies are women.  and people who haven't had the voice that white men have gotten throughout that time.  Apparently, diversity is no longer progressive enough for Jonah Hill.  Not content with all of the diversity quotas that we have, he seems to want to take it to the next level, purging the entire industry of white men as if that's somehow gonna magically fix all of Hollywood's problems.  Because as everybody knows, if you're a woman, or if you're a person of a non-white ethnicity, then you're a saint.  You can do no wrong, and you're a shining beacon, a shining example for the entire rest of the world.  This week, you also had CNN rear its ugly head, lamenting the fact that the coronavirus task force is another example of the Trump administration's lack of diversity.  Who are these experts, CNN asks?  They're largely the same sorts of white men and a couple of women on the sidelines who've dominated the Trump administration from the very beginning.  In other words, if you happen to be a man and if, God forbid, you're also white, then your medical expertise just isn't welcome, according to CNN.  It really doesn't matter if you might possess the ability to create some kind of vaccine for the deadly virus currently spreading across the world.  Sorry, but you're just too male and you're just too white to be allowed to try and save lives.  Over the course of my time on YouTube, I've made a few videos here and there about man-hating and male-related struggles, and every now and again I get comments asking me why I care so much about this topic.  I certainly do care about the general state of men in our society, but I also have three brothers, a father, two nephews, and a husband.  Which means I'm likely going to either have a son or multiple sons in the future.  And this isn't the type of society that I want them or any of the other men that I care about to have to exist in.  A society where they're constantly degraded for being male or white by a corrupt media and a far-left activist mob who claim to be for love, unity, and equality.  when in reality they only care about personal gain.  Because that is what this is truly about.  Promote the fashionable and popular narratives and you just might be rewarded with mainstream acceptance, a nice job, a large social media following with users who all have pronouns in their bios, and maybe even you might get a flattering Wikipedia page.  Who cares if your promotion of such a narrative is further contributing to the deterioration of goodwill between men and women?  Who cares that there's more single women in the workforce than ever before?  That the fertility rate has collapsed?  That men are the new minority in college?  That men face more discrimination than women?  That men in the US, in their overall disillusionment, are 3.5 times more likely than women to commit suicide?  Because hey, at least you got 190,000 likes on your tweet.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.  I really hope you enjoyed and I'll see you in my next video.","channel.id":"clxmi0ohw02ehcdvi3iglu7wl","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCesrUK_dMDBZAf7cnjQPdgQ","channel.name":"Brittany Sellner","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AT","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU5TvTw9o5vWAhQPsDHzc8k46cKZHRbE2ECRAqy-Q=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses their disillusionment with Twitter and the trend of man-hating, which they believe is a form of sexism.

We have found these blacklists before, we've found proof of political censorship on Twitter and Facebook, but how does it work on Google?  Well, it turns out it's not exactly what you would think.  Yes, political censorship is going on on Google, but it is done in a far more insidious and clever way than any sort of just straight up blacklist.  A few weeks ago, I began speaking to a Google employee or rather a contractor to Google who gave me access to a guidelines document that is handed out to anyone who is contracted to rank pages.  Rankings essentially being whether a page appears on the first page of Google search or the two billionth page of Google searches.  So how does this correlate with political censorship?  Who does this actually apply to here?  Well, the company's Google contracts to rank pages are given this guidebook that I mentioned earlier.  It's around 200 pages, 174, and the employees are instructed on how to treat each page and individual using this.  to make some obvious examples, a page like Facebook, which would be considered highly reputable.  Lots of people want to visit it.  Even if you spell it wrong, it's going to show up every single time.  Whereas, Scam websites, things phishing for your credit card, trying to steal your information or give you a virus, that is ranked the lowest of the low.  It's going to be hard to find that on the Google searches.  However, there's also a bit of a gray area, and that is political content.  It's added to a section called YM, YL pages, your money, your life.  So effectively anything that can impact a reader or viewers money or life, financial advice, political advice, invitations to join a movement or rally, even just philosophical discussions, anything that can sway your view of the world and how you engage in it.  People like yours truly are considered a YM, YL page.  Google contractor employees are advised to give these pages extra strong scrutiny.  They must be ranked.  And if they fail to meet the observation test, they will be put at the lowest of the low level, literally with the virus and phishing scam websites.  I guess where I am, guess where a large amount of my content is.  Yeah, it's ranked pretty low.  I was wondering why when I literally Google Lauren Southern borderless documentary, Sometimes, in fact, often it comes up with people's reuploads of my documentary before it even comes up with my actual YouTube page.  And that is because as the contractor explained to me, my name when associated with certain keywords is ranked at the lowest of the low for searches.  But why me?  Why not pages advocating, say, joining a witchcraft cult or advocating communism and Maoism?  According to the contractor, these pages aren't deranked at all.  They are perfectly fine within Google's algorithm.  And the reason is, and listen closely here, within the Google ranking handbook, employees are told to use Wikipedia, local hate group watches such as the ADL and the mainstream media's opinion of someone to decide whether or not Google users should be able to easily find their content or not.  Wikipedia is run by far left activists.  The mainstream media is run by far left activists.  The ADL literally labeled the OK hand symbol as hate speech.  I'm sure you can see where this is going.  And as the Google contractor was explaining to me, it doesn't actually even matter what the content you are saying is so long as it's political and the mainstream media dislike you.  An example he gave was if Candace Owens posts a video and it's perfectly reasonable citing factual studies, not a single thing promoting hate, doesn't matter because of her reputation and because it's about politics, it must be deranked based on the handbook.  The handbook specifically sites pages that spread hate must be ranked at the lowest of the low category.  Yet it also clarifies that hate and violence can be spread in entirely polite and academic ways.  So essentially, even if you're being totally reasonable, totally factual, if someone finds what you're saying to be hateful, you will not be able to find your content on Google easily, if at all.  This also impacts comedians.  Take Steven Crowder.  He makes jokes about the LGBT community.  Often, they're just jokes, but it doesn't matter.  His Wikipedia page now says he's homophobic and therefore, based on the guidelines, he must necessarily be deranked.  Another fascinating aspect about this is page 44 of the guidelines, which says, If you speak out against expert consensus, you must be deranked.  So even if you have a pristine reputation, you're a doctor, you've got all the education, never made an error in your entire career.  If you say something about COVID that isn't mainstream, you will be deranked.  This applies to topics like global warming and anything in that category as well.  Also, conspiracy theories, anything that is considered to be debunked by sites like Snopes, which they actually cite.  Snopes in the handbook, deranked, done, gone.  Remember, these pages, anyone who questions the mainstream narrative, that's in the guidelines, in some cases are literally being deranked to the same level as virus, scam, and phishing sites.  It's terrifying.  This is a terrifying thing to have Wikipedia and the mainstream media deciding what content people can access on the most popular search engine in the entire world.  That is a terrifying amount of power.  in the hands of people who have so often been wrong throughout history.  We know the media lie.  We know the powers that be have destroyed the reputations and persecuted people that have genuinely tried to spread truth.  Just look at, historically, someone like Galileo, who was totally persecuted for having contradictory opinions to the mainstream on the orbit of the Sun and the Earth.  Or today, a more modern example, someone like Nick Sandman, who had his life destroyed by the media over total lies just because of one video taken out of context.  I hate to think of the fact that our access to information as a society is in the hands of these people, but it is.  And they're the ones who get to decide what we see and what we are blinded from.  And that is a civilizational changing thing.  To be able to convince an entire society that a whole group of people's opinions just don't exist.  They can't be found, erased.  And the only thing we can really do to combat that right now is hope that the battle against big tech rages on.  That sites like DuckDuckGo, which offer alternative services for search engines, become more popular as people want a genuine and honest view of information online.  I don't have all the answers.  I still use mainstream sites like right now because I want people to be able to see this information.  But I don't know how long this video is going to last.  I don't know how many people are going to get to see it.

Here's why.  In February of last year, the CBC published an article called Dear White People.  The article is a series of attacks against European Canadians, formulated as a list of 21 ways that you can be a better white person.  The article claims that white people fill every moment with incessant talk, that we should shut up and listen, that we are willfully ignorant and uniquely fragile.  The article claims that racism against white people isn't a thing.  And it makes a number of other anti-white claims which you've heard many times before.  Although there are many statements in the article which rise to the level of criminal hate speech, there's one statement which we're focusing on in particular, which is the article's claim that all white people are racist.  The statement that all white people are racist is a clear example of hate speech as defined by the Canadian Criminal Code.  The Code defines hate speech as communicating statements in any public place which incite or promote hatred towards an identifiable group.  The Supreme Court has clarified that hatred in this context refers to an emotion associated with vilification and detestation.  In our society, there is no one who is more vilified and detested than people who get labeled as racists.  People who get labeled as racists in our society get banned from social media, they get fired from their jobs, they get denied service from banks, and they are violently attacked.  Our most powerful media corporations celebrate and glorify the murder, torture, and rape of people who get labeled as racists.  Prominent figures in Canadian society, such as Dr.  Matthew Sears of the University of New Brunswick or Dr.  Michael Capello of the University of Regina, publicly advocate for criminal violence against people who they deem to be racist.  Thus, to state that all white people are racist promotes the vilification and detestation of white people, and it incites violence towards us.  There is no statement which better exemplifies the crime of hate speech than the assertion that all white people are racist.  In principle, we lament using government force to address these issues.  What we would prefer is to combat anti-white hate speech in the arena of open debate, but we can't defend ourselves with debate if debate is not allowed.  When Europeans attempt to address our concerns with peaceful discussion, leftist gangs use violent harassment to terrorize us into silence.  Social media companies like Facebook have explicitly discriminatory censorship policies which ban white people and only white people from expressing our self-interested perspectives on these issues.  And when we attempt to address our concerns democratically, candidates who are perceived to represent the interests of European Canadians are barred from full participation in the electoral process.  I didn't think you should deserve a platform.

And they built forts against it round about.  And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.  And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.  And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden.  Now the Chaldeans were against the city round about, and the king went the way toward the plains.  And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho.  And all his army were scattered from him.  So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah.  And they gave judgment upon him.  And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.  But Johanan, the son of Chariah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven.  to dwell in the land of Judah, even men and women and children and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuchadnezzar, the captain of the guard, had left with Gadaliah, the son of Ahicham, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch, the son of Neriah.

The United States is in an uproar over the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police.  There have been demonstrations in over 400 cities and looting and arson in every major U.S.  city.  Why are so many people in the streets?  because they believe that American society is systematically racist and that the police brutalize and even casually murder black men.  The news constantly tells them that the police are racist, and many people think the gruesome video of the death of George Floyd bears this out.  But let's look at the facts.  Some may surprise you.  Police in America make 12 to 13 million arrests every year.  How often does this lead to the death of an unarmed black person?  We know the exact number thanks to a Washington Post database of every killing by the police.  No one else has better figures.  So please, stop and guess how many unarmed blacks are killed every year.  200?  500?  Last year, the figure was 9.  Just 9.  And that number is going down, not up.  In 2015, police killed 38 unarmed blacks.  In 2017, they killed 21.  Well, what about white people?  Last year, police killed 19 unarmed whites in addition to the nine unarmed blacks.  In almost every case, whether the person who died was black or white, an inquiry found that the officers' actions were justified.  Now, you may find this hard to believe, but in 2019, the chances of being unarmed, arrested, and then killed by the police were higher for whites than for blacks.  For both races, it was something very rare.  One out of 292,000 arrests for blacks and one out of 283,000 arrests for whites.  But, to repeat, the chances of an unarmed white man being arrested and killed by the police are slightly higher than for an unarmed black man.  Well, what about the people the police kill who are armed?  Since 2015, when the Post began tracking these numbers, the police have killed about 1,000 people every year.  One quarter of them were black.  Now, this is about twice their share of the population, which is 13%.  So is this proof of police racism?  Probably not.  The data tell us that blacks are considerably more likely than whites to commit crimes and therefore come into potentially violent contact with the police.  Here are numbers for 2018, the most recent year available.  blacks accounted for 37% of arrests for all violent crimes, 54% of arrests for robbery, and 53% of arrests for murder.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, it's people who commit crimes like these, who threaten the police and others, who are shot by the police.  In this context, for blacks to be only 25% of the people police killed can seem like a surprisingly low figure.  Here's another statistic.  Every year, criminals kill about 120 to 150 police officers.  And we know from this FBI table that every year, on average, about 35% of cop killers are black.  So to repeat, blacks are 13% of the population and account for 25% of the people killed by police.  But look at these high levels of involvement in violent crime.  They suggest it would not be surprising if blacks accounted for more than 25% of the people killed by the police.  Now, I have mentioned the high black percentages of arrests for violent crime.  You may think that these figures reflect police racism and not racial differences in crime rates.  You may think that biased police are arresting innocent blacks and letting guilty whites go, and that's why the black arrest rates are so high.  Well, we have very valuable survey data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics that disproves this view.  As this page explains, every year, data are obtained from a nationally representative sample of about 240,000 interviews on criminal victimization, involving 160,000 unique persons in about 95,000 households.  The government asks these 160,000 people if they have been a victim of violent crime.  They're then asked lots of details, including the race of the person who attacked them.  Many of these crimes are not even reported to the police.  So the numbers in this survey are always greater than the numbers of arrests for the same crimes.  However, and this is the key point, the racial proportions track almost perfectly.  For example, the American public says that over half the muggers were black.  So when half the muggers, the police arrest, turn out to be black, is that proof of police bias?  No.  The police are doing what they're supposed to do, arrest criminals without regard to race.  There have been scientific studies of possible police bias against blacks and Hispanics.  This paper, published last year, is from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, probably the most prestigious peer-reviewed journal in the country.  It built a sophisticated database for all the fatal police shootings in 2015 and looked at them from every possible racial angle.  Its findings?  Under the heading, Significance, it wrote, We find no evidence of anti-black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and white officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-white officers.  You will not be shot, in other words, by the police unless you are threatening them in a dangerous way.  You will not be shot because of your race.  And this is true of officers of all races.  Roland Fryer is a black economist at Harvard.  He was angry after the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray, so he did his own research on police killing.  He carefully studied 1,332 police shootings in 10 big city police departments.  When he compared the circumstances of each killing, he too could find no evidence of police bias.  If anything, police were more likely to shoot a non-threatening white than a non-threatening black person.  Professor Fryer said it was the most surprising research result of my career.  Well, why did Roland Fryer find it surprising?  Because just like the people who are demonstrating now, he believed what he read in the papers.  And let me give you a very relevant example.  On June 3rd, just two days ago, the New York Times published a long article with this headline.  Minneapolis police use force against black people at seven times the rate of whites.  Sounds pretty awful, doesn't it?  But this article says nothing, nothing at all about racial differences in crime rates or arrest rates.  Not one word.  It would be like learning that the police were seven times more likely to use force against men living in Minneapolis than against women and getting outraged over anti-male bias.  But wouldn't it be important to know that men were much more likely than women to commit crime, to be arrested, resist arrest?  Wouldn't male behavior and not police bias explain why police use force on men more often than on women?  So, what was the situation in Minneapolis?  Here are graphs taken from a Minneapolis Police Department report from 2009 to 2014.  Here are the racial percentages of victims, suspects, and arrests for an aggregate of violent crimes .  Blacks were 12 times more likely than people of all other races combined to be suspects in these crimes, and 9.5 times more likely to be arrested.  In light of these figures, can it be surprising that the Minneapolis police use force on blacks seven times more often than on whites?  Once again, the reasonable conclusion is that the police are reacting to behavior, not race.  For the Times, not to have included this information about racial differences in arrests is either grossly negligent or just plain dishonest.  This kind of reckless reporting gives people a completely false impression of the police.  Now, I'm not trying to justify what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis.  He was a big guy.  He was resisting arrest to the point that even with cuffs on, a team of three officers couldn't get him into a squad car.  The police had a problem on their hands, but keeping a knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes may have been homicide.  Of course, the solution is to indict the officer and punish him if he's guilty.  But even if he is guilty, who can be sure that race had anything to do with what he did?  He might have restrained a violent white criminal in the same way.  The solution to all this is not to demonstrate and riot against police racism, for which there is so little hard evidence.  There may be some bad apples among police officers, but the system is working just as it should.  Almost without fail, police deal with criminals properly, without regard to race.  I know that there is a tremendous head of steam built up behind the idea of police racism.  But it's not the police who need reform.  It's the media.  This crisis will not end until the press stop presenting a false and dangerously inflamed picture of the American justice system.  Rioting and looting are wrong, no matter what the reason.  Rioting and looting over an illusion because of something that isn't even true, that's a tragedy.  Thanks for watching.  Please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

They keep telling the EU that if they don't get their way on numerous issues, they will allow more people to illegally enter Europe.  The EU has paid Turkey an extremely large amount of money to stop the flow of illegal migrants.  In fact, just days ago, Angela Merkel sent another 32 million euro to the Turkish Coast Guard.  I've said in the past that it looked like Turkey was conducting a slow motion stand down.  Well, right now, Turkey is officially conducting a full stand down.  People are being given a green light to attempt illegal entry into Europe.  Of course, most of these people will be going to Greece where there are ongoing riots over illegal immigration.  people in lesbos and other islands have been a rioting over the construction of new asylum centers.  i talked about how new democracy gained a majority of the greek parliament last year.  a lot of people claim this was a huge conservative victory.  however I said they are a very weak center-right party and that I did not have faith in them.  New democracy needs to take immediate action.  It needs to be decisive and it needs to happen now.  Turkey has huge ambitions and is currently involved in a bunch of conflicts.  They are occupying part of Cyprus and engaged in a standoff with the EU over mining rights and the transfer of new weapons into Cyprus.  They have a huge military presence in Azerbaijan, where they are fighting against a breakaway Armenian region.  They are involved in the ongoing Libyan civil war.  They are occupying parts of northern Iraq and fighting Kurdish groups.  They are occupying parts of northern Syria and fighting the US sponsored YPG.  They also have a huge presence in the Idlib region of Syria.  This is controlled by an alliance of Salafist jihadists calling themselves the Salvation Government.  The largest remaining component of the Salvation Government is Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham or HTS, formerly known as Nusra Front, which was the official Al-Qaeda franchise in Syria.  Previously, Turkey, Russia and Iran negotiated a peace deal.  The main task that Turkey agreed to perform was disarming HTS by the end of 2018.  Instead, they have done the exact opposite.  They are openly conducting military operations with the group and arming them.  In fact, Turkey recruited many of HTS's rivals to go fight in Rojava in Libya, thus making HTS even more powerful in Idlib.  Well, the Syrian army has been rapidly defeating HTS and retaking large swaths of Idlib.  If you go to the community section of this YouTube channel, I have a lot of information about this.  The Turkish army has been providing the Salafist militants with armored vehicles and Grad rockets.  More recently, the Turkish army has been providing them with heavy artillery support.  They have given the militants shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles known as MANPADS.  And now they are even supporting the militants with airstrikes conducted by sophisticated armed drones.  There was another Turkish escalation today.  Turkey fired long range missiles into two major Syrian cities, including Latakia, which has long been a beacon of peace and stability in Syria.  Militants were able to retake the city of Serekib today with Turkish artillery and air support.  However, that battle is still ongoing.  Now, two days ago, Turkey announced that 16 Turkish soldiers had been killed in Syria.  Today, they officially announced that five more were killed in Idlib and another four were killed by a car bomb in Rojava.  Well, people began saying on Twitter that the death toll of Turkish soldiers in Idlib was far higher.  Immediately after that, there was a nationwide outage of Twitter in the country of Turkey.  A crowd also gathered at a Turkish hospital near the Turkish-Idlib border crossing due to rumors of Turkish military casualties.  Well, there are alleged sources inside the Turkish government saying 29 Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib today.  So to make a long story short, Turkey is throwing open the illegal immigration floodgates as retaliation for what they call a lack of European support for their adventures in Syria.  I know this is complicated.  In short, Turkey is demanding US and European support for their campaign to keep Salafist militants in power in Idlib.  They do not want the region to go back under the control of Bashar al-Assad.  Now, keep in mind, even anti-Assad groups admit that HTS and the so-called Salvation Government are extremely unpopular among the civilian population of Idlib.

Hello there, Steve here in Sydney, on the Lean Gnosis website, TrueBlueHelo.com.  You've just been listening to some of your favourite music, and I dare say that you've heard it internally for years or decades, and never quite knew what to do, but you really never had the time to question it.  Two things I'm going to tell you.  You are in fact being signalled.  That's something that you didn't notice because you were always in too much of a hurry.  And secondly, it's not part of your brain providing free elevator music.  It definitely is not.  And I'm going to tell you very quickly why and how to reframe your thinking a little bit to understand this internal musical signaling phenomenon.  Now when you hear this music internally there's a couple of things you can say about it.  It's sometimes quite weirdly out of context because you can be up a ladder knocking nails into a beam and you start hearing in your head beautiful ABBA music.  or maybe something that you've always remembered from childhood, Ave Maria or something like that.  And it's always out of context.  It can happen while you're in the bath.  It can happen and you sort of say, well, it's got nothing to do with what I'm doing at the moment.  It's out of context.  So why is it happening?  Now, This has been going on all of your life and you've been just too busy to take too much notice of it.  Okay?  We're all too busy today.  We suffer for it.  So make no bones about it.  You are being signaled.  You've just failed to respond.  Now, we give you a definition.  We call you a semi-gnostic.  That means you're receiving a signal.  You're knowing something.  Gnostic meaning knowing.  You're knowing something, but you're not responding.  You're sort of knowing subliminally.  You're not noticing sufficiently.  Agnostic means not knowing.  Gnostic means you do know.  So you're in the middle.  You're a semi-gnostic.  You sort of half know, but you're not responding.  Okay?

The motif shows up in various different contexts over a huge geographic range and a very wide timeframe, stretching from early Anglo-Saxon England in the Migration Era all the way to Viking Age Russia.  It is commonly associated with the cult of the Norse god Odin, and with extraordinary shamanic rituals, as I shall explain in this video.  The name Horned Man has stuck, but it's a bit misleading because those Horn-like projections coming from the head are definitely birds, not horns.  And their identification as birds is crucial for the identification of the motif as being associated with the cult of Odin. The Roman Empire fell during the Migration Era or V\u00f6lkerwanderung, which means migration of races, and which saw Germanic peoples such as the Goths, the Lombards and the Anglo-Saxons spread across the former Roman Empire.  This is when the dual raptor or dual bird motif first shows up in the archaeological record.  This brooch from France shows two birds joined at the talons.  They are usually identified as raptors such as eagles because of the way the beaks curve.  This brooch with garnets also clearly shows two birds heads.  And this migration-era buckle from Switzerland depicts two curving bird heads at the bottom beneath a man holding two sticks or spears.  These attractive little migration-era raptor brooches are not unique.  Many of this kind have been found in Western Europe, dating to the expansion of the Goths and Franks, and they always come in pairs.  These two golden raptor brooches with gold chains are a bit more special.  They were made by the Ostrogoths and date to around 500 AD.  Now this radial headed langobardic broach from Germany dates to around 600 AD and you can see the raptor heads on either side of the middle.  Although these finds all come from Western and Central Europe, we know they are all associated with peoples who migrated from Scandinavia, so this is where the motif originated, and this is also where it persisted and developed.  After the migration era, beginning in 550 AD, comes what is termed in the history of Nordic Germanic peoples, the Vendel era, named after this place, Vendel in Sweden, where many amazing helmets and other finds were discovered in boat burials.  And this is when we see the first examples of the bird-horned man showing up in the archaeological record.  One of the main ways the motif appears is as a full-bodied figure, sometimes imprinted onto a helmet foil, other times depicted as a 2D figurine holding a weapon and sometimes dancing.  This presplek was used as a die to be hammered onto thin metal foils that decorated warriors' helmets.  No one has found a helmet with this exact design on it, but there are others with similar designs.  This is a modern replica of a Wendel era helmet known as Valsier VII.  It has two variants of the horned man on, one of which depicts two weapon dancers wearing the bird headdress, and the other shows the figure wearing the bird headdress is assisting a mounted warrior by guiding his spear.  This replica of Valsier VIII also has a foil depicting the bird horned figure guiding the spear of a mounted warrior.  The dual raptor motif also persists in Wendel-era Sweden in the form of brooches like this one.  And like the Swedish brooch and the Langebardic brooch I showed earlier, this early Anglo-Saxon square-headed gilded copper brooch with black-yellow inlay has raptor heads projecting from either side of the centre.  And here, again on this square-headed Anglo-Saxon brooch from Wiltshire.  and on this one, the furthest on the right.  The dual raptor motif, as well as the bird-horned man motif, arrive in England in the 5th century.  The most famous example is on the Sutton Hoo helmet, dated to the 7th century.  The foils have two weapon-dancers with sword-bearing arms interlocked and spears in their other hands.  This Anglo-Saxon helmet is very similar to the Vendel era helmets of Sweden.  This 6th century gilded buckle from Fingalsham in Kent is the most spectacular example of all.  The figure stands naked except for his belt and headdress and holds two spears as in other examples.  Some claim this is Woden, the Anglo-Saxon name for the god the Vikings later called Odin.  This standing figure was found in a village called West Ilsley in Berkshire, near where I grew up.  This is the detail from a helmet foil from Gutenstein in Germany, and it shows another variant where the weapon dancer holds two downturned spears, and like on the Torslunder Pressblech, it stands with wolf-headed warriors.  The other main context in which the motif shows up is termed by Paul Mortimer, wanes.  Woden avatars in numerous environments.  And this consists of a 2d head with some relief features and carefully crafted horns.  Some are so very similar in design that they must be based on a widely known pattern.  These are normally made from copper alloy but can be gilt and bejeweled like this beautiful example.  They show up in a variety of contexts, but it's never quite clear what they were attached to.  They may have been mounted to bridal gear or to clothing, but no one has yet identified precisely what they were attached to.  All of them come from pagan Anglo-Saxon England.  I once had the privilege of holding one when filming From Runes to Ruins.  as well as another mount with the same double bird motif.  An apparently related Anglo-Saxon motif, found in two examples, depicts the face of a bearded man made of two birds.  In the Norse mythology, depicted in 13th century Icelandic literature, the god Odin is said to possess two ravens called Huginn and Muninn, which mean the thought and the memory.  These ravens fly all over the world and then return to Odin to report their news to him, yet he always fears one would not return each day.  Could the bird-shaped cranial projections represent thought and memory growing from the mind?  This Anglo-Saxon example from Northamptonshire depicts the birds' heads meeting the man's ears as if they are whispering their secrets to him.  The identification of the motif with Odin depends on us identifying the birds as ravens rather than raptors.  But Odin was also associated with eagles and was called Arnh\u00f6fte eagle head.  Another aspect of Odin we learn from Icelandic sources is that he was called Girtur, meaning spear god, and that he possessed a powerful spear called Gumnir.  That so many examples of the motif possess spears again points to Odin, or an earlier version of him.  Odin was said to have only one eye, yet the horned spear dancer usually has two.  Although in some examples, such as this one from Mopokra in Sweden, he is missing an eye, indicating either that Odin was not always depicted with one eye, or that the dancer sometimes depicts Odin himself, and other times depicts a ritual dance associated with him.  Next we move to the Viking Age, into which the motif persists.  The Viking era preserves the motif in the form of the weapon dancer also, as in this silver mount, but we also see more 3D representations, like this beautiful example found near Lake Ladoga in Russia, an area that was settled by Viking traders.  Now we can see the birds come out of the side of the man's head, but he is not wearing a helmet, as we can see his hair is engraved on the back of his head.  Danish Viking examples sometimes show the birds coming from the side of his head too, but in this recent find from Denmark the man is very clearly wearing a headdress with the damaged projections, which we must presume were birds, strapped to the front of his head.  This example from Anglo-Saxon Dover makes it absolutely clear that a headdress and not a helmet or man with horns is being depicted.  Although here the birds are attached to the top of the head.  There is another variant of the motif, which may indicate a continuation of Bronze Age religion.  This Viking-era fragment of a picture stone from Stora Valle in Ruta Parish on the island of Gotland in Sweden was discovered in 2013 by Sigmund Earl.  It depicts a figure who appears to be wearing the horned headdress and is hovering over the crest of a wave while seemingly guiding the course of a Viking ship.  An explanation proposed by Earl is that this depicts Odin himself guiding the spirits of the dead as they sail into the afterlife.  The Nordic Association of Boats and the Afterlife is well established and you can learn all about it in my video series on the Nordic Boat Cult, you can find the playlist on my channel.  The fragment seems to depict the same figure as the one on the much older helmet foil from Vals Jere VIII, where a horned man is aiding a mounted warrior, as though it were Odin guiding the warrior's spear in battle.  Another clear parallel to the Ruta fragment, one which Earl missed, is this Iron Age petroglyph from Boglursa known as the Brandskogshepet, which depicts a religious motif of an elk-headed ship being guided by a mysterious figure.  Even without the horns, the similarity is too great to be coincidental, which means this may be the oldest depiction of Odin that survives, or at least of a god from which he derived. You can bag yourself a t-shirt or a hoodie with a weapon dancer on it, or even one with a wane, a Woden avatar and various environment motif from Anglo-Saxon England.  you got to do is head over to my Teespring store and you can see t-shirts with those designs and many others there.  Actually if you look just beneath this video you'll see a line of garments from the store and if you click on any of those you get taken over to it.  Have a look through.  and what better way to keep this ancient motif of the Woden Weapon Dancer alive than to wear it in a brand new context.

The Slovenian government has more or less flipped from center-left to center-right without even having an election.  The previous prime minister resigned and it looked like there would be an early snap election.  However, the Slovenian Democratic Party, or SDS, was able to cobble together a new coalition.  Janez Jan\u0161a, a former Slovenian prime minister and leader of the STS, was nominated to be the new prime minister.  There was a big question as to whether he could get enough votes.  The Slovenian parliament has 90 members.  He ended up getting a lot more votes than people thought he would.  The vote was 52 to 31 in favor of making him prime minister.  The SDS is a party that is a longtime ally of Viktor Orban's Fidesz and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.  I have mentioned them repeatedly as a party that I suspect would leave the EPP and re-affiliate with the ECR if Fidesz also leaves.  The SDS are conservatives, and I have always considered this party to be one of the better members of the EPP.  They are currently the largest party in the Slovenian parliament.  There is another party called New Slovenian Christian Democrats that is also part of the EPP.  You could probably call them a very weak center-right or even just a centrist party.  There is a small party with three seats called the Slovenian National Party.  that is a more hardcore nationalist party.  Now, some people have said that Janez Jan\u0161a has been portraying himself as a centrist for the past few weeks.  Of course, this is kind of natural because he had to recruit a bunch of centrists to form this coalition.  At the very least, this is a victory for Viktor Orban because it means there will be another guy on the EU Council who would veto any action they try to take against Hungary.  Meanwhile, coalition talks are underway in Slovakia.  Most likely, Shmi Rodina, a nationalist populist party, will be the second largest party in the ruling coalition.  They are part of the Identity and Democracy group led by Matteo Salvini's Lega Party.  Meanwhile, on the Greek border, the Turkish police continue to commit violent criminal assaults on Greek border guards and Greek firefighters.  They are using armored vehicles to try to dismantle pieces of the Greek border wall.  The Turkish coast guard has committed very hostile acts and tried to create paths for the illegal aliens.  There are countless videos now that very clearly document Turkey's numerous crimes.  There is also a video showing armed men forcing people off a bus and onto rafts against their will.  An armed man cocks a handgun over the head of a small boy.  One of the perpetrators appears to have both Turkish police insignia as well as a patch for the militant gray wolves.  However, at least seven countries have pledged aid to Greece.  These include Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Cyprus, and Austria.  There is new video that shows Austrian police vehicles entering Greece supposedly to provide assistance to the Greek border police.  Of the people apprehended by the Greek authorities, the lion's share are from Afghanistan.  Many more are from Pakistan, Iran, and Somalia.  Actual Syrians are only a small minority of the illegal migrants.  The Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu bragged on television that the new wave of illegal immigration would crash Europe's economy and bring down governments.  Erdogan himself is increasingly using religious rhetoric and framing the actions of the Turkish government as part of a religious war for Allah.  I will make more videos about Turkey over the next few days.  I will also be making a video about my take on the Coronavirus in the USA.  In the meantime, thanks for watching this video.

The tragic death at the hands of the state, the stormtroopers of the state, using excessive force and killing an innocent black man yet again.  When is it going to stop?  When is it going to stop?  When is all this unwarranted and disproportionate force that's used against black people, innocent black people, from cops, usually white cops, killing innocent black people over and over and over, when is it going to stop?  And I see all these people talking about how, oh no, it's not about race.  It's not about race.  It's about the state.  It's about the jackbooted thugs of the state.  We should be on their side.  It's not about race.  And I want to be very clear when I say this.  You people disgust me and you're liars.  You're not wrong.  You're fucking liars.  And I'll prove it right now.  If the cop had been black, would this be happening right now?  You know the answer to that.  I know the answer to that.  Everyone listening right now knows the answer to that.  Don't pretend you don't know the answer to that.  If the cop had been black, if everything else had been exactly the same, and the only difference was that the officer restraining George Floyd, who was high on fentanyl and meth, and we'll get into that in a second, if the officer restraining George Floyd had been black... Would any of this have happened?  And the answer, of course, is no.  It's about race and everyone on the fake right, including Trump, by the way, trying to make it sound like it's about something else is a liar and a coward.  But you know what?  I will concede one thing.  It is about how we've been treating black people in this country.  I do a lot of movie reviews and sometimes I do TV and there's been times when people have asked that.  I take a look at Twilight Zone episodes and there's one in particular that really comes to mind when I think about how we treat blacks in this country.  There's this episode, perhaps you've seen it, it's pretty famous, I think you've probably seen it, where there's this small town and in this town there's a child and for some reason everyone seems very eager to please this child.  If he says the sky is green, they say, oh, yes, oh, yeah, it is.  Now that you mention it, it is green.  You're right, it's green.  Wow, thanks, thanks.  Thanks, Billy, or whatever his name is.  And this kind of thing goes on throughout the whole episode.  Everyone's just real eager to please and go along with whatever Billy says.  And then you find out it's because Billy has magical powers.  Billy can make people disappear permanently.  Billy can turn people into horrifying monsters.  Burn people alive.  He can do whatever he wants.  You see, Billy is this omnipotent child.  He thinks like a child.  He reasons like a child.  But he has the powers of a god.  He can make your life end like that.  And you mustn't think bad thoughts about me either, or I'll do the same thing to you.  So everyone walks around on eggshells.  They want to make sure Billy's happy.  And that's exactly how we treat black people in this country.  We treat them like little children that we can't talk about uncomfortable subjects with because if we do, they'll get mad and burn down the fucking city.  And that's exactly what's going on right now.  And when Trump tweets out that we have to honor the memory of the man that was killed, George Floyd, he's doing it because he's treating black people like a little child that he doesn't want to anger.  And that's why we're in the situation that we're in right now.  The whole town held hostage by this omnipotent child.  And like I said, this is about race, just like Ferguson was about race, just like Trayvon Martin was about race.  And what do all three of these have in common other than the fact that it was wildly publicized in the media?  Oh my God.  Yet again, the black man, victim to the white man.  And every time, including today, they fall apart.  In Trayvon Martin's case... George Zimmerman wasn't white, they find out, too late after they'd already started the narrative.  So now he became something we'd never heard of before.  He was a white Hispanic.  And little by little, the Trayvon Martin story fell apart.  In the case of Ferguson, all we heard about was the gentle giant.  He said, please don't shoot.  He had his hands up.  He said, don't shoot.  But the cop refused.  fueled by racism and hatred that always keeps the black man down in this country, callously opened fire for no other reason than he just fucking hated black people.  And then, of course, we see the video that shows that Michael Brown had just finished robbing a convenience store, manhandling the clerk out of the way, and then according to testimony from black people, I might add, He didn't have his hands up.  He didn't say don't shoot.  He charged the cop with the intent to wrestle the gun from him and possibly murder him.  This is from testimony from black witnesses to investigators that were sent there from a black attorney general who worked for a black president.  And yet how many black people do you know that even know that?  How would they know that when everyone treats them Like a child, you can't anger.  Now here we are once again.  George Floyd, upstanding citizen, you know, only did five years for breaking into a woman's house and holding her at gunpoint while he robbed her.  Sounds like a great guy to me.  High on speedballs.  Takes three people to restrain him.  And you know what?  I'm going to dig into that for a second.  If you want to be on Team Ben Shapiro and be like, we have to agree that this is evil.  We have to agree that it's evil.  I'd be willing to bet that most of the people freaking out and saying, oh, it's excessive, it's excessive.  You've probably been in about as many fights as Ben Shapiro.  You've probably never had to try to restrain a 200-pound-plus guy who's high on speed.  Oh, but he said he couldn't breathe.  They should have got out of him when... Really?  How many times do you think they hear that?  How many times do you think a cop, when they're trying to restrain someone, they're like, ow, my hands hurt.  Oh, I can't breathe.  Oh, please let go.  And they're supposed to just risk it?  They're supposed to just risk it because, oh, that looks too rough.  This has nothing to do with police brutality.  Absolutely goddamn nothing.  This is about multiculturalism failing.  Stop being cowards on race.  You don't have to like cops.  You think it's edgy to not like cops?  No one likes cops.  Stop being cowards on race for the exact same reason you treat black people like children.  Stop being afraid of what will happen if you tell the truth.

My latest video is on bit shoot only for a variety of reasons.  I was going to make a censored version and post it here, but about 10 minutes into it and only having like two minutes of video that I could show, I just decided it's not worth it.  It's not worth it for me and it's not worth it for you.  I mean, it would be... Like it would be.  it's like it would be like the video version of the FBI declassifying a document that you really want to read and all the things that you want to see are blacked out.  It would be the same thing.  It just be the video version of that.  So rather than just frustrate the hell out of you.  I'm just letting you know on the channel here that a new video is posted.  I have the link in the description and also in the comments.  So I'm just making this video to let you guys know.  I haven't streamed in a while because my internet took a dive.  I don't know what happened.  if I have to get another SIM card or something, but the wireless internet that I was using suddenly, after working for like six months, pretty decently, started getting throttled like crazy, like down to like 2G speeds.  I can't even stream at all.  So I'm going to get that worked out so I can start doing streams again.  Definitely watch the entire video.  The video that's on BitChute, it starts out Like it's just another movie review, which isn't... That's not a bad thing, right?  Because, you know, in a way, it is.  But make sure you watch the whole thing.  There's a couple goodies at the end that you're probably not going to be expecting, so... Anyway, I might also be on Adam Green's channel this week, maybe as early as tomorrow.  This is Monday night, so maybe as early as Tuesday afternoon.  And if not, probably this week at some point in time.  But you just said you can't stream.  Yeah, I can't stream, but I can call in.  Anyway, I'll get it all straightened out.  Make sure you subscribe to me on BitChute because I did get one of my old videos about a year ago.  Or no, older than a year ago.  It's like a two-year-old video.  Here's the funny thing.  I had a video taken down.  I'm not even going to say what video it is.  It's not even that important of a video.  It's not really that relevant anymore.  But it's a video they took down once already.  Like they took it down about two years ago.  I appealed it.  They put it back up.  And then they took it down again, like last week.  And I appealed it again.  And I even said, like, look, you guys did this already.  I appealed this already.  And they said it was hate speech and took it.  And by the way, which is ridiculous.  Like if again, I'm not going to even say what it was.  It's not that important, but they should have at least gone a different route with it.  I mean, I get why they wanted to take it down, but hate speech was just a stupid reason.  But whatever.  It's YouTube, right?  So anyway, go to BitChute and make sure you subscribe to me there.

Last Dark Stream, we talked about how we are now entering the demoralization season.  And every day, we're seeing new polls, new numbers, Biden's up 16%, Biden's up 18%.  I mean, these numbers are obviously ridiculous.  Obviously, just not even remotely credible.  An incumbent US president does not lose by 16 points.  Never happens.  Never happened before, not happening now.  But it's all designed to try to make people who are supporting Trump to feel despair and not show up.  It's also meant to try to convince those who are susceptible to wanting to be on the winning side that they have no choice but to jump in and support Creepy Joe's campaign for the Senate, which apparently he believes he's running for.  It's borderline cruel what they're doing to the guy, but he asked for it, he sold his soul for it, so we can't have too much sympathy.  But what we can do is explain why I'm so confident that the polls are not just wildly exaggerated, but are fundamentally wrong.  Like I said, it keeps getting worse.  Today, The Economist came out and in forecasting the US elections, they actually claimed that Biden has a 91% chance of winning the electoral college and a 99% chance of winning the popular vote.  Now, why an English magazine thinks that it knows anything about U.S.  elections, well, we'll just ignore that.  The point is that this is the extent of exaggeration that we're seeing in this demoralization season.  The demoralization season is going to last another week to two weeks, and then you're going to see them start backing it down so they don't look completely ridiculous when the election actually rolls around.  They don't want to have their 16-point predictions out there when Trump wins by three points or four points.  I mean, being wrong is one thing.  To be that completely and utterly wrong is going to destroy their credibility permanently.  They shouldn't have any credibility anyhow.  I don't give them any credibility, but a lot of people still do just because it's in the news every day.  Now let's look at the various reasons, the various non-poll reasons that we can be confident that Donald Trump is actually winning this election.  This is a chart of the growth in the S&P 500 the year of the election.  And the number just under 12% is the average performance in a year when the incumbent party wins the election.  So generally speaking, if the Democratic Party is in office or if the Republican Party is in office and the S&P 500 does over 11.5%, the party usually holds on to the presidency.  Now you can see why things were so close in 2016.  It was just under 12%.  It was right at that average line.  And of course, there was a relatively close election.  But now look at what has happened in 2019.  The S&P 500 is up over 18 points.  And so this indicator strongly indicates that Donald Trump is going to win reelection.  As a general rule, people don't vote out incumbents when the economic situation, the financial situation is generally good.  Now, obviously, COVID-19 has thrown the economy completely out of whack, especially because of the various lockdowns and so forth.  On the one hand, we've had more than a 30% decline in quarterly GDP, in the second quarter.  However, the third quarter numbers are going to show something like 34% growth.  So I think that trying to look at the GDP numbers and trying to figure out exactly where things are there is probably a mistake.  And obviously, the great state of Wall Street does not mean that Main Street is doing well.  We've talked about that many times.  But the point is, As far as the predictor goes, it strongly indicates a Trump reelection.  Now let's look at the next indicator.  This is an increasingly famous one.  It's actually an interesting model in that it pays no attention to what practically everybody else pays attention to.  It's the Norpoth model, which is named after the gentleman in the picture.  I think his name's Helmut Norpoth.  And he has, this model, Of course, you have to be dubious about back testing, but even so, it served to correctly predict or retro-predict 25 of the 27 presidential elections since 1912.  The two that were incorrect Or 1960, which was the JFK Nixon election and 2000, which, of course, was incredibly close and could have very easily gone either way.  It's based on.  mostly on the performance in the party primaries and there's.  it's not just about um it's not just about that.  it also um it is also tied in to uh the vote the previous vote.  but um he was very confident.  along with me and a very few other number of individuals, Nor Poth anticipated that Trump would win.  In fact, he gave Donald Trump an 87% chance of winning in 2016.  We'll have a look at what he says about 2020.  He says Donald Trump has a 91% chance of winning compared to 9% for Biden.  Not only that, but there is a variant that he's created that allows him to predict the electoral college votes.  And he predicts a 362 to 170 mini Trump slide.  And the fact that Norpoth is predicting that is significant because his model is usually correct.  So that's another indication.  Now, this one is getting a lot more press because it's predicting narrowly a Biden victory.  However, I'm going to explain why it's being misinterpreted and offer my own spin on it.  And this is, oops, that's the wrong one.  The keys to the White House.  You might see coverage of this in the media because, of course, they're focusing on stuff that supposedly looks good for Biden.  And it was created by Alan Lichtman.  It's been generally correct from 1860 to 2000.  It was incorrect in 2000.  The way that it works is eight of the 13 keys are required to win.  They actually tend to report this backwards.  They say, if five or fewer of the keys are false, then the incumbent party will win.  But it's easier, I think, just to think about it in terms of what's true.  So basically, in order to win, the incumbent party needs to score eight of the 13 keys.  The problem here is that these keys are relatively subjective.  Some are objective, but some are definitely subjective.  And that's why even though Lichtman is only coding six of the 13 for the Republican party, for the incumbent Trump administration, however, the way that he's coding them is obviously incorrect.  And I'll explain that.  So at six out of 13 for Trump, That would indicate that Biden will win narrowly.  So let's look at the keys themselves.  Number one, the party mandate.  The midterms.  Did the incumbent party win congressional seats in the midterm elections?  No, that's false.  Contest.  There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.  That's true.  Nobody ran against Trump.  Incumbency, the incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.  There's always an advantage to an incumbent.  Trump is the incumbent.  That's two keys.  Six to go.  There is no significant third party or independent campaign.  That's also true.  I don't think you can count Kanye West as a significant third party campaigner.  The Green Party doesn't have a significant candidate.  The libertarians are no longer a factor.  So that's also true.  So that's three now.  The campaign or the economy is not in recession during the election campaign.  Again, you've got that massive COVID swing, but it's not in recession now.  I believe that might be one that he had coded, but it's not in what we would consider to be a conventional recession.  Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.  That is true.  Even with the up and down swing, the reported GDP has been very good because of Trump's trade war.  We've talked about this before.  When you limit imports, you automatically increase GDP.  policy change.  The incumbent administration affects major changes in national policy.  That's definitely true.  Trump has instituted major changes, which is why he's always at war with the courts.  The next one, social unrest.  There's no sustained social unrest during the term.  Well, that's obviously false.  So there's a tremendous amount of social unrest, Antifa, BLM, et cetera.  However, notice we're already at one, two, three, four, five, six.  We're already at six.  That's all.  And that's he needs two more.  Now, this is one I'm guessing where he coded it against Trump, but I don't think it should be.  The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.  Well, you've got the Russia, Russia, Russia collusion, which is false.  You've got the impeachment, which nobody even talks about.  So I don't think that you can count any of these things as scandals when no one cares about them.  I mean, not even the Democrats.  So I would rule that to be true.  Now this is one where I think he definitely got it wrong.  The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.  He hasn't.  Trump is the first president in years to keep us out of war.  No wars, no lost wars.  He's pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq.  He's avoided war with Iran.  He's avoided war with Russia.  And that brings us to the next question.  The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.  Lichtman coded that one false.  I disagree.  North Korea is a massive success.  Avoiding the war in Syria was a significant success.  So we'll find out who's right in a few weeks.  This was the other one that I think he ruled against.  The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.  Trump is obviously charismatic.  It'd be ridiculous to claim otherwise.  And then finally, The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.  Well, it's very clear that Joe Biden is not charismatic.  He's not a national hero.  He doesn't even know what state he's in or what office he's running for.  In fact, he's barely campaigning at all.  So if you look at the keys to the White House, I actually score 11 out of 13, which indicates, surprise, surprise, a Trump slide.  Now, the betting markets are another indicator.  However, it's important to remember that everybody knows that now.  So, of course, they've been corrupted.  The betting odds currently show 66.8% in favor of Biden.  You can still go out and make some money on Trump winning.  I told people to do that back in 2016.  You can probably do the same thing now.  One of my readers, I think, actually made something like $10,000 by putting a sizable bet on Trump.  What's interesting here, though, is that, first of all, Biden's odds are nowhere nearly as good as they should be if he was genuinely up by 16 points.  I mean, if The Economist is giving Biden a 91% chance of winning... How come the betting odds are only 67% in this favor?  It's because people don't believe the numbers and they shouldn't.  But here's why the number, the betting odds are not legitimate.  If you look at the amount of big money, if you look at the total amount of money that's being bet on Biden, something like 82% of it is being bet on Biden versus 18% on Trump.  But if you look at the people who are actually betting, this number is not quite right.  It's actually 52.8%.  So it's more like 53% of the people betting are betting on Trump.  So what we're seeing here is not an indication of strength for Biden or a belief that Biden is more likely to win.  What we're seeing is big money being used to, again, create a false impression.  More people who are betting, 53% of them believe that Trump's going to win.  But of the... 47 percent that are betting on biden.  some of them are betting a lot more money on that and that's what influences the odds.  it's not about the the numbers it's about the total amount of money.  so if you take all of these factors into account i think that you can see that These are collectively much more important and carry a lot more weight than the ridiculous fake polls from the fake news, which are specifically designed to demoralize Trump voters and try to convince more people to join the fake winning side.  And that's why I don't think that there's any cause for dismay.  I don't think there's any cause for alarm.  And I think that you can move through this demoralization season full of confidence and good cheer that in a few weeks, we're not going to see joe biden win by 16 points.  we're not going to see joe biden win at all.  what we are almost certainly going to see is a trump slide 2020. i'm vox day and this is the dark stream.","channel.id":"clxmi0mox014ucdviiesvlk8a","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCGJNdaSwFeP3pLd1MhN0dRg","channel.name":"Darkstream","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"IT","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVst0MkhIyBTacd8RhWyV36q2BNkZ1B55DOnguf=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The host, Vox Day, discusses the current state of the US presidential election, arguing that polls are being manipulated to demoralize Trump supporters and convince others to back Biden.

In today's video, feminism is unfortunately back at it again with another radical feminist lending credence to the claim that modern day feminism isn't in fact about equality at all, but rather about wanting to destroy everything that's healthy and normal.  From decrying masculinity as toxic to labeling the traditional stay-at-home wife as a form of white supremacy, and now most recently calling to abolish the family.  We can't have a feminist future without abolishing the family.  The feminist thinker Sophie Lewis has a radical proposal for what comes next.  Apparently, men not wanting to date woke lefty women is a scandal worthy of international condemnation, but calling to abolish the family, the fundamental building block of our society, it's simply a radical proposal worthy of being supported by a positive puff piece.  The article from Vice promotes a book by the feminist thinker Sophie Lewis called Full Surrogacy Now, which is a polemic that calls for abolishing the family.  When Lewis demands full surrogacy now, she isn't talking about commercial surrogacy or surrogacy TM, as she puts it.  Instead, she uses the surrogacy industry to build the argument that all gestation is work because of the immense physical and emotional labor it requires of those who do it.  She often refers to pregnancy as an extreme sport.  If all forms of pregnancy count as work, we can take a clear-eyed look at our current working conditions.  It is a wonder we let fetuses inside us, she says at the start of her book, citing the roughly 1,000 people in the United States who still die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth each year, mostly poor women and women of color.  Yes, it's true that pregnancy is extremely difficult and that unfortunately, in some cases, women do die.  But saying that women shouldn't give birth because it's difficult and there are risks is kind of like saying that men shouldn't perform dangerous yet necessary jobs because every year there's between four and six thousand male workplace fatalities.  Also, it's not as if the nuclear family is solely responsible for certain women dying during pregnancy and that If we replaced this with a surrogacy industry, suddenly no women would ever again die during pregnancy.  No one is claiming that pregnancy is easy, that it's some kind of walk in the park.  It's a well-known fact that pregnancy can take an extraordinary toll on women's minds and bodies.  that things like childbirth and breastfeeding are indescribably painful.  But these enormous sacrifices are ones that many women choose to make of their own free will out of love for their children.  Lewis imagines a future where the labor of making new human beings is shared among all of us, mother no longer being a natural category, but instead something we can choose.  But it is something we can choose.  Nowadays, each and every one of us does have the choice, at least in the West, whether or not we would like to be mothers.  Also, Lewis incorrectly assumes that in a healthy nuclear family, the mother would have 100% of the responsibilities when it comes to raising the children.  While yes, the mother does do a lot of the work, when it comes to a nuclear family that's intact, she would generally also receive help from her husband and from her other children when they're old enough.  Many mothers also receive help from grandparents, aunts, and their friends.  There used to be a time when we had strong, tight-knit communities with a high level of trust among the residents.  In fact, I grew up in a community that was exactly like this.  So when my mom had to run some errands and didn't want to bring all the kids along because she had eight kids, that's, you know, quite a circus, she had absolutely no misgivings about leaving us with the neighbors for a few hours.  There's a saying that it takes a village to raise a family, and in some respects this is true.  But what happens when you can no longer trust the quote-unquote village that you live in, when your communities have become atomized and hostile?  when almost every child comes from a broken family.  The solution then becomes to focus on fixing the nuclear family and to rebuild the communities that have been damaged.  Not to scrap the entire system that's worked for us for so long and then to surrender all of our children to absolute strangers to be raised in God knows what way.  At this point, surrogacy becomes somewhat metaphorical.  Lewis isn't asking that we all agree to physically gestate fetuses that aren't biologically ours.  Her radical proposition is that we practice full surrogacy by abolishing the family.  That means caring for each other not in discrete private units, also known as nuclear households, but rather within larger systems of care that can provide us with the love and support we can't always get from blood relations, something Lewis knows all too well.  In Lewis's utopian future, the family as we know it no longer exists.  Everyone, regardless of gender, is a surrogate.  We mother each other.  There is a heck of a lot to say here, but first of all, I wouldn't call this future of Sophie Lewis's some kind of original vision.  It's been discussed by many people in the past, but what immediately comes to my mind is the very popular fiction book, Brave New World.  In Brave New World, the traditional family unit is non-existent.  In fact, there is no longer even any natural birth.  New people are instead engineered through artificial wounds.  There are no mothers, fathers, siblings, or relatives in the world state because familial loyalties and strong emotional bonds are considered to cause instability.  The citizens of the world state are also led to believe that everyone belongs to everyone and they should have numerous sectional partners, monogamy is discouraged.  I find it very interesting that Sophie Lewis's vision of the future, in which the family is abolished, is referred to as utopian.  It's clear that what people like Sophie Lewis are envisioning is a permanent happiness, something resembling a perfect life on Earth.  Of course, while we can strive for such a life, in reality, it's never going to happen.  We're never going to achieve a utopia simply because human nature is too flawed.  I genuinely am sorry for Sophie Lewis that she wasn't blessed with a healthy and happy childhood and family life.  But it's no excuse to try to destroy the entire system of the nuclear family simply because she believes that it failed her.  What's more, there are massive flaws in her utopian theory.  Firstly, there's never going to be complete equality because people aren't robots.  People are always going to naturally like some people more than they do others, and people are always going to naturally give some more love, attention, and care to some people more than they do others.  Even in a society where people equally share the responsibility of raising children, There's still going to exist favoritism and negligence, hatred and abuse of certain children.  There is no complete fix to this problem.  I actually found an article which goes over several examples regarding how, at least for the most part, the data reveals that being raised by both biological parents is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not a child will actually be safe and loved.  This is certainly not to say that a child raised by only one biological parent or that has been adopted won't be safe and loved.  The article is simply speaking in overall terms.  Furthermore, in Sophie Lewis's vision for the future, Children being raised in some kind of large and centralized system of care will make it much easier to indoctrinate them, to have power over very young children to make them all follow the same religion or lack thereof, to make them all have the same political beliefs, or to introduce them to things like drag queen story hour against their biological parents' wishes, or even to ostracize the few children who refuse to fall in line.  For the most part, everyone will end up being cut from the exact same cloth.  But maybe this is exactly what Sophie Lewis wants.  Once again, the best solution is not to replace the nuclear family, it's to fix it.  But before we can even start doing that, we as a society do need to return to a position where we actually regard the nuclear family as a positive thing, as something of importance that's worthy of incentivization and protection.  Otherwise, there's really nothing stopping feminists from destroying it in the exact same way that they're trying to destroy nearly every other sense of normalcy when it comes to relationships between men and women.

The laws of God are everywhere in white European civilizations. Ever since the Ten Commandments were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, only one race has consistently strived to follow them to this day.  It all started with our ancestors invading the land of Canaan and there they were for a while able to keep the commandments going on to build a vast civilization. but Yahweh warned them if they did not fully drive out all the Canaanites that they would be pricks in our eyes and thorns in our sides.  and that is exactly what happened.  the Canaanites gradually corrupted them blinded them to the truth and turned our ancestors away from Yahweh, leading them into all types of sin.  But after the Assyrian deportations and with the Israelite migrations into Europe, our people were separated from these accursed Canaanites.  And upon receiving Christ's gospel, once again we were able to keep the laws and commandments.  Does European Christian civilizations we built not show this?  Does it not show that we are the Israelites of the Bible?  the people of God.  Throughout all of our nations you will always have found law and order in every white European society.  No matter where you go, pick any country and you will find it.  It has been this way for centuries and it wasn't too long ago that for Europeans every man, woman and child would have known the Ten Commandments by heart.  Bibles were taught in our homes, churches, and even in our schools.  We read and knew our Bibles to a greater or lesser degree.  The average person feared God and knew that His laws should be upheld.  It is only with the infiltration of our governments and nations once again, only with a foreign force have our societies been corrupted and begun to be taken over and forced us to depart from the law and order-based system that our forefathers had established.  It's the exact same story as our ancestors in the lands of Canaan all over again.  They were slowly corrupted and so have we been over the past century.  Is it not obvious?  How can people not see it?  Now as for the laws, it should be noted that they were only ever given to one people, the children of Israel.  No other people in existence were ever given the law and therefore are not expected to keep it.  David in one of his Psalms said that he was glad that the laws were not given to any other nations and he praised Yahweh our God for it.  Now as for the laws, most people only think that there are only 10 commandments and that's it.  But there are actually many more laws.  When Moses and the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, Other laws were given to them, and these included prohibitions against usury, sorcery , sodomy, bestiality, the food laws, and many more.  But most importantly, the children of Israel were commanded to be a separate people, to not mingle with non-Adamites, especially the Canaanites.  All of these moral laws are our creator's blueprints instructing us how to build a moral functioning thriving civilization.  They are a loving father's directions to his children.  You only have to look at any European nation to see the truth.  and fulfillment of all of this.  Yahweh's commandments teach us what virtue is and they train us how to live properly.  In addition if we properly maintain these laws and truly abide them it protects our societies from infiltration.  Now some people believe that the laws are only temporary and that once Christ came they don't matter anymore.  And that is simply not true.  These moral laws are forever.  They never expired.  Only the Levitical rituals were retired once Christ came, or as Paul calls them, the works of the law.  Since Christ was the last sacrifice, they were not needed.  So since the moral laws did not pass away, every generation of Israelites is required to follow them to this day.  So all Europeans, being their descendants, are still expected to keep the laws.  They are your heritage.  Christ himself told his followers, if you love me, then you will keep my commandments.  Which commandments would those be?  He was referring to the same ten commandments and other laws that he gave to us.  He being Yahweh our God, he gave them to Moses and then to our ancestors.  And Christ is God, and therefore those old commandments are his commandments.  Furthermore, Christ gave us a new commandment, so He takes it even further, and that is that we should love one another as He loved us, and that way everyone will know that we are His disciples.  Now no man can just turn up and make his own new additions to Yahweh's laws.  Only God Himself can do that.  Since Christ is God, He can do it.  If a new commandment is made to complement the old ones, we are still expected to keep all the old commandments as well.  In Christ's name, we are commanded to truly love and care for one another, that is, to care for other Israelites as true children of Yahweh.  We are a brother's keeper.  So which people have followed Christ's commandments, which are our God's commandments?  Who built entire civilizations based on his laws?  Who opposed what the Bible prohibits going to great lengths to ban usury, sexual deviancy, pornography, drugs use, i.e.  sorcery, gambling, and all other vices that tempt people and destroy their lives and our civilizations?  These were all outlawed before Europe became secular during very recent times.  One renowned jurist and member of parliament, William Blackstone, wrote in his commentaries on the laws of England, the attitude of the European Christian man and woman towards law and order.  The Bible has always been regarded as part of the common law of England, and no enactment of man can be considered law unless it confirms to the law of God.  Blackstone's writing also had a tremendous influence on the Americans' founding fathers.  The American Constitution they drafted is based on the Bible laws, as well as older documents such as the Magma Carta, the Scottish Declaration of Arbroath, and many more.  Yahweh said that He, speaking to the Israelites at the time of the deportations, that He would write the laws upon their hearts.

This isn't a particularly pretty place. Doesn't attract any tourists.  This hedge is at the side of a field through which a busy road goes.  On the other side we have a wind farm and up over beyond the road there's a recycling station.  But it was a sacred space.  Darakot Moor was once a burial ground in the Bronze Age, and it's scheduled as an important monument nationally.  Even with the coronavirus epidemic, there's still traffic going around here.  But every single one of these lorries and cars and tractors that goes past is driving literally over the bones of the dead.  Because this mound that goes off into the road is not a hill.  It's actually an enormous burial mound, an enormous barrow of some great man who lived in the Bronze Age in Britain.  The mound is visible on the road as well.  You can see it when you're driving.  It's just this hill that you go over.  all the cars going over it.  Then from an aerial view, you can see the barrow on both sides of the road in each of the fields.  Here it is quite clear, the largest of all the barrows in this grey field. Barrow 2, from the same grave field of Daracot Moor, in Huntshaw, was excavated in 1875 by a local amateur archaeologist named George Doe.  He found this dagger inside the barrow.  The dagger was found with a cremation burial, and radiocarbon dating of the remains in 2013 dated them to around 1800 to 2000 BC.  Many Bronze Age barrows on the moors of Devon contain cremation burials, such as Brocken Barrow from Exmoor, which contained this urn now kept in Barnstable Museum. On the Exmoor there are over 300 barrows from the late Neolithic, to the early Bronze Age or is mainly associated with the Bell Beaker culture.  And this is a nice example of one from Brockenbarrow.  It's called Brockenbarrow Urn but there are actually several barrows at the Brockenbarrow site and there have been other urns unearthed from it before this one.  It was unearthed at the beginning of the 20th century and unfortunately there was a mishap involving a drunk individual which led to it being smashed.  Perhaps it wasn't in great condition when it was first unearthed anyway, but it was restored to its present state in the 1990s.  And you can see quite clearly where the reparations have been done. The Huntshaw dagger was buried with a large quantity of oak and beech leaves, which may have had a ritual significance associated with the weapon.  Such daggers were high status symbols in the early Indo-European culture of the Bell Beaker folk.  This dagger is from a similar barrow around Stonehenge and this one is from York.  Another local bronze age find was a hook tang spearhead of Cypriot origin.  Very few examples are found in Britain.  The British Beaker people were a part of an enormous trade network giving them access to amber from Scandinavia and weapons from the Mediterranean and the tin they mined here in the West Country was exported as far away as the Levant.

You should also peruse my online Teespring store which features a number of excellent designs of very Indo-European artwork.

Now, while I've been to it and lived there as well as Europe many times over the years, some of the cultural habits in those places never ceased to take my notice.  And I think part of the reason for that is given the fact that I've lived in Japan now for a number of years.  I guess growing up in a Western country has helped me come to realize that there is a reason why we can't have nice things.  Safe public transit, safe streets and parks at night, allowing small children to walk themselves to school, freedom from vandalism, freedom from marauding urban youth.  In the past several decades, these nice things we just cannot have.  And what do translucent, glowing, cyberpunk, Blade Runner-esque public toilets have to do with this?  As I compare and contrast Tokyo the city I currently live in, with the city I lived in last summer, London, plus the greater implications of why we can't have nice things.  A big thanks to Raid Shadow Legends for sponsoring this video.  Now, it's a pretty cool game with a dark-esque type fantasy theme.  What I like about it is you can pick it up and play for just a couple of minutes, or if you have a little bit more time, for half an hour.  You can play on your cell and on your desktop, and it's really easy to get started and make serious progress.  I really like the different styles of combat that the different characters can play, but also the boss fighting, but more so the meticulous attention to detail and the stunning graphics that the game employs, because it looks good on both your laptop and your other devices.  So what's new for September 2020?  Well, there's been a huge champion update to make the PvP even more competitive, as well as the introduction of a forge where you can craft top quality artifacts and get started with them right away.  use my link only in the description and you will get.  if you are a new player you'll get 100 000 silver plus 50 gems plus 10 mystery shards plus one free champion.  this bad boy here slasher and all of this treasure is waiting for you here.  help support this channel by downloading raid shadow legends.  it's a lot of fun and it is very much appreciated.  and now back to the video.  Probably one of the most noticeable differences between the Occident and the Orient in terms of cultural habits is simple hygiene.  Most people don't remove their shoes upon entering their homes, for example, and track the filth from outside into the space they live.  And this is not only unique to the UK, but appears to be not only found in the Anglosphere, that being Australia, Canada, and the US, but pretty much most of the places that I've been to around the continent.  While, of course, this habit of taking off one's shoes changes when there's rain and snow, for the most part, Westerners tend to wear their shoes indoors.  And they even do this after being in places like public toilets, where men especially will be the first ones to tell you that the floors are usually covered in spilt urine, and then afterwards track this all over the carpets in their homes.  And this is what brings me to the focus of this video.  As stated previously, last summer I lived in London and what I noticed in that city, like many centers in Europe, was the unmistakable foul odor of dried urine after periods with little rain.  You could go out in London on a Friday night, turn around into a lane only to see young women squatting down with their skirts hiked up, relieving themselves on the concrete.  On a Saturday night, London smelt, put simply, quite awful.  Now, the reason for this is that beside the few public toilets or pay toilets in places like Hyde Park, the only outdoor public toilets I can remember running across was this standing only turrent style cylinder that clearly says on the outside that it's for urine only, but was in fact on every occasion I was near Trafalgar and felt the need to use it.  Well, it was generally almost every time caked in splattered, malodorous, wretch-inducing fecal matter.  Because let's be real, and anyone who's ever spent any time in central London, the central part of that city, will tell you, it, like many other cities in Europe, because of the lack of this basic, civilized necessity, that being clean public toilets, smells oftentimes like an open sewer, where every wall is as good as any other.  Even the London Underground was not much help.  Some of the larger stations like Paddington had public toilets, but the majority of the smaller stations on the lines that I frequently used didn't.  After researching this a bit, the simple answer to why this is the case is that these public toilets just cost the local councils a lot of money.  According to a thread on Quora, there are a few businesses like McDonald's that are trying to pick up the slack and allow public use of their toilets.  But my experience was that you still need to purchase something to be able to use the toilets in places like McDonald's or Burger King for that matter.  And unless you're in a nice restaurant or such a place, the vast majority of public toilets in the United Kingdom are filthy, smelly, disgusting, and very unpleasant places to be.  And this is in stark contrast to not only big metropolises like New York, but also and especially Japan and in particular Tokyo.  Greater Tokyo or Metropolitan Tokyo has a population of around 38 million people, but as any traveler to this city will notice almost immediately, are a few things that stand out in relation to cities like London.  First is the almost total absence of rubbish bins anywhere in the city to be found, but paradoxically, probably the cleanest, most litter-free streets on earth.  And the reason behind this is because people are meant to carry their own garbage with them to wherever their destination is and then discard of it there.  Even smokers carry around small fireproof cases to discard their cigarette butts in.  The streets, the train stations, and also the public toilets are absolutely spotless and clean in stark contrast to my experiences in London.  In Tokyo, at every train station, at every park, and about 90% of convenience stores that are basically ubiquitous in the city, they all provide safe and clean public toilets for anyone's use, with the vast majority of them having toilet seat sanitizers, toilet seat warmers for use in the winter, and complete with a shower bidet.  There are usually buttons to dry your backsides off with and even options for shy women to have bird noises playing while they take care of their business.  Actually, the high-tech nature of Japanese shower WCs has long been one of the first topics of conversation with newly arrived people and the fascination that surrounds them.  And the thing to remember is that all of these spotless, clean, and beautiful toilet spaces are absolutely free.  But now it would seem the Japanese have taken their considerable penchant for cleanliness to the next level.  In the Shibuya ward of the city near Yoyogi Park, transparent public toilets have now been installed in five public locations with plans for 17 more.  So that the prospective customer, the reason for the transparency is that the prospective customer can inspect the cleanliness of the toilet from the outside so as to be able to decide whether to use it or not.  While the transparent nature of the toilets might fill some with anxiety, and I'm sure a small minority of exhibitionists with a sense of thrill, the toilets themselves are built using what is called smart glass that turns opaque once the cubicles are occupied and you are doing your business.  According to the non-profit that constructed them, there were two main concerns when they were constructing public toilets, especially those being located in parks.  And the first is whether the toilet is itself clean inside.  But the second is that there is no one secretly waiting inside.  And this is quite important in a city that is infamous for its legions of hentai or perverts.  that secretly equip cameras in public toilets to film unsuspecting victims.  And adding to the cyberpunk or Blade Runner-esque look of Tokyo, these toilets at night light up in the parks and look like gigantic, beautiful lanterns.  Even the fading pop star Madonna said of Japanese toilets back in 2005 that she missed them after more than a decade outside of the country.  And I must confess, when abroad, I do too.  Because there's nothing quite like going from a heated seat bidet toilet in a spotless WC to a fecal matter-encrusted urinal and foul-smelling streets that places like the United Kingdom's capital, London, has to offer.  And none of this is to say that there aren't other cities that are even more infamous for their streets being paved in human waste, at least in the Western world.  Perhaps the most famous on Earth right now would be the brown-strewn streets of San Francisco, saying nothing of the many other large American and Canadian metropolises that too are encrusted in excrement.  Much of this would be funny if it wasn't so tragic, because it was the Romans that had this figured out 2,000 years ago, as they installed public commodes in the centers of their cities throughout their empire.  But it would seem their heirs, centuries later, can no longer get this basic civic service in their modern cities to function any longer.  Thus the stench of London and the brown of San Francisco.  Seems like the mayors of both New York and London are always in some kind of verbal joust over which of their cities is the greatest in the world.  Well, when it comes to things like safe and clean streets, and frankly, a safe, clean, and hygienic way to answer nature's call while in public, Tokyo has both of these cities beaten hands down, but especially the latter.  It displays, Tokyo displays the kind of civilized behavior that Western cities should at least attempt to rediscover and or emulate.  Don't get me wrong, I really, really like London.  But if I'm honest, it is a filthy, grimy, and smelly place overall, even if I do like it.  And it's not at all safe.  I can't say the same about Tokyo, though, and the reason is pretty clear.  Tokyo still has what's been lost in western towns and cities.  Social cohesion, civic pride, high trust, the awareness not to crap in your own bed by vandalizing and destroying property in your own community.  Tokyo still has social shaming to keep people and their anti-social behavior in check.  Would London, specifically its society, the people that make up its community, be able to handle, for example, another blitz?  Would they be able to come together as a people with a stiff upper lip?  And if not, why not?  What has happened in the last few short decades that is so undermined, so subverted, that society?  Well, there are a lot of things one can point to, and that will be the subject of another video.  Maybe next month, if this video proves to be popular.  but the question i would like to leave you with is this why can't we have nice things anymore in large cities in the western world?  why can't los angeles?  why can't san francisco?  why can't london have nice cyberpunk blade runner-esque glowing see-through public toilets?  ask yourself that question.

I mean, you see these people that agree with us on 90 percent of things, but they just won't touch.  They won't touch race or they won't touch national identity.  And at the same time as they are decrying many of the things we decry, they don't see it as a problem at all that capitalism is is forcing this mass immigration on people against the democratic will.  And I mean.  that's kind of a source of despair.  I mean, you know, you look at these intelligent sort of distant left types that are very much against the establishment, very much against the mainstream left and the radical liberal types.  But at the same time, they'll just never go there on race.  They'll just never go there on national identity or on the democratic will against immigration.  And I mean, it seems like the only explanation for that is that they still have an element of liberalism that they don't care to admit.  And that, you know, that is the sticking point, because I know you're talking about we can make some kind of alliance with the left, we can win over leftists.  And, you know, you and I are both former leftists, so we know that there's obviously a pathway there.  But at the same time, it's like, is there any, there doesn't seem to be a viable way to get these people to even touch the race issue. Yeah, you know, that's surprising as I Always found it a bit weird when, you know, people like Amy Therese are overrated in our circles a little bit because when she's criticizing like Vogue ideology and neoliberalism, it sounds a lot like the criticisms we make.  But what's behind it is what I came to reject Marxism in the first place.  at the very beginning of this call was that it shares the same ontology with liberalism.  In fact, Marx was heavily influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment.  It's the same idea that man is malleable and he's malleable because of the economic conditions that he finds himself in.  Essentialist notions of race, even if Marx had some race comments, in principle are denied by Marxism.  So even he himself might have said some things in principle.  what the main ontology of dialectical materialism is, is that what creates man is the material conditions.  All these antagonisms can be solved if we just solve the problem of the way in which people don't have access to material resources as upper classes do.  And so this is why I came to reject it, because it postulated that, which I think is a false view of man to begin with.  And then it postulates this idea that, you know, if we solve this problem, then everyone, there's going to be essentially a state of harmony, right?  That's what communism is.  It's a stateless, classless society.  And so I'm always a little skeptical of this idea of allying with the left.  I more or less take the approach that whoever likes what I have to say or what you have to say, whether they be from the left or right, they can come along for the ride.  But at the end of the day, we're doing our own thing.  And I'll say about people like Zizek, for example, Zizek should really just be a fascist.  Because if you look at what his main point is, his point is that when he puts it this way, I'll say it this way because it's the easiest way to say it, is that traditionally the father figure would just say, you're going to your grandparents whether you like it or not.  While the postmodern dad would say, you're going to your grandparents because you're going to love it.  Right.  It tries to make you enjoy this process.  So the formalized authoritative figure is no longer present, which is very much true.  This goes back to what we're talking about before.  We have this great neoliberal system in which this flowing of capital is mismanaged by a variety of spectators and institutional actors and educators and presidents and the  U.N.,  And none of them are taking responsibility for it.  It's effectively being treated like a system outside of our control.  It's propped up like a collective fiction.  So what, well, not like, it is a collective fiction.  And so what Zizek, his point is we need to return to this authority figure.  We need to actually have a stated role of the state and putting a stop to this dominance of economic rationality.  And so in his point, he should really just be a fascist.  right and so with people like zizek you do.  we do have more of a common ground with but for the majority of marxists and zizek of course is more of a hey gillian even though he gets painted as a marxist.  it's more because of his critique of ideology.  but regardless marxists are still caught up in the same enlightenment ontology.  they get it from the exact same source and at the end of the day they're still denying the fundamental importance about who we are.  And that's really what the dissident right and the alt-right in its heyday was about.  It was asking the question of identity.  It was asking who we are.  And it was asking about it in terms of race, in terms of religion, in terms of the fact that these things actually matter and just trying to prop up an economic utopia, which is the same thing that conservatives actually have in common with Marxists more than they have in common with us.  In the sense that they simply think ordering the economy a bit differently than the Marxists is going to bring about the result of, you know, everyone's free, right?  Everyone's happy.  It's the same thing at the end of the day.  And so really, the only ones questioning the entire ontology of this world system is really us.  And I think these are questions that we need to keep pushing because it's any kind of Marxist account simply is not a strong enough bulwark.  It's a part of the system, and I'm just as opposed to it as I am opposed to capitalism. You actually gave the same answer that I gave when I was asked recently about the kind of dissident left-alt-right alliance, because I kind of disagreed with Spencer.  Spencer said something along the lines of, you know, well, we'll have to give up something and the distant left will have to give up something and then we can potentially meet in the middle.  But my attitude was much more, you know, when people ask about the potentially aligned with these people and they say, well, you know, look at how these figures that you think are going to come to our side, they still won't touch the race question or look at this example of them peddling anti-white stuff.  And yeah, my attitude is the same as you.  It's like, yeah, we're not going to win these people over.  We're not going to win over the kind of dissident left journalist on Twitter that's been doing this stuff for like 20 years.  We're not going to win over Amy Therese or these people.  But yeah, my approach is the same as you.  It's like, no, we won't compromise.  We won't meet them in the middle, but we have potential to win over people that would otherwise go to them.  So the next generation of those people, the people now that are becoming alienated from liberalism, that when they're looking for a radical alternative, that instead of the options being this kind of, you know, racist conservatism versus the dissident left perspective, which maybe has a better structural analysis on some things, that they will have the option of racialist third position that can explain the economic alienation they're looking at and can explain the source of many of the structural problems just as well as the dissident left.  without us having to compromise on race and without us having to compromise on those elements of our identity.  And I think that is very doable.  And I think that actually we probably do have more potential to win people from there rather than conservatism.  And if not more people, then probably better people in terms of what their motivations are and in terms of what they're looking for.  But, you know, it's actually interesting.  you mentioned Amy Trees because it was just this week I saw her on Twitter.  She got into it with kind of, some of our guys, and she said to one of them that they had a completely liberal ontology because they included race as well as class as a factor.  And she said that, you know, that position implies that racial categories are primordial or that they exist outside of history rather than the historical materialist Marxist perspective.  that racial categories are ascribed in accordance with ruling class interests.  Now, that sounds to me like a fairly muddied explanation in that it's kind of a, I see what you think of it, but I think it's kind of a sleight of hand trick in that it's like, well, you know, people didn't discuss race in this way before a capitalist epoch.  And therefore, it can be explained due to class interests and therefore in a communist society or post-capitalism that the importance of race would diminish.  But it's like at the same time, you know, we didn't always understand things like calculus and it's like she seems to be just doing a kind of sleight of hand trick there or a kind of genetic fallacy and that it's like, well, this is historically how we came to knowledge of these things or this is how racial identities kind of came into conflict or got an awareness of themselves in a globalized context and so how we developed a language around it.  and therefore it's historically contingent it's completely contingent whereas really it's like well maybe the origin of those individual categories are contingent and yeah maybe they came out of an embedded social context where you know various class interests and so on played a role in the way they were the way they were discussed, but at the same time, there can still be a material reality of race there.  And, you know, if you are a dialectical materialist, then biology and genetic factors are, you would imagine, just as much a part of your material analysis.  You know, if you're not a dualist and you don't see, you know, you don't see humans as being on some separate ontological plane to the world they inhabit, then, you know, surely race and genetics should be a part of your materialist kind of deterministic outlook on the world.  Would you agree with that? Yeah, I do.  I should think I replied to that tweet.  Yeah, it was an interesting sleight of hand.  It was also, when it comes to history of philosophy, very ignorant.  What I found interesting about that is like, It's the same thing with like, you know, Marx having said racist comments and liberals having like historically 18th century and on using a lot of racial understanding to justify certain colonialist activities.  Right.  That doesn't mean, therefore, that these racial categories are purely historically contingent and don't fit into the analysis.  So like what I was saying earlier is I was saying like.  The way in which neoliberalism weaponizes ethnic resentment as a part of its woke ideology does not therefore mean that that racial awareness is not real or that race isn't real.  They come from a real place.  And you have to be able to look to all these various different influences that actually play a role in bringing about these antagonisms.  And you have to deal with the fact that they do matter.  Marxism tries to prop up, like I was saying before, this malleable view of man.  It's why it tends to fall into these historicist misunderstandings that it does.  It's like Amy's response there, perfectly exemplified.  So if you look at like the foundation of liberalism, they had, when it came about, they had coffee houses and salons and all that.  And those were considered places where people exercise the use of public reason, which were in principle meant to be open to everybody.  The actual historical reality of that, though, while they were claiming in principle that everybody has access to the same universal reasoning powers and rationality, and we could come to purely secular universal principles of justice, for example, is they were, of course, excluded to women and minorities and things like that.  But just because of the fact that the historical circumstance does not negate the fact that the principle of liberalism was always about universal rationality and about people having the exact same capabilities at reaching these principles and then constructing society around these principles.  And Marxism, of course, has a similar understanding when it comes to malleability and economic conditions.  It simply prioritized these conditions and propped up a historicism in which we could, if we think the conditions in which these antagonisms come, we could change the nature and then we could ultimately reformulate man away from alienation.  And so they share a similar root in the sense that both of them are ontologies of of tabula rosa of blank slate of malleable man.  While the third position, this one is of course that race is real and that it matters and that it plays a functional role in our explanations.  And it's something that is, it's not a part of identity.  You could throw away and expect everything to be perfectly okay from that.  You know, it's a part of alienation and capitalist alienation in particular.  that racial categories and awareness are being denied to white people and that has obvious obvious effects if you look around the world right now.  so it's.  it's in the sense then that allying with the left is simply impossible because you'd be giving up the foundation of what makes our worldview distinct from theirs.  i do think in some ways Like when it comes to our show EBL, we've had a lot of good reaction from leftist philosophers, including like a Zero Books author and that have wanted to open up dialogue with us, which I think is good.  I mean, really, at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is poach an audience.  I'm not trying to give away the goat, but we're trying to present our case and we're trying to present it by talking to people outside of our sphere.  But there's no sense in which we're actually talking.  unironically adopting these ideologies and somehow hoping to secret squirrel our own worldview in there.  That is just naive, right?  But what we're trying to do is open up this dialogue and present the strength of our worldview against theirs.  And that could only be done by being willing to not ghettoize yourself and not get caught up in purity spirals and Conservative baggage.  You have to be willing to engage the world, but you have to do it critically.  You have to know where Marxism came from and you have to be willing to call out, say, Amy Therese when she makes a classic mistake when it comes to the history of philosophy and where the common root of both liberalism and Marxism stem from.","channel.id":"clxmi0nny01tecdvi8ps3cteu","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCGe8kzr_18FIOzjkmzGzzuA","channel.name":"Keith Woods","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/Jyv3LE8oiaGC6Ao0M-rtBOQG5Pz3HKdg4Tb_YLYyYl9e--8tFqlPMmMCK93HmzAhGHydGPu1=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the challenges of forming an alliance with the left, particularly with regards to the issue of race.

Welcome back to my channel.  In today's video, I'm going to share my opinion about OnlyFans.  And it's a bit of an unpopular opinion, at least insofar as the mainstream is concerned, which likes to promote OnlyFans as a platform that empowers women and offers them a route to financial freedom.  For the few people who don't already know, OnlyFans was launched in 2016 and is a subscription-based social media platform where users can sell and or purchase original content, typically of the pornographic variety.  When utilized as an adult site, users will post Not Safe for Work videos and photos to their accounts, which are protected by a paywall.  To date, OnlyFans has 450,000 content creators and 30 million users who pay for their content.  First of all, even if I can't personally relate to the feeling, I do understand on some level why so many women nowadays are drawn to OnlyFans.  Not only is OnlyFans promoted by the mainstream media, but many influential celebrities such as Cardi B and Bella Thorne as well, which makes the platform seem a lot more palatable.  Prostitution or sex work as many call it is presented as an empowering lifestyle.  Women are told that they can have complete control over their bodies and their lives with the potential to secure for themselves financial freedom.  And this is particularly tempting to those who are currently struggling due to the COVID pandemic.  However, the negatives of OnlyFans in my opinion far outweigh the positives.  Personally, there actually aren't any aspects of OnlyFans that I find positive, but there are many who do, so with that in mind, and leaving aside any moral arguments against OnlyFans, here are a few other reasons why you shouldn't start in OnlyFans.  Firstly, you might have read articles about how some women are making $100,000 a year on OnlyFans.  But the truth is that only a small percentage of creators are making anywhere near that amount of money.  The reason for this is because most porn is free, so many people don't feel inclined to pay for it.  And also because there's 450,000 creators on OnlyFans, meaning the competition is brutal.  What's more, for the people doing OnlyFans as a side hustle while in college or while searching for a job, it has the potential to hurt your future career prospects.  There's also the risk that your photos and videos won't remain private and will be published for all the world to see.  Earlier this year, 1.6 terabytes worth of videos and images from OnlyFans were leaked online, primarily comprised of women's accounts, specifically those who use the site to share pornographic images.  And then there are less discussed negatives, such as the fact that OnlyFans creators, some men but mostly women, are being reduced as human beings solely down to what they can offer sexually.  not just by those who consume their pornographic content, but through their own choice as well.  Of course, on its face, a person's sexuality is extremely valuable, but much less so when it's made available to the entire world for five to ten dollars a month.  Not to mention, out of a person's entire set of talents and skills, their genitals are what ultimately they're being defined by.  I can't for the life of me understand why any woman who claims to care about women would encourage other women to join OnlyFans.  For those who want to be valued for their minds and their characters and their positive qualities, OnlyFans obliterates this possibility and instead places all the value on a woman's sexual and physical attributes.  People who look at a woman's naked photos and videos in which she simulates sex acts.  These people aren't thinking about the woman's personality, nor do they care about her.  She's simply one of many outlets that gives them sexual pleasure.  And in many cases, these sexual fantasies requested of OnlyFans creators are horribly degrading.  One creator, Eloise, said, I have been asked to dress as a schoolgirl and pretend to masturbate myself.  Once I was told to tie a rope around my neck and pretend to choke.  There are some real weirdos out there.  Another creator, Claudia, said that she discovered one of her main clients had made a pornographic meme out of one of her topless photographs and posted it on a porn site.  I tried to complain to OnlyFans, but I never heard from them, Claudia said.  I emailed them five times.  In the end, I gave up and deleted my account.  Then there is the girlfriend experience.  OnlyFans offers men the opportunity to pay providers for a day, or however long, to behave as if they are a real date, and via messages and voice notes send instructions as to what he requires of his girlfriend.  It's not surprising that this leads to reports of subscribers becoming obsessed with and going on to stalk the women they follow on OnlyFans.  Recently, it was reported that a 21-year-old woman in Australia who posted explicit content on OnlyFans was followed and harassed by a man who went on to leak her personal information online.  I heard from another woman about being sexually harassed by a subscriber after she rejected his pleas to meet up in real life.  He ended up tracking down my real name and mobile number, she told me, and put up a fake advert on a porn site.  The young woman was soon deluged with dozens of calls and messages from men before she was forced to change her number.  Is money really worth all of the shame, guilt, depression, PTSD, the inability to form healthy romantic relationships that a woman might potentially suffer as a result of day in and day out constantly selling the most intimate, private and vulnerable parts of herself to strangers.  Also, how does OnlyFans affect women's view of men in general?  On the daily, they're surrounded by men who care nothing for them as people, but as fantasies.  Not all men are like this, though.  In fact, many of them aren't.  Many men are loving and honorable and noble, but the women on OnlyFans are never going to know these men because these aren't the types of men that pay women to debase and degrade themselves.  They have far too much respect for themselves than to do that, and they have far too much respect for women in general as well.  I'm not saying all of this to insult women who have OnlyFans, who have had an OnlyFans in the past, or who are considering starting one.  I'm saying it because I genuinely care about the well-being of women.  And for this reason, I think it's necessary to speak out against all of the ideologies and trends that are harmful to them, even if it's unpopular to do so.  Women are worth more than their physical and sexual appeal, and they're sure as hell worth more than their genitals.  They're worth more than being used as fodder for masturbation, and they're capable of much more as well.  Some in fulfilling careers that they can be proud of, some in marriage and motherhood, and some even in both.  Basically, all I want to say to women is please look before you leap.  OnlyFans might seem like a good idea in the moment, but then later becomes something which you deeply regret, but which you can never erase from your past.  If you're being encouraged to join OnlyFans by an OnlyFans creator, and they're only telling you about the positive aspects, you can be sure that they're not being honest.  And if they're not being honest, then perhaps they don't exactly have your best interest at heart.  Perhaps they simply want you to join because it makes them feel better about their own decision to do so.  At the end of the day, we are the ones who determine our own value, not just through how we act, but through the life choices we make.  Money and followers can be gained and they can be lost, but our dignity and integrity, which are infinitely more precious, once lost are in danger of being lost forever.

Or how much this is just the logical effects of capitalism.  And again, that commodification process where all of these traditional forms of life, uh, any traditional social order is a limit to commodification.  It's a limit to profit.  Uh, it's a limit to this growth imperative and that the tendency of capitalism is always to turn limits into barriers and to overcome those barriers.  And.  you know, traditional moral orders, national identity, all of these things are limits to growth and limits to commodification, and so it only makes sense in the capitalist logic that they would be transformed into barriers and overcome, and that the absolute moral wrath and degeneracy is just that kind of natural expression of capitalism in this late stage.  Now, you know, there is a case at the same time, I think that would much more be my opinion, in terms of, you know, the breakdown of identity being a necessary effect of capitalism.  But at the same time, you know, there are obvious effects of the work of people like Adorno and Marcuse.  And, you know, there obviously was somewhat of a combative approach or attitude to, I guess, what we might consider Western civilization.  And, you know, there's a tendency for people to say, well, you're absolving the bad characters involved of the role in this.  And, you know, if you have this kind of structural explanation that you're lessening the effect that these radicals had on things.  So, again, I'm interested where you'd stand on that.  You're obviously very familiar with the Frankfurt School. Yeah, I mean, I agree with you that what we're really talking about here is cultural capitalism.  So if we take what is capitalism trying to do, it's essentially trying to homogenize the world into consumer units so that you purchase your identity.  Everything becomes commodified.  Right.  This is why it takes on a very Gnostic look to it.  Right.  What was Gnosticism?  It's that the physical world and essentialist notions of the self or race or culture is degraded and created by an evil God.  So the goal is to gain the proper knowledge of who you are, and that's how you get salvation.  It's a flight away from the material.  It's a flight into ultimately abstraction.  So now if you look at the way capitalism is, why is it that we're having such a proliferation of, say, trance or anti-racialism or non-essentialist notions of man, of which man is malleable, is because it's essentially removing us from these physical and social and cultural expressions, which are our barriers.  to commodification.  And the reason there are barriers is because only notions of higher meaning that can't be satisfied by an economy of desire, which is based on face needs, on fake needs, is the only bulwark against that.  That's why I like the traditionalist worker party slogan, faith, family, and folk.  That perfectly encapsulates what real resistance to capitalism is.  So now if we look at the Frankfurt School, The story is a little more complicated than the traditional right wing's telling of it actually is.  So if you look at Adorno and Horkheimer, for example, as early as the 1930s, they actually gave up on critical theory as trying to bring about social change.  They were very pessimistic.  The story that they tell in Dialectic of the Enlightenment is basically one in which instrumental reason comes to dominate and push us away from religion and culture and other sources of meaning, and even destroys art.  I mean, Adorno was famously hateful towards jazz music, and he was all about high art.  If Adorno was in that debate between Stryker and Destiny, he would have been on Stryker's side.  All right, that's just a fact.  Now, this is where it starts to get a little more complicated, because then you have other Frankfurt School figures like Herbert Marcusek, herbert marcusa.  he had actually worked for the state department as an anti-fascist during the war and then after the war he was monitored by the fbi but he was also weaponized by the cia.  why was he weaponized by the cia?  because for marcusa what he thought was that this which he actually identified i think correctly.  what we've been talking about is that the way in which we move and become a one-dimensional man instead of one capable of critical thinking is because democratic unfreedom coupled with industrialization prevails to such an extent that we start to identify with the ideology of the state, which is homogenization, meaninglessness, consumerism.  What the American way of life means means freedom and liberty away from these ethnic groups.  understandings of ourselves and it, of course, destroys value in the process.  This was something Marc Huser was talking about and he was completely right about.  But now where he becomes a problem and where I think that story is only very minutely correct about cultural Marxism is his answer to this was saying we have to look for moments of rupture in which Those that are traditionally left outside seats of power and are outside of this homogenization process can affect liberation from it.  They can bring about two-dimensional thinking.  They can bring about a critical attitude towards the prevailing ideology.  So he looked to the feminist movements.  He looked to gay rights movements.  And, of course, this is where it becomes a problem because for him, his reasoning is dialectical.  You look at the domination, then you look at the opposition, and then you try to effect a change from that.  And so he was weaponized by the CIA.  They funded a lot of his work and distributed a lot of his work.  And the reason he did that is because they wanted a left that was friendly to American hegemony.  So if you look at the Soviet Union, this was the Cold War.  They're trying to counteract dialectical materialism.  They're trying to counteract bourgeois and proletariat way of thinking about the problems of the world.  And they want to be like, this totalitarian state, the Soviet Union, which it definitely was, is something that the new left in the 60s was starting to become critical of.  They were starting to look to all these other minority identities and to pull them up, right?  So how does the elites, how do they deal with this?  They go, okay, well, we have this great philosopher who's telling these leftists that it's all about becoming free to realize yourself, right?  It's becoming free to push your minority identity and to rupture the system.  And so it ended up becoming a method of helping to co-opt and solidify American hegemony from that new left form of resistance.  And the reason that that happened, of course, is because what we see right now, you take a look at the black experience in America, For example, you have these groups that were traditionally obviously not at the seat of power.  Right.  They were the ones, you know, slaves.  And then, you know, then you had Jim Crow.  We had all these things.  And so they were.  they were resentful over that.  So they go, OK, well, this is how we can help fight the Soviet left.  Let's bring these people up.  Let's let's let's use it as a part of pulling them into this economy of needs.  Let's sublimate that dissent.  And now it becomes a part of the way the system functions.  And so the reason they did this was because it aided neoliberalism.  Not because they wanted cultural Marxism.  This wasn't subversive professors that just somehow influenced a majority white nation and subverted it.  It was very particular work of the elites that saw a weakness in this project.  And they saw how it tied together with what they were trying to do, right?  And so now we're in a position where whites are scapegoated, because in order to make it look alike, you know, they are woke, that they care about the poor and the oppressed.  They're going to scapegoat us as the traditional holders of power.  And then at the same time, these minority groups are going to become the bludgeon against criticisms of neoliberalism.  So Marcuse, where he went wrong, was very much in his dialectical thinking.  Now, if you look at another Frankfurt School figure, you look at Walter Benjamin, when he wrote theses on the concept of history, he was actually criticizing the materialist and Marxist worldview, which he thought could very easily become co-opted by the state and can turn on any dissidents that are trying to criticize it.  It draws them up into it precisely by satisfying their needs.  So now we're in a place right now where it's like, Congratulations, you replaced a powerful man with a black woman as some CEO position.  This was very much a planned part of solidifying neoliberal hegemony.  This wasn't from just subversion into some pretty system in which American capitalism has somehow always been good.  It hasn't.  It led to the state where it is.  It was not just from some obscure philosopher's right.  Marcuse certainly played a role and he I would say later on he actually got pessimistic about it himself.  And I don't want to absolve him.  I think the weakness in his understanding helped influence what would later become in the academy as like the post-colonial studies, the gender studies, all that proliferated from this reconfiguring class and dialectic between bourgeois and proletariat into oppressor and oppressed and minority groups.  He did play a role, but ultimately it's not really, he was more of a pawn in that game.  It was not that he somehow changed the minds of the entirety of America and made it hate itself.  There was no perfect capitalism.  There was no perfect rising liberalism.  There was no perfect financial empire.  It was planned and that is exactly the way that it went.","channel.id":"clxmi0nny01tecdvi8ps3cteu","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCGe8kzr_18FIOzjkmzGzzuA","channel.name":"Keith Woods","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/Jyv3LE8oiaGC6Ao0M-rtBOQG5Pz3HKdg4Tb_YLYyYl9e--8tFqlPMmMCK93HmzAhGHydGPu1=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the concept of cultural Marxism and its relationship to capitalism.

So where do we find all these Israelite symbols today?  Well, all amongst the European symbols, heraldry, and coat of arms.  Could there be a link?  Could we be the same people as the Old Testament, the people that God promised he would bless above all others?  Let's compare them all, and let's see what we can find out.  Originally, before entering the lands of Canaan, the tribes were split into four camps, all surrounding the tabernacle of Moses and the Levites.  So each camp had three tribes, with one being the head dominant tribe of that camp.  There were four main symbols, one for each camp, those being the lion, the man, the bull, and the eagle.  God commanded that the tribes take these symbols and make them into banners.  However, they also began to take prophecies and blessings.  given to their tribes and turning them into their own distinct tribal symbols to set themselves apart.  Before we begin, it's clear the tribes are spread all throughout our European nations and certain nations do seem to fulfill certain prophecies such as Ephraim and Britain.  So there must at least be a cluster of Ephraim within Britain.  But no doubt Ephraim are also spread everywhere in our nations.  The main point is that these symbols have been right under our very noses this whole time.  The sheer volume and scale, along with many, many other proofs, show that we are the true descendants of the Israelites.  So, starting with Reuben, he had three main symbols, those being the primal man, the unstable water, and also the mandrake, which is often an overlooked one.  The man symbol as we said earlier was because the tribe of Reuben were the head of the southern camp so that became theirs.  The water symbol, the blue white watery stripes was part of Reuben's prophecy that he or his descendants would be as unstable as water and we will get to that.  Lastly the mandrake is from where Reuben gave his mother Leah a mandrake flower which she used to bribe Rachel to conceive another son with Jacob.  It's typically called the fleur-de-lis, which means the lily flower.  However, the only blue lily flower is in the Middle East or South Africa.  Now the mandrake is a blue purple color and the buds are yellow during the summer.  And this symbol looks identical to it.  So lily flower or mandrake, whatever you want to call it, I would contend that this is the symbol of Reuben.  The early Frankish kings such as Charlemagne around 700 AD in his heraldry had the mandrake.  So it's a very old symbol but it's said to go back even further than that which is no surprise.  So a few examples, of course the symbol is all over the French flag and heraldry, on the flag of Quebec and throughout Europe.  For the primal man symbol it's often a supporter.  so on the side such as in the Danish one.  Notice the Iceland coat of arms, the man, along with all the other Israelite symbols.  Then lastly the unstable waters.  This one you could argue that the symbol just represents a lake or a river.  But again look at how many other Israelite symbols we see used in conjunction.  So for prophecies, Reuben was the beginning of my strength, of dignity and power.  Was France not the beginning of the Christian nations?  Charlemagne dominated with the first empire, but just after it says you will not excel or have preeminence.  In other words, it wouldn't last forever.  By the time of Napoleon's empire he practically encompassed all the white world, reaching as far as Russia and even influencing America.  And what happened?  He was defeated and in turn Britain with the British Empire took over and expanded, essentially taking that first born birthright and becoming the new superpower followed after by America.  Reuben had the first birthright, but lost it to Joseph's two sons.  Does this not correlate perfectly with our Old Testament ancestors?  So next, Simeon, he had two symbols.  Firstly, the sword and also the castle, sometimes a tower or a gate.  The sword came from Jacob's prophecy of the wrath of Simeon and Levi for when they sought revenge for their sister and slew all the males of the village.  The castle represented the scattering of Simeon, as they, like Levi, were to be scattered amongst the other tribes.  Simeon, however, was given portions of land within Judah, so they had their own cities and territories, so therefore the castle symbol was appropriate.  This means we'd expect to find these symbols amongst and in conjunction with the other tribes.  So the castle symbol is especially prominent in Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar.  But we must remember Spain very early on was overrun as early as 700 A.T.  and struggled to return to Christianity for a very long time.  For the sword you especially see this one combined such as an eagle holding a sword like on the Irish coat of arms or sometimes a lion holding a sword.  But then again this is no surprise as Simeon would be scattered amongst the other tribes.  On to Levi, he had one symbol and that was the breastplate.  The 12 stones of Israel representing each tribe.  The breastplate was of course because Levi was given the Levite priesthood and they wore them.  Levi was also spread amongst the tribes but as the priests.  However these symbols never appeared as coat of arms.  This is because Levi although they were all across Europe like the other tribes, they were actually the ancient Druids.  When the Israelites began spreading and colonizing Europe, they brought with them these Levitical priests, and over time they simply got known as Druids.  They are most known as being in Britain, however.  originally they were in fact all over Europe.  The Romans outlawed Druidism and gradually began to purge it within the empire.  The last safe haven was Britain.  But once Christ came, there was no longer a need for the Levite priesthood, and the same with Druids.  They all became Christians, and so the 12 stone symbol disappeared.  Next up, Judah.  He had but one primary symbol, and that was the lion.  However, there's more to it, as there were two separate tribes of Judah.  So you have the blood red lion, or sometimes instead, the blood red hand.  and alternatively King David's harp, the first Judah King.  So the lion symbol again was from the eastern camps which Judah was the head of.  Now Judah had twin sons Zerah and Pharah.  Zerah inherited the greater birthright because his hand came out first and it was covered in blood.  so that became the symbol the blood red hand or blood red lion.  Ferez had the second birthright and amongst his descendants was King David and that's where we get the harp which was his personal symbol when he played it for King Saul.  The lion symbol is everywhere in the monarchies.  The harp mostly in Ireland.  It's interesting that the British monarchy has both the red lion and David's harp.  showing that they have both bloodlines, Zerah and King David's.  The blood hand is a bit rarer, we especially see it in Irish and Scottish heraldry.  Again, red lion, we do see it here and there throughout Europe.  For prophecies, virtually every king in Europe uses that lion symbol, and every kingdom always has.  Is this not the kings of Judah ruling over the children of Israel or Europeans?  Even the ruling sceptre of Judah is typically used by the monarchies, and even in the heraldry you'll often see that like an eagle holding a sceptre.  The coronation ceremony of Queen Elizabeth is exactly the same as King David's, it's still there.  Even the Stone of Destiny or Jacob's Pillar, the one our main ancestor slept on, that the kings of judah were to be coronated on has passed on as well all the way through to ireland to scotland and to england.  for dan he probably has the most symbols out of all the tribes those being the eagle the snake the scales and the rider tumbling backwards.  The eagle was the sign of the northern camp, so another one of the four primary symbols.  The snake was Jacob's prophecy, the first half that Dan would leave a viper's trail wherever they went.  The scale simply comes from the name Dan, which means to judge, but also the prophecy that he would judge our people.  And the rider was again Jacob's prophecy, the second part that Dan would buy at the rider's hill, causing it to tumble backwards.  So the eagle is the most prominent to have survived and we can see it just about everywhere like all the European shields such as Poland and Germany have it.  Sometimes the eagle and snake would get combined into a hybrid animal like the Wessex Weaven which is an eagle with a serpent like body.  So for prophecies, the Vipers trail was wherever Dan went, they would name the location after their patriarch Dan.  And you can see that with many rivers, cities, all across Europe.  Denmark literally means Dan's mark or frontier.  Its people are called the Danes.  in their ancient legends their ancestor was called Dan.  now a lot of the Vikings were in fact Danes.  and did they not cause a lot of Christian Europe to tumble backwards at least initially?  but this had the positive effect of forcing those to rally together under a Christian King such as King Alfred and putting all their faith in God.  lastly the Nordic countries were last of the European nations to finally convert to Christianity, so I have awaited your salvation, I believe is referring to this.  So Naphtali only had one primary symbol and that was the stag, the deer or hind.  This is another one of Jacob's prophecies that Naphtali would be a hind.  let loose.  The stag symbol again we see all across Europe, especially on surnames and often frequently as supporters on the sides of heraldry.  Onto Gadd he had two symbols those being a troop as in an armed rider or a military style tent or camp.  Both symbols come from the word Gadd which means troop and also the prophecy that Gadd would be a troop although the camp symbol rarely ever got used today.  This troop symbol is very common in the east, especially Russia where it's on the actual national coat of arms, as well as Lithuania, as well as cities and provinces all over.  The tribe of Asher had two primary symbols, the royal cup and the olive tree.  The cup was from the initial part of Jacob's prophecy of Asher yielding royal dainties, whilst the olive tree, it doesn't appear much, but it was from Moses' prophecy of their lands that they would conquer in Canaan would be abundant in olive oil and then later that they would mine the iron and brass which we will get to.  The cup you see appearing quite often quite subtlety in a few national coat of arms almost in the background and especially amongst the Nordic countries.  Now for prophecies the Phoenicians were primarily from the northern tribes.  The main cities of the Phoenicians were Tyre and Sidon.  which were within the tribe of Asher's territory.  They colonized a lot of Europe, such as Carthage, and these were all Israelites.  They reached as far up as England and Ireland.  So this is where we get the iron mines of Spain and tin mines of England.  For example, this shows how Asher would become rich because of these minerals.  So Issachar he had but one symbol, the donkey.  This was the prophecy that Issachar would find a pleasant land and settle there, but it would be between two burdens and he would be forced to submit like a donkey.  Interestingly the donkey symbol appears mostly throughout Germany and the East European countries.  For surnames mostly Polish ones, and for prophecies.  considering that these lands are in between the powers of the West, i.e.  Europe, and East, i.e.  Russia, does it not fit perfectly that these lands are counting down between two huge burthens?  Zebulon also just had one symbol and that being the boat or ship.  This is once again from Jacob's prophecy that Zebulon would dwell at the haven of the sea.  In other words they would typically be seafarers with plenty of ports and harbours.  So the boat symbol was very appropriate.  The symbol you could argue is just what any fishing village you'd expect them to have.  But again we got Lions, Eagles all entwined.  It appears on the New Zealand most notably Co of Arms.  Now Holland the old crest of the Dutch Republic was a ship.  We had the seven shields for each province.  What's interesting is Moses gave a blessing that Zebulon would suck of the abundance of the seas.  and of the treasures hidden in the sand.  It's interesting that over a third of Holland used to be under the sea until they claimed it and turned it into land with their dike system.  Also Rotterdam is the busiest harbour in the world so Holland certainly is a seafaring nation.  Now Ephraim had three symbols the first being the bull, also the unicorn or alternatively simply the horn.  The bull symbol was the last of the four primary symbols from the camps of the west.  The horn and unicorn come from Moses' prophecy that one day Ephraim with his horns would push the children of Israel to the ends of the earth along with his brother Manasseh.  and we will get to that.  The Bull symbol like the other main symbols we see everywhere all over Europe.  but it's interestingly the character John Bull who was a nationalistic type symbol in England.  For the unicorn most notable it's in the United Kingdom's heraldry, a unicorn on one side and a lion on the other.  So for prophecies Ephraim was promised he'd have a double portion and one day be a company of nations.  The only nation to accomplish such a feat is the British Empire which allowed the Europeans or Israelites to colonize virtually the entire world, at this time setting up prosperous new nations everywhere.  Even the name England or English comes from the word Angles which was one of the Anglo-Saxon tribes that invaded Britain.  it means the bull or horned one.  so England or English means land or people of the bull or unicorn or in other words the land and people of Ephraim.  so Manasseh had two symbols the arrow bow or crossbow and the diagonal sideways cross.  the arrows are again Jacob's blessing of Joseph overcoming everything to eventually rise up.  the cross is the same cross where Jacob crossed his arms when he blessed his two grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh.  He swapped the blessings making Ephraim the first and Manasseh the second to come later.  The arrow symbols appear a lot in conjunction with lions and eagles, but most notably upon the United States coat of arms.  The diagonal cross of course is tied in with Ireland and Scotland.  it appeared on the union jack and then the early confederate flag with the 13 stars but also going back to the old anglo-saxon kingdoms such as mercia.  it had a diagonal cross as well.  so manasseh had the second birthright.  again he was promised a double portion just like Ephraim and to become a single great nation.  That meant that after the British Empire, we'd expect to see a single great prosperous nation, greater than any other European nation.  I wonder who that could be.  Lastly, Benjamin, he had just one symbol, the wolf.  Now this is the prophecy that Benjamin would be a wolf and divide the spoils.  The wolf symbol appears on the capital city of Norway's Oslo's coat of arms and quite a lot of surnames do have wolves upon them.  It should be noted that all the apostles except Judas Iscariot were of the tribe of Benjamin.  Even including Paul of Tarsus, as Christ said he chose them all.  Another prophecy was that Benjamin would be a light to Judah.  As the apostles awakened their brethren, they spread the gospel amongst many of the Judahites and traveled to the lost tribes, originally just Judah.  The apostle Paul first only traveled to European colonies with descendants of Judah.  and then to the other lost tribes of Israel all over Europe.  Eventually the gospel spread reaching the Germanic tribes that were the deported tribes from Assyria and from there Christianity kept spreading amongst the lost tribes.  So overall as you can see we the Europeans have the Israelite symbols everywhere.  we inherited them from our ancestors.  they are all spread out in all our nations and many of our nations even fit the prophecies.  exactly this is because we are the children of jacob and his twelve sons the patriarchs.  we are the same people as the old testament.  all the promises that god made were for us for our people forever.  We are now entering a time where we as a whole will finally wake up and realize the truth of who we are.  Visit truthvids.net for more information and videos.  We're in the endgame now, the time of Jacob's trouble.  So wake up and start spreading the truth for your people.","channel.id":"clxmi0mkw0121cdviprmvy4pp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","channel.name":"TruthVids","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVAyptfys-UmOQ2qarn1fQod4Buiqcki0hctHTY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker explores the connection between European symbols, heraldry, and coat of arms and the 12 tribes of Israel.

Known as the City of London, it was established a few years after the Roman invasion in 50 AD on the north bank of the River Thames.  William the Conqueror gave sovereign status to the City of Londoners in 1694, allowing them to continue enjoying separate rights and privileges as long as they recognised him as king.  The kings that succeeded William built a new capital and called it Westminster.  Westminster then joined up with surrounding towns and villages and became the bustling metropolis that we know as London today.  Since then, however, the City of London, one square mile in the heart of London, has remained semi-independent.  While it's not an independent nation like the Vatican, laws passed by the British Parliament do not in fact apply to the City of London.  The city in fact elects its own mayor, who negotiates both with the British state and overseas heads of state, and is supported by a committee of so-called aldermen, nearly all of whom are representatives of financial firms located in the city.  The Lord Mayor, the Committee of Aldermen and the entire political structure of the city are unashamedly the representatives of corporate financial interests.  The City of London is effectively a state run by international financial elites in their own interest, and has become the centre of an international web of power spun by these elites.  How did this happen?  Well, in the 18th century London succeeded Amsterdam as the centre of international finance, and in the 19th century the British Empire became the dominant force in the world, to the point that by the middle of the century half of all of the world's manufacturing was based in Britain.  This led to the rise of the City of London as the centre of international finance and trade.  A huge number of foreign-born merchants moved their business to London by the middle of the 18th century.  These merchants established guilds and wielded great influence and power.  They were able to secure autonomy and special freedoms and rights for the residents that businesses in the area enjoy to this day.  This group of alien residents included the Dutch Jews who came over as London succeeded Amsterdam as a centre for international exchanges, and played a major role in London banking and insurance, and as investors in government stocks.  A number of other merchant families migrated to London in this period.  The cities from which they were drawn, principally Frankfurt, Hamburg and Constantinople, were international trading ports.  Their prosperity was derived from their location at the focus of a mosaic of small states and at the meeting point of different ethnic and religious traditions.  so that over the centuries each evolved an elite of mercantile families drawn from various races and creeds.  Their situation then was broadly favourable to the development of an aristocracy of international financiers, with no loyalty to any nation or project beyond their own enrichment and power.  As the British Empire became an empire on which the sun never set, in the City of London there emerged all sorts of middle and small sized commercial institutions that were really specialists on different countries.  And this became the bedrock of the city's success, highly specialised knowledge of various areas in the world.  After the Second World War, the British Empire began to withdraw from its former colonies, to the point that by the 1980s the largest empire the world had ever seen shrank down to contain just remnants and debris, including the United Kingdom, three adjacent Crown Territories, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and dependent overseas territories which included some small Caribbean islands, the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.  But the remarkable fact about the British Empire is that while it disappeared completely from most contemporary maps of the world, it never went away on one map, the map of contemporary international finance.  On the face of it, New York is the largest international financial centre, followed by London.  But this data treats British jurisdictions like Jersey, Guernsey, the Cayman Islands and so on as entirely separate, independent territories.  they are in fact part of the British state.  If added together, you find that roughly one-third of all international deposits and investments are going through these jurisdictions, which are remnants of the British Empire and which remain part of the British state.  And if you add ex-colonies whose independence was relatively recent, like Singapore, then you reach a figure of 40%, that compared to roughly 10% going through the US.  To understand how this new British empire, the colossal financial empire, formed, we have to go back to 1956, the Suez Canal crisis.  This was a time when Britain's global dominance was in steep decline.  Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal Company and took control of the canal, displacing the international consortium that had run it for nearly a century.  France, Israel and the United Kingdom almost immediately began planning a joint military action to retake control, while seeking to win international support for a diplomatic solution.  Israel invaded the Sinai and France and the United Kingdom used Egypt's counterattack as an excuse to attack it by air.  One week later, however, Britain undercut the operation by accepting a United Nations resolution for a ceasefire, primarily due to intense pressure from the US.  This has come to be seen as Britain's last throw of the imperial dice, and led to a political crisis that eventually led to the resignation of its Prime Minister, Anthony Eden.  More significantly though, the Suez was also a financial crisis.  Throughout 1956 and 57, the United Kingdom had a current account surplus despite the disruptions to its international trade, but the value of its currency came under speculative pressure.  The currency crisis was partly engineered by the US, which was unhappy about the British role in the invasion.  In response to the run on the pound, the Treasury raised interest rates and imposed a moratorium on lending to non-British borrowers.  These policies were intended to strengthen the pound, but it cut many commercial banks, which specialised in lending to ex-colonies or the informal empire of Latin America, off from their business.  Many city banks, which had evolved over more than a century as specialists in international lending to British imperial outposts, saw their core business disappear overnight.  At this point, representatives of the city banks approached the Governor of the Bank of England.  Without consulting the British Treasury, the Bank of England decided that they could continue lending as long as they used dollars or other non-sterling currency, and intermediated between non-British clients.  The agreement meant that such transactions were deemed by the bank not to be taking place in London.  This liberated them from the regulatory regime not only of the UK, but of any country.  As these transactions were taking place in London, they could not be regulated by any other regulatory authority, and ended up therefore in a regulatory vacuum.  This led to the growth of what is called the Euromarket, or as we know it, the offshore financial market.  This is the origin of the now well-known practice of offshoring.  Today, almost the entire wholesale global financial market is effectively an expansion of the Euro-market, offshore and mostly subject to voluntary regulation.  American banks, increasingly constrained by a series of New Deal financial legislation, discovered the opportunities that London offered them to escape their own financial regulations and began to set up branches in London specialising in Euro-market operations.  However, despite London's lax financial regulation, it still had relatively high tax rates.  So London financiers began to develop British islands as offshore financial enclaves for tax purposes.  The financial elite followed a clear geographical path, beginning from those islands nearest to the UK, such as the Channel Islands, soon followed by the British-held Caribbean jurisdictions, then Asia and lastly British-held Pacific Islands.  Within a decade, a complex web of offshoring had developed that was effectively an extension of the City of London.  The result today is a London-centred, integrated global financial centre that covers all of the major time zones, tries on lack of regulation and taxation, is a specialist in incorporeal and increasingly risk assets, and uses English common law which encourages so-called financial innovation.  So the British Empire, in fact, never really went away.  While independence has been granted to former British colonies, the London financial elite, who always profited most from empire, responded to the decline of empire by using backroom deals and their political influence to create a new, financial empire which spans the globe and grants them more power than ever.  Due to offshoring, some calculate that as much as half of the world's wealth is now hidden in these so-called treasure islands, totally untaxed.  While the means of their influence has changed, the same class of super-rich, unaccountable financial elite of the City of London continues to dominate the globe financially.","channel.id":"clxmi0nny01tecdvi8ps3cteu","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCGe8kzr_18FIOzjkmzGzzuA","channel.name":"Keith Woods","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/Jyv3LE8oiaGC6Ao0M-rtBOQG5Pz3HKdg4Tb_YLYyYl9e--8tFqlPMmMCK93HmzAhGHydGPu1=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The City of London is a unique entity, a city within a city, with its own mayor and laws separate from the rest of the UK.

We learned of this tragic news during the garage party today, and we dedicate that episode to Simon's memory.  He leaves behind, as far as we know, a wife and a lovely daughter whom he told us with deep love and pride that he had recently reestablished a connection with her and he was helping her to go free. Heard you mention recently that six months ago, your daughter was what you call a default leftist.  And we'll talk a little bit about that in a few minutes.  And six months later today, she's talking about things like repatriation.  So how did you get her from point A to point B?  Give us some tips. Let me just say before Simon answers this question, because what I observed at the Patriotic Alternative Conference, where he was put up on a big screen and he spoke to all of us as a speaker, will absolutely play into the answer that he is about to give, because he is a master of sharing the truth of white well-being and bringing people over to going free.  He obviously did this with his daughter.  He did this with a great many.  He has an erudite mind.  He is level-headed, if you will, when he speaks, and very enjoyable.  Everybody loved Simon when he spoke at the conference.  And, I mean, the fact that he wasn't actually physically present, but he was just digitally present.  He was visually plastered up on the screen, and yet it was still enough.  for everybody to be enthralled by what he had to say.  Everybody was, including myself, on the edge of our seats as we listened to the information that he had to share.  So it is a great pleasure to have been able to, in a way, share a lectern with Simon, even though it was digitally, thanks to the white man's technology.  So it's great to have you here.  And let's go ahead and hear your answer about your daughter now. No pressure, Simon. Jason, thanks.  I mean, yeah, I mean, you're going to make me blush now.  Yeah, I suppose I need to be give some people some contact context.  I went through a very unpleasant separation about eight and a half years ago.  And as a result of that, I was kind of forcibly separated from, well, I'm not going to go into the details of this, but I was unable to see my daughter for about eight years.  And we finally made contact again in November.  And yeah, to be perfectly honest, this is something you haven't asked me, but being back in touch with her, it gives me much greater motives to be involved in this fight.  She was always there.  She was always with me, even when we weren't in contact, but having her so close and seeing her so frequently and having this wonderful relationship back again, My investment in the future hits me in the face all the time.  So it convinces me that the reason why we do what we do is for love.  And I suppose that's the first answer to the question.  The reason why I changed her is because I love her and she loves me and she hadn't seen me for a long time.  So she hadn't been subject to my gentle influence, my gentle guidance for all those eight years.  We last saw each other when she was 16 and now she's just turned 25.  So it's a big chunk of life and a big chunk of influence.  And the first day we met, It was exciting and fantastic, and we clicked immediately.  But I kind of realized that there were some political differences.  But I didn't want to upset that first meeting.  So I said to her, I'm going to tell you my real opinions once you know I'm one of the good guys.  And she said, I already know you're one of the good guys, Daddy.  And basically what I did for the next month is \u2013 And I did this with full of love, but we didn't really talk about politics for a month.  She came around most weeks, one night a week after work.  And on Sunday lunch, we have a big Sunday lunch with my wife's family, my new family.  So we have a lot of people around.  So she just became part of things.  And we kind of talked about, again, the whole way of connecting with people is, firstly, I'm a father and she loves me.  Then we talked a lot about Catalan history, how it fits in with the European story.  I talk a lot about identity with people.  Obviously, I was talking to her about how I'm English and I can't be Catalan.  So I can connect with her on this.  And then one night, I don't know what got over me, came into me, but one night she came around after work and I just decided, okay, I am going to go for it big style now.  It just, you know.  But also the important thing is when you have a close relationship and you know somebody's going to come back, then you have a lot more leeway.  Red pilling somebody like that is very different.  Somebody you meet in a bar, it needs to be a red pill in a certain kind of way.  My daughter is my daughter.  She's always going to come back.  She might say, oh, daddy, don't be ridiculous.  But I'm always going to have another chance.  So hit her really hard with this.  And I mean, she was shocked.  And I accompanied her to the bus to get home.  And she was barely speaking to me.  Then on Sunday, she stood me up, stood us up for Sunday lunch without warning.  And, you know, imagine I'd not seen her for eight years.  I thought, have you blown this?  But we kind of maintain WhatsApp contact.  And luckily, the next weekend was her 25th birthday.  And so we organized a little bit of a family party.  And she came and we didn't speak about it again until Christmas, but obviously she thought about it and we didn't touch the subject.  And then we had the kind of Christmas festivities.  And as we were saying before the show, I'm a very enthusiastic cook and I do, we have a nice flat.  My wife is a wonderful host, a lovely sociable person, and I am a good cook.  and a grumpy polemicizer.  And we're a great combination.  Very, very happy.  We've got a symbiotic relationship. After quarantine's over, we're having a dinner party at Simon's. Yeah, yeah.  I mean, come round.  Round our house, everybody knows you can say anything you like.  But I have this.  My daughter, she's very bright, and she knows me.  And she's kind of, watch this.  And then every now and again, I'll kind of draw the, often with a knife in my hand as I'm about to carve something, I'll draw the table together and come up to some kind of conclusion along the lines of, say, the patriotic alternative policy for repatriation.  Okay, this is why we need repatriation.  And this is why it will work and go through a policy statement.  and then get on with the food.  And my daughter had been completely silent for this, except one time.  She looked at me as I started one of these things.  She rolled her eyes at me and she turned to my wife's niece, who is now her new cousin.  It's very a happy situation.  And she said, I know every damn argument he's got.  Isn't he boring?  And both of them laughed as the older people kind of lapped it up.  And then a little bit later, then in January, my wife was away for the weekend, but we had our Sunday dinner anyway.  So she came round and we had a chance for a much longer talk about, I mean, we generally talk about what she's doing, what her life is.  I mean, it's not politics, politics all the time, but we had a whole day on our own together.  And we got onto the subject of relationships.  And she said things like, you know, To be perfectly honest, Daddy, you know, I had never really thought about it before.  But, you know, I wouldn't have a foreign boyfriend anyway.  I'd kind of like an English boy.  I'd like like an English boyfriend because I kind of she thinks it's cool to be.  She likes her English side. I was going to ask.  I was going to ask if she had an interest in her English side. Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, she's really, really pleased to get back in touch with it.  And she also said, yeah, and I kind of agree with repatriation.  It does make sense because Catalonia has to be for the Catalans and we are special.  And I've done it in a very easy way.  But she did say to me that you can be a little bit extreme, though, can't you?  So then I pointed out to her that, okay, the reason why I do this, and I am, because I'm pushing the Overton window.  I don't know if you're familiar, I was a teacher for many years.  I don't know whether you are familiar with Vygotsky's Law of Proximal Development.  Okay, my degree is in psychology as well.  So I studied psychology at university.  And then when I came to teach English, the whole trick with teaching people anything is always set the level just above their competence level.  So that's the same with language.  It's the same with pretty much anything.  And it's the same with radical politics.  So just push it.  And this is what the left does all the time. That's how I got into streaming. Yeah. I felt like I was in over my head at first.  I still do, to be honest. Don't be ridiculous, Jared.  You know you're one of the cracks of this community.  That's basically the story, and that's what I do.  So I red-pilled my daughter and quite a lot of people.  There was a beautiful moment, actually, where quite a right-wing woman looked at me after one of my diatribes, which my daughter was groaning at.  And she said this in Spanish.  She said, Simon, you love England.  You love Catalonia.  You love Spain.  You're a good man.  And it's one of those things where, you know, the message, it isn't a message of hate.  It's because a lot of the time I'm talking about what we've got, why it's worth defending, why I love it.  Why am I here?  You know, I often say to them, look, I love this place as much as you do, because I've made a positive choice to come from a country where I love and live here.  I've got I'm just as motivated as you for it not to be destroyed because I've made a conscious choice that I love it.  And I've fallen in love with it in the process.  And, you know, these are the kind of conversations we have.  And they all very, very easily lead in to red pilling moments. Does your daughter watch what you do?  Might she be watching this stream ever? I doubt it.  I tell her, she asked me, how long is the show?  And when I say an hour and a half, she said, Daddy, you must be joking.  I'm not going to watch that.  I think she did. Tell her we make 10-minute clips, too. Okay, I'll send her some of those.  I might send her this because I've not told her story live before, so she might be quite pleased to hear this. In the words of the work we are currently doing, Promethean hails, Simon.  We will meet again beyond the western sunrise. But I didn't want to upset that first meeting.  So I said to her, I'm going to tell you my real opinions once you know I'm one of the good guys.  And she said, I already know you're one of the good guys, daddy.","channel.id":"clxmi0qxr044kcdvizhkl4gln","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCkY8CvV8WQFe87CZGmvuYHA","channel.name":"No White Guilt","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/0YucuojQg3vL5zFivzXCv6DZwmxOWS1QLEN9RRXD5xhaL5BObtCr6MqcnGGuopcNPp2ndmsvyM8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Jason and Jerry George are postponing their show \"Tap\" to next Saturday to celebrate the official launch of \"Prometheus Rising.\" They dedicate the episode to Simon Harris, who recently passed away.

Angela Merkel declared that the results of a democratic election are quote, bad for democracy, and she is publicly demanding a new election.  So, if you have been watching, I made a bunch of videos on the three state elections held in the former East Germany last fall.  The conservative party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, or AfD, was the big winner overall.  and by the way today is the seventh anniversary of the founding of the afd so i don't want to rehash everything.  the afd came in second place in all three elections.  in saxony and brandenburg People actually crossed party lines to prevent the AFD from coming in first place.  In Thuringia, the former East German Communist Party, Die Linke, was in power.  They came in first place while the AFD took second and the CDU took third.  Meanwhile, the Free Democratic Party, or FDP, which previously had no seats in Thuringia, made the 5% threshold by less than a dozen votes.  Well, the media and the political elites had already declared that the CDU and the FDP were to never cooperate with the AFD.  In fact, they were not even supposed to have conversations with AFD politicians.  Even talking on the phone with an AFD politician would taint them.  In Saxony, the CDU and the AFD collectively won a big majority, yet the CDU formed a coalition with the far-left Green Party.  It is going very badly.  I have already made a video about it.  It has further damaged the reputation of the entire CDU.  Well, there were CDU politicians in Thuringia that did not want to further self-destruct their own party.  So, yesterday it was announced that the CDU, FDP, and the AFD collectively voted to make Thomas Kemmerich of FDP the new Prime Minister of Thuringia.  Die Linke leader Susanne Hennig-Wilsau was supposed to present Kemmerich with a wreath to show respect for the democratic process.  Instead, she hurled the wreath at his feet and stormed away.  This was the start of a nationwide frenzy.  Major, allegedly mainstream German media outlets openly called the AfD Nazis and fascists.  It used to be that in Germany and many other European countries, you could not just casually call someone Nazi simply because you didn't like them.  You could get into serious legal trouble for defamation.  However, that is completely broken down in Germany and courts have refused to protect the AFD against slander and libel.  In fact, Guy Verhofstadt, a man considered to be a top leader of the European Union, actually tweeted a picture comparing an AFD leader to Hitler.  And by the way, Guy Verhofstadt just called for mass censorship on YouTube today.  claiming that YouTube was undermining democracy, Christian Lindner, the head of the FDP, rushed to Thuringia to ask Thomas Kemmerich to step down.  Meanwhile, Angela Merkel was in South Africa.  She expressed outrage and said it was, quote, a bad day for democracy.  She said it was, quote, unforgivable that members of the FDP, as well as her own party, were cooperating with the AFD.  She made a public plea for a new election in Thuringia.  Well, today, Kemmerich resigned.  I think he was prime minister of Thuringia for less than 24 hours.  The media and the elites successfully overturned the democratic process through intimidation.  AFD leader Tino Chrupalla declared that it was, quote, a sad day for democracy.  The behavior and rhetoric of Guy Verhofstadt, Angela Merkel, Christian Lindner, and the media is shameless, tasteless, and a total affront to democracy.  One of the most fundamental basic tenets of democracy is that you have to agree to work with people you don't agree with.  If you demand that one party be quarantined and no one even allowed to speak to them, that means you do not actually support democracy.  We are seeing a rapid merging.  of the CDU and the FDP with the left, it is becoming AFD versus an anti-democratic authoritarian uniparty.  Now, Kimmerich has just also called for an election redo.  I think Christian Lindner is going to do the same thing.  I fail to see the logic here.  What does the CDU and the FDP hope to gain in an election redo in Thuringia?  The FDP barely won any seats.  I can't imagine the FDP keeping those seats.  It makes no sense.  It seems like the CDU and the FDP would just hemorrhage more voters to the AFD.  In fact, to me it seems like the CDU could actually split and lose people in two different directions.  They could lose voters on the right to the AFD and voters on the left to the SPD.  Now, when the election results originally came out, it was a big surprise that the FDP even made the 5% minimum threshold.  I saw a lot of people talking about this on Twitter and claiming that the FDP voters were ex-CDU voters who were really closet AFD supporters.  In other words, they were people who couldn't stomach voting for the CDU again, but they were too intimidated by the media hysteria to cast a vote for the AFD.  People spoke of the FDP vote as a sort of transitional vote by people who were in the process of switching from CDU to AFD.  I hope Merkel gets the election redo she is calling for.  I honestly think it's going to blow up in her face big time.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.  Click the like button, post a comment below and tell me what you think about this.

When were white people invented?  I mean look, another day, another indignity for the straight white man.  Here's the thing about reverse racism, it's a figment, it's a phantom.  It's summoned up by white people who think that talking about race is the same thing as perpetuating racism.  Maybe it's because whiteness as it is now is not something active or propositional.  It is the blank space against which everything else is defined. much of the public, much of the electorate has the same kind of opinions that you'd find amongst your slightly racist, pissed-up uncle who'd rather not speak to at Christmas family get-togethers. So what else did we learn today?  Oh, we learned that it is possible to be incredibly xenophobic and, let's not beat about the bush, incredibly racist.  Hello, welcome to this week's edition of Novara FM on Resonance 104.4.  Today we'll be discussing the invention of whiteness.  How can we locate the origins of whiteness as an identity, as the apex of a system of racial domination, as a set of cultural markers in various points in history?  Let's think about what happens when we racialize the working class as white.  Specifically, let's think about what whiteness is doing here.  I mean, that's the thing is that whiteness has to be read retrospectively.  We'll be talking about how whiteness can be defined and why this particular statement of an essentialized characteristic of human nature emerged as a method of social control. I've often talked about demographic changes, right?  It's going to be a minority-majority country sometime in the 2050s, 2060s, right? The problem is that this so easily turns into the hatred of the West, which, of course, Corbyn exemplifies.  Corbyn and his branch of the left fundamentally hate Britain, hate Britain's allies. Wait, wait, wait.  They do.  They do.  This is absolute nonsense. On the contrary, the evidence is overwhelming.  Give me some evidence that I'm wrong. It's the most British thing on the planet, which is like, racism's bad, but you know what?  I'm absolutely gasping for a cuppa.  What we have failed to do is unpick and dismantle this formulation of the white working class. But, I mean, these white people going on about, you know, like, how can it be that the original Britain is a black man? Professing that you don't see colour merely invisibilises injustice.  If I were to ask myself this question, when were white people invented?  I would probably cop out and say it was at multiple points in history.  And what we see in terms of whiteness is not a unified blank, but actually a composite of different processes of racialisation.  What we fail to do is look at how class is inherently racialised.  When were white people invented?  I have no idea.  OK, all right, I can give you some evidence.  The other week I was at a talk where Jeremy Cook... Anecdotes are a form of evidence, Professor Starkey. Are they?  Oh, are they really?  Yes, they are.  Now, isn't that fascinating?  I thought you were an academic. These over-60s, you know, who are they?  They would like to see a return of the Empire.  They have no problem with Britain's colonial past.  We know that. Oh, say a couple of things that don't really mean any harm.  Buy a cup of tea and a bit of cricket, or let's go colonise something. We're full up.  We can't take no more.  We're small islands.  Well, if you didn't understand that, by the way, there'll be subtitles. Pushing a culture wars narrative that the left is intent on demonising straight white men is becoming more and more central to conservative communication strategy.  Whiteness as a composite, so rather a single process of racialisation against a single tangible racial other.  One of the things that I found really interesting was that when white people were confronted with the increase in incidences of racist street harassment, they were really casual about it.  The real beef is the idea that white people might not be welcome in all spaces.  But rather than talking about whiteness as something tangible, framed it as a set of interactions they had with various racial others at different points in history.  But communism is back, baby, and it's back because Ash Sarkar I understand that lots of white people feel annoyed by the idea that they benefit somehow from their whiteness or that the presence of white people automatically means the presence of racism.  I really understand that.  But with all love and all kindness, this really isn't about you.  whiteness is what matters.  white people and everyone else white people on the basis of their race will never be discriminated against indicate an anxiety that whiteness being outnumbered is under attack by ever increasing numbers of people of color whose very existence is threatening Minority, majority, what does that mean? It means that whites will be an ethnic minority. And what, like ethnic minorities were treated badly in this country or something?  For me, the metaphor that I find useful for thinking about whiteness as a composite is Isaac Newton's 18th century experiments with light.  And at the time, the scientific consensus was that white was the purest form of light.  It wasn't made up of anything else.  And through his use of prisms, he found out that actually it was a composite of every single color of the spectrum.  That's the way I like to think of whiteness.

The Silver Swan was crafted by James Cox in London in 1773.  It is a life-size clockwork automation that imitates the behaviour of a real swan.  Cox was a showman and dealer, and the swan appeared in his mechanical museum in 1774.  It is the finest example of an automaton in the United Kingdom, and one of only two of its importance and size in the world.  The mechanism is clockwork of the finest quality and was designed by the celebrated inventor John Joseph Merlin.  This clockwork-driven device has inside a music box which, when fully wound, plays as the glass rods rotate, giving the illusion of flowing water.  The swan turns its head from side to side and also preens itself.  After a few moments, the swan notices the swimming fish and bends down to catch and eat one.  This graceful silver automaton was exhibited at the 1867 World's Fair, where the admission sum cost an enormous five shillings.  It was there in Paris that Mark Twain saw the piece and later wrote, I watched the silver swan, which had a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes, watched him swimming about as comfortably and unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of a jeweller's shop.  Others called it a magic wrought by Merlin himself.  It has more than 2000 moving parts, including 139 crystal rods and 113 rings in the neck alone.  it is said that there was originally a waterfall behind the swan, which was stolen whilst being exhibited in Paris.  The nuts and bolts, levers and cogwheels have for almost 250 years powered this life-size silver swan to play music and catch a golden fish out of a crystal stream.  At last it was purchased by the antiques dealer John Bowes, and it now sits pride of place in the Bowes Museum in the northeast of England, where every afternoon at two o'clock it comes to life.  The swan is as close to perfection as you're going to get.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The Silver Swan is a life-size clockwork automation created by James Cox in 1773.

What I have for you today is a quick dot joining exercise because a lot of people are getting very alarmed about Donald Trump's seemingly odd behaviour, wanting to use the military to vaccinate people in America.  I think that's a wrong conclusion.  I'm going to point out to you a couple of things.  to the effect that it is a ruse.  He absolutely needs to declare another state of emergency around Christmas time because the earliest one from the previous one, 21st December last year, do you remember that executive order for human trafficking, pedophilia and money laundering?  He was going after the deep state.  It's running out around Christmas time and that's why he's horrified Dr Fauci by saying a vaccine will be delivered by the military at Christmas time.  The lack of the vaccine available at that time will be the reason to declare a continuing state of emergency.  Now, why is there a need for a continued state of emergency for 18 months?  Well, the answer is the Obama administration is finally facing serious indictment for crimes as high as treason.  And a very current activist judge, one Emmett Sullivan, has proven that the Obama administration will never get a fair trial on the mainland of America.  So it is in fact Gitmo where it has to be done with military judges.  That's the gist of it.  The business about vaccines and Donald Trump going from house to house with squads of soldiers, vaccinating everyone, holding them down, make sure they get it in the neck and everything.  That's not going to happen because Donald Trump is not really a vaccine fanatic at all.  He's cautiously pro-vaccine because he has a son, Barron, who may have suffered some vaccine damage.  Donald Trump is a bit suspicious of some vaccines and Dr.  Judy Mikovits is hopefully going to tell us soon in the American Senate.  So I think that's really the plan.  When there's no vaccine, it's going to be another emergency around Christmas time.  And that's the anniversary of the first date of emergency.  December 21, 22, 23, it might happen or just before that.  And I really think it's triggered by this Emmet Sullivan, the activist judge, who will not allow natural justice to occur.  And there seems to be almost no way to stop activist judges in America upsetting the simplest courses of natural justice.  But that's my explanation.  I don't think we should get too concerned about Donald Trump putting vaccines and the military together, end of the year, that sort of thing.  I think it's just a ruse to justify a new state of emergency beginning around Christmas time this year.  So that leaves only Justin Trudeau, who's just proving that he really is the son of Fidel Castro, admiring all things totalitarian and communistic, he wants to bring the Chinese military into Canada to test their vaccines on Canadians.  Well, they've got a very bad track record testing on Chinese people, have the Chinese military.  There are many, many vaccine-damaged reports from China, you can see mothers wailing about it.  They get nothing, no compensation, no hospital care, nothing for their brain damaged children.  There's many, many cases of it.  I've seen the videos.  But that's all I have to tell you now.  And it's basically, don't be too alarmed about Donald Trump's putting the words vaccine and military in the same paragraph when he's talking, because I think it's really just a ruse.  That's all it is to justify a new state of emergency for the next 12 months when Christmas comes around again.  So that's all we have today, gang.

The article says something completely different to what has actually occurred, whether it be the very fine people myth with Donald Trump or articles I've read about myself where I can't even recognize the person they are writing about.  Now, I kind of thought this would be a bipartisan take.  Doesn't matter if it's not saying right wing media, it's not saying left wing media.  It's just giving kids the tools to know.  Don't believe every headline you read.  Think about it a little more, question it, search for the evidence.  But no, of course not.  I had an incredible reaction from some folks who decided to say this was indoctrination, that they can't believe.  I'm dragging children into politics and trying to make them distrust the media.  This is absolutely horrible.  And one person even said that any parent who buys my book and reads it to their child should be investigated by the state and have their kids taken away from them by Child Protective Services.  a super normal and not radical communist response to a children's book whatsoever.  Seriously though, I want to talk about this for a second because Firstly, telling kids not to believe everything they read is quite literally the opposite of indoctrination.  But there is this idea going around that parents should just stand back and not have any input in their children's thoughts, ideologies, and the way that they see the world.  Otherwise, you're indoctrinating your kids and forcing your view on them.  This is absurd.  There are people all over the world in media, government, schooling, everywhere that want to sell your kids some sort of idea that want to bring your child into their cult, into their ideology, whatever it may be.  And they are going to try to get your kid in every way possible.  And if you as a parent stand back and don't parent and don't teach your kid critical thinking skills, or different perspectives on the world, well, someone else is gonna teach your kid for you.  If you don't raise your child, someone else will do it for you.  And it'll probably be the state, it'll probably be the education system, it'll probably be celebrities.  The idea that if a kid isn't influenced by their parents, they're somehow just gonna go on and critically find their way in the world is absurd.  Children are influenced by everything around them.  I just got a call from my parents the other day who said, they're they had basically an emergency church meeting when a bunch of the kids came home from school and started telling their parents they couldn't believe and this is a canadian school a canadian public school they couldn't believe that black people were being murdered indiscriminately by the united states government that there was basically a genocide of black people going on in the u.s.  and all these parents are like what are my kids learning in school?  they keep coming home and getting new lessons about, I mean, there are kids that are now questioning their gender identity in elementary school, kids who think their parents are white supremacists just because they are a Christian conservative family or not even that political.  I mean, their kids are just coming home with bizarre ideas about the world and with extremely progressive slant to the politics.  So them just stepping back and saying nothing just means that the teacher in the school with whatever their politics is, is going to implement their views on the child.  And I'm not saying tell your kids, be a conservative like me or be a liberal like me.  You have to have my values.  There are phenomenal ways of raising your kid to be a critical thinker.  When I was younger, my father never imposed his beliefs on me.  I would come home from school and I would tell him I learned XYZ in school today.  And he'd say, that's interesting.  Have you ever considered this view though?  And he would offer me counter perspectives and he would offer me books and articles that challenged the things I learned in a classroom.  If I read Naomi Klein in the class, I'd come home and he'd give me a book by Andrew Breitbart and say, that's great, consider this as well.  So I got to sit and make up my own mind about what I thought was the better ideology.  And you know, my parents didn't leave me to just decide how I wanted to, what I thought morality was.  In fact, every fairy tale we read growing up, most of them have some sort of important life lesson, whether it be Pinocchio, which is not lying, Peter Pan, you have to grow up at some point, lots of lessons.  And my parents would tell me, you know, don't steal, don't lie, try to be kind, try to be honest.  These are good life lessons.  Same with this, question headlines that you read.  This shouldn't be a partisan take.  These are just lessons that you need to talk to your kids about.  And I'm just so disturbed by this pushing of the idea parents shouldn't be parenting.  So if you are a parent and you are interested in offering some alternative views to your child, you can get Henry the Sheepdog on Amazon right now.  It's just a really nice illustrated story.  Kind of think Roald Dahl reading comprehension, elementary school, seven to 11.  The story is about a sheepdog who gets an unfortunate photo taken of him by a journalist where the journalist couldn't see the whole picture.  He couldn't see that he was defending his friend from a bear.  So all he got was this terrifying photo of his face where he's growling and barking.  And the journalist goes back to town and tells everyone in the town that there's a wolf coming and they all form an anti-wolf mob and they refuse to believe Basil, his friend and the sheepdog, but he's not a wolf.  Eventually at the end, he saves the journalists from the bear and they still won't tell the truth because they're journalists and they don't want to ruin their reputation, but luckily a little new press of hamster pups decides to publish the story when they were hiding in a tree and got the pictures themselves.  so it's a really cute story.  it kind of teaches all the different angles teaches that you know sometimes journalists aren't always lying and they just get a story wrong they see the wrong angle and sometimes they are and they're just trying to save their reputation and their paper and make money.  so it teaches all the different ways that journalists can spin things and why they do what they do when they get it wrong and that there are good people there are press that are trying to bring truth as well.  so if you're interested in that find it on amazon.com.  And I know a lot of the rest of you are probably like, Lauren, I don't care about a children's book.  Where is Crossfire?  You said it would be out weeks ago.  I know.  Bear with me.  Scooter and I are just putting some last finishing touches.  We did a rough screening in Sydney and it went fantastic.  People are loving it.  But we still, there are things that we can perfect to make it better.  And I'd rather it come out a little later than us not do these little changes here and there.  So That should be out in about a week or so.  I promise, this time I'm serious.  Stay tuned, a week or two, Crossfire will absolutely have dropped, and I know you guys are gonna love it.  So I'm excited to see you then, and thank you for watching my little rant.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I recently released a children's book called \"Henry the Sheepdog and the Wolf of Mossville\" that teaches kids to question the media and not believe everything they read.

I decided against making a video about the coronavirus today because I feel like it's all that anybody's been talking about since January and I assume that, like me, many of you feel a bit burnt out and would prefer some variety.  If I'm wrong in assuming that though, please do let me know and I'll try to make some videos about it in the future.  For the moment, though, I will just say that the most recent update here in Austria is that the lockdown is starting to lift.  Since Monday, the Austrian government has started to slowly reopen the economy, making them one of the first countries in the entire world to do so.  So I will be sure to let you know how it goes.  Anyway, for today's video, we're going to talk about something completely unrelated.  I'm sure that many of you are probably familiar with the viral story from I think it was December of 2019, about a polyamorous relationship that consisted of one woman and four different men.  The woman had gotten pregnant by one of the men, and apparently the whole group had agreed upon raising the baby together.  At the time, the story was promoted by a variety of mainstream media outlets, from the New York Post to The Sun to Mail Online to Metro.  And now, several months later, it's recently been revealed that one of the men in this relationship has been charged with aggravated child abuse because he fractured the baby's arm, leg, ribs, and skull when it was just five weeks old.  Thankfully, the baby will not suffer any permanent damage and is expected to make a full recovery.  Now, I am certainly not claiming that all polyamorous relationships are destined to inevitably end in abuse.  I am not saying that at all, although I do personally oppose polyamorous relationships on moral grounds and I don't really understand how such a relationship could possibly be genuine or healthy.  It's more about why, particularly in the media and on social media platforms like Twitter, for example, you seem to have this bizarre fascination with inverting fundamental and healthy societal norms and then presenting this inversion as a positive thing.  You have heaps of praise for polyamorous relationships.  You have praise for girls prostituting themselves on OnlyFans.  And just as a quick side note, due to the coronavirus, OnlyFans has apparently seen a 75% increase in signups.  with more than 170,000 new users each day.  Patreon reported 50,000 new creators in March, its fastest ever rate of growth.  You also have the consistent devaluation of fatherhood and relentless criticism of men in general.  You have criticism of the nuclear family and stay-at-home moms.  You even have criticism of people who choose to have children.  In contrast to the reaction to the polyamorous relationship that I mentioned in the beginning of this video, look at the reaction to this admittedly dorky, but overall normal photo of a mother posing in matching outfits with her children.  Really dark in such a layered way, I can't fully wrap my head around it.  So much to unpack, but seemingly willfully having four children in 2020 is always so dark to me.  This is what Hitler wanted.  It's a white supremacy wet dream.  In response to these comments, one woman made an excellent point.  please tell me if this was a beautiful black woman with gorgeous healthy looking children in a nice clean house.  believe me there are many of my sisters who are that blessed.  will people still describe the picture as dark?  someone even went so far as to accuse the mother of tying the children together by a cord when you can clearly see in the photo that the cord is behind them and it's a treadmill cord plugged into the wall.  and last but not least my personal favorite You innately understand that the mom is trying to create her idea of a perfect family by grooming, controlling the children to be exactly what she wants them to be, which will have devastating psychological effects on them as they grow up.  You know pain is coming to this family.  To react to a dorky but perfectly normal photo with such twisted accusations and animosity does far more in revealing the darkness of the person who posted this comment than anything else.  In fact, if you look at the Twitter account of the woman who initially criticized the photo of the mother and her children, the woman's timeline is chock full of tweets talking about how depressed and unhappy she is.  It's already been said a thousand times before, but there really is truth to the claim that this push to invert fundamental societal norms is coming as a result of indoctrination from the mainstream media, the education system, Hollywood, etc.  Indoctrination to hate the nuclear family, monogamy, masculinity, and even the notion of acquiring success based on merit as opposed to what ethnicity you are or what sexual orientation you identify with or whether you're a man or a woman.  It's a concerted effort to destroy natural order, which in turn is going to destroy our society.  But this, of course, we can never let them do.  If there's any silver lining at all to this whole coronavirus lockdown, perhaps it's that we've been given a rare opportunity to rediscover the importance of family.  Or if you don't have a family, then of finding a close unit of friends or perhaps getting married and starting a family of your own.  Because given how disastrously many of the world governments have handled the coronavirus outbreak, it's become more apparent than ever that they're unreliable and that we as citizens aren't always the highest priority.  In the end, family and friends are really all we have.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.  I really hope you enjoyed and I'll see you all soon.","channel.id":"clxmi0ohw02ehcdvi3iglu7wl","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCesrUK_dMDBZAf7cnjQPdgQ","channel.name":"Brittany Sellner","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AT","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU5TvTw9o5vWAhQPsDHzc8k46cKZHRbE2ECRAqy-Q=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The creator of this video decided not to make a video about the coronavirus, opting instead to discuss a polyamorous relationship that made headlines in 2019.

I cannot believe it.  After a long anticipated wait, Crossfire is finally here.  It is finally out.  Merry Christmas.  Happy new year.  This is your gift from Scooter and I. Now you may be wondering, Lauren, where is it?  I keep refreshing your channel.  I'm not seeing it anywhere.  Yeah.  I loved hosting farmlands here.  I loved hosting borderless on YouTube.  The reason I used YouTube in the first place, despite all of the problems is because people got to see the hype.  They got to see the millions of views.  You could translate it.  It was on a mainstream platform.  So people that I normally wouldn't be able to reach could maybe get it in the recommended bar and watch it.  That was awesome.  Those days are gone.  Well, borderless and farmlands both dealt with very extreme themes.  Crossfire has somehow managed to exceed that.  It's even more controversial than both farmlands and borderless combined, in my opinion.  And I am about a thousand percent confident, maybe a thousand and 1% confident that Crossfire would not last two days on this platform.  not a minute.  It would immediately, of course it wouldn't ever get ads on it in the first place.  Then it would get age restricted almost immediately.  And eventually I absolutely believe it would be taken down after it was hidden and put into sandbox mode and all of that.  I just, I have no doubt in my mind.  Um, Firstly, there's the violence in it, if we just even take away all the political themes altogether.  Anything, I mean, there's videos of shootings, there's videos of people dying, lots of blood in the film, lots of people being beaten up, and that stuff just gets totally censored by YouTube.  And to an extent, I understand, and I also understand why some people will say we don't want too much violence in our movies or our content, but it genuinely felt like For this movie, so many people have been coddled from the realities of crime.  I mean, within our society, we don't even understand what death is.  We are so detached from the actual human condition of violence, death, and pain, and all these very real things.  Their bodies are instantly hidden.  We never see someone when they die.  They're just taken away and cremated.  we are so detached from the realities that happen behind the scenes that cops and emergency workers have to deal with all the time.  And if we really wanted to tell this story, honestly, we had to bring people into that reality.  We have to show them what the consequences of crime in our civilization actually are, because right now people are so coddled from it that they think social workers can actually go and deal with gang bangers, which is, I mean, watch the documentary.  We'll talk about that.  Now, if you actually include the political stuff as well, I mean, we have people like Colin Flaherty who is totally banned from YouTube as is.  He can't even do commentary on this website.  So who knows what would happen if you get to an hour in the documentary and you see his face come up, we'd have plenty of reports on this video.  It would almost immediately be put into exile on the website.  So, As a solution, I have uploaded Crossfire to its own website, which you can find in the link below.  Now, don't you just go scroll down there and find that button and leave.  I'm not done yet.  I need you for one more minute.  As usual, I have put this film out for free.  I want as many people to see it as possible.  The reason I do this is so you can speak to your friends who haven't watched content that questions the mainstream narratives and say, hey, watch this film.  And when they say, no, I'm not paying for that, you can say, no, it's free.  No strings attached.  Just a different opinion.  And yeah, I just want to reach as many people as possible with this content.  But unfortunately, while the film is free, making it is not.  And we still have not paid off the cost of the project.  It was a huge, huge, huge endeavor making this film.  So if you are in a position where you can donate to this project before or after watching, please, please do that.  Obviously, we do not have big Hollywood donors or backers to make our films.  It's literally... just a few people here and there who are willing to give 50 bucks, 100 bucks, five bucks even, and my amazing Subscribestar supporters who make this possible.  I also have just one more request.  It's going to be really hard to bring attention to this film with it not being on YouTube and traditional media.  So if you could just share it as much as possible, share it on Facebook, share it on Twitter, let's try to get that traction that unfortunately, Silicon Valley has largely taken away from dissident projects.  Thank you so much to my amazing director, Scooter Downie, who, well, I couldn't be there in person on the ground to make this movie because of my US ban.  just was able to help me create this vision in ways that I never could have even expected.  He is an incredibly talented individual.  Go send him your praise.  Also, thank you so much to my Subscribestar supporters who have been there every step of the way, believed in me.  I'm sorry the film is late, but I hope you love every second of it.  Anyways, I will see you all soon.  Let me know what you think of the film and happy new year.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The host, Lauren, has finally released her new documentary, Crossfire, after a long wait.

The Wojak meme has been a popular meme among imageboard users since its appearance in the early 2010s.  Wojak, or that feels guy, is a simple Microsoft paint drawing that became a popular way to express melancholy, wistfulness and alienation.  Wojak later transformed into a number of related memes, such as the Weiji, the Coomer and the Doomer.  What these memes had in common was the intended personification of the many pseudo-roles that young men adopt in modernity, and their common emptiness and lack of fulfillment.  Although there is a Coomer Wojak and a Doomer Wojak, there is no corresponding Happy Family Man Wojak or Hero Wojak.  in its original form on internet image boards among young men the wojak was always presented as self-deprecation a jarring presentation of naked sincerity and vulnerability.  in its mass form wojak is beautified and presented in such a way as to exude confidence.  Mass Wojak contains no element of critical self-reflection from its creator.  It excludes it.  In its mass form, Wojak is denied the possibility of the expression which was originally its sole purpose.  Because the products of mass culture are unable to get beyond their own narcissism to any critical self-reflection, their creations are pure form, pure simulacra.  The popularization and subsequent loss of meaning in the Wojak meme is reflective of a more general trend of the massification of innovations from niche male spaces, repackaged and universalized to appeal to a less intelligent, woke, global audience.  In Simulacra and Simulation, Jean Baudrillard claims that postmodern society is characterized by the hyperreal, the blurring of simulation with reality.  In hyperreality, authentic reality and meaning is gradually replaced by sign and symbolism.  Baudrillard in The Consumer Society writes about the transformation of signs in postmodern society by mass communication, a description apt to the massification of the Wojak meme.  Mass communication is everywhere defined by this systematization at the level of the technical medium and the code.  By the systematic production of messages not from the world, but from the medium itself.  We enter here the world of the pseudo-event, of pseudo-history and pseudo-culture.  A world of events, history, culture and ideas not produced from shifting, contradictory, real experience, but produced as artifacts from elements of the code and the technical manipulation of the medium.  It is this and nothing else which defines all signification whatsoever as consumable.  It is this generalization and the substitution of the code for the referential dimension which defines mass media consumption.  The key here is Baudrillard's characterization of mass media consumption as necessitating the substitution of the code for the referent.  In order to understand what Baudrillard was talking about, let's look at the orders of simulacra as he defines them and how they apply to the evolution of the Wojak meme.  The orders of simulacra increase as it becomes less and less possible to trace the origins of the simulations.  For Baudrillard, the first order is the reflection of a profound reality.  In this case, Wojak is a sign to represent the familiar alienation and ennui of young men.  The second stage is perversion of this reality, where we come to believe the sign itself to be an unfaithful copy.  We can arguably see this development in the NPC edit of the Wojak meme.  This is a perversion, an unfaithful copy, as the Wojak himself now becomes the masked man that his original sign defined itself against.  At simulacra, Wojak has now gone beyond the original intent of the creator.  The third stage masks the absence of a profound reality, where the simulacrum pretends to be a faithful copy, but becomes a copy with no original.  The black female Wojak may have vestigial elements of the original, but the original artistic intent is now absent.  The intention is idealisation rather than naked sincerity.  Multiple versions of new Wojaks spring up representing various demographies, still pretending to be faithful Wojaks, but, in Baudrillard's terms, the code has now been substituted for the reference.  The original referent, the meaning of the Wojak meme is absent, only the code or the aesthetic form remains.  And finally we come to the fourth stage.  The fourth stage is pure simulation.  Here signs merely reflect other signs and any claim to reality on the part of any of these images or signs is only of the order of other such claims.  To see what we're talking about, we can see the fourth stage, or pure simulation, when the mass Wojak becomes transformed into hyperrealist cartoons and fanart.  What we're left with is a hyperreal representation of a person, with no connection left to the original Wojak other than a vague genealogical one.  These signs are copies of copies, signifying nothing except their own representation.  What can also be observed in the new Wojak memes is how lacking of any serious political or philosophical content they are.  And this is really another symptom of the massification of culture.  The closest these simulacra ever come to an authentic message is blatant racism against white people and a restatement of the doctrines of political correctness.  And this gets us back to the observation that the left can't meme.  The observation is that the right memes to truth, while the left memes to power.  And as I've observed before, the basis for humour is the shock of being exposed to an intuitive truth against a wall of ideology.  That's why politically correct humour is an oxymoron.  Inserting or assuming complex ideology removes the possibility of humour.  hence humour in a society dominated by the left tends toward the right and in a society built on lies tends toward intuitive but unspoken truths.  men and women are different.  equality is a myth.  modern life is empty deracinated superficial and devoid of purpose.  Wojak captured that truth, but his repackaging by the normies reveals perhaps an even more disturbing truth.  It is a reminder of the system's incredible ability to embrace its own contradictions, thereby co-opting and destroying its own opposition.","channel.id":"clxmi0nny01tecdvi8ps3cteu","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCGe8kzr_18FIOzjkmzGzzuA","channel.name":"Keith Woods","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/Jyv3LE8oiaGC6Ao0M-rtBOQG5Pz3HKdg4Tb_YLYyYl9e--8tFqlPMmMCK93HmzAhGHydGPu1=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The Wojak meme, a simple Microsoft Paint drawing, originated as a representation of melancholy and alienation among young men on imageboards.

He was the founder of the traditionalist school, and the movement is sometimes called Gu\u00e9nonian, although its precepts are considered to be timeless and to be found in all authentic traditions.  It is also known as perennialism, the perennial philosophy, or Sophia Perennis.  The term Philosophia Perennis goes back to the Renaissance, while the Hindu expression Sanatana Dharma has precisely the same signification.  According to the traditionalist school, it is possible to discern a primordial and perennial truth manifested in a variety of religious and spiritual traditions.  Ananda Kumaraswamy explains, The metaphysical philosophy is called perennial because of its eternity, universality, and immutability.  It is Augustine's wisdom uncreate, the same now as it ever was and ever will be.  The religion which, as he also says, only came to be called Christianity after the coming of Christ, and so long as the tradition is transmitted without deviations.  William Stoddart explains, The symbol most often used to convey this idea is that of the uncoloured light, and the many colours of the spectrum which are made visible only when the uncoloured light is refracted.  In the Renaissance, the term betokened the recognition of the fact that the philosophies of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus incontrovertibly expounded the same truth as lay at the heart of Christianity.  Subsequently, the meaning of the term was enlarged to cover the metaphysics and mysticisms of all the great world religions, notably Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam.  So what is the teaching of the Sophia Perennis?  Firstly, that there exists a divine reality underpinning everything, and without this no thing and no one would exist.  God, Brahman, Tao, the Absolute, all terms that point to the one underlying ultimate reality.  Secondly, the divine reality may be directly perceived under certain conditions, through prayer, meditation, near-death experiences, mystic revelation, psychedelic drugs, religious ecstasy, inspired ritual, or super-rational intuition.  Humans possess a dual nature, the little egoic me of day-to-day living and a true self that reflects the divine reality.  And finally, people long to reunite with that divine reality from whence they came, and this is variously called salvation, enlightenment, self-realization, or Buddhahood, and this is ultimately the purpose of all religion and tradition.  Ganon writes that the philosophia perennis is by no means a philosophy, that is to say one particular conception, more or less limited and systematic and having this or that individual as its author, but is rather the common foundation from which proceeds whatever is truly valid in all philosophies.  The designations traditionalist and perennialist are nearly synonymous and are, for all intents and purposes, interchangeable.  All of the major writers in this area wrote of tradition.  By this they meant the entirety of the intellectual, religious, cultural and artistic aspects that tie a people to a revelation or to a sacred origin.  Thus, such an entity as this tradition is itself considered sacred.  All things centered on this tradition, such as civilization, its arts or crafts, doctrines, all can be referred to as traditional.  Traditional is not used by these writers in the modern conservative sense to just designate cultural artifacts passed along from one generation to another by sheer habit.  Instead, it is used to indicate, for example, those civilizations whose ideas, practices, creations and so on are still guided and formed by the attraction and the principles of the domain of the spirit.  People who study tradition are called traditionalists, and all such traditionalists accept the premises of the perennial philosophy.  As Schuon remarks, a nostalgia for the past is in itself nothing.  All that is meaningful is a nostalgia for the sacred, which cannot be situated elsewhere than in the liberating now of God.  The traditional school insists on the necessity for affiliation to one of the normal traditions or great ancient religions of the world.  The regular affiliation to the ordinary life of a believer is crucial, since this could give access to the esotericism of that given religion.  Most traditionalists, such as Ganon himself, found a way in Sufism and embraced Islam.  Ananda Kumaraswamy was a Hindu, while others, such as Wolfgang Smith or James Kutzinger, embraced Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity respectively.  Some, such as Marco Pallas, found a way in Buddhism.  One term that often crops up in the writing of traditionalists is Kali Yuga, or Derkage.  From Hinduism, the traditionalist authors adopted the doctrine of the four yugas, or ages, a teaching they believed had a similar expression in every ancient tradition.  According to the doctrine of the four ages, the real meaning of history is not progress, but increasing involution while the golden age passes by.  Our materialistic era corresponds to the age of iron, the lowest degree before a new cycle.  Our modern way of thinking is a wasteland.  It is in the final stage in the decay of truth, rather than its pinnacle.  History, from this perspective, is a series of steps downward, whereby new religious and esoteric systems are fragments of the truth rather than being new innovations or developments.  We now live in the Kali Yuga of the Hindus, the Iron Age of Hesiod, the Germanic Ragnarok, according to the traditionalist school.  Politically, this age is characterized by the falling away from tradition, the worship of materialism and the generated forms of knowledge like rationalism and scientism, the disappearance of spiritual hierarchy in favor of the doctrine of egalitarianism, and the governing of the materialistic masses through democracy.  In the case of Ganon's traditionalism, there was more than a revival of an old wisdom.  He added to it a conviction that European civilization was in terminal decline, having lost even the memory of those eternal religious truths that are the only basis of genuine civilization.  Ganon and his followers were convinced that these truths could be recovered from surviving non-Western religions, principally Hinduism, A major theme in the work of Ganon is the contrast between traditional worldviews and modernity, which he considered to be an anomaly in the history of mankind.  For Ganon, the physical world was a manifestation of metaphysical principles, which are preserved in the perennial teachings of the world religions, but were lost to the modern world.  For Ganon, the malaise of the modern world lies in its relentless denial of the metaphysical realm.  The quintessential Ganon is to be found in two works which tie together some of his central themes, the crisis of the modern world and his masterpiece, The Reign of Quantity and the Sign of the Times.  Ganon unfolds a startling thesis about the present terrestrial situation in the light of the doctrine of cosmic cycles, whereby humankind is seen to be degenerating into an increasingly solidified and materialized state.  more and more impervious to spiritual influences.  Inversely, the world becomes increasingly susceptible to infernal forces of various kinds.  The forced convergence of different civilizations is the spatial correlate of the temporal unfolding of the present terrestrial cycle, moving towards an inexorable cataclysm.  The best illustration of this concept is found in Ganon's elucidation of quality and quantity.  For Ganon, quality is the epitome of the Age of Gold, when true spiritual experience was found by excelling in one's exploration of self as part of a vital spiritual tradition.  The opposite of this is what is found today, an emphasis on quantity, units and the lowest common denominator.  Instead of emphasising how we can raise levels of education, skill and awareness, we talk about averaging, affirmative action, political correctness and educational adjustments due to minority status.  Quality is embodied in skills, crafts and personal ability.  In a word, achievement.  Quantity is embodied in reducing humanity to numbers, units and a cog in a wheel.  Modern employment, for example, has reduced most jobs to quantity.  Most people can fit into an office or a factory job.  No special skills are warranted or required.  Modern man has become a faceless number or an equation.  And this is the reign of quantity.  Gu\u00e9non's belief in the inevitability of these forces of decay led to a pacifism and disengagement with the day's politics, believing that only the return of the rule of a spiritual elite could reverse the trend.  Political traditionalism was in fact established in the 1930s by an Italian, Baron Julius Evola, on the basis of Nietzsche as well as Ganon.  Evola was less interested in esoteric aspects of the original religion of humanity, which was the main focus of people like Ganon and Schuon, than in other varieties of esotericism, including magic, and in what he saw as the decadence of contemporary Western civilisation.  Although concerned by spiritual and esoteric questions as much as Ganon was, Evola focused not on religious practice but on spiritual values, for example those of medieval chivalry.  He initially hoped to transform Europe through the possibilities that seemed available, notably the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and the SS, though he became critical of both fascism and National Socialism.  penning the book Fascism Viewed from the Right, and his most directly political book, Men Among the Ruins.  Evola died relatively unknown and pessimistic about the hope for change.  His revival started only in the 1980s, but since then he has become one of the most widely read thinkers of the radical right.  If Evola's influence is visible on the radical right, the influence of the traditionalist school remains visible in the field of comparative religion, with prominent religious scholars considering themselves successors to the school, while the ideas of traditionalism are increasingly reaching a receptive audience in the Eastern and Islamic world, which Ganon hoped would be able to resist the materialism of the West.

This truth is considered timeless and universal, and is often referred to as the Sophia Perennis or the Philosophia Perennis. \n\nThe traditionalist school teaches that there exists a divine reality underlying everything, and that humans possess a dual nature, consisting of a little egoic self and a true self that reflects the divine reality. The ultimate purpose of all religion and tradition is to reunite with this divine reality, which is variously called salvation, enlightenment, or self-realization.\n\nTraditionalists believe in the importance of affiliation to one of the great ancient religions of the world, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, or Christianity, in order to access the esotericism of that religion.

That's what they're gonna do. This guy, Konstantin Kaysen, I'm not sure who he is.  What is he?  He's a winner of Jewish Comedian of the Year in Coast of the Triggered Pod.  Centrist Chad.  Here's what he writes.  I'm going to read you this whole thread.  It's very, very important.  He writes, you're going to hate me for writing this.  You're going to resist what I say because you don't want it to be true.  You're going to pretend that I want this to be true, when in fact, there's nothing I hate more than the fact that it has come to this.  Here's what happens next.  If protesters continue to deface monuments like Winston Churchill's statue and burn British flags on the cenotaph, you will see groups forming to defend them.  These groups will be composed primarily of young, angry white men and led by people with links to groups like the EDL and Tommy Robinson.  This is already happening.  The groups will gather in city centers to, quote, defend our country.  They will have names with words like patriotic British defense in them.  Inevitably, they will clash with the current protesters and the police under pressure from the media and political class.  The police will overreact.  They will treat these groups differently to the BLM protesters.  They will use force.  They will detain people for breaking lockdown rules.  They will issue stiff sentences.  The media will do the opposite of what they did with Black Lives Matter.  Instead of talking about how, quote, 27 police officers were injured in largely peaceful protests.  They will run major front page headlines like 27 police officers injured by far-right violence.  At this point, the majority of the public will lose the ability to be nuanced.  The double standards will be too obvious to ignore.  Fueled by a constant stream of images of white people kneeling, washing POC feet, and publicly apologizing as they already are, they will conclude that their very identity is under attack.  At this point, all their sensible aversion to supporting thuggish far-right groups will evaporate.  they will believe they are in a war for their survival and extreme measures are justified.  At the next election, which will likely be brought forward for one reason or another, fueled by mass unemployment resulting from the economic depression, far-right parties will make significant inroads.  When I say far-right, I am not talking about what the far-left call far-right, such as anyone who talks about controlling immigration.  I'm talking about genuine far-right parties that talk about reversing immigration and deportations.  These parties will not win seats or get anywhere near government, but they will put a UKIP-like pressure on the conservatives.  Boris Johnson will likely be ousted as too soft and liberal and replaced by a law and order hardliner.  From here, I'm afraid, the journey is all too obvious.  The only way to prevent this is to reverse the re-racialization of our society.  Either we learn to live together or the very idea of a multi-ethnic society is over.  End.  I completely agree.  And there's another article that talks about this.  that says, quote, far right groups are already showing up in the UK to defend and to fight back.  And you already have the sentiment in the US that you have clearly one ideology that is favored by the police, Fort Worth, New York, and the racetrack in North Carolina that claimed to be a protest got shut down. Yep. so what is anyone going to conclude in this? it was an imminent imminent threat the governor said. did you hear about the naval academy alumni or whatever who had his uh his facebook?  you know conversation leaked or something.  so apparently the story is this guy was sitting with his wife and he somehow accidentally started a live stream on his on his phone through facebook.  okay yeah and they started talking about black lives matter and he basically said exactly what this dude said that white people can't speak up anymore.  They're under attack.  They're losing their jobs.  How does this make sense?  Then some racial slurs got dropped.  He was forced to apologize.  But this is a very important story because it shows you that, I mean, this guy, I don't, I didn't listen to the conversation.  It didn't sound like he was overtly racist, but it did sound like he was angry that he as a white man was being attacked simply for being white.  There are memes about this where it's like you've got a bunch of people saying something like, you know, you're white and you're bad.  So then all the white people band together and they go, oh, no, they're forming evil groups.  And it's like you threatened them.  You insulted them based on race.  So they did exactly what anyone would expect them to do.  They created a group based on what they were being attacked over.  So I think things like this are obvious.  I think it'll be\u2014I think it's likely. Yep. And then this is what I warned about a couple years ago, that I don't think Antifa could ever really win.  They're too pathetic.  They don't have guns.  They're whiny, and they collapse under pressure.  Yep.  And when they finally do see a few blocks, they're like, please bring us vegan meat substitutes as a sign of their privilege and their expectation of what they're owed. Yep. But they don't even want that, though. So here's what I think is a likely potential for what we'll see, you know, coming off of this statement from this guy, Constantine.  The far left and their constant rioting and their attacks are creating a secret base of Trump voters.  Trump and the Republicans will win.  The left will freak out.  They'll get even more aggressive.  And regular people will say, please just make it stop.  And Trump will by sending in the military, invoking the Insurrection Act and shutting it all down.  The people will beg for the authoritarian police state and they will get it.  And then you will have this constant fear in people's minds, which will result in, like what Constantine was saying, a bunch of far right groups start emerging.  Then you end up with, you know, I don't know, more white identitarian politics.  And people just start reverting to the rules of the past, you know, 40 or 50 years because they're scared. Yep. And that's the fault of the left. This actually kind of worries me because I think the far left pushes so hard to the left because they only ever think that they will win.  And I don't think they recognize that their action is going to cause a very strong opposite reaction because it turns out that people don't really like the far left all that much.  They don't like being controlled.  They don't like authoritarianism. It's not just that, it's that, you're right, but it's also what we're seeing from these leftists goes against the grain.  So when you have somebody who grew up in this country and they're like a dude and they're like, I like playing football and I like attractive women.  I like women with big boobs.  And then they get told they're wrong and to shut up and you're toxic.  They get angry.  It's not even about being white.  It's about being told that everything you do is toxic all the time.  And no matter what you do, you're wrong and you're bad.  And they get angry and they hate it.  And they want to find somebody who they can relate to.  Right.  What the left is trying to do is essentially rewrite normal human biology.  They're trying to claim that point.  They say that there's there's.  you know, they've literally said biological sex isn't real.  And they love playing this game where they're like, literally no one believes that.  It's like, dude, what's the guy's name?  Nicholas Matt.  Yeah, in the debate with Jordan Peterson where he was like, basically it is not true that their thing is biological sex. And we can unpack that at length. I'm a historian of medicine.  I can unpack that.  But in the interest of time, I won't.  They really do believe it.  When J.K.  Rowling came out and said, I respect and love all of my trans friends and I will fight for you.  But I have a lived experience of a female and believe that should be protected.  She got attacked for it.  So you take a regular person who knows nothing, right?  And put them in front of a fascist who says, you know, family.  God, tradition, and they're going to be like, I recognize these things.  And they're going to say, baby, it's cold out night.  I remember Christmas when I was growing up.  You take the far left and they're going to say, you're not actually a woman, you're a menstruator.  And they're going to be like, what? That is so insulting. Yeah.  And who do you think they're going to pick?  The crazy person smashing windows or the dude who walks up with, you know, he's got the haircut where the sides are shaved and it's slicked over to the side and he's wearing a suit and he says, I just want you to be happy.  I want you to have faith in God and I want you to be a good wife and we're going to make sure you're safe.  And there's going to be a bunch of goons with guns standing behind them saying, and we'll make sure you're safe.  They're going to pick it.  They'll pick it every step of the way because it's safety and security.  And the people running through the streets, smashing windows and threatening people and talking about there being no genders or infinite genders freak people out. Chaos. That does. I think a lot of the stuff we're seeing has a very good possibility that results in fascism.  And I think, you know, I wonder if that's how it happened in Europe, because in Germany and Spain and other countries, the communists and the fascists were fighting each other all the time.  And the regular liberals got attacked by them, too, and just kind of stood back and did nothing.  And that's kind of how the bad stuff happens.  So I wonder if, in the end, when given the choice between what they call progress but is actually just a mishmash of weird ideas and authoritarian traditionalism, people choose what's familiar and what they think will be safe and fine.  Think about it this way, man.  They banned Gone with the Wind.  But they also banned Baby, It's Cold Outside.  There's going to be a ton of people who are in their 40s and 50s who are going to think back to that suburban life where it was Christmas time and they woke up early in the morning and there was mom making a batch of chocolate chip cookies.  And she turned on the song, Baby, It's Cold Outside.  And then they remember mom dancing with dad and having a good time.  And they're going to say that was home.  That was family.  That was safe.  And now they're being told you're wrong, you're evil, you're racist.  Some people fall for it.  Some people are going to say that was bad.  Now, tradition is absolutely fine.  It's the authoritarianism part where things become evil.  Progress is absolutely fine.  It's the authoritarian part where things become evil.  Yeah.  So we have right now a liberal society.  But the problem is, I think too many liberally minded people, liberty minded people, libertarian, classically liberal or otherwise won't say anything.  The conservatives have been speaking up and they get banned for it.  Why?  Because liberals won't speak up.  I've talked to my friends about it and they're just like, oh, I don't know.  I don't care.  I'll be involved. That's irresponsible. OK, then when you lose your freedoms and you get kicked in the butt and then all this weird stuff, weird stuff starts happening.  Now they're apparently in colleges.  A friend of mine is doing a course.  They have a specific course where you have to remove gendered language.  So it's like what we saw with that UN segment where you call your landlord your owner.  Yeah, that's in college and it's a part of their mandatory curriculum. They're infiltrating the colleges and changing curriculum for their end. No, they don't. yeah so that's not new.  i actually had a friend who lost a girlfriend.  she broke up with him because she took a course on this kind of language and gender changing stuff in college and she's like you're part of the patriarchy.  i'm sorry i can't be your girlfriend anymore. i've heard so many of these stories on uh like on reddit.  yeah people are just like.  you know.  my girlfriend went to some feminist class and all of a sudden she's like i have to break up with you because you're you're the patriarchy. it made me so so mad because it was my friend.  it was a super nice guy and i was like dude.  it's not right. Welcome to the Brave New World.  1984, everything mishmashed a little bit.  We got a little bit of Fahrenheit 451.  We got a little bit of Brave New World. Yeah.  Hey, Constantine Kyson's new special is called Orwell.  That Ends Well. Oh, interesting.  Who is he?  I don't know who he is. He's a comedian.  And man, he is based.  He just is talking about 2 plus 2 equals 4.  Biological sex is real.  Men and women are different.  So I followed him.  I kind of like him. Somebody retweeted this thread from him.  And he says he's a centrist, Chad.  Yeah.  But Esther was right.  I've been saying this.  I've been thinking it.  And it's what actual white supremacists are hoping for.  I'm not trying to say that everybody on the right is.  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that the small, tiny fraction are crossing their fingers hoping that white people are forced to be identitarian.  They want it to happen. Yep.  They want it. And I think they're going to make it happen.  And you know what?  I don't like it.  I like the idea of America being a melting pot where we can all hang out together and our shared identity is that we're Americans.  But they're erasing that. They're erasing it. The left is erasing that. You're not allowed to be American.  If you're a proud American, then you're their enemy. Don Lemon says he wants everyone to see him as a black man.  He doesn't want people to ignore that.  And I'm like, why? So you want to maintain being. Racial division.  Yeah, exactly. Being a victim.  I don't understand.  Not even a victim, just being different.  What do they want then?  Do they want equality or do they want to be known as someone?  that's different?  Preference. What did Terry Crews say? He said, we can't get rid of white supremacy without whites.  Otherwise, we have black supremacy. And they got mad. Oh, man. They were mad. But he's right. Yep. Yeah. It's not equality.  We're all in this together.  That's how we finish. They don't want equality, dude. I know that's.  that's what he.  how that he finished that tweet, though.  Yeah.  It's like.  so you want black supremacy then if that's the case.  They don't want.  I want equality.  I want everyone to be treated equal.  Right.  I like that. Yeah.  You can't get it if people use identity as a pretext because you will never have it.  What are we going to do?  Are we going to like, we have to create a quota where five foot tall women have to be in the NBA?  It's only fair.  All NBA teams now must be completely diverse.  At least one person must be under five feet.  At least one person must be over six feet.  You must have an Indian person.  You must have an Asian person.  You must have a white person, a black person, a Mexican person.  One person must be overweight.  One person must be underweight.  One person must have more muscle mass in their arms.  We can go on.  One person must be in a wheelchair. Oh, yeah. Yeah. White person optional, of course. No, no, you gotta have one white person.  You do?  Yeah, we're talking about real diversity.  Oh.  Where you try and make the sports team like everything. That's not even what they're saying. I think a lot of these people that we see, like high-profile Black Lives Matter people, like Ice Cube, for instance, are probably followers of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam.  So when Farrakhan got banned... Snoop Dogg made an Instagram video where he was flipping out, saying, how dare you ban the minister?  And then he told all his fans, post videos of Minister Farrakhan onto Instagram so they can't do this.  You have that clip from Ice Cube.  He posted anti-Semitic art that apparently shows a bunch of Jews playing Monopoly with black people under the board.  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  And he got attacked for it.  And then somebody, I think it was Magic Noirs, posted a picture of him with Farrakhan.  And they're like, what do you think these people are all about?  Yeah.  Like, do you realize that, like, the Women's March people were seen at his event and they called him the greatest of all time.  They really do support this guy and his ideas.  And he says a whole bunch of crazy stuff.  So I question when they prop these people up what they really want.  Well, just look at who they follow and who they think is the greatest of all time and you'll get a better understanding.  I don't say everybody believes that stuff, but...

The Israelites Were White Version 2 by TruthVids.  For more information and future videos, check out TruthVids.net.  1.  The Origin and Migrations of the European People.  Today our people the Europeans are spread everywhere throughout the world, on every continent and every corner.  Wherever we went we built a Christian civilization.  However Europeans were not always found scattered across the world.  At one time we weren't even found in Europe, just over 2000 years ago we all collectively for the most part originated from a mass of Germanic tribes who swarmed into Europe and eventually even conquered and destroyed the Roman Empire.  So we didn't just start off as Englishmen or French, German, American, Australian and all the other European peoples.  Rather we all came from the same ancestors, our Germanic forefathers and we started off as Franks, Saxons, Angles, Goths, Vandals, Lombards and the many other numerous Germanic tribes.  From then on we became the modern nations and with Christianity we built the greatest, most prosperous, thriving civilization ever to exist in history all over the world.  But if we came from these Germanic tribes, then where did the Germanic tribes come from?  Did they just magically appear out of nowhere?  Now most people probably have a vague recollection of the events of the Bible and that the Israelites were deported out of their nation by the Assyrians.  They were dragged off into the regions just below the Caucasus mountains.  But after that, what happened?  Where did they go?  Were they just lost in history forever?  Is that where the story ends?  Well, not quite.  Over the past 200 years, modern archaeology has dug up many of these biblical locations such as Nineveh, the former capital city of the Assyrian Empire.  we have uncovered many pillars and tablets, where the inscriptions have been translated, and it all shows that the Assyrians, the Persians and Medes, the Babylonians, all these empires really did exist, that the Assyrian kings really did deport millions of Israelites, There are numerous records of this, except they called them Khimri or Khumri, which means the people of Omri.  Now, King Omri was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel at the time when the first deportations began.  The Assyrians called the Israelites after their king.  In Hebrew, the name Omri actually starts with a guttural C, so it would be pronounced something like Khimri.  Throughout our English Bibles, the translators generally got rid of all these guttural Cs in many words and just replaced them with vowels.  So that is why our Bible translated the name to King Omri, but the Assyrian inscriptions dropped the guttural noise and kept the C or K, and so we have Khimri or Khumri.  After the Assyrian Empire collapsed, a mass of these Khimri are recorded as beginning to invade and pillage Greece, while some went over the Caucasus Mountains and others around the Caspian Sea, all towards Europe, but many still remained where they were.  The Greeks transliterated Chimri to Chimeroi, which we anglicize to Chimerians, Ian meaning people, so people of Chimri.  And these Chimerians came from exactly where the Bible tells us the Israelites were deported to, because they were the Israelites.  Now later with the rise of the Babylonian Empire they transliterated the name to Gimari so that guttural Chimari they preferred a G over a C or a K. Next with the Persian Empire we get a completely new name.  they called the Israelites Sake or sometimes Sake-Sune instead which means the sons of Sake.  now over the centuries the Israelites were still migrating to Europe in waves and some adopted this new Persian name.  one famous historian of the Saxons Sharon Turner proposed that the tribal name Saxons is likely the gradual merging of Sake and Sune together into a single word and thus the origin of the name Saxon.  As the Cimmerians or Saxons pushed their invasions further into Europe they gained another two names, those being the Scythians which they called themselves and the Galatahi which the Greeks called them.  Scythian is likely from the Hebrew word Sukkoth and it literally means booth or tent, so people of the tents.  The Israelites had no home or permanent settlement.  They were constantly on the move, pushing further and further into Europe.  As for Galatahi, one possible theory is the famous Greek historian Homer mocked the Scythians, calling them Galafagi, which means milk drinkers, since they lived and survived off their vast cattle they brought with them.  The word Gala is milk in Greek.  so Galatahi.  Eventually these Galatahi reached as far as northern Italy and sacked Rome.  The Romans shortened the name Galatahi to just Gali which once again we anglicized to Gauls.  The historian Livy calls these invading Gauls at the time a strange race, new settlers.  the Romans had never seen them before because they were the migrating Israelites who had come from Assyria.  The Gauls pushed even further into Europe, including what we call France today, and at the time the land was already called Celtica.  Whilst most Gauls ended up all over Europe, the Gauls in Celtica blended in with the Celts, and the Romans from then on called the land Gaul.  So now we're on to the final name, German, Germanic, Germania.  Where do we get these names from?  Well you can thank none other than Julius Caesar for that one.  During his conquests in Gaul he distinguished the Gauls who had merged in with the Celts and the masses of Gauls all across Europe.  He called those ones Germania, which means genuine, authentic, true, sincere.  He saw the Gauls who merged with the Celts as a mixed breed, and the Gauls across Europe as a purer breed.  Now this is purely Caesar's perspective.  In reality, the Celts were also Israelites.  So the Gauls in France were just as pure.  And we will explain the origin of the Celts in a later proof.  Strabo the famous historian lists these German people or all of Germania from the western Rhine all the way right back to the Black Sea, an enormous mass of people, and historians over and over again like Pliny assert that the Germans are the Scythians who are the Chimerians, further proving these are all one and the same people.  So the deported Israelites migrated into Europe from Assyria becoming the Germanic tribes and then the modern European people and all of our nations today.  Many went over the Caucasus mountains and that is today why we are collectively called Caucasians and at one time all historians accepted this as a mere fact.  In other words, we are the Israelites, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the 12 tribes.  We are the people of the Bible, all the promises and prophecies we inherited.  It is our family history.","channel.id":"clxmi0mkw0121cdviprmvy4pp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","channel.name":"TruthVids","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVAyptfys-UmOQ2qarn1fQod4Buiqcki0hctHTY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The video \"100 Proofs.

The Chess is now the Chap.  The Chapel Hill Autonomous Zone has been renamed the Chapel Hill Occupied Protest.  Now, this name change came about after different factions battled it out for control of the ladder.  And the winning faction climbed that ladder and changed Autonomous Zone to Occupied Protest.  So the CHAP, formerly known as the CHAZ, was founded Monday evening when Seattle mayor and city council ordered their police to abandon the East Precinct building.  Now, radical left-wing extremists and Antifa gangs had been throwing bricks and other things at the police for days.  The mayor didn't want the rioters, I mean, mostly peaceful protesters, to hurt themselves.  So she simply told the police to abandon the precinct building.  So the cops boarded it up and left.  And the radical left declared it their own territory.  And the mayor and the governor... are just letting them have it.  The state government of Washington actually delivered porta-potties to the occupiers.  Now, there's already been a bunch of violence.  People have been assaulted.  People have been threatened with violence.  People have been forcibly expelled.  It's all on video, despite the disingenuous fake claims by Seattle mayor that it's a quote-unquote block party.  A street preacher was just violently attacked, choked, held on the ground for a long time.  Eventually he had to be rescued and carried out.  The media are trying to put a positive spin, yet even left-wing CNN admitted that there was a serious potential for violence. If, in fact, there is going to be federal officers or federal law enforcement come to this area, it is not going to be a pretty situation.  These people have made it clear that unless there's some kind of major reform, and remember, they want to see this police department defunded or even abolished.  Short of some type of major concession, they're not going to leave voluntarily.  And we should point out that Washington is an open carry state.  And no doubt some of these protesters are armed, Anderson, so you have to worry about the potential for bloodshed, the potential for violence, if in fact they're going to try to remove these people by force. Anderson?  Now, it took less than 48 hours for the chop to get its own strongman ruler.  So whenever you have a power vacuum, the guy with the biggest posse, the biggest guns, and the most charisma takes over.  And in that case, it's local Seattle gangster rapper Raz Simone.  He unilaterally declared himself and his posse to be the quote-unquote leaders and quote-unquote the police. We are the police of this community now. We are the leaders of this community now.  And almost immediately, Raz was accused of vigilante brutality against an unarmed black male.  You may have heard about this.  There's a bunch of different cell phone videos and a bunch of witnesses are saying that he beat up a graffiti artist, kicked him in the head, broke his glasses.  Why are you doing the only thing I said?  It's on the tape.  Let's stop the stream.  I'll stop the stream right now.  It's also been discovered that Raz posted anti-homosexual slurs and rhetoric on Twitter back in 2010 and 2011.  Now, the first and primary goal of the CHOP was to be a cop-free zone.  Well, they already failed at that.  Raz and Posse met with the chief of police outside of the CHOP.  And they let 18 police officers in to inspect the precinct building for a brief amount of time.  So the cops came in, they went into the building, and then they left.  This caused a whole bunch of infighting and chaos.  So how are citizens of the CHOP occupying their time?  Well, they're sitting around listening to extreme far left speeches like this. I want you to give $10 to one African-American person.  from this autonomous zone.  If you find that's difficult, if you find it's hard for you to give $10 to people of color, to black people especially, you have to think really critically about in the future, are you gonna actually give up power and land and capital when you have it?  If you have a hard time giving up $10, you gotta think about, are you really down with this struggle?  You find that African American person and you give them $10. Cash app, Venmo. $10 in your pocket. So all white people must prove their devotion by giving a random black person $10.  And I like how the dude in the corner is all clapping and then he holds up his hand so everyone can see him and tell he's a black guy.  He's probably sitting there thinking that these are the stupidest, craziest white people he's ever seen in his life.  And he figures if they're dumb enough to give him free money, he's going to take it.  So there's some grassy areas in the CHOP.  There's actually a big soccer and baseball field, but that's AstroTurf.  And then directly north of that, there's some public restrooms and there's another park.  And basically the first patch of grass in that park, it's called the cal anderson park.  i think they're making these circular farms.  there's at least three of them now and it's the most bizarre thing i've ever seen.  they're putting cardboard on top of the grass and then putting dirt on top of the cardboard and then they're putting seedlings in the dirt.  now i've never farmed before i've never had a garden but this looks.  Does this look like any kind of viable garden to anyone?  As soon as it rains, the cardboard is going to be floating away.  This is the most insane thing I've ever seen.  And to make it worse... All these left-wing Twitter accounts and left-wing blogs are praising what a great accomplishment these gardens are.  There's some guy named Marcus who is supposed to be in charge of this garden project.  And they're alleging that he has a master's degree in sustainable urban development.  So if you actually have your own garden, let me know what you think of this garden, because I can't even understand how grown adults could create this thinking it could possibly be a viable garden to produce food.

In Europe, black people society has a historical sensibility that associates with the African contribution to Europe.  So, you know, Europe wouldn't have written language and bathhouses and roads or this idea of schools and universities.  That's African stuff.  And Rome, Spain, and Greece, those places are African civilized places. No.  In Europe today, there are two human conceptions which stand confronting each other.  One is official and advocated by the authorities, the other realistic and understood privately and intuitively by the people.  This is the conception that European civilization was built by people of color.  These so-called contributions increase in extravagance from month to month, each claim being more brazen than the last.  What began as a little post-Blitz DIY has apparently evolved into penning some of our greatest literary works.  As amusing as all this began, we now find ourselves jockeying for position in a competitive struggle for predominance, and the battle for representation is starting to resemble something like a national conquest.  Strangely, the more wild and exaggerated these claims become, the more difficult it can feel to protest them.  Notorious professor of black studies Kehinde Andrews, for instance, claims that Britain was built on the back of black labour.  Nasreen Malik of The Guardian is of the opinion that black and brown immigrants both built and rebuilt Britain.  It's often been said that the tendency to fantasize is a chief characteristic of narcissists.  And Douglas Murray, for all his errors, makes a salient point when he asks, what happens when a sadist meets a masochist?  The gentle and affable conduct of Europeans is in part to blame for this fallacy, struck by a toxic combination of guilt and pity that has nourished these falsehoods, so that over time and with repeated usage they have congealed into fictions resembling truths.  And now we find ourselves in a bit of a sticky wicket, because these falsehoods have been swallowed and seized upon jealously, so that European history now looks to be establishing its own form of Year Zero.  The conception of a Year Zero, instituted by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, is the idea that all cultures and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded, and a new, revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch.  All of the history of a nation or people before year zero is largely deemed irrelevant because it will ideally be purged or replaced from the ground up.  What we must understand is that this all boils down to retrospectively accounting for the mass African settlement on our soil, The vast scale of movement into the continent over the past two decades continues to be an unacceptable disgrace, unless, by chance, it is discovered that Africans have in fact always been here, in the Overlook Hotel.  And this was the point I was very clumsily trying to communicate in last year's Millennial, when I made reference to The Shining's bathroom scene. Mr.  Grady, you were the caretaker here.  I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.  But you are the caretaker.  You've always been the caretaker.  As you know, sir, I've always been here. I've always been here.  An exchange of this very nature occurred only this week in The Guardian, when they asked, why are period dramas so white?  What supposedly began as the pursuit of a more inclusive casting has, over time, developed into calls for a, quote, more accurate reflection of history, one where black people invented roads, numbers, and bathhouses? There is a problem with this vision of British history.  is often almost entirely white.  Some of them have the occasional token appearance of a black or brown character, but others don't even bother with that.  I mean, I thought that there was a long history of diversity in the UK, even before the Windrush era.  But if that's true, then why are period dramas so white? If it appears that the non-white role in period drama is underestimated, that is because there is no significant body of ignored non-European accomplishment out there for comparison.  This meta-peculiarity of stealing our stuff is starting to resemble a Soviet-style neurosis.  Solzhenitsyn once said that the worst part of the gulag system was that it robbed death of its meaning as the end of a fulfilled life.  By making death itself anonymous, making it impossible to find out whether a prisoner is dead or alive, in a sense they took away the individual's own death, proving that henceforth nothing belonged to him and he belonged to no one.  His death merely set a seal on the fact that he had never really existed.  In a sense, the bid for more inclusivity almost always requires exclusion.  It's like blotting out ink on a manuscript where you can still see the pencil marks.  Sticking a bunch of black people in Oliver Twist is a serious annulment that may as well be called abolition.  And this is why I tend to call it a replacement.  It's not an outright removal of white people, but it is a gradual and successive cancellation of the hitherto orthodox social order.  And that means something.  This is precisely the kind of pernicious logic you'll find with the likes of Mike Graham when they ask, what do you mean by English?  Norman English?  Roman English?  And it's in this process that a kind of silent death occurs.  We might think of it in colloquial terms as a kind of civilizational ghosting. But it still raises an important question.  How truthful are period dramas, really, when it comes to racial diversity? In Czech author Milan Kandera's novel, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, he describes the bargain that negationist historians and totalitarian charlatans impose upon their subjects.  Quote, they were ready to sell people a future in exchange for their past.  They wanted to compel him to cast his life away and become a shadow, a man without a past, an actor without a role, and to turn even his castaway life, even the role the actor had abandoned, into a shadow.  Having turned him into a shadow, they would let him  live.\".  And this really extends from what I've said in my former video on humiliation.  Even in its darkest period, the Western world has hitherto granted the slain enemy the right to be remembered as a self-evident acknowledgement of the fact that we are all men, and only men.  In the origin of totalitarianism, it is written that the murderer at least leaves behind him a corpse, and although he tries to efface the traces of his own identity, he has no power to erase the identity of his victim from the memory of the surviving world.  Mission diversification, on the contrary, sees to it that the victims of this erasure never existed at all.  Diversity has always been here.  We simply didn't know it.  Nikolai Kovach started looking for his parents in 1953, the year Stalin died and Nikolai turned 17.  He had grown up in an orphanage outside Leningrad.  When it was time for him to get his identity papers, the orphanage director instructed him to pick a patronymic, a derivative of the father's name that forms part of one's official identity.  you come from nowhere.  the orphanage director said you have no parents.  kovacs's objection was factual rather than existential.  he could accept that there were people who came from nowhere but he knew that he was not one of those people.  he had an unusual last name and this meant that someone somewhere had to know something about him.  He told the orphanage director to put down Ivanovich, the Russian equivalent of John Doe.  But once he became a trade school student in Leningrad, he began filing information requests with the city office of internal affairs.  No information available was the response he got.  He continued filing his request every few years, for a total of five rejections.  This account is a valuable reminder of Shakespeare's eternal question, what's in a name?  Does English correlate with identity, or doesn't it?  The blackwashing of European history, apart from being embarrassing and ridiculous, is all part of ameliorating the crippling insecurities of non-Europeans.  The truth is that they borrow stories from us because their own history fails them, arriving in the millions from their battered, impoverished countries, feeling themselves, as soon as they set foot on our soil, the intellectual and demographic enemies of Europe, armed with a resentful inferiority complex.  An inferiority complex toward the white civilization, one which, in the case of many West Indians, has evolved into resentment-driven hostility that gets cheekier by the day. They made civilized by the Moors who came in 711 in Spain and stayed there hundreds of years.  And they ended up with prior to that, though, not having numbers, a sense of what a number was or written written language.  So I'm saying all that to say that in European history, they have that. The intensity of this self-deception would not be half so alarming were it not constantly endowed with flattery and validation.  As in any essentially totalitarian propaganda, the aim is to create a scrupulously inverse depiction of reality.  Whilst our Lugan press deride the hate crimes committed by English natives toward Africans and visible Muslims, which are a rare occurrence and more often than not the result of self-defense, The gratuitous murders of whites are never put down to anti-European sentiment.  The purpose of an all-brown casting such as the recent David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, I'm convinced is all about daring the little Englander to vocalise his displeasure.  That way they can persuade the viewers that the guilty ones are none other than the anti-immigrant white folk, even if in actual fact they are the ones being victimised by immigrant violence on a daily basis.  Through both its fictions and its news bulletins, television sets out to establish and construct a virtual reality, one that is seen as correct and faithful to hegemonic ideology, and that strives to cast the real world into oblivion, condemning any popular revolt against the daily humiliation of anti-white erasure.  All these talentless propaganda productions, whose goal is to generate bewilderment in the minds of the working class and delight in the shallow idiocy of the middle class, are naturally the work of producers, screenwriters and actors who make a fortune off them living in fashionable neighbourhoods and never having to cross paths with ethnic gangs or to set foot in a vibrant district.  Of course, the unintended consequence of this cathodic, self-righteous propaganda is that it stimulates and strengthens resentment among viewers of immigrant origin.  This impotent jealousy has turned over time into active hatred.  Unknowingly, or perhaps not, the intellectual media class is actually strengthening ethnic division through its so-called integrationist propaganda, by taking white people for fools and force-feeding them guilt-ridden canards.  Of course, these painful contradictions can be attributed to an inferiority complex, Both the public and private life of many newly arrived migrants is so manifestly devoid of all signs of a productive and characteristic culture.  They speak of their longing for empowerment, whilst at the same time victimising themselves, appealing to the public's pity.  They claim to refuse infantilisation, but infantilise themselves and community.  They reject humiliation and handouts, yet their discourse generates it.  This hardly fits with the academic tendency to stress the series of catastrophes, cruelties and ostracism that have punctuated black and brown history on the continent.  On the one hand, we are meant to believe in black innovation and entrepreneurship, while simultaneously believing in their persecution and subjugation.  It cannot be both that blacks are a central cog in the European machine, as well as an outsider demonised on the periphery, since you hardly authorise that which is already a part of you.  Diversification policy itself is testament to a pre-established mono-ethnic order.  Again, you do not diversify that which was diverse from its inception.  I'll finish here with a passage from Nietzsche.  The cultural Philistine fancies himself a son of the Muses and a man of culture.  This incomprehensible error clearly shows that he does not even know the difference between a Philistine and his opposite.  owing to this lack of self-knowledge he is convinced that his culture is the consummate manifestation of real culture.  and since he everywhere meets with scholars of his own type since all public institutions whether schools universities or academies are so organized as to be in complete harmony with his education and needs wherever he goes he bears with him the triumphant feeling that he is the worthy champion of prevailing culture and he frames his pretensions and claims accordingly.  The confusion underlying the cultural philistine's error may arise from the fact that, since he comes into contact everywhere with creatures cast in the same mould as himself, he concludes that this uniformity among all scholars must point to a certain uniformity in public consciousness, hence to culture.  All around him he sees only needs and views similar to his own.  Wherever he goes, he finds himself embraced by a ring of tacit conventions concerning almost everything.  This imposing sameness, ever ready to burst forth, persuades him into the belief that here a culture must be established and flourishing.  But philistinism, despite its systematic organisation and power, does not constitute a culture by virtue of its system alone.  It does not even constitute an inferior culture.  but invariably the reverse, namely, firmly established barbarity.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"In present-day Europe, a disturbing trend has emerged among ethno-masochistic migrants who claim to have built the continent.

The Irish had a general election this weekend.  It took a long time to tabulate the results.  They have a special system called SVT, where you put the candidates in order of which one you like the best from which one you like the least.  And it takes a long time to tabulate.  But the results are in and there might be a bombshell because the 100 year reign of Fianna Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il could come to an end and Ireland could have its first very left-wing government.  Although I'm not so sure that's actually going to happen.  So first let me go to the white board.  So at the top here we got Sinn Fein at 24.5 percent.  Now last election they got 13.8 percent.  13.8 percent was considered a huge breakthrough for them.  Now the current version of Sinn Fein was founded in 1970.  Their background is members of the original Sinn Fein, hardcore Marxists, the Irish Republican Army, etc.  For decades, they remained a teeny tiny pariah party that was generally hated by a large portion of the population.  Now they have always gotten votes in Northern Ireland as a protest party, but that's kind of a whole different story.  I'm not going to get into that whole thing.  Now the old duopoly is Fianna F\u00e1il and Fianna Gael and they got 22.5 and 20.9.  Both of them were down and they no longer command a majority.  Now both of these parties, At one time, it could have been called center-right.  Now they're basically establishment globalist parties that have gone way to the left.  Fianna Fowl, back in the 80s, 90s, and even into the 2000s, used to always be part of nationalist and Euroskeptic groups in the European Parliament.  Now they're part of Renew Europe, which is the big tent centrist group, which is very pro-EU, pro-globalist.  Now, you have a big chunk of independents.  There's 160 seats, 20 of them went to independents, technically 19.  But I counted this Peter Toblin guy as number 20 because he's basically a wild card.  To make it easier to understand, basically there's 20 independents.  And then there's the Green Party plus four other left-wing parties.  Well, there's 160 seats.  The election chooses 159.  There's a special process to choose a speaker who becomes member 160.  Now, Sinn Fein says that they are going to try to form a ruling coalition.  And they're going to need the support of 80 people in the assembly.  So the first thing they need to do is win over the Green Party.  And the Green Party is already making a bunch of demands.  And then if they win over the Green Party, they got to get all these other radical Marxist parties to join in.  If they can get all of these guys, they still need 14 of the 20 independents.  Now, these independents span the whole spectrum.  They're all over the map.  I'll get to the independents in a second.  The odds are still, as far as I can tell, for the Fianna F\u00e1il Fianna Gael duopoly because they got 73 seats.  they only need to win over 7 of the independents and they hit the 80 seat mark.  so it remains to be seen if Sinn Fein can pull this off.  so if you go to the community section of this YouTube channel I already posted a list of the independents and like a little one-sentence blurb about each one.  Some of them.  I couldn't really even find that much information.  What I did find out is that most of these independents are either incumbent members of the assembly or they're former members of the assembly, and most of them are ex-members of either Fianna F\u00e1il, Fianna Gael, or Sinn Fein.  Now, there was one woman who's a brand new person that ran on a campaign of stopping immigration, and that was Verona Murphy.  There's two other incumbents who were reelected as independents that are attacked in the media for their stance on immigration.  There's two more who are brothers.  Their last name is Healy Ray.  And I couldn't find much information on them, but they seem to definitely be right of center candidates.  Then you have a lot of candidates that are big right to life people.  So there's two that are ex Sinn Fein people who quit Sinn Fein over the issue of abortion.  And then there's one ex-Fianna Foole incumbent who quit that party over abortion.  And then there's some other candidates who are ex-members of Fianna Foole and Fina Gayo who quit for a variety of reasons, but all of them seem to be right-to-life candidates.  So there's a significant chunk of the independents who are right to.  life is either their biggest thing or one of their things at least.  And then there's just a huge, there's one woman that the only thing I could really find out about her is she's an advocate of the Irish language.  There's another guy who basically runs as an advocate of farmers.  Although he is run afoul of the Green Party and the hardcore climate people because they want the Irish people to eat less meat and they want to force them to eat less meat by reducing livestock.  And then there's a few leftists who are definitely hardcore leftists.  So it spans the whole spectrum.  I remain skeptical that Sinn Fein will be able to put together 80 members of the assembly to form a ruling coalition.  I could be wrong.  They'll have the media on their side.  And so the media might influence some of these independents.  We'll just have to wait and see.  Now, the campaign that Sinn Fein ran is somewhat unconventional for a left-wing party.  So, for example, in America, we have the Democrats who run on free stuff and the Republicans who run on low taxes.  And the Democrats have never seen a tax cut that they liked.  In fact, right now, the Democrats are campaigning nationally on repealing the tax cuts that Donald Trump just made.  Well, Sinn Fein, in their national campaign, campaigned on free stuff and tax cuts.  Now, they have a 110-page manifesto, and when you get to the end of the manifesto, it's a whole different story.  But the talking points that were distributed in their main literature was nothing but free stuff and tax cuts.  In fact, they even denounced the carbon taxes.  Sinn Fein said that the carbon taxes were a scam.  Besides the 110-page manifesto that probably hardly anyone has ever read, they had a six-part smaller platform that was widely distributed for the election.  One of those points is to bring about an Irish reunification referendum.  That's a big thing for Sinn Fein, and that's a whole different side topic, really.  Then, the next point is to have the largest public housing program in Irish history.  Part of the reason that this election was held early is because there was an attempt to remove the Minister of Housing last December and it failed.  but it came very close and it kind of destabilized the whole government.  So they want to pump $6.5 billion into housing and build 100,000 new homes over the next five years.  that will be different kinds of subsidizing.  Of course, what they don't want to talk about is immigration.  There's numerous documentaries now showing that a big part of the housing crisis is because of non-European immigrants coming in seeking asylum.  And Sinn Fein in their 110 page manifesto fully supports the asylum process and says it's their duty under international treaties to take these people in.  And then they want to come to the rescue of renters and new home buyers.  They want to put a cap on how much interest the banks can charge.  And they want to give renters a big tax rebate equal to one month of rent per year up to 1,500 euro.  So this is the first one of several tax breaks that they're claiming that they're going to give to people.  They also want to halt the planned increase in the retirement age.  So it's going to increase to 67.  They want to bring it back down to 65.  And then they say that they're going to subsidize child care.  They're going to save every family an average of 500 euro per child per month.  And on top of that, they're going to give higher wages and better working conditions to child care staff.  They're going to extend paid maternity leave and increase maternity benefits.  They're going to increase the federal police by 2,000 officers and 2,000 support staff.  Then they're going to have a huge income tax break.  So Ireland has something called Universal Service Charge, which I think is similar to what we call Social Security and Medicaid in the United States.  I might be wrong, but there's something about it.  It kicks in after the first $13,000 of income.  Well, they say that they're going to increase that from $13,000 to $30,000.  And so if you make $30,000 or more a year, the amount of taxes you'll pay on your income will go down by $700.  And they say they're going to abolish personal property tax, saving each person an average of 250 euro per year.  and then for point six they say they're not gonna borrow any money.  in fact they're gonna run a surplus such a big surplus that after five years there'll be so much money left over that they're gonna give everyone another big tax break saving each worker another 700 euro each year.  and after I read that I thought hey Why not just promise everyone their own personal leprechaun too?  Now they claim in the literature they were given out that other third party sources have verified that their plan really will pay for itself and generate a surplus.  Well, on page 110 of their 110 page manifesto, they surprisingly actually lay out figures.  And they say we're going to reduce taxes by 2.4 billion euro a year.  And then the next part is we're going to raise taxes by 3.8 billion a year.  But all the new taxes are just for the people who really deserve it.  So the evil banks, the evil landlords, the evil employers.  the rich people, they're not going to be taxed.  And that's not going to affect the workers and the families.  The workers and the families are only going to be affected by the tax breaks.  And so the Sinn Fein Manifesto is actually calling for big tax increases overall, but with the fantasy view that their tax increases somehow won't affect the little guy.  that it's not going to trickle down to the little guy.  But the main small platform that was distributed for the election was all rainbows and pots of gold, free stuff and tax breaks.  And so that's how Sinn Fein played it and it paid off.  They came in first place.  Now, ultimately, the rhetoric of Sinn Fein reminds me very much of the Scottish National Party.  It is also a fake national party, which is just a globalist socialist party.  And I've said repeatedly that I support Scottish independence in part because I believe that it would turn out very badly for the SNP.  That if Scottish was granted independence under SNP rule, it would be a total disaster, and eventually the SNP would collapse, and then maybe finally Scotland could start building a real nationalist movement.  And so maybe if Sinn F\u00e9in does gain control of Ireland, it'll be such a disaster that a real nationalist movement could grow out of the ashes.  all right thanks for watching this video.  click the like button post a comment below tell me what you think about this and please support my sponsor patriotic flags the online flag store patriotic-flags.com and click the subscribe button.  new video every few days.","channel.id":"clxmi0r4w049gcdvicqej1m2p","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCd3HQiNlNvrBnSVv8MLTDIw","channel.name":"Renaissance Horizon","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJW8s-WcGR-uojJvfoLJ2wVQzBmIX08KmFL5jvlRyw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-06-27T05:48:56.000Z","summary":"The Irish general election took place this weekend, and the results are in.

Ora, ora pra nobis Peccata erbus.  Non quid inoram mortis Inoram mortis nostra is Ave Maria Llamo mamma mia.  Hello there, Steve here in Sydney, on the Leanosis website, TrueBlueHealer.com.  You've just been listening to some of your favourite music, and I dare say that you've heard it internally for years or decades and never quite knew what to do, but you really never had the time to question it.  Two things I'm going to tell you.  You are in fact being signalled.  That's something that you didn't notice because you were always in too much of a hurry.  And secondly, it's not part of your brain providing free elevator music.  It definitely is not.  And I'm going to tell you very quickly why and how to reframe your thinking a little bit to understand this internal musical signaling phenomenon.  Now, when you hear this music internally, there's a couple of things you can say about it.  It's sometimes quite weirdly out of context because you can be up a ladder knocking nails into a beam and you start hearing in your head beautiful ABBA music.  or maybe something that you've always remembered from childhood, Ave Maria or something like that.  And it's always out of context.  It can happen while you're in the bath.  It can happen and you sort of say, well, that's got nothing to do with what I'm doing at the moment.  It's out of context.  So why is it happening?  Now, This has been going on all of your life and you've been just too busy to take too much notice of it.  Okay?  We're all too busy today.  We suffer for it.  So make no bones about it.  You are being signaled.  You've just failed to respond.  Now, we give you a definition.  We call you a semi-gnostic.  That means you're receiving a signal.  You're knowing something.  Gnostic meaning knowing.  You're knowing something, but you're not responding.  You're sort of knowing subliminally.  You're not noticing sufficiently.  Agnostic means not knowing.  Gnostic means you do know.  So you're in the middle.  You're a semi-gnostic.  You sort of half know, but you're not responding.  Okay?  Now, how to clarify this mystery and learn how to respond is available in a 20-minute lecturette at TrueBlueHealer.com.  20-minute beginner's tour is all you have to do.  And here is a bonus.  While you're learning to shift your understanding, of this situation slightly, you'll be given some physical evidence that is repeatable and is going to show you over and over again until you're convinced that you weren't paying enough attention for many, many years.  Okay?  So, where does the signaling come from?  It's your own internal divine spark.  Now, you've probably heard about that in literature but never paid much attention to it.  um last 20 30 years your divine spark has decided to make itself physically knowable to you so you could.  you'll be able to feel your divine spark after you have visited truebluehealer.com.  this is a free public service.  okay cost you nothing.  And by the way, this is a totally natural process.  It benefits, improves the life of both secular people and religious people.  Okay?  You can be a religious Gnostic or you can be a secular Gnostic.  It just depends on what you prefer and how you've been brought up.  It's okay to be either.  And layman's Gnosis is for everybody.  implied by its name.  It is literally for everybody.  There's no belief required in this because you'll be shown everything you need to know.  Physical evidence to back it up every step of the way.  Everyone finds this a most pleasant experience.  Some people want to keep it all to themselves.  Other people want to shout it from the rooftops.  Do whatever you want.  You don't have to talk to me.  You don't have to know me at all.  The site's fully automated.  There's an email link.

This happened many years ago.  He left the station in a Manchester suburb and started to walk up the Bolton Road wondering what to do.  He came to some streets of terraced houses which lay at the foot of an immense mill.  As he took in the scene, he was filled with the urge to paint it.  And at that moment, he decided to become an artist.  His name is Lawrence Stephen Lowry. I've often had it said to me, in fact, that your people are not of today.  They are 20 or 30 years ago.  How is that?  Well, I say, I don't think it matters.  I paint the people as I see the people.  It reminds I. I just paint the people as I see them.  I simply paint the people as I see them, and that's all there is to it. Picking away the moments that make up a dull day.  Threaten and waste the hours in an offhand way.  Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown.  Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.  Tired of lying in the sunshine Staying home to watch the rain.  And you are young and life is long And there is time to kill today.  And then one day you find Ten years have got behind you.  No one told you when to run.  You missed the starting line.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And you run and you run to catch up with the song they're singing.  racing around to come up behind you again.  The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older, shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.  Every year is getting shorter, never seeking to find the time.  Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.  The time is gone, the song is over.  It's all like something more to say.  Home, home again.  I like to be here when I can.  And when I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.  Far away across the field, tolling of the iron bell, calls the faithful to their knees to hear the softly spoken magic spell.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The film is about the life of Lawrence Stephen Lowry, a man who became an artist after missing a train.

Now, their term, their concept, racist, has been dying, thankfully, a very slow death, and we're happy about that.  But what they've done is started using the phrase anti-white racism.  do not use that phrase.  that is their phrase to revive their concept that has been almost single-handedly used to destroy our people.  so let's let their concept racism die and let's not wed it to anti-white which is growing rapidly cunning group of people.  but we're not going to fall for it.  thanks for everybody being over here and i will toss it back. The anti-white concept racism is the reason why this poor white child was lynched by anti-whites.  To use the anti-white concept is to legitimize it, and to legitimize it is to perpetuate anti-white lynchings, just like this one.  Let us continue to be this Little Sisters champion as much as the anti-whites will allow us to by not censoring us when we bring light to these anti-white lynchings.  Good God!  I can't even show the vile anti-white lynching here because the anti-whites at YouTube have given me strikes in years past for sharing videos of Westmen lynched by anti-whites.  because, according to the anti-whites who wrote me from YouTube, YouTube does not permit depictions of violence to be shared on its platform.

Thanks, Chair.  Please go on.  It is said that absolute power does not come from an imposition from above, but by the choice of individuals who feel themselves more protected, renouncing their own freedom and granting it to a third party.  With this in mind, you are going on anesthetizing the minds with corrupt mass media, with disaffectant and un-LP, with words like regime to allow and to permit, to the point of allowing you to regulate our emotional ties and feelings and certify our affections.  So in this way, phase two is nothing else than the continuation of phase one.  You just changed the name, as you did with the European stability mechanism.  We understood that people don't die for the virus alone, so it will be allowed to die and suffer thanks to you and your laws for misery and poverty.  And as in the best regime, the blame will be dropped only upon citizens.  You take away our freedom, saying that it is our fault.  Divide and rule.  Our children will lose more.  Rape the soul with the help of the so-called warrant of the rights and so on.  The rights to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, slavery and to virtual lager in exchange for a skateboard and a tablet.  All this to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, well represented by the WHO, whose main financer is the well-known philanthropist and savior of the world, Bill Gates.  We all know this.  Back in 2018, Bill Gates predicted a pandemic simulated in October 2018 at the Event 201.  Together with Davos friends, for decades Gates has been working on depopulation and dictatorial control plans on global politics.  aiming to obtain the primacy on agriculture, technology and energy.  Gates said, I quote from his speech, if we do a good job on vaccine, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%.  And again, only a genocide can save the world.  With his vaccines, Gates managed to sterilize millions of women in Africa.  He caused a polio epidemic that paralyzed 500,000 children in India.  He causes more deaths than the disease itself, as well with his sterilizing GMO designed by Monsanto and generously donated to the needy populations.  He is thinking about distributing the quantum tattoo for vaccination recognition, an mRNA vaccine, as tools for reprogramming our immune system.  In addition, Gates does business with several corporations that own 5G facilities in the United States.  So with all of this is the entire Italian deep state.  Sanofi, together with Glaxo, friends of Ranieri Guerra, Ricciardi, and the well-known virologists that we pay 2,000 euro every 10 minutes for the presentation on television.  He signed agreements with medical societies to indoctrinate future doctors, making fun of their own judgment and their oath.  High-tech corporations like the Roman engineer, which is friend of the noble Mantuan, or bending spoons of Pisano, to control and manage our personal health data, in agreement with the European Agenda ID 2020, which uses mass vaccination to obtain a digital platform of digital ID, pushing on the transfer of data started by Renzi to IBM.  In 2016, Renzi gave a plus 30% to Gates Global Fund.  Aspen's friends, like the Saxon Collao, who with his very expensive four pages report, without scientific review, dictates his policies as a Bilderberg general, far away from the battlefield.  The list is very long.  There is also Mediatronic by Arcuri and so on.  The Italian contribution to the International Alliance against COVID-19 will be 140 millions of euros, of which 120 millions to Gavi Alliance.  This is just a part of the 7.4 billions found by EU to find a vaccine against COVID-19, which will be used, as I said before.  No money for serotherapy, which is super cheap.  Nothing as well for our real prevention, which includes our lifestyle, food, and relationship with the environment.  The real goal of all of this is... Total control, absolute domination of human beings transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty and free will.  All this thanks to your tricks disguised as political compromise while you rip up the Nuremberg Code with force, fines and deportation, facial recognition and intimidation endorsed by dogmatic scientism, protected by our multi-president of the republic.  who is the real cultural epidemic of this country.  We outside with the people will multiply the fires of resistance in a way that you won't be able to repress all of us.  Chair, I ask fellow members, fellow members, this is a free parliament in which anyone has the right to express his opinion and everyone must respect them.  If you disagree with it, you can speak later.  Enough.  Please go on.  Chair, please, be the spokesperson to give an advice to our President Conte.

So I'm doing this video today on fertility.  It's not going to be a political video because I really haven't done any political videos since Trudeau won reelection.  I've been pretty uninspired in that department.  I've also been undergoing some fertility challenges and I was hoping that while you're sitting at home during this horrible corona outbreak that you could watch this YouTube video if you are struggling with fertility issues.  Mine in particular was egg quality.  so my sad story last year in 2019 i went through three miscarriages in less than a year.  it was horribly devastating and uh you know i was kind of at my breaking point and we went to a doctor downtown a fertility clinic and she immediately said to me you know what based on your age i was 38 at the time i'm now 39. she said i think that this is an egg quality issue.  i think that you are having miscarriages due to egg quality.  It turned out her diagnosis was correct because we did some genetic testing on the last miscarriage that I had and it turned out that the baby had chromosomal abnormalities.  So fast forward to January of this year when I did IVF.  I only did my retrieval.  I have not done my transfer yet.  But we had tremendous results for a woman of my age.  We actually had four genetically normal They were tested with PGS, chromosomally normal embryos, and then we had one Mosaic embryo.  So really we have five embryos to work with heading into our transfer.  So obviously we were very thrilled with these results.  I definitely think that it was a combination of the doctor's advice as well as a book I read and my diet and lifestyle changes that I made.  And that's what I'm going to talk about in this video because women that are undergoing IVF and really want to amp up their egg quality, For their retrieval definitely want to take some of this advice.  Listen to it because it could help you and you could have some success and of course it could lead to a healthy baby.  the first thing I did obviously was listen to my doctor when she said it was an egg quality issue and I talked to her and she recommended some supplements for me and And, you know, so those I bought at the clinic and I use them in conjunction with reading this book.  So this book was recommended to me by some women on some chat forums in regards to fertility.  It's called It Starts With The Egg and it was written by an author named Rebecca Fett.  She was going through her own infertility issues and she decided to put her research skills to work.  And she was able to come up with some supplements through all of the intense research that she did.  that helped her improve her egg quality and it actually helped her produce some beautiful eggs.  And she now has two healthy children.  So I read this book and loved it.  It was very good.  It had so much information in this book.  She's got all different plans for women, depending on what your infertility issue is.  Mine was reoccurring miscarriage due to egg quality.  So I go to page one 98 and I take a look at what she's written here.  So let's talk about the supplements that I took.  I took her advice in conjunction with my doctor.  And of course, all the supplements are pretty much the same.  I took a little bit more supplements based on Rebecca's advice than what the doctor had decided to give me.  I think it was.  she gave me about five supplements.  And in this book, there's a few more.  So let's talk about the advanced plan for recurrent miscarriage that I personally did.  Now, of course, if you pick up this book, you might not have recurrent miscarriage.  That might not be your issue.  But I do find.  a lot of the supplements are pretty much the same.  Depending on your issue.  really these supplements are across the board.  They work for all types of different cases of infertility.  She says here consider taking the following supplements for two or three months before trying to conceive which I did a prenatal with at least 800 mcg of methylfolate.  where is my?  I have this whole thing here.  all of my Supplements looks like a doctor's office.  Okay, so I took this prenatal vitamin.  How do you do this?  see that prenatal multivitamin.  it's called Vita Day.  I bought.  I bought some of my supplements online.  I bought some of them a health food store and I bought some of them at Walmart.  this one in particular I did buy at a health food store because it's very difficult to find prenatals that have methylfolate.  of course you can spend a fortune on prenatals.  so this one didn't have as much because I couldn't find one that had that much in it and So I went with the next best option.  This one had 333 MCGs.  Now, I don't have that genetic mutation MTHFR.  So I wasn't as concerned with the methylfolate.  I also took folic acid based on my doctor's advice.  So I know that this is a little bit of a conflict because if you can't process folic acid, typically you would take the methylfolate.  And in my case, I didn't have the genetic mutation, so I just took them both.  So I don't know, not the best advice there, but I wanted to stay in accordance with both Rebecca's advice and my doctor's.  So the next one, which is pretty much the gold standard for egg quality is CoQ10.  Rebecca devotes an entire chapter to CoQ10 in the book.  talking about how important it is for women with poor egg quality and the improvements shown through research that CoQ10 really works.  So that one was really important.  This one I just got at Walmart.  So she says that you should take 400 milligrams per day, one 200 milligram capsule with breakfast and one with lunch.  And the reason for that is you should take it with some fat, but also you can't digest 400 milligrams of CoQ10 altogether so it's better if you space it out.  Now as I was leading up into the IVF about a week prior I got a little excited and I took another tablet.  So I was actually taking three tablets of CoQ10.  so it was 600 milligrams I was taking but honestly we had amazing results.  so I have to think that CoQ10 probably worked right.  Okay so the next one that she recommends is A-L-A, I can't really pronounce it.  This one I got at the health food store and she says 200 to 300 milligrams, preferably at least 30 minutes before a meal.  Vitamin E is really important for both retrieval and transfer and you can take that at any time.  I typically take my supplements in the morning because as we go through the day, I tend to get busy and then I forget.  So I really do everything in the morning.  The next one is one that I cannot pronounce.  So I'll just show it to you.  I got it at the health food store.  600 milligrams.  And yeah, you can take this one at any time during the day.  Now, if you're trying to conceive through IVF, which I was, she also recommends taking melatonin.  You can get this pretty much any health food store.  You can get it at Walmart.  You can get it at the grocery store.  If they have a vitamin section, it's relatively cheap.  And that one you should be taking two weeks to one month before the egg retrieval.  I kind of slipped a bit and forgot about that one.  So I only took it about a week prior to the egg retrieval.  Okay.  So the other thing that's really important is if you have an underactive thyroid, you should go to the doctor.  and get your thyroid panel tested.  I did that.  My thyroid came back fine.  However, I had a healthy son in 2018, that pregnancy, everything was fine.  But when I was first pregnant, they did a blood test on me and they saw that my thyroid was actually higher.  And so they put me on a very low dose of Synthroid.  And so I went to this doctor that I'm currently working with now.  And I told her that story and she said, you know what?  We're going to put you on thyroid medicine.  even though your thyroid looks to be okay, your TSH levels are fine.  It's not just TSH that you wanna look at.  When you do the whole thyroid panel, they really take a really good look at everything that's going on.  For me, it didn't seem like there were any issues.  Regardless, they still put me on the thyroid med.  It's very important to get your thyroid tested, especially if you are going through recurrent miscarriage as I did.  Vitamin D is also incredibly important.  Now this one is the capsule version of vitamin D. This is just a cheap one.  You can just get that at Walmart.  When I was actually gearing up for the retrieval, I used a liquid D3.  And that is also what Rebecca suggests.  Most women who live in the Northern Hemisphere are actually deficient in vitamin D. So if you don't get a test, assume that you are deficient and take about 10,000 UIs of vitamin D for two weeks and then back off to about 5,000.  Okay, so DHEA.  is not available in Canada over the counter.  you have to get it from your doctor.  my doctor recommended it to me as a supplement and I took it happily so.  here's the one that I took like life extension DHEA 25 milligrams.  she told me to take it.  I think I took it three times a day.  They didn't test me for testosterone, but she just said this is a very popular supplement to give women for egg quality prior to their egg retrievals.  I also took fish oil.  Okay.  Fish oil is just, it's really good for you.  Omega-3s.  I took vitamin C. I took one a day.  500 milligrams.  Rebecca suggests that you do take some vitamin C. And something else that I took is called Oversalt.  Yes.  So I ordered this online.  It's expensive.  It's like $100 for this.  This is supposed to help with egg quality.  I took that for about a month and a half.  It was recommended to me by a different doctor.  This went out of the US and I just thought, okay, fine, I'll take it.  I mean, it's not going to hurt, right?  Diet is the other part of this equation.  So not only did I take all the supplements, I also changed my diet and I changed my diet significantly.  In the book, It Starts With The Egg, Rebecca recommends the Mediterranean diet.  Because I have some inflammation, I decided that I was going to go against that advice and I was going to go keto.  I thought, you know what?  I don't want to have any of that white bread, white rice, white pasta leading up to the retrieval.  So for almost two and a half months, I did not eat any sugar.  I mean it.  I was so diligent.  I was like a woman possessed and it was hard because it happened over Christmas and you know, chocolate at Christmas, wine at Christmas.  I didn't drink anything, no alcohol, zero alcohol.  I wasn't so stringent with coffee though.  Because I thought, oh, wow, I can't have any of these vices, sugar or alcohol.  You know what?  Maybe I'll have some coffee because I love coffee.  And I really struggled to give it up.  The doctor even said, you know what?  One coffee a day is okay.  I was drinking probably one to two and I was drinking it with heavy cream, no sugar.  Basically, a regular diet plan is, you know, on keto, I would eat bacon and eggs in the morning.  I would use butter and I would have a coffee with some cream.  And then in the afternoon, I would have salad with chicken with some dressing that I had made with olive oil, no balsamic vinegar.  You can use red wine vinegar, but no balsamic because it has sugar in it.  And then for dinner, I would have a piece of meat and greens, and that would be it.  That's all I would eat.  If I was really hungry, I would have fruit, but it was only berries because on keto, you can eat berries.  You can't really eat any other fruit, and then with a little bit of cream.  I was really diligent about my diet.  I felt really good.  Inflammation cleared up.  I felt my head was very clear.  I didn't have any headaches anymore.  I didn't have any mood swings.  Even on IVF meds, I didn't have mood swings when I was on keto, which I thought was really interesting.  And I just felt good.  Like, I just felt like I was being very healthy.  And I mean, the thing is with keto, it's, you know, gearing up for the egg retrieval.  You're, you're determined to do it, but it's a very difficult lifestyle to keep up.  I'm sure I've got some people in common saying, I've been doing keto for four years.  It's amazing.  Blah, blah, blah for me.  It was difficult.  But again, leading up to your egg retrieval, I would be as stringent with your diet as you can possibly be.  I've talked to some women and they even say that they didn't eat anything other than steak and the occasional greens.  They were doing the intermittent fasting.  They would have a coffee in the morning with cream and then they would eat at night a steak.  That's it.  A ribeye with lots of marbled fat.  That's it.  I'm like, no.  Okay.  Interestingly enough, I did talk to a doctor at a CNY fertility in Syracuse, Dr.  Keltz, and he said that you should be on the baby diet.  That's his diet.  So it stands for butter, eggs, bacon, something else, and ice cream.  Oh, beef and ice cream.  And that's a little too hard for me.  I couldn't do it.  He said vegetables are evil.  I shouldn't eat them.  I thought green vegetables.  I don't know.  I really like them.  So, but he said that he's seen women with miraculous results, just eating that diet.  And when I say ice cream, it's like a special concoction ice cream that he's created.  It's not regular ice cream with sugar in it that you get at the grocery store.  I think it's like Egg with heavy cream.  Those are the things that I did.  In terms of exercise, I just did some moderate walking.  I also did fertility yoga.  I will leave a link in the description of who I was watching.  And her name is Yoga Yin.  She's on YouTube.  She does all these amazing fertility videos.  It's very calm.  It's very relaxed.  She does egg quality yoga.  She'll do yoga for reoccurring miscarriage, yoga for the two week wait, yoga for uterine lining thickness.  I mean, she covers it all.  She's great.  And I guess part two of this video will be, you know, were my results successful for when that day comes when we do the transfer.  So that'll be my next video.  At least this is a two part series.  That's how we'll look at it.  OK, well, this is the retrieval and then gearing up for the transfer.  and then was a transfer a success.  I don't know.  We'll have to find out.  Anyways, thank you so much for watching this video.  Thank you for liking and subscribing.  And also, please take care during this coronavirus outbreak.  Stay safe, stay healthy, wash your hands, wear a mask if you have to, self-isolate, do all the things that you need to do.  Good luck.  to all the women out there, I should say, that are struggling with infertility as well as the pregnant women.  But all of the women that are going through infertility, it's very hard.  And just know that there's a lot of women like you out there.  And I hope that everything works out for you.

So as we all know, Joe Biden was inaugurated today, maybe yesterday, depending on what time zone you're in.  And firstly, I believe congratulations are in order for my American audience.  You ended fascism.  You toppled a dictator, ended racism.  At least if you're watching the media, that's what you'd think was happening here.  I literally saw a picture that a guy posted on Twitter where he was crying.  He posted a picture of himself sobbing, saying, I can't believe this moment has occurred.  Sir, you are a grown man.  This was an election.  There was no... war that occurred.  There were no death camps that existed in America.  I seriously worry that we have people in their old age that buy into the media to this degree, to that hysteria to this degree.  It's scary times to live in.  But talking about the other side, if you were a plan truster, this wasn't even Joe Biden who was inaugurated.  Clearly, this was Donald Trump who had gotten serious facial reconstruction surgery.  Just wait.  Just you wait.  The big reveal is coming.  It's been a crazy election season.  Crazy few days for everyone.  I'm sure as Americans it was very chilling to see the inauguration where it basically looked like the end of Game of Thrones where the Mad Queen had come in and it's just troops upon troops.  There are more troops in the capital than in Afghanistan and Iraq combined right now.  26,000 just marching the streets to protect an inauguration that's being attended by a bunch of flags.  So that's, uh, yeah, that was pretty chilling for me to watch as well.  But my predictions here, I do think that after this moment for the next few months, we are going to enter a period of bliss, not necessarily for people who voted for Trump, but for general liberals in the population, the media, Hollywood, they are genuinely going to feel that the age of chaos is over.  COVID situation.  You're finally having a man in office who's going to ensure no one gets sick with COVID anymore or it's handled appropriately.  The riot's not going to happen anymore because we have a progressive leader who cares.  There's going to be unity and social cohesion.  We're all going to love and hug it out now.  It's just, it's going to be better.  And of course, this was fueled.  This belief is going to be fueled by the media and has been fueled by the media.  I don't think anyone is under the impression that Biden's going to be perfect, but there's just been such a stark difference between Trump and Biden's signal to the public that despite the fact, even if they don't think Biden is perfect, they still feel it's saint versus Satan.  It's heaven versus hell dictator versus democratic politician.  So there's going to be this brief period of bliss, but it is going to be brief because well, Biden is going to be able to sign a few executive orders.  You know, he'll take, put America back in the Paris climate accord, reverse all these things Trump did.  The real problems in America right now can't be fixed with a few executive orders.  They are social problems.  They are issues like the fact that half of America believes the other half are neo-Nazis and want them dead in some cases, or at the very least completely censored.  That issue is not going away unless Biden decides he's going to do a complete overhaul of the media, which he's not going to because they are supporting each other.  They're working together.  Riots in the streets.  That's not going away, in my opinion.  Why?  Well, you look in March, you're going to have the trial of Derek Chauvin, the guy who put his knee on George Floyd's neck, which resulted in his death.  And the cops that were there, they're all going on trial.  What happens if Black Lives Matter don't get the result that they want?  They're going to riot.  And are Kamala and Biden going to get rid of the police?  I don't think so.  The reality is that Biden is kind of a boring president.  He's an establishment Democrat.  He isn't an AOC outsider type.  He's not a Bernie type.  He knows not to disband the police because he knows that's going to lead to complete social chaos.  He knows that's going to lead to skyrocketing crime.  And you look at someone like Obama before, even he wasn't that different than Republican politicians.  You know, Obama actually deported more people than Donald Trump did.  He sent plenty of drone strikes, had wars going on.  Him and Joe built cages to put people in at the border.  Not that different from Republicans.  And eventually the progressive left, some of them already do realize this, I see them posting about it, but eventually the wider left and the people who are supporting Black Lives Matter, they're going to realize this.  The police aren't gone.  Nothing's happened.  Black people are still being shot in the streets.  Actually, America isn't that different from when Trump was in office.  And you guys haven't done anything to fix these big asks that we have.  Because, you know, quite frankly, it doesn't matter who's in office, Trump, Biden, Obama, Bush, the shootings are going to happen.  That's just the reality.  And there's going to be this slow waking up of the populace.  The media are going to cover for Kamala and Biden for a long time.  They'll do fluff pieces.  They'll probably come up with some sort of phrase and talk about how this is like post-traumatic Trump syndrome.  The nation is still dealing with the residual effects of having Trump in office.  And they'll be able to blame this for a while, maybe even a year, maybe two years, and say all of the social issues, the COVID issues, the race riot issues that are still occurring, that's actually just residual Stuff spilling out from the Trump administration and era, but Biden's going to fix it.  Biden's going to fix it.  But eventually that mask is going to fall.  That facade is going to drop because you can only cover up these things from people for so long.  There's going to be economic fallout from COVID.  You're going to see mass censorship of conservatives continue.  You're going to see continued social cohesion issues.  And as this continues throughout Biden and Kamala's term, it's going to be harder and harder and harder for the media to cover it up.  And they will try to cover it up because if they decide to go as hard on Biden as they did on Trump, it totally delegitimizes everything they have done for the past six years.  They can't go around telling you Donald Trump is Satan, Hitler, all of these bad things combined, and then suddenly treat Biden the same way when they were acting like this is our savior come to fix America.  And post Trump, once you get the Democrats in, it's all going to calm down.  No one can be as bad as Trump.  All of these people are being killed because of Trump.  The reason there are riots, the reason there are shootings against black people in America, that's all because of Trump.  If they apply all those problems to Biden, which are still going to occur under him, they completely delegitimize themselves and everyone will realize they're frauds.  I think you definitely have to be prepared to see some serious infighting within the left and Democratic circles because you're going to have progressives very frustrated with the fact that not much has changed.  You're going to have them... completely pissed off with the democratic party and Biden and Kamala are going to have to make the decision to either raise and burn them and try to kick them out of the democratic conversation altogether or to embrace them.  And, have absolute chaos policies being put forward by their administration.  So get your popcorn out because I think you're about to see a serious dilemma within left-wing progressive and democratic circles.  And also just for the wider populace, once again, I don't want anything bad to happen for any administration.  We all want America to thrive.  We all want healing for you.  But my one hope is that No matter what, I think the Biden administration is not going to be this perfect administration or better, better administration than Trump.  I think things are going to get worse in America as poverty hits from COVID, as you have more and more social cohesion issues.  more and more censorship.  This is all going to get worse.  And my only hope for America is that this is going to wake a lot of normal people up to the lies that the media have told them.  They spent years and years telling you that once you get Trump out of office, things are going to be so much better, so much better.  And when Biden comes into office and that doesn't happen,","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the inauguration of Joe Biden and the potential consequences of his presidency.

Amongst the people of the northern marshlands, the white horse seems to have been held in a special honour, and to this day, a white horse rampant forms the cognizance of Hanover and Brunswick.  The English settlers brought this, their national emblem, with them to Britain, and cut its figure on the chalk downs as they advanced westward to mark the progress of their conquest.  The white horses on the Berkshire and Wiltshire hills still bear witness to their settlement.  England is a country of gentle gradients, slow moving rivers, long and well-drained valleys.  We tend to picture the old England as an emptier, cleaner version of our own rural England, but it was not.  Its aspect was quite different.  Like most of Wales and Scotland, it was a jungle, if one may use the word in a temperate zone context, in which settlement, although not new, had not yet taken very well.  By the time the Teutonic tribes arrived in the 5th century, the light network of Roman civilization which had been laid across this wilderness had by now fallen apart and was decaying.  The towns were long deserted, the roads beginning to be overgrown.  The achievement of the English in cultivating the face of Britain during the first five centuries of their settlement was much greater than that of all the people who came before them.  When they arrived, for example, the whole of the Midlands was still continuous primeval forest.  The river valleys in those areas were deserted until the English cleared and cultivated the heavy soils of the lowland valleys.  We're left to conclude that it was Anglo energy, Anglo will, which drove them to tackle the job of felling forests and claiming difficult soils for cultivation.  At least 98 of every 100 acres of land, which is now either farmland or is built on, was still in the state of nature in the 5th century.  The forests of Selwood, Wychwood, Savenake, Wyre, Arden, Sherwood, Epping, Kinver, Morph and the Chilterns were dark, continuous woodlands, vastly more extensive than they are now, and in which the voice of man had scarcely been heard since the time of the Mesolithic hunters.  From Kent to Hampshire, the Weald was unbroken forest.  In Sussex, Somerset and Lincolnshire, and neighbouring counties, there were enormous expanses of marsh and fen, huge populations of wildfowl and wading birds.  The Scottish and Welsh islands were virtually untouched.  We with our motorsaws, tractors, harvesters and machinery, can have very little idea of the slowness and pace upon our ancestors in carving out this great nation, where houses, streets,","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The German tribes in ancient times revered white horses as sacred animals, using their neighs and snorts for auguries.

Becoming a person who just hates.  That's about it.  That's really all I do is hate. Often when I'm talking about the reality of the widespread child abuse and human trafficking that takes place in America every day, I encounter weak people.  who don't have the stomach to acknowledge this evil, much less confront it.  Their denial and the cowardice of their unwillingness to face the reality that we live in dark times, and sometimes the monsters are indeed real, is precisely what has allowed these monsters to thrive and to prey on our children in the first place.  And I think it's only fair that we hold these cowards responsible for looking the other way and allowing it to continue. Epstein was hiding in plain sight.  We all knew about him.  We all knew what he was doing.  But we had no one.  that was, no... They shut down and they tell you that rampant child abuse and sex trafficking is, it's all a deranged fantasy of the right wing.  And if something like that was really happening, they would know about it.  Certainly, law enforcement would stop it.  You see, it makes them feel unsafe to think that they might live in a society where these kinds of things happen, and they certainly don't want to believe that.  They don't want to believe that these things might actually be facilitated by the same people that are supposed to be protecting them from evil.  That's an extreme inconsistency in the official narratives.  Something like that might force them to question other aspects of the narrative.  Weak people like that need to maintain their suspension of disbelief.  They need to hold on to it for dear life, because life might be a stage, but for these people, they're just the audience.  Audience members that squirm at the thought of having to actually participate in the play.  They'd rather just sit back and watch and look away during the scary parts.  But as I said, looking away makes you complicit.  Looking away is what people have done year after year as children have been abused, tortured, and murdered, and the monsters allowed to run amok.  Looking away is what people have been doing all over the country for decades, including in the case of Leo and Ella Stein.  and their Circle S Ranch.  In the early 1950s, Leo Stein, a Jewish student of Freudian psychology, and his wife Ella Stein, founded a boys' ranch in the Arizona desert outside of Phoenix.  Stein had previously been fired from the local school board and even investigated by the FBI for attempting to teach atheism, communism, and sex ed with a weird focus on what he perceived every boy's desire was, having sex with their mother.  But for some reason, and somehow, this man with no psychiatric training whatsoever was the man that, for some reason, the system in both Arizona and Southern California decided to send their troubled teens to.  They sent boys from ages 12 to 18 to his secluded compound in the middle of the desert.  His compound called Circle S Ranch for nearly 25 years.  And for nearly 25 years, Leo and his wife Ella abused and molested young boys repeatedly.  And despite several complaints with matching stories from boys who didn't know each other that spanned decades, who had been at the ranch decades apart, it was allowed to continue because nobody wanted to believe it was happening.  Even after a boy, Larry Middleton, who was staying at the ranch, was found dead in the desert in 1958.  And nobody was annoyed by the Steins' uncooperative nature.  And for some reason, nobody investigated further.  You see, the boy had simply wandered off into the desert.  He had simply wandered off in the desert and died of heat stroke.  And nobody bothered to investigate further when witnesses told investigators that Larry Middleton... had been beaten severely by Leo the day before his disappearance.  Nobody investigated further when another boy was told by Ellestine, Run away if you want.  You'll end up like the last guy who tried to escape.  In fact, this abuse was allowed to go on for 20 more years at Circle S Ranch.  until Arizona finally revoked Leo Stein's license in 1978, after a boy did manage to escape and finally found a social worker who would listen. What sort of allegations did the boy make? About questionable treatment practices.  the children being asked to simulate intercourse with a pillow.  The boys were asked to expose their genitals and describe the workings of each part.  Each child in the room was asked in turn to strike another child who was being punished.  My boy was asked, since he felt very strongly about his father, that he was to simulate eating his father's genitals at one point. I'd got there, and everybody was playing basketball and such, and I was still looking for this guy named Leo Stein, and I'd asked the staff there, who's this guy named Leo?  And he said, he's right behind you.  And I turned around, and his first words to me was, do you ever masturbate?  That's when I sort of got the hint that this place is a little weird, you know. Kids have told me that Leo Stein used to spit in boys' faces.  Did he ever do that to you? Yeah. Yeah.  About a hundred times that way.  When I first went there, he used to spit on me all the time. They more or less scared the hell out of all of us in order for us to conform to society. You don't say anything wrong about Papa Steiner, you get your face kicked in. Sometimes there was maybe 10, 20 kids beating up on just one kid. He used Freud, turned around into... into the way he wanted to use it.  You couldn't even call it Freudian.  It's Steinism.  All it is is just something.  Stein took and turned around. Donald was 15 years old when a homemade explosive device was found in his school locker.  The juvenile court sent him to Circle S. His mother made a visit there. On our Christmas visit, to the ranch.  We left the office and went out to the car and one of the staff members walked up towards us and my husband kept him busy talking some distance from the car.  and Donald and I went over to the car and I gave him his letter from his sister and he read it and he says, I'm not allowed to have mail here.  And so I said, oh Donnie, you know, and started to put my arms around him and he jumped back And he says, Oh, my God, Mother.  He says, Don't touch me.  He says, Because I came out to the car and hugged you when you came in June.  He said, I had to pretend to have intercourse with you in group.  And I had to do it every day until I had an ejaculation, and it took me 27 days.  And I was just stunned.  I was just stunned.  I didn't know what to do. I just backed off, and I didn't even cry.  Even the parents, like this mother, did nothing.  They were too cowardly to face the evil that was being inflicted on their own children.  All they wanted to do was believe it was normal, that everything was okay because the authorities knew what was best.  We see this same compliant behavior from people today.  Nobody wants to call the evil that's happening right now in front of them to their children by its name.  And so the monsters are allowed to continue to feed and grow. Mr.  Stein would say to a kid when he first came to the ranch, what does every boy want to do?  The kid didn't know.  Mr.  Stein would say, have intercourse with your mother. From that, it went to screwing pillows.  You know, the duffel bags, they... And he'd lay those out on the floor and he'd tell us, okay, lay on the pillows and reenact sex like that's your mother. Donald came home very frightened.  He would not interact with the family at all.  It took me about four months to the point where, you know, if we were in the kitchen together, my kitchen's about four foot wide, You know, that Donald did not back off away from me when I walked into the kitchen. What did happen to you? Becoming a person who just hates.  That's about it.  That's really all I do is hate.  I hate the courts.  I hate Stein.  It's just a mess.  You just put a kid away and forget about him.  Don't give a damn what happens to him. So what happened to Leo and Ella Stein?  Well, pretty much nothing.  The Steins were ordered to have no contact with children under 18, but there was no jail time.  Leo ended up dying of prostate cancer in 1994, and his wife died almost 20 years later, quietly in the same town where she and her husband had been abusing children for decades.  In fact, to this day, despite the Steins admitting to much of the sexual abuse, of course disguised as unorthodox therapy methods, while researching this case, I came across several posts on the internet from acquaintances of the Steins still in denial of what is now a matter of public record because they didn't want to believe that they had lived next door to monsters and done nothing.  And make no mistake, they don't want to refuse to believe this because what it would mean for the children.  They refuse to believe it because what it would mean for them. The Circle S is closed now, but that does not lessen the emotional harm that Donald and others say was done to them.  For all we know, there are worse places than Circle S operating today.  It is important to remember that the truth about Circle S came out almost by accident, and that right up to the last minute, government agencies in several states were using public money to subject youngsters to what Leo Stein called therapy.
