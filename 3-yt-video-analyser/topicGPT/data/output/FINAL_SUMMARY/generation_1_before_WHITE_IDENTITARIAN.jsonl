And it matters because we are here in the heart of England.  And how the heart of England votes is how the rest of the country will vote.  And to the astonishment of our political leaders in Westminster, to the horror of much of the media commentariat, and I do include Andrew Marr and the BBC in that, Yes, oh yes, absolutely.  And I think many others were very surprised, very surprised on the 23rd of June 2016.  I suspect President Obama was quite surprised as well.  David Cameron, of course, resigned the next day.  And, of course, we've been told by George Osborne... that half a million jobs would go, taxes were going to go up, interest rates would go up, house prices would collapse, foreign and direct investment would leave the country, plagues of black locusts would descend upon our land, and to the horror of all of them, and in particular, the one person who I think was most appalled when we heard that Birmingham and the West Midlands had voted to leave on that evening.  I think the person who was most horrified by the result that we decided to leave was one Anna Soubry.  So it was a great day.  It was a great day.  And the West Midlands in many ways did lead the way with some really big, big leave votes in some of these constituencies.  And, you know, the next year, We had a general election.  We were told Brexit means Brexit.  But we were also told by the Labour Party that they would respect the result of the referendum.  And don't forget that 500 members of Parliament had voted for Article 50, which became part of the law in this country.  That's important.  And what did it say?  What did it say?  It said, we will leave the European Union on March... at 11pm and we'll leave... with or without a withdrawal agreement.  and i really thought we'd won.  i really thought it was going to happen because i thought we lived in a civilized democratic nation that respected the rule of law.  i had underestimated.  I had underestimated the sheer levels of dishonesty amongst our political class.  They have done everything to prevent the greatest democratic exercise in the history of our nation from taking place, and I think the whole thing is an absolute disgrace.  I had to think, what am I going to do?  Am I going to stand aside?  Am I going to stand aside and be rolled over by these people to allow 25 years of work of my adult life to turn into dust because of the sheer dishonesty and duplicity of our political class?  Or am I going to stand up and fight.  And I chose to stand up and fight.  And that is why I formed the Brexit Party.  And I am absolutely thrilled that we have got men and women of the caliber, integrity, and courage who are standing with me in this election, such as those on this platform this evening with me.  Here's the important thing.  There's no point in just getting mad.  There's no point in just fulminating with rage against the treachery and duplicity of all of our political leaders.  What we now have to do is look calmly, and I think optimistically, at what is before us.  Here in the West Midlands, you have seen the choice.  You've seen the Brexit party menu.  What does it look like if you were considering going out and voting for Mrs May's Conservative Party?  Well, let me tell you, the two leading Conservative candidates in the West Midlands are both Remainers.  And the two leading Labour candidates in the West Midlands are?  who both support a second referendum because you didn't know what you were voting for, did you?  Did you know what you were voting for?  To think that Mrs May is going to bring back to the House of Commons for a fourth time I mean, talk about the definition of insanity.  Doing the same thing again and again and expecting a different result.  And by the way, it is not Mrs.  May's deal.  It is a new European treaty written by Monsieur Barnier with Angela Merkel looking over his shoulder.  Well, at least Angela Merkel is elected.  Barney is not elected.  Tusk's not elected.  And Jean-Claude Juncker, after lunch, has got no idea whether he was ever elected or anything.  Yeah, it's okay.  I'm going through my low booze, hypocritical stage at the moment.  But the point is, we are being deceived.  We're being told to leave one set of European treaties to sign up to another European treaty, which in many ways is as bad, if not worse, than the current arrangement.  And we will be damned if we're going to accept it.  And just to really put me in the mood, they've been negotiating with Mr.  Corbyn's Labour Party discussing the possibility of tying us in to the customs union on a permanent basis and alignment with single European market rules.  They've actually been attempting a coalition of the politicians against the people.  Well, let me tell you, We're the people, the Brexit Party are the people, and they are in for the shock of their lives come next Thursday.  So let us be positive.  Let us be upbeat.  Let us say that we believe in our country.  We believe in its people.  We believe in our ability to make our own laws.  We believe in our own ability to chart our own destiny.  We believe that we should be able to choose our own friends around the world and form whatever relationship We choose from them and we think starting with the Commonwealth would be a very good idea.  Well, what a surprising reaction.  I thought you were all narrow-minded little Englanders.  You see, they don't get it, do they?  They don't understand.  We want to be free.  We want to be proud of who we are as a country.  And we want... We want to live in a system of democracy, something that the generations that went before us sacrificed so much in two world wars to make sure that we could enjoy.  I truly believe as a nation we are now lions led by donkeys and it's time we did something about it and we will.  This is about more.  This is about far more now than just leaving the European Union.  This is about the very democratic system in our country.  It's about the bond of trust that needs to exist between the governors and the governed for our civilization to carry on with the underpinning that it has.  You see, democracy only works if the losers accept the result.  But our political class haven't accepted the result.  And so our job now is far bigger, far more ambitious than just campaigning for Brexit.  Our job now is to completely transform the political landscape in this country, to sweep aside a two party system that now serves only itself.","channel.id":"clxmi0ppu039dcdvi401cuowr","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCqDUhDiWJdk3inMxtEPOUWw","channel.name":"Steve Trueblue","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUHmaaBQi2V8e22QwrpXmsDVBW9ZsrwCgjmXs60=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2006-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"I was in Birmingham just a week before the 2016 referendum, meeting traders and shoppers, and I thought it went really well.

Originally it was written in the Hebrew language, and by the New Testament period it was Greek, and now predominantly in English.  Along the way, along the translations, certain words have lost their meaning.  It's estimated that the King James Bible has over 2700 translation errors.  and any other versions don't fare much better in correcting those.  While some words are difficult to translate, others have been deliberately twisted and completely mistranslated.  Here they are.  One of the most mistaken ideas is that most of the people in the United States and Europe, in fact nearly all the Christians in the world, are Gentiles.  The Greek word ethnos, which means nation, is all too frequently translated as Gentiles in the New Testament.  the term gentile is not used even once in the original bible manuscripts and there is a good reason for that.  there is no such word in either the hebrew or greek language.  the term gentile is a latin word and it was first used in the latin vulgate by jerome in the fourth century and at men of the same clan or race.  so the original meaning of gentiles does make sense.  the israelites had dispersed into europe and where did the apostles go to?  well to their kinsmen to their own people to the lost sheep of israel to the europeans.  they obeyed Christ's command to go only to the lost sheep of Israel and that's exactly what they did.  now around a thousand years later after Jerome the Latin term Gentile was suddenly changed to mean non-Jew.  So not only do we have the wrong word, we also have the wrong meaning.  The nations are the lost sheep of Israel, the nations that God promised Abraham's seed would become.  You're not a Gentile, but rather an Israelite.  Many times throughout the New Testament we get this term, this generation, seeming to mean a group of people only at that specific point in time.  but the word genos should be translated as race and not generation.  when john the baptist called his opponents a race of vipers he calls them this because they were the descendants of the fallen angels.  they were literally a corrupt race.  when christ declared that his opponents were responsible for the death of every prophet from abel to zechariah how could he hold any person accountable for crimes they hadn't committed?  he didn't.  he was holding a race accountable for all their evil deeds.  And when Peter called the Europeans an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, he was repeating the exact words what Moses said to the Israelites on Mount Sinai.  And this is because they were and still are the same people as in the Old Testament.  The word Jew did not come into existence until the late 18th century, whereas all the occurrences in the Bible took place thousands of years ago, up to around the end of the first century.  When it was first introduced, it replaced both Judean and Judahite.  Nevertheless, it maintained and combined both meanings as one.  A Judean would be any person who lived inside of the region, known as Judea.  Just like an American can mean anybody in America, which can be anyone from any origin.  Whilst a Judahite would specifically be a descendant of Judah.  Just like a Levite would only be a descendant of Levite.  This issue causes a lot of confusion.  Paul explained in Romans that he only cared about Israelites according to the flesh.  meaning real genetic kinsmen his own people and in 1 John he explains speaking of the antichrist that they came out from us but they were not from us.  Judea had a lot of different people at the time of Christ and this should alleviate some of the confusion.  Throughout Christ's ministry, he often referred to himself as the son of man, a sign of humbleness that God himself had come down to live and die just like us.  But is there any more special significance to this phrase?  Well, we must remember that God also called the prophets back in the Old Testament, such as Ezekiel, the son of man, Well what has been completely lost is that the word man is almost always actually Adam.  So what Christ is really calling himself is the son of Adam.  Now this must have vexed Christ's opponents as he called them sons of the devil.  They were descended from Cain who came from Eve and that serpent, the Satan, the fallen angel.  Anyone descended from a fallen angel is a devil and Cain was a devil just as Judas Iscariot whom Christ also called a devil.  So the purpose of calling himself the son of Adam is to show that Christ only came for Adamkind, God's original creation.  In today's churches there is no word more misunderstood than seed.  Seed, which comes from the word sperma, can only be a physical descendant.  yet over and over we are taught it now means spiritual.  that the serpent satan the fallen angel his seed is spiritual.  that abraham isaac and jacob their seed is also spiritual.  that all the descendants of israel are spiritual.  yet nowhere in the bible is this ever stated.  in genesis 3 15. it makes it very clear there is a war between two different seed lines Those of the woman, we must remember, Eve was created out of Adam.  They are closer even than a brother and sister.  Eve's seed is also Adam's seed.  Whilst the serpent's seed is the seed of the fallen angels.  And they are still with us today.

Or as you put in your article, the high price of steel grievances, the double standards. Yeah, I think this is increasingly a problem, especially for our politics as a country.  The way I think of it, I mean, do you remember the Sarah Jeong controversy where the New York Times hired Sarah Jeong as a writer who had a history, a several year long history of tweeting really vile things about white people, celebrating the fact that white people might stop breeding, for example, things that would be recognized as straightforwardly racist if they were said about black people.  In fact, Candace Owens, retweeted, she copy-pasted Sarah Jeong's tweets, but replaced the word white with black and got banned from Twitter almost instantly and then reinstated, which I think is telling.  Okay, so Yeah, I don't, I mean, so I'm not saying Sarah Jong, I think in the context, in her social context, those kind of tweets are not to be read as statements of eugenic intent or, you know, there's a kind of coded language that they, far left social justice warriors kind of use as a more of a signal of their wokeness rather than a really a commitment to exterminating white people.  But the problem is that if you're sort of a typical middle America white person who watches Fox News and you voted for Trump, maybe you don't like everything about him, and you're watching Fox News and you see New York Times hires writer who has said that she wants white people to stop breeding.  And New York Times did not apologize for this.  Think, nope.  You just have to imagine how that reads to the typical white person who perhaps has concerns about immigration, about changing country.  And the way in which they feel that there's nothing left for them on the left.  At this point, you have the biggest left-wing newspaper, the most respected, hiring a person who is just shamelessly hiring a person without apology, who has just said the most vile things about people that look like you.  And this is a huge problem for our politics.  I mean, you have to wonder why so many people are Trump supporters who know that Trump lies a lot.  They know that he's a scummy person, but they don't care.  because look at the alternative.  I mean, the alternative is just a half of the political spectrum that celebrates their non-existence.  That's a problem politically that is only getting worse and worse.  And yeah, I think it's just.  we have to be willing to call out anti-white racism.  And we can't settle for redefining the word racism. I was going to ask because I've heard people say there's no such thing as reverse racism. Yes.  I mean, that is the most... I mean, imagine, you could do this with any word.  Let's just redefine the word murder to only mean when you kill a black person.  We could do that.  We could decide, we could just decide to come up with a different word, but you can't change the underlying ethical status of an action by redefining it, right?  Like racism, you just call it something else.  It's still just as bad as it was yesterday when you change the terminology.  So yeah, this is an incredibly silly thing that's been done with that word.

The Mesolithic is characterised as the warm period following the ice-age. In this video I visit Cheddar gorge and the very cave in which Cheddar man was found.

Why am I taking all this camera gear up this cliff?  This rocky terrain, very prehistoric looking.  Well, it's because I'm actually looking for a caveman.  I'm gonna look for the location of the settlements of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in Britain.  But first I gotta climb up to the top of this gorge. Paleolithic Europe was very cold.  Middle Pleistocene glaciation in Britain was called the Anglian.  Neanderthals arrived 400,000 years ago and built flint hand axes like these.  It got so cold that they all left, and Britain was empty for over 100,000 years, until 60,000 years ago, when Neanderthals returned.  They were joined by the first modern humans about 40,000 years ago, but eventually all of these died or left too, until finally the Ice Age ended.  The end of the Ice Age saw a new era in European history.  The Mesolithic.  The warm climate resulted in a changed landscape.  The old pine forests and frozen plains were replaced by lush broadleaf woodlands.  The melted glaciers left canyons and gorges.  Many animals flourished, such as wisent and aurochs, as well as many smaller ones.  The European Mesolithic began over 14,000 years ago in the Balkans as a new race of hunter-gatherers arrived.  and they reached Britain by 11,700 years ago.  These semi-nomadic tribes are known by geneticists as Western hunter-gatherers, and they lived in caves, plateaus, and beneath rock shelters in valleys and gorges across Western and Central Europe.  Early anthropologists called these robust skulled people Cro-Magnons, and modern genetic analysis reveals that they all had blue eyes, swarthy complexions, and are associated with the maternal haplogroup U5.  Mesolithic hand axes look quite like those that came before.  But these geometric microliths are characteristic of the Mesolithic.  Geometric microliths come in three types, triangular, trapezoid or lunate.  All of them are carved from one of these, a microburin.  Hunter didn't need to carry all these tools with him, just a microburin from which he could make any tool he needed as and when it was required. While the microliths were for hunting small prey, rabbits, squirrels, they also hunted larger prey and that required tools such as these, javelins, harpoons, to catch fish, to kill deer and other large prey.  i have come to cheddar gorge because this is where the most famous mesolithic hunter-gatherer in the world was found cheddar man.  these stark cliff faces stunning views and beautiful scenery attract tourists to-day but would have been attractive to cave men for a different reason.  they provided shelter.  Deep inside the cliffs are these caves, and it was in this cave, Gough's cave, that Cheddar Man was found.  The Victorian explorer who found it named the main cavern after a cathedral.  It is likely the Mesolithic men attached a religious significance to caves as well. It was in a cave just like this that explorers and archaeologists in the late 19th century discovered that there were cave people living here.  And specifically, a very famous one was found in the early 20th century.  His skull was put on display at the beginning of the 20th century.  His bones had all been put together, full skeleton, by 1921.  And he was understood quite early on to be someone who was neither from the Paleolithic, nor from the Neolithic, someone in between, the Mesolithic, in between those times, the Middle Stone Age.  And the New Stone Age and the Old Stone Age, historically they were already recognized by different types of archaeological cultures arriving.  But now we know as well that these exact periods are marked by genetic shifts in the European landscape.  The Mesolithic period in Europe has a specific genetic identity of hunter-gatherers in Western Europe and Central Europe who form one genetic group and we take DNA from them.  Unlike the Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who preceded them, who lived very similar lifestyles but slightly different.  The main thing that distinguished the Paleolithic and the Mesolithic was the temperature.  The Ice Age ended and began what we call the Holocene.  It's what we still live in now.  Now, people in the Paleolithic were painting cave paintings and stuff like those I've looked at in other videos.  And there are also some Mesolithic cave paintings as well, slightly different.  But what's interesting is that the Mesolithic people did actually live in caves.  I don't think that was as common before, but we find that people definitely were living in caves in the Mesolithic.  So the term caveman really is appropriate for people like Ched and Man.  This genetic group that Cheddar Man belongs to, and he was found in the cave, not this specific cave, but one of the other caves in here, right here in Cheddar Gorge.  He's named after Cheddar Gorge, but This group is known as the Willebrunner Cluster, or as the Western hunter-gatherers, meaning Western European hunter-gatherers, as opposed to Eastern European hunter-gatherers.  The Eastern European hunter-gatherers were different because they had a lot of ancestry from Siberian hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic called Ancient North Eurasians.  Western hunter-gatherers didn't have that admixture.  but we call it the Willebrunner Cluster in scientific terms because the oldest of them all was found as about 14,000 year old Villabruna man.  And Villabruna man is found in Italy in a cave named after the guy who discovered it.  It's in northeast Italy.  The guy's name was Villabruna.  But one of the guys there, one of the skeletons there, they found from it viable DNA.  And they've analyzed that DNA, just like they've recently analyzed Cheddar man's DNA.  And they're related.  And they've also got other Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from across Europe.  From Spain, there's a famous one called Labrana man.  And all of them related.  And it's Villa Brunner Cluster because the Villa Brunner guy 14,000 years ago represents an early arrival of these people.  Villa Brunner Man is R1B haplogroup.  Most of the people with R1B in Europe now are from a much later migration of Indo-Europeans who brought that in.  But R1B was present in the Mesolithic in Europe as well among some Western hunter-gatherers like Villa Brunner Man.  Our man Chidaman, his maternal haplogroup was U5, and that was very common among the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, whereas the previous hunter-gatherers, the Paleolithic, had maternal haplogroups that we now associate with Asian people.  Whereas U5, which our man Cheddar Man had, I've got that too.  That's the same one I got from my mother.  And it's an indigenous European haplogroup.  U5 is very much associated with indigenous Europeans.  It's quite common up in northeastern Europe among the Sami as well.  Now, they also have quite a lot of Western hunter-gatherer admixture.  The further north in Europe you go, the more closely related people are to people like Cheddar Man. This map shows the amount of Western hunter-gatherer admixture in modern Europeans, and as you can see, it gets higher in the north.  This is a principal component analysis chart, and it shows us the genetic groups that modern and ancient populations belong to.  These are all modern Europeans, and these yellow bits are near Easterners, and the Turks are up here.  This purple blob is modern British people.  The blue shapes out here are all Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, and the green shapes are Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Britain.  You can see they are all nearer to modern Europeans than anything else.  This one here is Cheddar Man, and this one is Loche Boer Man, who I showed earlier, and this one is Villa Brunner Man. Wow.  Let's take a look at that.  really epic landscapes.  Funny thing the thing that Chetaman and Villabrunnaman have in common is they were both found in epic mountainous landscapes, both found in caves.  That's not a coincidence obviously because if they hadn't died in the cave then their bones wouldn't have been preserved.  so maybe we over exaggerate just how important caves were to them, their lifestyles, because those are the only places we find them for rather, you know, obvious reasons.  But else we know about mesolithic people?  well they came into europe just as the ice age was ending and it was much warmer.  it's nice.  it's like this.  maybe today's a warm day and um obviously the paleolithic people didn't live.  there weren't very many of them.  there was only about 3 000 people in the whole of western and central europe during the paleolithic at one stage.  estimates currently show well the Mesolithic people start to increase in number.  Now, it's still Stone Age, they're still cavemen, but it's maybe a little bit more advanced than you expect.  So these guys came in to Europe, started populating people like Willebrunner around 14,000 years ago.  Shortly after then, the Ice Age really finishes and it gets much warmer.  And they're able to flourish and hunt to a great degree.  You know, hunt quite well across Europe.  There's a lot of decent stuff for them to eat there.  This kind of landscape had all sorts of prey for them.  Great for hunting.  mountain goats, lots of deer.  No Mesolithic people in Britain ate deer and hunted deer because we found up in Yorkshire Mesolithic front, like head mounts of antlers.  Big antler things from deer.  They kill the deer and take the top part of the skull, put it on their head and wear it.  Why?  Only two possible reasons I can think of.  One is that they're trying to look like a deer as they're stalking it so it doesn't get too, you know, spooked and run away.  And they can get close enough that they can chuck a spear in it.  The other thing, it could be some kind of ceremonial shamanic thing.  There is a cave painting of a kind of half-deer, half-man creature in Europe.  Maybe that refers to this kind of hunter-gatherer shamanic cult where people would wear these horns or maybe it's both.  maybe they had a practical and a religious function.  you know another strange thing about the mesolithic people.  now mesolithic means stone age and neolithic is the final like new stone age and that's marked by the arrival of farming from the middle east.  thing about the Mesolithic is actually they did have farming already to some degree like not really advanced farming but they were growing in Western Europe types of grasses that were domesticated or came from the Middle East already and they were making bread out of wild grasses.  so they weren't like you know plowing fields.  they didn't have plows they didn't have domesticated oxen to draw plows but they did gather grass seeds and make flour and bread and they did even have grass seeds from the Middle East.  So that shows this is kind of not like your typical stereotypical Ooga Booga caveman.  Now the actual.  we may have very small amounts, very small amounts of legacy from the Paleolithic cavemen, the hunter-gatherers, from tiny refugia of them who maybe left a little legacy in subsequent hunter-gatherers.  But as I say, most of our hunter-gatherer DNA as Europeans today come from Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, the two groups, the Western hunter-gatherer and the Eastern hunter-gatherer.  And in Scandinavia and the Baltic, there was a mixed population, which we call Scandinavian hunter-gatherers, which are half and half.  eastern hunter-gatherers who were very actually quite closely related to western hunter-gatherers.  they're more.  they're more based in eastern europe and they have their ancestry up on the siberian tundra where the ancient north eurasians came from.  that's where their ancestors were and you can see my video about ancient north eurasians to learn more about them.  So another difference though between these two guys, Eastern hunter-gatherers and Scandinavian hunter-gatherers, they had the same complexion as me, quite pale.  but they didn't have eyes like me.  See, my eyes are greenish blue.  They all had brown eyes.  But Western hunter-gatherers, like Cheddar Man, who lived here, they had eyes like me, like bluish or greenish eyes.  Blue in the case of, actually, is the reality, all blue eyes.  In fact, every single Western hunter-gatherer had blue eyes.  The whole of Europe, Western Europe, from Britain down to Spain, Italy, all of Central Europe, all, everyone had blue eyes.  but they didn't have the same skin color as us.  they were a bit darker because they haven't got the same genes associated with our pale skin like eastern hunter-gatherers do so.  basically we've taken the eyes from the western hunter-gatherers and the skin from the eastern hunter-gatherers to make us look the way we are now and all indigenous european phenotypes.  but how dark were they?  hard to say.  obviously you've seen the news where they tried to make out who's very dark.  that's quite unlikely.  it was warm then but it wasn't that warm and you could get vitamin d deficiency quite easily if you didn't have a pale enough skin to absorb vitamin d through the sun like i can and like i'm doing right now.  it's lovely.  Maybe they could survive with dark skin.  There is a group of hunter-gatherers who live in a cold climate with dark skin and survive, like parts in Tasmania.  They can do that.  They did that for a while.  They're extinct now.  But generally, hunter-gatherers that do that, They need to eat a lot of shellfish, a lot.  They need to be near the beach so they can eat lots of crabs and mollusks and things like that could get their vitamin D because vitamin D is a is a chemical.  It's not really found.  It's not found in plant matter.  It's only found in animal matter produced by our bodies.  It's produced in.  You can get it in organs as well, they could eat a lot of liver.  Like Eskimos don't have very light skin, they don't have much sunlight, but they have to eat all the weird bits of animal that we don't eat now.  So maybe that's what Tehran and his people did if they were as dark as it said in the news.  But it's always a possibility.  they weren't that dark.  I mean, they could be as dark as an Arab, as dark as an Indian.  They weren't black people.  Sorry if you think they were Kangs, but it's not true.  They weren't black people.  Their closest living relatives are northern Europeans, and in every respect phenotypically they were European, except perhaps complexion.  So to call them any other ethnicity except European is just plain wrong.  Sorry. While Paleolithic cave paintings are famous for their realistic depiction of animals, Mesolithic art in Europe is rarer and focuses more on humans and rituals.  In Spain, the Western hunter-gatherers left many depictions of humans which had formerly been absent.  There are 45 human figures depicted in the caves of El Cogul.  Most famous are the nine women in the dance of Cogul.  who dance around an ithyphallic figure in what is apparently a fertility ritual.  in britain the tiny star-car pendant was found.  the eleven thousand year old artefact is the only engraved shale pendant found in europe.  Many argue this was a protective shamanic amulet, but who can say for sure what the markings mean?  The neighbours of the Western hunter-gatherers in Eastern Europe are called the Eastern hunter-gatherers, and they left a more impressive insight into their religion in the form of the Shigir idol from Russia.  the carvings on this eleven thousand five hundred year old larch idol were made with a beaver's jaw and teeth.  it is the oldest ritual wooden sculpture of a human figure in the world and was preserved because it was deposited into a bog just as much later.  nordic idols were Standing 2.8 meters high.  it was an imposing site and was most likely a god or some local spirit that these people worshipped.

Yeah, I have to have two brothers.  I meet them in Tangier, two brothers.  They're going to Spain. They're in Spain now? Yeah, they're in Spain now.  Why don't people legally apply? Why don't people try to go in legally? Hey, I haven't heard from you in like a week.  We were getting a little worried there.  Are you guys okay in Morocco?  What's going on? The other person, you can call your brother in Senegal.  You say, if you want to go in Spain, I have my brother here.  He can help you to go to Spain.  He'll ask me how much.  I give him the price.  2,500 euro, 2,000 euro, 4,000 euro.  When he come, he give me 4,000 euro.  I can give the boss.  Or when you go to the bank of Guantanamo, I do there 2,500 euro.  The rest, I put it money.  It's for me. Yeah, so we've been really busy.  It's actually pretty hard to get phone service out here.  So where to start?  Look, it's massive.  I won't lie, I'm pretty excited.  I can imagine.  There's a large-scale human trafficking organization here.  I know police intelligence here, they're actually having a crackdown on it at the moment.  But we've managed to get ourselves an interview, a frontline interview with one of the guys who actually traffics people.  So place them in a boat, puts them on a boat to Spain.  This guy's name, it's been pretty hard to get the interview, but he's agreed to do a video interview for us. He's agreed to be on video.  That is insane. There's a couple of issues here in Morocco, though.  I'm sure you're aware, but filming is really restrictive legally here.  It's pretty crazy.  There's checkpoints everywhere.  So bring the bare essentials that you can to get this done.  We'll break the cameras down.  We'll just put them in various compartments in the car.  There is some real ramifications if we do get caught.  There has been journalists jailed here and I think the fines are pretty huge and there could be some real jail time around that.  But we do need to jump on this quickly in the next couple of days. I'm booking tickets right now and I should be seeing you either tonight or first thing in the morning.  This is huge.  Okay, so we just got back from investigating and talking to some people at a little migrant holdout here in the mountains out of Ecuador, a little town on the coast of Morocco, right across from Spain, where tons of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are just sitting here waiting for their chance to get on a little dinghy raft to go over to Spain.  And it's been hours.  We've been waiting all day.  And our guy hasn't shown up.  He's nowhere to be found.  He's sending us Really brief messages.  Yes, no, back and forth.  He's super nervous about talking to us.  But I'm just going to kind of hold out here and see.  Because if we could talk to him and really figure out what's going on here, that would be huge.  So it's getting dark soon.  Probably going to have to interview him in the dark if he does show up.  My name is . I'm 20 years old.  I spent eight months here.  How do people get to Spain?  People have to spend a lot of money here.  They have to spend 2,000 euro, 4,000 euro or 2,500 euro.  You have to spend 2,500 dirham.  Well, in Nador, it's 2,000 euro. Euro.  Why is it more expensive here?  Longer distance? 2,500 dirham is 250 euro. Wow, from 10 years. But it's not guaranteed.  When you enter in a span, you are lucky.  When you don't enter, you have lost the money.  You try again to have another money to go.  Right. And how do you guarantee in Nador? When you are in the boat here, in Nador, You go to the other zone.  They say the international zone.  You are in Spain.  After you have one birth, they call it salvamento.  Salvamento is the Spanish name.  Salva.  Salva is to save you.  Salva.  To save you in the moment.  They come, they pick the person, and they go in Spain. How much money can you make per boat from the door to Spain? Well, you know, every person, you can have 2,000, 2,500, 4,000.  You have the totality.  50 person, you have to calculate.  50 person, you do 50 person.  Everybody, everybody, 2,500, 2,500.  When the boat enter, the boss have a lot of money.  But in this morning, The Moroccan man have him money. Who is the Moroccan man? The Moroccan man, the customer don't know it.  Only the boss will know it.  When you have to go to Spain, they take me, go to the beach, they enter to the boat, we go.  It's a business.  No black man can go, cannot go to Spain.  If you are not, if it's not business, if it's not business, you cannot go to Spain. How many people are sent over to Spain from here?  a week or a month? A week you can have, one day you can have 500 person.  One day you can have 500 persons, but the month you can have 2,000.  Or when you have a lot of security, in the whole of the weekend you can have 100, 200.  But when the security is so easy, you can have the day 500 persons. Do you get your money back if the boat doesn't make it? Yeah, you get your money back.  When you do it, guarantee.  But when you give... When you give the money in your boss, he can say, when you touch the water, you lose it.  But when you do it, guarantee, if you don't enter, the money is your money. So you can pay more for a guarantee? Yeah, where the guarantee, you have one bank, you go there, you put your money there, you have the court.  The court is your court.  When you enter, you call, you call your boss, take the court.  After the boss take the court, go to the bank and receive the money. How do you help the boss? Because in our country, it's so difficult to have a visa.  It's so difficult to have a visa.  When you have money to give the government, when I... Is it okay? Stop there. So our guy is just one off.  We just had a local farmer pull up and the car coming out into this field with the light on.  Thought it was a sting operation, I guess.  They're so worried that we're working with the cops.  We're trying to set them up.  We're trying to get them arrested.  And we just sprinted into the woods.  And he's got a laugh mic.  He's gone.  There's a good chance he's not going to come back.  He's going to think that this is all a setup.  We're going to lose and burn all of our contacts in this area.  We've been cultivating contacts for a week here, paying guys to talk to these people.  And now they're going to think we're cops because of a farmer.  I guess we could wait around and hope he comes back.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"A journalist is investigating human trafficking in Morocco, where migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are attempting to reach Spain.

Welcome to Hellworld.  And no, your eyes aren't deceiving you.  They tweeted it from the CBC Kids News account.  You know, the one whose motto is real news delivered by real kids.  A little sidebar, last year I did a story on the CBC kids news program and I said the plan is to weaponize these kids into lefty news soldiers.  and right from the first episode they were indoctrinating children on gender theory and LGBTQ trans stuff.  And now they're airing a drag kid documentary.  How's that slippery slope?  I'm not going to play the entire video because I don't want you to have to endure this demented promo.  It literally made my stomach turn.  Please, someone tell me, what purpose does this serve?  We are paying for this obscene doc after all.  We have a right to know how this programming is appropriate for children.  Who is going to watch this besides some very sick individuals?  And how is this not sexualizing kids?  You've got a child gyrating with booty shorts on.  If this was a little girl, lefties would be up in arms.  Remember the outrage over toddlers in tiaras?  But this is perfectly acceptable because it's a bunch of young boys, huh?  And for the network that preaches diversity 24-7, the lineup of kids isn't exactly multi-culti.  Where's the Arab Muslim trans kid?  Or the Indian trans boy?  or the Orthodox Jewish trans kid.  I mean, this isn't exactly a stretch for Afghanis, where child sex slavery is rampant.  I mean, they even have a name for it.  It's called bacha bazi.  But to see this sort of practice being aired on public TV by Canada's national broadcaster is absolutely despicable.  Children need to be protected, not thrown to the wolves.  How is this not child abuse on behalf of the parents?  What kind of adult puts their young, vulnerable, and trusting son on display in this manner?  As a mother myself, this makes me ill.  This is child exploitation.  They're being paraded out for attention, likely by their sicko mothers that have Munchausen's by proxy.  Living in clown world, we're seeing drag kids everywhere.  From RuPaul's Drag Show to that 11-year-old Desmond is Amazing.  Drag queens are even selling cookies to children.  Remember Chips Ahoy on Mother's Day?  I'm so sick of this shit, honestly.  Let's call it what it really is.  Grooming under the guise of tolerance.  And naive people who want to virtue signal their moral superiority are falling for it hook, line, and sinker.  Don't believe me?  Then why are so many of these storytime drag queens pedophiles with criminal histories of sexually abusing children?  Confusing kids about gender isn't healthy.  Is this doc going to discuss how many children regret sexual reassignment surgery after they undergo it?  Or how about the high level of mental illness and suicide in the trans community?  Manipulating kids whose brains are not developed enough to understand the implications of hormone injections or to disseminate concepts like gender fluidity is disgusting.  And to have Canada's public broadcaster at the forefront of it is criminal.  If we cannot protect our children, what is even the point for the West to exist?  I don't know about you, but I don't want to be part of a society that allows and promotes this degradation.  Using our tax dollars to push this degenerate agenda is evil.  Time for the CBC to be defunded now and the higher ups who okayed this program fired immediately.  And for the people out there who call me a fascist or a homophobe or transphobe for not accepting drag kids, you know the types, let him express himself.  He's not hurting anyone.  He's having fun.  Well, I don't give a shit.  I will never back down on this issue.  What is happening to these kids is beyond wrong.  It's satanic.  The CBC is out of its mind airing this stuff and allowing innocent children to be exploited.  Desmond is Amazing's mother just recently complained about pedophiles sexualizing her son.  Like you didn't see this coming, lady.  Your child was videotaped dressed as Gwen Stefani taking money on a stage at a gay club.  What did you think was going to happen?  He also appeared in a YouTube video with convicted killer Michael Alling talking about ketamine and with a Rohypnol painting behind him.  You know the date.  rape drug?  Who knows what has happened to Desmond?  It is tragic.  And yet the mother doesn't get charged with child abuse.  And she continues to parade her victim son around like a show pony.  And the mainstream media eats it up.  Anyways, a white pill here is how many Canadians feel the same rage I do over this documentary.  Take a look at that Twitter ratio in the comments.  They just keep going and going and going and going.  Maybe there's hope for Canadians after all.  Normal, healthy-minded people who genuinely care about children's well-being are rejecting drag kids en masse.  It's about time.

In this video I'll show you some of the amazing Neolithic and Bronze Age history found on Exmoor and Dartmoor and I will also teach you some of the enchanting local folklore of the Moors. I've just woken up here on Dartmoor slept out on the moors.  it was a bit windy when I went to bed but it was dry and I woke up in a soaking wet tent.  now I've camped out here next to this circular enclosure right up on the hills on a windy desolate place.  why would someone stack these rocks in this way?  is it a stone circle?  it seems like one a bit doesn't it?  but actually this is built in the Bronze Age and it was only intended as an animal enclosure.  sometimes the animals here they wander in and out of it.  obviously it doesn't work to keep them in but a few thousand years ago maybe three thousand years ago they were a bit higher and it worked to keep the animals inside.  it's remembered even today what its original purpose was.  no one calls it a stone circle.  it's called a pound because it's a compound for animals and it always has been but the name that it's had since medieval times is grim's pound.  grim you may or may not be aware is one of the names of the Norse god Odin.  Gr\u00edmr means the masked one or the hooded one the one who is a concealing thing.  And that is the name which Odin gives himself when he comes to us in the form of a man, when he is disguised as a man, usually an elderly man in the stories, some grey-bearded, sort of unassuming character, maybe a beggar.  Somehow there must have been a Norse influence here, and somehow this Bronze Age Indo-European animal compound became associated with a pagan god.  and can we assume therefore that this place was also the site of pagan rituals to that god?  who knows it's a mysterious place.  i'm sure that anyone coming here a thousand years ago would have felt that this was an eerie and magical place and perhaps they weren't aware of what kind of a person would have built an animal enclosure of this kind, except a god.  Here's the gate.  Presumably there was a wooden gate here at one point, and they'd have a corral and just, you know, hide all their animals in here through this passageway.  It's hard to understand how exactly, why they did it all with stone and why they didn't just use wood.  Much cheaper and easier.  This circular enclosure is inside Grimm's Pound.  Doesn't look like much.  And no, it's not a stone circle.  This is the outline of a Bronze Age hut.  very, very small dwelling place.  The stones probably just formed the base, you know, and then afterwards on top of it was a structure made of wood and mud or whatever.  Now, I suppose that this is too small for it to be an all year round dwelling place, so I'm going to guess, being that the Indo-Europeans were pastoralists, practicing transhumance, they came up onto the moor during some seasons, bring their animals into this pen, Lived in here for a part of the year or at least the and the herders who were responsible for these animals lived here.  It's quite amazing that this is just still here after all these thousands of years.  I think one of the main reasons is that it's just such a remote and secluded spot and no one's bothered to come and collect this stone and use it to build a church or anything.  so here we have the humble remains of some cattle herder from thousands of years ago and his house is still here and his animal compound is still here.  but who's to say whether this little hut hasn't had more significance to subsequent generations of people living in Britain.  they may have even attached some mythological significance to this place. The most obvious symbol of the transition from Neolithic to Bronze Age Britain is the burial mound or barrow.  Exmoor has loads of them, built by the Beaker folk 4,000 years ago.  Even today, locals honor their dead on these barrows, but in a new way, with engraved stones left on top.  Back to Dartmoor, and it's time to look for a stone circle. The gatekeepers.  They will not allow us to pass the bridge.  Trolls in the guise of horses.  Hengist and Horser.  Hello.  Few things are quite as atmospheric and evocative as the sight of an English moor with an ancient Neolithic stone circle.  These have captivated the imaginations of British people for thousands of years.  No one for most of their history has known where they came from.  Now we know that they were built not by our ancestors so much as well.  to an extent they were our ancestors but more in.  it's more to the point that they were the people who preceded the majority of our ancestors because our people really arrived in the end of the Neolithic and they built those Bronze Age structures like Grimms Pound that I showed you just before.  These Neolithic structures were here already when they arrived.  And they must have been as captivated by the shocking structures as we are.  These enormous stones standing solemnly like ancient people in a circle.  Not all of them are aligned to the sun or the stars as far as we can tell, but some of them appear to be.  So we can't really be certain of what exactly their function was.  And that makes them all the more fascinating.  This one in this desolate landscape, when it was built, the landscape was very much as it is now, desolate.  You see, this landscape is very, very ancient, but also not natural.  It's a man-made landscape.  But it's so ancient that it feels like a part of nature.  It feels like something that's been here for so long.  I mean, the Neolithic is the end of the Stone Age.  This landscape has not changed since then.  There's nothing you can see, except for those pine trees, which are modern, of course.  But everything else is Neolithic.  And, I mean, it's been a long time since native broadleaf forests have been here, like the Stone Age, basically.  This thing's been here as well since the Stone Age.  I mean... We know for certain, all we can say for certain about these is that they had a religious function.  Stonehenge is associated with sacrifices.  People brought pigs there for sacrifice.  Pigs were a really important food for the Neolithic people.  They were very big on pigs.  And people brought pigs from as far away as Orkney all the way to Stonehenge to sacrifice them there.  Did people bring pigs here to sacrifice?  Was this an important site of pilgrimage?  I don't know.  But it's quite reasonable to think that there were animal sacrifices here.  But to who?  To which god?  We'll never know.  We'll never know the names of the gods that they worshipped, or goddesses.  We'll never know whether these were associated with a particular deity.  We'll never know that.  But we do know that there was pig sacrifices.  And we know that this culture of Neolithic stone circles extended over a vast distance from France, further south as well in the Mediterranean, all the way up to the Northern Orkney Islands, which are north of Scotland, and that Britain is a hotspot for them.  And here on Dartmoor, they still seem like they're more at home on the landscape than I am, or any of the modern people who have come here since.  the sheep and the stones. Water is a magical element with deep spiritual meanings in most religions including those of our ancestors.  In Exmoor and Dartmoor one finds these extraordinary clapper bridges made from enormous stones.  Some claim they date back to the Neolithic but they may only go back as far as the Anglo-Saxons.  These women are Lithuanian pagans on holiday in Dartmoor, and they're honouring the bridge with their music.  Some of these tourists are less welcome, though. Nice doggy.  Get out of the way, nice dog.  Get out of the way, dog.  Is it dead? I need to cross this clapper bridge to reach a magic stone. As you can see here, this is a naturally forming hole in the rock.  And the funny thing is, in Britain, these have a special folk significance in folklore.  This particular one, it leads into the water.  So the idea here, and it's big enough for a full grown human to go through.  So around here, it's said that if you jump into the water through this hole, and you're a woman, you'll get pregnant.  So it's a fertility.  And similar things elsewhere occur.  But also there's kind of a belief that going through naturally forming holes in folklore in Britain it will actually heal you of ailments.  So this one's unique because it's more about fertility.  The holes that form in trees have traditionally been used to, you know, like a natural forming hole in the tree.  You push your baby through the hole and that will make sure it's strong and it will cure it of any ailments it might be suffering from.  To bring things back to the Neolithic stuff, up on the northern islands of Orkney, They used to be a stone among the many standing stones there in the Neolithic.  There used to be one there which had a hole in it.  It was a standing stone with a big hole.  Pretty impressive.  I don't know what it was called in the Neolithic times, but when the Vikings took over Orkney, they named it Odin's Stone.  And some people think that's because the hole was considered to be representative of Odin's eye.  As good an explanation as any eye could come up with.  Funnily enough, right up until the 19th century, the local people believed that putting your child through the hole or climbing through the hole yourself would have health and healing properties.  And that is something that people continue to do until very recently when a farmer who owned the land that the Odin stone stood on dynamited the stone because he was so fed up with people coming there and doing their pagan practices.  I'm not sure if it was a religious rebellion that the farmer did this or just he just didn't like people trespassing on his property.  In either case, we've lost a very valuable piece of our history and our culture by losing that stone.  But this stone is not in risk of being dynamited.  I think it's because it's on the public national park.  So if ever you're in Dartmoor, jump through here and you'll have a baby.  I don't think I'll go through though because the water's a bit low and it's not enough room for me to swim and I don't think I've got much chance of getting pregnant anyhow. Upriver from Tar Steps in Exmoor is this wishing tree.  Too many wishes were made and it died from all the coins hammered into it.  Now it resembles a piece of modern art. With this project the artist seeks to decolonize and rewild currency from a natural perspective. This is a memorial stone erected for a 6th century Christian Celt who claimed descent from the 1st century Celtic chief Caractacus, who was a hero resisting the Romans.

On Monday the Italian Senate passed Salvini's new security bill by a large margin.  The bill had already been passed by the House of Deputies, but it needed to be passed by the Senate before summer recess began on Wednesday.  Salvini used a procedure where he coupled the security bill with a confidence vote in order to speed up the process.  According to numerous media sources, Salvini would have actually had to resign as Interior Minister had the vote failed.  The new bill further cracks down on human trafficking as well as drug smuggling and organized crime.  The key provision of the bill increases fines for NGO ships engaged in human trafficking.  The ships now face fines of up to 1 million euros.  Italy is currently in a standoff with multiple NGO ships.  The latest development is that American actor Richard Gere is apparently on board a trafficking ship operated by the Spanish NGO Open Arms.  That ship has picked up a load of economic migrants and is expected to attempt to ferry them to an Italian port.  A bundle of lawsuits is also being prepared to try to force other European governments to rein in NGOs that are engaged in criminal trafficking activity in the Mediterranean.  Salvini has been engaged in a whirlwind of press conferences and public rallies.  Now, for the first time, he is openly calling for an early snap election.  Currently, Salvini's Lega Party rules Italy in a coalition government with the Five Star Movement.  Many English language media outlets claim Five Star is a right-wing party.  This is just not true.  It is a big tent anti-establishment populist party.  They have people from all over the spectrum, even people who are very left-wing.  In some ways, you can compare Five Star to the French Yellow Vest movement.  In some ways, you can compare it to Zelensky's party in Ukraine.  It is not easily defined using conventional left-right terminology.  In the 2018 general election, Five Star won a dramatic 33.7%, and Lega won 17.4%.  The leaders of the two parties became co-deputy prime ministers, with Salvini also getting the position of interior minister, and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio becoming the minister of economic and social development.  The coalition between Lega and Five Star was based in part on the fact that both parties were willing to defy the EU on several key issues.  However, the coalition has been turning sour as Lega has risen and Five Star has fallen in popularity.  In the 2019 EU election, Lega got 34.3% and Five Star only got 17.1%.  They basically switched places in one year's time.  Currently, Salvini's Lega party is polling in the high 30s and the center-right coalition is collectively polling over 50%.  The center-right coalition consists of Lega, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, and Fratelli di Italia, or Brothers of Italy.  Forza Italia was once the dominant party of the center-right coalition.  Now they are competing with Fratelli for second place.  Based on current polls, if an early election was held now, Lega and Fratelli could potentially take over 50% of the seats.  They could potentially form a coalition government without even needing the help of Berlusconi's Forza Italia.  Five Star seems to be playing it cool and claims they are not afraid of an early snap election.  Among other things, Salvini says a new snap election would allow the government to rein in out-of-control activist judges.  He wants to bring an end to the judiciary attempting to usurp the entire Italian government.  Of course, right now there is a battle going on where the globalists in the EU pick and choose which countries they think that the judges should be given more power.  Matteo says he will not be taking a summer vacation, but will be working non-stop.  However, he said he would trade his suits for summer wear.  Recently, Salvini showed up at the annual Pompeto Beach Party, where he was given control of the DJ booth.  The hysterical media has spent the past week trying to invent scandals.  They claimed Salvini disgraced his office by standing too close to a go-go dancer and then posing with the girl while she took a selfie.  Except the photos of Salvini and the go-go dancer were from a 2016 beach party before he ever became interior minister.  They claim Salvini disgraced the national anthem of Italy by playing it at a beach party while wearing a swimsuit.  They claimed Salvini misused public resources because a police officer ferried his son on a law enforcement jet ski.  Anything to create a manufactured scandal.  If an early snap election were to take place, it is hard to even imagine how hysterical the media is going to become.  Across Europe, globalist politicians in the media are hyping Russia-Lega collusion conspiracies with increasing fanaticism.  I can remember when the media hysterically attacked Berlusconi.  This is going to be off the charts.  The Western media is going to elevate Matteo from Italian Trump to brutal dictator of a rogue state.  By the way, these alleged journalists who refer to everyone as M-X Trump or M-Y Trump, what they are saying is they do not actually have any knowledge of the subject matter and they are just writing clickbait aimed at a low information audience.  Also, I am looking forward to upcoming regional elections in Calabria, Emilia-Romagna, and Umbria.  All of these regions are currently controlled by the left.  It is going to be very exciting to see if they can be flipped.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.  Click the like button, post a comment, tell me what you think.

It is the largest independent trade union on the planet, with more than 2.3 million members, with a history that's longer than 125 years.  But what many people do not know is that the IG Metal isn't about metal anymore, not just metal anymore.  Actually, the IG Metal deals with crowd workers and the working condition of crowd workers and has been doing so for several years.  And that of course also includes YouTubers.  If the IG Metal once decides to enter into a certain fight, then they will not relent.  They will fight this to the very end.  And for us YouTubers, completely new times begin.  It is no longer the case that we are helpless against YouTube.  With the IG Metal we have a strong, strong partner. especially when the YouTubers are with us.  We know from experience that together we can achieve a lot.  And this is where the YouTubers Union comes into play.  It's quite a young union, only founded in 2018, but already 15,000 members strong.  During this time, a lot has already been achieved.  meetings with the YouTube management, even initial concessions and a lot of press. Attention YouTube, here we go.  Being a YouTuber is a dream job for lots of young people.  But two years ago YouTube turned the dream job into a nightmare.  The real YouTubers that are the reason for YouTube's big success are getting censored, deleted, erased and hidden.  Making a living on YouTube is actually no longer possible.  Many channels have entirely disappeared or are now reduced to a minimum.  There is no job security.  It seems like YouTube doesn't want independent YouTubers anymore.  Because now YouTube prefers like channels run by TV stations or Hollywood celebrities.  And for those guys completely different rules apply.  They won't be censored, they won't be erased, they won't be kicked out.  YouTube is actually pushing these guys with everything they have.  All this happens simply out of greed for profit, simply because advertisers prefer Will Smith over the independent YouTuber.  But YouTube should not be so sure about that strategy.  Since one year we have the YouTubers Union and we have thousands of YouTubers that are now united and picked up the fight.  The only problem is that so far we haven't been able to achieve much.  But exactly that is going to change now.  IG Metal, the largest independent trade union on the planet and the YouTubers Union are now joining forces with the clear goal to bring back the old YouTube.  We have founded the joint venture FairTube.  And now time will change for YouTube, since we have 125 years of experience in the fight against injustice.  and over 2 million members plus superb lawyers are now joining forces with thousands of YouTubers who are really unhappy with the way things go.  Together I think we are completely unbeatable.  FairTube is unbeatable.  We want YouTube to actually perform massive changes on their strategy for the benefit of the creators and for the benefit of the entire platform.  And in this video we're going to explain to you how we will achieve it and at the same time we're asking for your support.  Hello everybody, I'm J\u00f6rg Sprave, founder of the YouTubers Union and we're here in the 15th floor of the IG Metal building in Frankfurt and I'm here with Christiane Benner.  Hello Christiane.  Hello J\u00f6rg.  What is your job at the IG Metal? I've been a member of IG Metall for more than 30 years now.  I've been working as a youth representative and as member of a works council and for more than 20 years I'm working full-time employed for IG Metall and now I'm vice president of this wonderful union and my job is social justice. It's been quite turbulent lately, that's true.  But only through FairTube, our joint venture, can we make things change.  And what that means is exactly what we're going to explain to you now. Transparency.  Publish everything.  Categories, procedures, rules. You would assume that everybody would want this, but in reality that's not the case.  YouTube keeps everything secret.  The rules for the bots and the censors, their decisions, the processes that they use to promote or hide a video, it's all kept secret.  And that is not the way how to treat a partner.  justify demonetization and deletion. Vaguely formulated rules are not enough.  We demand exact and comprehensible reason for every decision. Let us talk to a human being. YouTubers are human beings and deserve respect.  No more standard emails from anonymous servers.  People should make the decisions, not machines.  YouTubers must have real human beings to talk to and not anonymous email addresses.  Establish a neutral dispute resolution board. YouTube calls the YouTubers partners, but in reality, that's not the case.  YouTube has all the power, and this is not how a partnership works.  If there are serious disputes, a third neutral party has to decide.  And this works wonderfully elsewhere, by the way. IG Metall participates in the crowdsourcing code of conduct.  This is a voluntary commitment about social standards by crowd working platforms.  We have such an arbitration board and it works well.  Give us a seat at the table. The entire success of the company depends on the creative output of the YouTubers.  Therefore, it is only fair that YouTubers can also participate in the decision making and the future of the platform.  We demand the establishment of an advisory board that is fully integrated in all decision making and has something to say about that.  Participate in the process. These are our demands and our goal is to implement them as soon as possible. And now, pay attention, C-level managers at YouTube.  You have exactly four weeks to enter into negotiations with us.  Tick-tock.  The clock is ticking.  You know how to reach us.  We're looking forward to that. We delivered our demands to YouTube in Hamburg and we asked them to enter into negotiations within the next four weeks. We have three main powerful strategies.  Two of them are for the lawyers and one of them is based on your participation.  Plus also lots of smaller topics and issues. First, there is the issue of potential false self-employment of the YouTubers. That is pure dynamite.  But because the issue is rather complex, we have an expert here, Dr.  Thomas Klebe, certainly one of the most renowned experts on labour law in Europe.  Thomas, what is false self-employment? Thanks a lot for your generous introduction.  False self-employment means that someone is working as a self-employed person, but in fact they are an employee, with all the protection employees have, like protection against unfair dismissals, vacation and social security.  There is some evidence that YouTubers may be falsely self-employed.  For example, they are continuously rated, and monitored by YouTube, and only YouTube manages the relationship with advertisers.  And if you take all this information about the working relationship into account, it's hard to say that these are independent video producers. And if it turns out in court that YouTubers are indeed falsely self-employed, what consequences would that have for YouTube? Well, then the YouTubers would be employees with all the protections and benefits, and that would be very, very expensive for YouTube, especially when you take in regard the social insurances. But that means it would really threaten the whole business model. That is why we want to see our demands met.  If YouTube meets them, then YouTubers will be real partners. Well, there's a lot of heated discussion among policy makers.  For example, they are talking about expanding the definition of employee.  And one thing is certain, YouTubers need more rights. If YouTube meets our demands, YouTubers will be real partners.  Then this will be no issue.  But if YouTube does not talk to us, we will certainly put the question of false self-employment to the test in court.  We will certainly put the question of false self-employment to the test in court. There are many possibilities.  It will be interesting and exciting. The second strategy has to do with YouTube's secrecy, which could be illegal.  Every video that a YouTuber uploads will be actually inspected by a whole army of bots and human sensors and then put into categories.  These categories can then be excluded by the advertisers.  Which means that this video won't make any money and won't go anywhere in terms of views.  It will be a sitting duck.  the video will hardly earn any money and see very few views.  The YouTuber can only guess why and he can't do anything about it. That's not legal.  Under the GDPR platforms like YouTube must give anyone they have personal data about a copy of this data. The General Data Protection Regulation applies to all companies which process personal data.  And these are laws that YouTube has to follow as well. And what happens if it turns out that YouTube does indeed violate the GDPR? Violations of the GDPR can be punished with a fine of 4% of the worldwide revenue of the previous year. In 2018, YouTube made billions of dollars.  So the fine could be tremendous. Wow, a high price for useless secrecy. Every single violation may lead to another fine. So YouTube has to stop the secrecy.  At least in Europe, people have the right to know which data the companies store about them.  YouTube still has the chance to settle the issue without high costs. We are looking forward to the discussions. Last but not least, there is another powerful measure.  And this is where YouTubers come into play.  Help us to make YouTube better for everyone involved.  Spread the video, follow us on Facebook and Twitter and visit our website. And above all, if you are in Germany, join the IG Metal.  I did that months ago.  Isn't that a pretty little card?  The IG Metal is the perfect union for us YouTubers.  The more YouTube members the IG Metal gets, the more likely it is that we can end this and turn the nightmare job into a dream job again. On the website fairtube.info you will find all information about IG Metal membership.  We are very grateful for everyone who stands with us. We have a really long list of actions that require your active participation and we don't want to go into details yet but I can guarantee this is going to be a shitstorm that hasn't been seen ever before. So YouTube, now it's up to you.  Talk to us.  We are sure there will be a solution that works out for everyone. Not only that, but what is YouTube worth without happy YouTubers?  Come on, managers at YouTube.  You know that we can only keep the platform successful if we work together on this. You now have four weeks to talk to us. So the countdown is ticking.  And you can actually follow what is happening on our website fairtube.info.  Wow, that's it for today.  Very, very big day for the whole of YouTube.  Anyway, thanks.  Bye-bye.

It was put out by the General Secretary, Mr Dermot O'Leary.  It's pretty pathetic really.  He claims to represent the vast majority of his members, which he doesn't.  Not everybody holds his views.  Somebody, a lady with an opposing opinion, an opposing view of how the country should run has taken out advertisements.  And this pathetic publication is a prompt.  It's a dumb prompt to anyone dumb enough to actually take it up.  Nobody has refused to drive a Dublin bus with any advertising on it.  Dublin bus drivers are professional drivers.  They turn up, they check the bus, make sure it's mechanically sound, fit for purpose.  They don't even look at the advertising.  They get in the bus and they go and do the day's work and hope that they can get the day's work done safely.  As an NBRU member, I don't pay my subs and neither do the vast majority of NBRU members to have the branch secretary pursue his personal political interests.  We pay our subs to be represented.  Most members I speak to would rather Dermot O'Leary did not get involved in this.  There's a whole lot more to be getting on with, given that Dublin Bus is on the cusp of being privatised, which would be an absolute race to the bottom.  You refuse, in your publication, you refuse to name who's on the billboards.  This to me suggests that your total argument is baseless.  Gemma O'Doherty is well able to fight her corner.  I'm not here to represent Gemma O'Doherty.  She's well able to do that herself.  I'm here to represent myself and plenty of other members who probably feel the same.  That our subs could be much better used and your time could be much better spent.  To pursue the national interest to want to preserve your culture, your people, your land.  There's nothing questionable about that.  And just because you love your nation and your family and your friends and your culture, it doesn't automatically mean that you hate everyone else's.  This is a Trojan horse that has been pushed out there by Dermot O'Leary.  It's absolutely contemptible.  And I'd just like to get that message across today.  There is a direct contradiction between proponents of open borders and unrestricted, unvetted immigration en masse.  We'll urge people to go homeless, live hand to milk, live day to day, and have to emigrate themselves to America and Australia and never see their families again, or hardly ever.  It's about time the unions in this country started representing Irish people because they seem to be hell-bent on representing, and politicians, they seem to be hell-bent on representing everything and everyone else but the Irish people.  What Dermot O'Leary needs to do is to work harder that Dublin bus drivers aren't being assaulted.  aren't being victims of verbal abuse, aren't being victims of anti-social behaviour.  That's what we pay our subs for.  Not for your political personal agenda.  Not for you and George Sorrows pet project which is ENAR and all the other non-governmental organisations.  that's hell-bent on making Irish people an absolute minority in their own country.  Now that's pretty much all we have to say on it.  God save Ireland.","channel.id":"clxmi0oem02c5cdvifvlaufkb","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxgY69mo_nUGuCDo1yPygng","channel.name":"The National Party \u2014 An P\u00e1irt\u00ed N\u00e1isi\u00fanta","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"IE","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU7ivwQD99tz4V9BIwbUF8E9SWhYm3UPSK5N4O2EA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker is a Dublin bus driver and a member of the NBRU trade union.

And this is the main stronghold of the Swedish Democrats.  In the September 2018 local elections, they received roughly 20% in both of these counties.  This caused many local leaders of the moderate party to break rank with their national leadership and form coalition governments with the Swedish Democrats in certain municipalities.  S\u00f8r\u00f6v\u00e4sborg, which includes about 17,000 people, is one of these places.  The new chairman of the Municipal Council is Louise Eriksson, who is engaged to party leader Jimmy \u00c5kesson.  Servisborg Municipal Coalition includes the Swedish Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Christian Democrats, and a tiny local party.  The municipality is currently at the center of multiple major political controversies in Sweden.  The municipal council is vowing to defy the Swedish government and refuse to accept any new economic migrants.  Under a 2016 federal law, the government can assign economic migrants to municipalities and the local authorities must provide for them.  They are not allowed to refuse.  This is going to trigger a court battle.  Even if the municipality loses in court, it will be a psychological blow against the left-wing Swedish federal government.  It will cause months of embarrassing public debate over the issue.  There are already other municipal councils who have said they are going bankrupt providing for the economic migrants they have already received and simply can't afford anymore.  Sweden has a system where the individual municipalities are required to fund a lot of federal mandates with local municipal tax revenue.  for several years now and ever increasing percentage of swedish municipalities are having budget shortfalls.  this is increasing tension between municipal level government in the federal government.  then factor in that the current federal government is a minority ruling coalition that only received thirty three percent of the vote.  also in the past week The Servisborg municipal government has done two things that are causing hysteria among the left wing and the media.  The city has flown rainbow flags at the municipal building since 2013.  A new law says only the national flag of Sweden and the municipal flag may be flown.  The new guidelines say the city should not be flying any flags that promote a political agenda.  They also passed new guidelines blocking city funds from being used to purchase and display so-called modern art.  This has become a growing issue all over Sweden.  For example, back in 2017, the city of Stockholm purchased and displayed so-called minstrel artwork at subway stations.  they claimed the art promoted female empowerment.  many called it obscene and absurd.  under new guidelines city funds can only be spent on traditional artwork that appeals to a broad majority of residents.  naturally swedish cultural minister amanda lind publicly denounced the move.  a group of leftists retaliated by making a giant menstruating doll in serviceborg.  The media and the radical left are now demanding that the leadership of the moderate party and the Christian Democrats condemn their own people who have formed coalitions with the Swedish Democrats.  The leadership of the moderate party within Blekinge County is even deeply divided.  Servisborg is also where the Swedish Democrats hold an annual festival every August.  This event has repeatedly featured Swedish rock band Ultima Thule.  The 2019 event also featured Tommy Ekman, a Swedish pop singer from the 80s.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Swedish government is a minority ruling coalition with only 33% of the vote.","responses":"[1] Politics: Mentions the Swedish government, elections, and coalition governments.\n[1] Law Enforcement: Mentions a court battle.\n[1] Migration: Mentions economic migrants.\n[1] Government: Mentions the Swedish government and its minority ruling coalition.\n[1] Culture: Mentions the display of rainbow flags and modern art.\n[1] Media: Mentions demands from the media.\n[1] Elections: Mentions the 2018 local elections.\n[1] Law: Mentions a new law prohibiting the display of flags promoting a political agenda."}

And one of the most common is the idea that because there's more genetic difference, more genetic variation between people of the same race than there is between the different races, that race is somehow an illegitimate concept.  And this was something that was proposed by the Harvard geneticist Richard Lewontin.  Oh, I think it goes back to the 1980s already, the idea that there is, in fact, more genetic variation within groups than between groups.  And people then somehow slyly suggest that this could mean that you could be genetically more closely related to someone of a different race than to someone of your own race.  That's, in fact, impossible.  You are more closely related to people of your own race.  But to point out that there is all of this genetic variation within people of even the same family, even within the same tribe.  that does not negate the fact that there is a relatively small amount of genetic patterning that can be used to distinguish people of different races.  In the case of human beings, about 15% of the genome, that's a small portion of the genome, is the part that is patterned in different ways that result in racial differences.  If you draw a parallel between that 15%, which is at the time of Lewontin's discovery, it was thought to be a surprisingly small figure.  This was a legitimate scientific discovery about the commonality of the genome across different human groups.  But if you want to make a parallel between human differences and dog breeds, for example, in the case of dog breeds, there's about 30% of the genome.  The proportion compared to humans is about twice as broad in which there is different patterning.  that accounts for the fact that you have different dog breeds.  For dogs as well, there is much more in common than the amount of genetic difference that separates them.  And yet, in the case of dogs, you have differences as vast as Irish wolfhounds and chihuahuas, greyhounds and beagles.  You have differences in intelligence and temperament.  Of course, these have been bred by human beings, but bred probably most of these differences only in the last, say, 500 or 600 years.  The point is, there is enormous amount of genetic difference between people who are in fact genetically of the same subspecies or race.  We don't fully understand the purpose of all the genetic aspects of human beings.  The genome is still a mysterious place.  And people talk about junk DNA because we don't really know what these genes do, what these parts of the genome do.  I think the term junk DNA is a little bit dangerous because there are probably aspects of this unknown and undeciphered DNA that probably do play important roles in the development of human beings.  But still, that is an argument that's commonly made.  that there is more genetic variation within a race than the genetic variation that distinguishes races.  But one parallel argument you could make to that is that if you're comparing the heights of men and women, there's obviously far more variation in the heights of men or women than there is between the average height of men and women.  That doesn't mean that men and women are the same height.  The amount of variation within a group does not negate the fact that there are differences between the groups.  Furthermore, the genetic difference between men and women is very, very small.  Genetically, a man and a woman are essentially the same except for the presence or the absence of a Y chromosome.  And yet that amount of genetic difference can result in human morphology in which there are entire organs that are present or absent depending on what sex you are.  So small amounts of genetic difference can go a long way in establishing morphological and physiological and even behavioral differences.","channel.id":"clxmi0l2d004ecdvicqihfv4o","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCHC60upCUfq7EAfw6oDQRDA","channel.name":"AustralianRealist","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AU","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXGtj3mCQ77TqT5-IhdDe-HuDoxbUTsKWP74KUF=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2012-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The argument that there's more genetic variation within a race than between races is often used to dismiss the concept of race realism.

I've talked about this a few times on my channel before and had some conversations with viewers and other YouTubers about it, but I really wanted to have a more focused discussion today on something that I think may be afflicting many of us.  Burnout and what to do when righteous anger dissipates and turns into apathy.  I think this might be why male content creators are generally better than women.  They don't internalize the criticism or engage in the fear of repercussion as much, particularly as it pertains to media backlash.  They just keep getting angry at the injustice and that fuels them.  As such, the men have more mental energy available to funnel into this creative process.  I, on the other hand, make a video when I feel truly compelled and inspired to, which, as you can tell, is infrequently.  And I can tell that other content creators like Stefan, Styx, Matt Christensen are motivated and feel compelled to do their very important jobs when they experience righteous anger at the current state of affairs.  I used to be more like this as well back in the day when I was more hopeful that we would be able to turn this ship around.  Since it has become clear to me over the last year or so that we're probably in too deep and we're going to have to start anew, I've begun to really internalize these waves of hopelessness, although it comes and goes.  worsening censorship, unveiling new levels of government corruption, and unwillingness of the general public to accept their circumstances, I want people to be hopeful, so I probably shouldn't be infecting people with my unending negativity.  So when I see something that makes me hopeful that things are changing, that does help me make a video.  Ostensibly, we're in pretty good times now.  Longer lifespan, less violence, technological advances that would look like sorcery to our ancestors.  I shouldn't really be feeling this way now.  People were probably more emotionally hardy during the plagues or the depression.  Yet here we are.  So I've been wondering why.  Why now in these better times is there this all-encompassing anxiety, this existential angst, this nagging feeling of impending doom that is robbing me of my productivity?  I've talked about this before as well, but culturally, part of it has to be our lack of spirituality and conviction.  Even in hellish times on Earth, our Christian ancestors, galloping into battle, knowing full well that they were going to be hacked to death, had a strong sense of purpose and duty, which our iPhone-scrolling modern society just lacks.  We've replaced God with a dogmatic devotion to atheism.  We have upended natural gender roles by mandating that all Westerners deny even the existence of biological gender, which of course is based on dubious, politically motivated pseudoscience.

The topic of today's video comes as a result of me reading a lot over the course of the past few months.  I've been an avid reader at various points in my life, particularly during my childhood and late teens, and recently I've felt the urge to, if only for a few hours, use books to distract myself from the ever more convincing goal our society seems to have of tearing itself apart.  I mostly chose to read fantasy and science fiction books.  But what I very quickly came to realize is that nowadays, even in fantasy, there's little hope of escapism, at least as far as modern fantasy books are concerned.  Like movies, television, and gaming, nearly everything bears a flagrant political mark.  Mind you, there's nothing inherently wrong with being political.  Everyone has a right to their beliefs, and I wouldn't be bothered were it not for the fact that the majority of it comes off as insincere.  By this I mean that the rules have been set.  Despite your personal beliefs, if you don't abide by certain rules, you'll never be successful, or at the very least, you'll never be accepted by the mainstream.  So that's why it's hard to believe in the words of most of these authors.  Because even if these authors' words are sincere, you know they have no choice but to write them.  So the books come off as tired and uninspired at best, and at worst, a lie.  A lie that reeks of fear and desperation to please, and produces little more than colorless, tasteless characters and stories, most of which will never stay on the test of time.  In today's video, we're going to take a tour of the writing industry and examine how it's changing as a consequence of political correctness.  However, since the writing industry as a whole is extremely broad, I'm going to focus this video primarily on the young adult branch, which is one of the most popular and lucrative branches of the industry.  But before we get started, I just want to quickly mention that if you would like a signed copy of my new book, I have just 15 hardcover and 15 paperback copies left.  And once they're gone, I will no longer be offering signed copies anymore.  Furthermore, I've marked the price down for this last batch of signed copies because I'd like to get rid of them as soon as possible since traveling with them is quite expensive.  So again, if you would like a signed copy of my book with free domestic or international shipping, now is your last chance to get one.  The link to my website where you can order.  one is in the description of this video.  Okay, so now back to the topic at hand.  To set the scene, I'll just give a bit of a rundown about how things in the writing industry work.  Once you've finished writing your manuscript, you generally send a submission letter, including the first few pages of your manuscript, to multiple literary agents of your choice.  If a literary agent enjoys the first few pages of your manuscript, he or she will request the full manuscript and then make a decision regarding whether or not they want to offer you representation.  The main problem that my twin sister and I observed during this process, when we were trying to get our own book published back in 2015, was that the literary agents often had checklists on their websites discussing the types of themes they were looking for in the books that they personally wished to represent.  The common themes that my twin sister and I saw were themes such as social justice, diversity, LGBT, and strong female characters, and so on.  This was all bearable up to a point, but from what I could perceive, the demands of the young adult industry only became more and more stringent as time went on.  For example, there was an initial demand for diverse characters, but soon it became an issue if a white author included a black character because how dare a white author pretend to understand the experiences of a black person.  But on the other hand, if a white author only included white characters in their book, or if they, heaven forbid, had a minority as their villain, then they'd be accused of being racist.  Just a few of the many popular authors who have been criticized for not quote-unquote living up to the rules of political correctness are Sarah J. Maas and Maggie Stiefvater.  Starting with Sarah J. Maas, her most popular series is the Throne of Glass series, which includes seven books, the first of which sold over one million copies alone.  Maas found herself in hot water a few years ago for not living up to the diversity standard.  An article from a site called Affinity Magazine claimed, quote, Authors like Sarah J. Maas and Maggie Stiefvater are wildly popular in the book community, and they really shouldn't be.  Sarah J. Maas is the perfect example of an author who uses the white savior trope in her book series, Throne of Glass.  She also killed off the only two women of color in the series.  Maggie Stiefvater's most popular series are entitled The Wolves of Mercy Falls and The Raven Cycle.  The same article from Affinity magazine claimed, quote, As for Maggie Stiefvater, she's just plain racist.  In The Raven King, the final installment of her book series, The Raven Boys, two of her white characters mock Henry Cheng's voice.  Henry is half Korean, half Chinese, and it sparked an outrage among readers of color because, contextually, it can be taken as the characters mocking his accent.  Given the radicalization of pretty much every medium of the entertainment industry, a lot of people might not find accusations such as these surprising.  But what some might find surprising is that their efforts have come full circle.  They're now even going so far as to persecute writers who are themselves minorities.  Recently, a contributor to New York Magazine, a man by the name of Jesse Singel, published a four-part series of articles detailing the nightmarish prison in which the young adult writing industry has locked itself.  Jesse's articles showcase that in the last few months alone, the outrage from young adult book readers on Twitter has caused not one but two minority authors to choose to unpublish books that they had already completed.  First, Emily Zhao's Blood Heir, which was accused of anti-Black racism because YA Twitter decided, on the basis of rather questionable evidence, that a racially ambiguous character was Black and didn't like how she was treated in light of that assumption.  and then Kosoko Jackson's A Place for Wolves, which was accused of being offensive for focusing on American teenagers during the Kosovo War and its attendant human rights atrocities, and for having a Muslim villain.  Both authors ended up releasing statements, apologizing to the book community, and explaining that they would not go forward with publishing their books.  Personally, I found myself a bit conflicted while reading these statements.  Firstly, I wasn't surprised at all that these authors had been attacked, because I've seen firsthand the utter inability of the leftist mob to refrain from destroying anything that even remotely falls outside their personal framework of what quote-unquote is acceptable nowadays.  Secondly, like many others, I'm really disappointed that these authors chose to cave.  In my opinion, they should have ignored the backlash and stood by their books.  Showing the mob that they wouldn't allow themselves to be dictated by their whims would have both weakened the mob and given these authors a better chance at writing and publishing what they wish to publish in the future.  But by caving, and even worse, apologizing, these authors are not only agreeing with the injustice thrust upon them, but they're also opening their future work to being controlled by the mob.  And lastly, I do have to admit that, at least for me personally, these statements were really sad for me to read.  Having once been in the writing industry myself, I can vividly imagine how excited and happy these authors must have been to reach their dream of traditional publication, only to have their dream dashed to bits by a fanatical mob, most of which had come to hysterical conclusions about their books without even ever having read them.  Basically, what generally happens is that advanced reader copies, also known as ARCs, are sent out to reviewers ahead of the scheduled publication date in order to garner publicity for the book.  A few of these advanced readers apparently took issue with a few things in these authors' books, wrote insane reviews, and then these reviews circulated on Twitter, causing all hell to break loose, with the result being that both authors opted not to publish their books.  Now, if this wasn't enough to characterize the young adult writing industry as deranged, there are also claims that a secret list has been made with the names of writers who have been deemed quote-unquote enemies of people of color.  In other words, it's a type of blacklist compiled by literary agents and other people in the industry with the names of authors who they personally deem as racist.  One literary agent by the name of Barry Goldblatt seemed to confirm the existence of this list in a tweet.  that said, So essentially, the young adult writing industry has devolved into a climate where no one, not even minority authors, are safe from the hammer of political correctness.  To make matters worse, there are also claims that many people in the industry, quote, just in case they ever need to publicly destroy someone.  In an alleged email to Jesse Singel, who is the author of the series of articles about this situation, a published young adult fantasy author says, I'm sending you this because I believe the community needs to change.  It's destroying itself.  What started out as, in my opinion, an important effort to diversify books for children has become embroiled in far too much public grandstanding and private backstabbing.  Debut authors, the targets of a majority of the latest call-outs, do not have the industry or social clout within the community to push back or really to even recover career-wise from canceling their books.  It's even more difficult when they are marginalized people themselves.  People in the YA community obsess over receipts.  They keep screenshots of conversations just in case they ever need to publicly destroy someone.  Carefully cultivated public personas are common.  If secrets are a form of currency, then coming off as a friendly person is intended to get people to open up to you.  It is an industry where a lot of people have, quote, allies instead of, quote, friends, and they are perfectly willing to throw those people under the bus in order to maintain social clout within the community.  The people who do value friendships are the quiet ones.  We're not here to grandstand.  We're here to write books.  But what you see on YA Twitter is really just what they're willing to put out in public.  The private stuff is very personal and it cuts very deeply.  In this industry, you have to be careful who you open up to because you never know when the details of your life are going to become gossip fodder.  While I could obviously utilize dozens more examples to showcase the deterioration of the young adult writing industry, in an effort to make this video a reasonable length, I'll end on a final point.  And this point is the ever-increasing implementation of morals clauses into author contracts.  The Authors Guild recently wrote an article on the matter saying, The Authors Guild objects to publishers' new and increasing use of so-called morals clauses.  These contract provisions allow publishers to terminate a book contract and in many cases even require the author to repay portions of the advance already received if the author is accused of immoral, illegal, or publicly condemned behavior.  Publishers insist they need the clauses to protect themselves in the event an author's reputation becomes so tarnished after the book contract is signed that it will hurt sales.  But most of these clauses are too broad and allow a publisher to terminate based on individual accusations or the vague notion of public condemnation, which can occur all too easily in these days of viral social media.  So basically, these morals clauses are paving the way for the termination of authors' contracts based on quote-unquote public condemnation, which, as we've seen in the case of Emile Zhao and Kosoko Jackson, could occur simply if advanced reviewers take issue with something the author has written in their books and decides to stir up a mob against them.  From what I can tell, much of the young adult writing industry is now running on fear.  Fear of writing the wrong thing, tweeting the wrong thing, trusting the wrong person, and so on.  This is obviously the worst type of climate to produce good literature.  Like many other entertainment-related professions, being an author nowadays comes with a large set of risks.  It's like perpetually walking on thin ice that can at any moment crack and swallow you up.  And it's becoming increasingly difficult for me personally to comprehend how any sane person would willingly be a part of it.  But on the other hand, I do have to say that this situation is hardly surprising.  Due to the blatant agendas and infant-like sensitivity of those pulling the strings in the writing industry, we've been forced to surrender the principle, the long-held principle, that writing books should challenge the authors and that reading books should challenge the readers.  Ideas that fall outside of the mainstream, controversial characters, and the liberty to make people uncomfortable are becoming all but forbidden.  While having such freedoms won't always make for good stories, it'll definitely make for unique ones, and it'll also pave the way for that rare book that always eventually comes along and inspires a generation.  In closing, write what you want to write, not what the dominant culture or the higher-ups want you to write.  These kinds of stories will be most welcome in a world that's steadily being leeched of its color, becoming grayer and grayer and grayer by the day.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.

The use of morals clauses in author contracts has further exacerbated this problem, allowing publishers to terminate contracts if an author is accused of immoral or illegal behavior.\n\nThe industry's focus on diversity and inclusion has become a form of censorship, with authors being criticized and even blacklisted for not meeting certain expectations. The speaker argues that this is a problem because it stifles creativity and freedom of expression, and that authors should be able to write what they want, without fear of reprisal or censorship.\n\nThe industry's obsession with social justice and diversity has led to a culture of outrage and cancel culture, where","responses":"[1] Politics: Mentions the influence of politics on the writing industry and the restrictions imposed on authors.\n[1] Culture: Mentions the dominant culture and its influence on the industry.\n[1] Business: Mentions the commercial aspect of the writing industry.\n[1] Representation: Mentions the importance of representation in the industry.\n[1] Identity: Mentions the identity of authors and their relationship with the industry.\n[1] Criticism: Mentions the criticism and backlash faced by authors who do not conform.\n[1] Morality: Mentions the morals clauses and the expectations placed on authors.\n[1] Censorship: Mentions the use of morals clauses in author contracts and the fear of reprisal or censorship.\n[1] Freedom of Expression: Mentions the importance of authors being able to write what they want without fear of censorship.\n[1] Cancel Culture: Mentions the culture of outrage and cancel culture in the industry.\n[1] Diversity: Mentions the focus on diversity and inclusion in the industry.\n[1] Conformity: Mentions the pressure to conform to certain rules and themes in the industry.\n[1] Ethics: Mentions the morals clauses and the expectations placed on authors.\n[1] Authorship: Mentions the role of authors and their relationship with the industry.\n[1] Creativity: Mentions the stifling of creativity due to the industry's restrictions.\n[1] Reputation: Mentions the impact of criticism on an author's reputation.\n[1] Social Justice: Mentions the industry's obsession with social justice and its impact on the culture.\n[1] Industry: Mentions the writing industry and its practices.\n[1] Accountability: Mentions the accountability of authors and the industry to each other.\n[1] Autonomy: Mentions the importance of authors having autonomy over their work.\n[1] Responsibility: Mentions the responsibility of authors to their audience and the industry.\n[1] Values: Mentions the values of the industry and their impact on authors.\n[1] Influence: Mentions the influence of the industry on authors and their work.\n[1] Control: Mentions the control exerted by the industry over authors and their writing.\n[1] Expression: Mentions the importance of expression in the writing industry.\n[1] Power: Mentions the power dynamics between authors, publishers, and the industry.\n[1] Expectations: Mentions the expectations placed"}

He was one of several aid workers wanted for helping migrants illegally enter the country. Various NGOs actually facilitate the illegal entrance of immigrants in Greece.  We have at least 20,000 illegal immigrants and refugees at the Aegean Islands. Our first location is like right off the coast of Turkey.  I've read a little bit about it.  I know about the Moria camp, obviously.  But the big question now is how are those people getting there?  Of course, I assume they're taking little dinghies from Turkey, but they can't be, they're not doing it on their own.  Emergency Response Center International. They're really high profile.  Two of their senior workers were arrested recently.  They're still in prison. And they're looking for this dude.  It says in hiding here.  What's his name?  Panos? This is Panos Maratis.  And the police have no idea where he is.  And neither do we.  The police confiscated his WhatsApp and all the WhatsApp members of the RCI.  And they found all these signals about locations of migrant boats that were coming into Lesbos.  There's only one place that could have come from. Right, so the traffickers.  That's trafficking. That drives into espionage, listening to radio signals, smuggling, and money laundering.  We don't know where they got that information from.  The police have said they've laundered up to $5 million.  So basically, all of this, and they're linked to Doctors Without Borders.  I mean, they're hugely connected, but it all leads back to Panna. So how are we going to get him? I'm going to reach out to the rest of the RCR members who haven't been arrested, who are still active, see if we can get a connection to him, and then we can maybe arrange a call, maybe a meeting, but I think that's so unlikely, given that he's in hiding from the police.  Well, we can try.  We can try. I mean, he... The police have already found a few of their other high-profile members.  He can't be nowhere. ERCI said at the moment our organisation has been squashed down, most permanent members are in jail and nearly all volunteers have resigned in fear of being arrested.  There are very limited people that can represent the organisation and these operate off the record at the moment while they are trying to regroup.  ERCI ceased operations in Lesvos until further notice, we knew that, but while we're trying to fight our legal battle there is one at the island available to comment. It said no one at the island available to comment. No one, okay.  However, we could try and find former volunteers. That wouldn't be so bad.  It would be great to just get anyone that worked with them on camera. the very fact that we've got an email from their press department still means we're talking to someone and they've said give us your whatsapp number. okay so contact them right away and let's see where we can go from this because that would be amazing. even if you don't get this former person we've still got the press person so we can.  probably we've got someone that is in contact with Panos.  maybe he's even met Panos.  okay let's do it. good morning. No, no, no, this is worth it, I promise.  So ERC, I have WhatsApp, we have been talking in the last few hours, they've said that we can actually get an interview directly with Panos, not even on Skype, on the phone, in person.  With Panos?  Yep, the guy who's behind all of this.  So he's arriving in Mitalini in two hours, which is, he's basically, I've got this shipping app, which they've given me an update to, and they've said that he is... so that's it.  but we spoke to his lawyer and he said that there's a not a warrant out for his arrest but it's really likely he's going to be arrested.  he wants to maybe hand himself in to the police before he gets arrested because that looks better for him.  can we get that on film?  yeah we can follow him all day but we just need that interview because the police apparently the police will be waiting at the ship so we can get in there before he gets out.  like maybe go in the service. I really want to go but yeah They might, if you want to follow him, they might recognize me, him and his lawyer. Well, someone who, yeah, well, every major leader of every NGO will know who you are because of Italy and all the stuff that's happened. Is the security up? Yeah, he said he can do it.  He said, actually, we should probably leave, like, now.  Yeah.  Because we want to get there really early this week to the lawyer and just figure out, like, a route onto the ship.  Because once we get that interview, then... And you're going to, George? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then that's it.  And we'll just tell you, we'll just keep you updated.  I'm going to follow this ship.  Yeah, I'll stay up, I'm... Y'all, I guess I'll just be texting you from here and supporting you however I can.  I wish I could come.  Okay.  I'll make coffee. Okay, cool.  All right, okay, let's see what happens.  Okay. So I've just gotten off the phone with Kaylin and the guys and they are waiting outside the boat.  Apparently there are police everywhere waiting for Panos, but they're going to see if they can find an entrance onto the boat and go to a deck where Panos is waiting and interview him before he's arrested.  Our security is super hopeful that he'll be able to get them on.  They've got the cameras ready with them and I'm just fingers crossed.  we can get this interview with him before he's Locked up. Thank you.  Briefly tell me what the charges are. Quite grave, actually.  Espionage, getting access to state secrets, facilitating smuggling and human trafficking, money laundering, forgery, and breach of the telecommunications codes. And how many people have you helped? At sea, more than 55,000 people.  More than 600-700 volunteers through the course of the last three years. A lot of writing media saying that you are a human trafficker.  I just wanted a very direct response to. We have never facilitated human trafficking.  We have never assisted any smuggler.  We're quite against it.  We're here to save lives and nothing more. They said that we were actually money laundering.  Unknown sums of money. So I've just gone back to watch some of the footage the interview we did with Panos, the head of ERCI, and I'm listening to the undercover recording we have now.  Panos denied all of these allegations to the police and publicly.  He said they were partaking in no money laundering at all.  And I'm pretty sure I just heard his lawyers say to us on tape, they laundered half a million dollars.  I mean, we have, We have to send this to police.  This could actually impact the court case.  I'm just also really alarmed here that his lawyer is telling us that laundering half a million dollars is nothing compared to what other NGOs do.  This is huge.  I don't even believe what I'm listening to right now.  I don't know.  Is this a one-off thing?  We have a lot more investigating to do on this island, that's for sure.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The founder of Emergency Response Center International (ERCI), Panos Maratis, has gone into hiding after being wanted by police for helping migrants illegally enter Greece.

Let's get things underway.  Now, as Westmen, we live in fear of anti-white slurs.  And just by the way, that's how we should always refer to terms like racist or bigot.  We should always refer to them as anti-white slurs.  It's important because it frames our position.  It puts us in a position to defend ourselves.  It puts us in the position of a group.  It puts us in the position of a individual being victimized.  And at the same time, it smears the person using the term.  So it disempowers the person who is using the term.  They are using it.  from an artificially constructed, like a sort of superstructure on the outside of a building, a moral high ground.  And when you use, when you reframe the word as a slur, you automatically knock them off of that moral high ground.  So anti-white slurs.  Often these slurs precipitate social lynchings and we live in fear a regular fear of these social lynchings because they begin with an anti-white slur and then they become ostracism when it comes to our friends and family and they become often character and career assassinations when these slurs make it out to the general community.  We also fear these anti-white slurs because we end up being hauled before these anti-white tribunals.  You had like these witch tribunals of the past.  Well, now you have these anti-white tribunals at our universities.  and at our places of work.  You say the smallest thing that deviates from anti-white ideology, anti-white slurs are hurled your way, and then you're dragged before these anti-white tribunals where they either expel you or they fire you, and when one of those things don't happen, you nonetheless always incur permanent stigmata on your record.  for having this happen to you.  So we live in fear of these things.  This is a very real psychological fear that we undergo and that is never discussed.  It's not even discussed in the white positive movement.  Think of the fact, think of the trauma that an individual undergoes by having to constantly fear.  This is like you have the post trauma from having been in battle.  Well, this is like the pre trauma, the anticipation that you're going to be socially lynched, the anticipation that you're going to be hauled before one of these anti-white tribunals has an extremely injurious effect on you psychologically, physically, mentally.  And so this is a fear that we live with every single day.  And it's the kind of thing that we have to discuss.  It's the kind of thing that we have to discuss with our friends and family.  It's the kind of thing that we have to discuss when we are attempting to persuade those who are our prospects.  We have to talk about this sort of trauma.  The trauma, of course, in my going free doctrine is called white noir.  So this is a big part of white noir.  is this incessant, and it's a background thing.  You don't necessarily have to be focused on it at all times to have it working.  its deleterious effects on you mentally, physically.  it's always in the background.  it is always haunting us and this these lynchings these social lynchings are no less uh no less deleterious for us than if we were physically dragged out of the house.  our lives are very often ruined by these social lynchings and the anti-whites know this.  think of the anti-white female the non-white anti-white female.  when they were attacking this young man at the university, what was his name again?  Very recently, just a few weeks ago, who said he loves white men, Abeel or whatever his name was.  When they were attacking him and he finally said he couldn't take anymore, he started saying that he loved white men.  He started speaking truth to power, didn't he?  He started saying enough of this.  We have discovered and built, yes, Julian, Julian Abeel.  We have discovered and built the majority of things.  We have unearthed the secrets of the cosmos.  We have brought them up.  We have made the lives of others infinitely better because of our abilities, because of our Faustian or Promethean spirit.  It is in us, and that is why we do these things.  People live Three times the length they would have lived.  Lives that otherwise would have been lost in childhood are now preserved because of our medical technology.  For no reason other than we saw something that had not been conquered and we wanted to conquer it.  A disease that hadn't been conquered and we wanted to conquer it.  a new frontier that hadn't been conquered and we wanted to conquer it.  A new hostile people that were attempting to conquer us and we were able to defeat them and then civilized the territory.  Then of course they move in and say, where's ours?  Where's the line to get me my Gibbs?  Where do I line up for the social welfare?  It is because of us that these things happen, but to my point, what happened when he spoke truth to power, when Julian spoke truth to power?  What happened was this non-white, anti-white female said, Twitter, do your thing.  Twitter, do your thing.","channel.id":"clxmi0qxr044kcdvizhkl4gln","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCkY8CvV8WQFe87CZGmvuYHA","channel.name":"No White Guilt","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/0YucuojQg3vL5zFivzXCv6DZwmxOWS1QLEN9RRXD5xhaL5BObtCr6MqcnGGuopcNPp2ndmsvyM8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the fear of anti-white slurs and their consequences, which they refer to as \"white noir.\" These slurs can lead to social lynchings, ostracism, character and career assassinations, and even expulsion or termination from work or university.

So I wanted to make a short video regarding my Girl Talk series.  I recently completed episode 10 and I think that as much as this has been a really valuable experience for my audience, particularly my female audience, this This series has taught me a lot of things.  Some things more important than others, but I think that the more women that I speak to, the more well-rounded my understanding of what it means to be a right-wing or a traditional woman is.  And one of the things that I think is most important that I really want to touch on it and really just sort of reiterate in a video on its own that hopefully will be kind of short, um, is regarding motherhood.  And I think on the left, we see a lot of women sort of degrading motherhood, putting motherhood down, um, sort of saying really derogatory things that, you know, gestational work and it's a kind of slavery and it's, you know, awful.  They have very few good things to say about motherhood.  And I think that that's really wrong and really harmful to women.  But there's something that we do on the right that is equally as harmful.  Maybe not equally, but it is also harmful to women.  And that is that we tend to oversimplify how great motherhood is.  We tend to promote motherhood as something that will make you happy, give you purpose.  It's the most important thing that you can do.  And it's not that I don't necessarily believe those things.  It's just that I know.  for some women it isn't like that.  I have received a number of emails from women who have expressed such gratitude to me for making my videos with mothers and my latest one with Ed Dutton about how happiness is predicted more so by personality most of the time than it is by whether or not you have children.  For example, one of the things that we spoke about in that last video with Ed Dutton called, does having children really make you happy, is that things like extroversion, having high self-esteem, being low in things like neuroticism, these are greater predictors of whether or not you're going to be a happy person than whether or not you're a mother.  So hearing this has been a huge relief to some women who are struggling with motherhood who have postpartum depression, who have had difficulty bonding with their babies at first, women who are struggling with the lack of sleep and the amount of pain that can result from trying to breastfeed and heal from things like cesarean sections and natural childbirths.  There's a tremendous amount of trauma that the body endures in motherhood.  I've had women say, your body's never really the same.  Now, of course, if your weight gain isn't excessive and stuff, you can always kind of bounce back to a certain degree if you're living a healthy lifestyle.  But from what I've heard from many mothers, there are certain things that change about your body which never really quite go back.  to the way they were before pregnancy.  And for some women, this is not a big deal.  It's a really small thing.  But for other women, it's very difficult to accept, I think.  And it can cause a lot of difficulty with settling into this new identity as a mother.  I've had some women say to me that they feel like their body isn't theirs anymore You know because every single time that baby cries they have to get up they have to feed they have to rock them to sleep They have to change the diaper to.  you know you become Fully absorbed in the nurturing and the looking after of this little thing that you love and And so for some women, that is something that they slip into with ease.  And these women who I've spoken to some of these women in on this series, and they are some of the strongest, most intelligent, most kind hearted, just amazing people that I think I've ever met.  And I don't want to detract from the fact that those women exist.  I want to hold these women up because they are the role models for the women who struggle with motherhood.  But I don't think it's fair to sell women this idea that having a baby is going to solve all your problems.  It's not.  That's not really what motherhood or having a child should be about.  If you're having a baby because of peer pressure in the right wing movement or in the social circles that you run in or because you want people to stop telling you that there's a lot of jerks, I feel like, anonymous jerks in comment sections a lot of the time, and they'll say things like, your life is worthless if you're not a mother, or shut up, your opinions are irrelevant because you're not a mother yet.  This is so damaging to the women in our community.  It's so harsh, it's so damaging, and ironically, I think it negatively affects fertility.  If you want women to be fertile and go forth and multiply, giving them this extra anxiety about whether or not they will be able to conceive or being able to conceive on somebody else's timeline causes unnecessary stress and stress is a really harmful thing which negatively affects fertility.  We need to be supporting women in this movement if you want them to be healthy moms.  You also don't know if a woman is trying to conceive and she's having difficulty.  How do you think that that affects a woman when she's trying to conceive, she's actively trying?  And for many healthy people, regardless of their age, it can take up to a year to conceive.  So imagine the stress of trying to conceive, just maybe having a bit of difficulty.  You know, it can be really, really painful to be patient when you're trying to conceive.  from what I've heard.  You know each month is the two-week wait trying to find out whether or not you are you aren't it's.  it's grueling and For some women it's really tough and then to have these other people on the other side of things.  You know nagging in your ear and nagging you making you feel bad that you haven't had a baby yet.  This is so counterproductive.  I really want to.  if you have done this if you're watching this and you have done this, please um take a step back and question as to whether or not these sorts of negs are coming from a place of just you know being a jerk or if you really want Women to be mothers and you really want women to take that burden on because if you do Giving them extra anxiety about the timeline of their fertility and having having a child is making it worse.  I promise you that I speak to him behind the scenes and it's making it worse.  Please stop.  Please stop doing that and you know We need to be real with women about what motherhood about.  It's not about being happy.  you shouldn't be.  you shouldn't be entering into motherhood because you want to make yourself happy.  Entering into motherhood is sacrificial.  It's virtuous But it is in a way somewhat sacrificial.  you and your life becomes about somebody else and it's a beautiful thing.  and And I'll never stop trying to lift women up who take that burden on and do it with grace.  to deny the reality that some women really struggle with motherhood, especially in the beginning.  Some women have really horrific pregnancies.  Every pregnancy is different.  And I've heard this from moms who have like two and three kids.  Each pregnancy that even the same woman has will be really, really different.  So having this oversimplified perspective on the right that you know mother who's gonna complete you and it's gonna give you the sense of purpose and it's gonna make you happy.  it's irresponsible to say that to young women because some women like it or lump it guys they are not meant to be mothers and some women can't be mothers.  so to deny that these women can't have a positive effect on their communities that they can't have purposeful lives that they can't be happy is just wrong.  it's just not true and I think it is a kind of fracturing of the community which is counterproductive and it's cruel and it's unnecessary.  and I just I just want I really hope that it can stop because There is an antinatalist element to this kind of bullying of women, I think, about their fertility and telling them that the only thing that they can do to win the approval of their community is to be mothers.  I just, you know, I think for many of us it is the greatest thing that we will ever do.  And I think for me, I'm hoping that it will be something that brings me a lot of joy.  But I'm not gonna delude myself or deceive women into thinking that it's something that is gonna solve all my problems.  I don't want to be a mother so that I can get the validation of the men or the women in this movement.  I'm doing it for me, I'm doing it for my future husband, I'm doing it for my mother and my father who I want to make grandparents and my grandparents who I want to make great-grandparents And I am under no illusions that it is going to be probably one of the most difficult things that I ever embark on.  so that being said Let's as a community.  If you're a fan of my content and you appreciate the women in this movement and what they're doing and how they're trying to set an example for young women, cut us some slack.  Be pro-natalist in supporting women in a positive way about them moving towards fertility.  Stop bullying women about getting pregnant as fast as possible because you don't know if they're actually trying or not.  And you don't know if that bullying is actually contributing to stress which is negatively affecting their ability to conceive.  And let's stop telling women that you don't get pregnant or you can't have children.  you're going to be miserable and your life is going to be pointless because it's just not true.  All of the science indicates that for the most part people are either happy or they're not and that's a personality characteristic.  It has very little to do with whether or not you have children.  Yeah, so I'm hoping that as I progress with this series, I can get more stories and more well-rounded information from real moms that can expand my own knowledge and my viewers' knowledge of the complexity of motherhood and the reality of motherhood.  If you have any stories, so I've received a lot of stories actually already and they are very powerful and very moving.  And I'm hoping to maybe start doing some story times where I can read the stories of the women who have reached out to me about their stories and about what they've experienced as moms.  And of course I will keep your identity anonymous.  You can email me.  My email will be in the description.  It's criticalcondition at pm.me.  Check for it in the description if you want to send me your story and share your story about motherhood.  and maybe have it featured on my channel in this sort of motherhood story time that I plan to start working on.  If you don't mind about kind of more publicly sharing these stories, feel free to post short stories in the comment section of this video.  So I want to thank you so much for listening to this video.  Thank you for watching and supporting the girl talk series.  It's been really fun.  I'm really excited for where it's headed and I just you know, I can't keep track of all the women who You know are being suggested to me and that I'm running into and meeting online all the time Who I think have a lot to offer this community and each other.  so that being said I hope everyone has a great week and if you enjoyed this video uh like and uh share subscribe.  if you haven't already and if you want to support the channel there will be links in the description for you to do so.  thank you so much bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0oti02mtcdviesy1mxcf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC_N4L2B-g2hZ9OPVdkmthGw","channel.name":"Robyn Riley","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX46rNQ9L_R4Ki7TAvk0urxfzOAIkkomRsq2t4gsw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2011-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses their Girl Talk series, which explores the experiences of women in the right-wing or traditional community.

Well, I have to first offer alternative suggestions.  How about something by Tim Wise or Al Sharpton? Why are you telling me all this, then? No. Don't you want to understand other perspectives? Like I said, there are unfortunately still certain laws.  We're still extracting genes from frozen Ruth. Alright, I still don't quite understand what's going on.  I just wanted to take the items on my wishlist and convert them into a sale, and I keep getting the same error message.  Yeah, we have a block on your order.  Well, it was all in stock. Well, there are items on your order that go against our terms of service. How do you list something on your site that you can't sell? Well, legally we do have to offer them for now because, well, we haven't figured out a way to clone Ruth Bader Ginsburg yet. Yeah, what's the problem?  Are they delayed? With cloning RBG? No, not with cloning RBG.  Try having conversations about politics outside of Starbucks.  I mean, are my items, what we're talking about in this conversation, delayed? No, not technically, but there's a delay in consent. Yeah, I consented to buy them, and I need to know they're going to arrive in time.  A lot of them are gifts. Well, let me explain.  I'm your consent advisor. Is that like the consent at my cousin's college? A little different, but maybe similar in that I'm here to make sure you don't unintentionally hurt anyone, including yourself. This is about the knives.  It's a kitchen set.  I know you don't allow people to buy that in the UK anymore, but I'm in America- Those are the least of our concerns.  Well, good.  That's part of a gift for my wife's birthday. Kitchen knives?  Don't you guys know we offer automated food delivery? Yeah, we like home-cooked meals.  Thank you. Do you help your wife with the cooking? I know my way around a kitchen, but it's not really my thing.  I get bored cooking. Can we get back-?  Well, it's not fair if she does something you don't. Yeah, she doesn't work on power lines for a living like I do.  Can we get back, please, to why my items are delayed? Well, as I said, I need to advise you on your consent. I consented to buy them.  I put them on my credit card. Well, I need to confirm you really want them and understand the consequences.  For example, you ordered several books that prominently mention white well-being.  That term is on our watch list. What a joke.  My God, I figured your company's keeping tabs.  That's crazy.  That's just a term about being happy and healthy with who you are. Well, it's not just our company's watch list.  We're overseen by the Ministry of Responsible Consumption. My God, sounds like something from 1984. Actually, it was created in 2011, but, like, no one knew for a while.  Like I said, I have to know you really want these books because you'll be closely monitored. Yeah, I figured I'm being monitored already.  It's okay. Why did you order several copies of each book? I want to give some to my friends and family. Oh, spreading disinformation gets you on another part of this list. All the movies and media and books my whole life are the other perspectives.  I've been swimming in the other perspectives my whole life.  You're swimming all the time in the other perspectives. Actually, I'm very open-minded. Yeah, you know what?  I do want to change my order now that I think about it. Oh, I'm glad to see you came to your senses.  I'll cancel everything. Yeah, I actually want to add a copy of each book and have it sent to your address.  Consider it my gift to you. Uh, no.  I can't do that. Why not?  I thought you were open-minded. I can't be seen with those books. They come in a nondescript cardboard box, as you know. I don't accept gifts, okay?  What about the rifle case you ordered? It's a gift for my friend Pete.  You see his address there?  I'm having it sent to him. And what will Pete be using this for? To put his rifle in it when he goes hunting into the shooting range. Right.  I'll be adding both you and Pete to the pre-terrorist list. Okay, I'm calling my lawyer.  It's just a pre-terrorist list.  Everything I'm ordering is sensible and legal.  This is crazy.  Well, I'm trying to give you a chance, but you're just not getting it.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  I'm not getting it.  I'm not getting anything. Well, admitting it is the first step.  I can transfer you to our partners at the Cultural Adjustment Ministry who can start you with counseling and re-education.  It's great. I did it.  No.  No, I'm not getting the items.  The books are available elsewhere.  I'll make the other stuff.  I'll make my own damn gifts if I have to.  Cancel my order.  Delete my information from your system. Well, I'll cancel your order, but I can't delete your info.  You're already on the watch list. From wish list to watch list.  Okay, fine.  Whatever.  Fine. Oh, one more thing.  Can I email you a brief survey to ask how I did today in assisting you? No.  I don't consent to that.  But I have one more thing for you. Yes? Have fun training your replacement in the Philippines.","channel.id":"clxmi0qxr044kcdvizhkl4gln","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCkY8CvV8WQFe87CZGmvuYHA","channel.name":"No White Guilt","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/0YucuojQg3vL5zFivzXCv6DZwmxOWS1QLEN9RRXD5xhaL5BObtCr6MqcnGGuopcNPp2ndmsvyM8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"A customer attempted to purchase items from an online store, but their order was delayed due to a block on their account.

If you need, if you want to protect people, put a camera.  My big problem here, no give me medicine.  I want to speak just you. So we need to talk about Moria.  It's one of the single issues in this crisis to receive almost more attention than anything.  It's this small little refugee camp about a 15 minute drive inland on the Greek island of Lesbos.  And this small camp has processed and received hundreds of thousands of Europe's refugee asylum applications.  It's a processing facility that's designed for about two and a half thousand people, but realistically holds around 10,000 in small tents surrounding the actual facility.  And the news reports that are coming out of this place are horrifying.  We've heard reports about starvation, murder, theft, the rape of women and children in these tents at night, and even that this facility is being used to filter ISIS into Europe.  So there's no doubt that this is a place we are going to need to visit while on our trip.  .  .  .  .  . How do you know it's ISIS? You can come to me and my tent. How do you know it's ISIS? We can't bring that camera, so we have to use that audio.  Do we have audio for it?  Can you use your... It has a microphone in it.  No, we can't bring the... They stopped you over there?  Yeah, so we have to just use that microphone.  Do we have a phone?  Yeah, so we have to just use this one.  Can we give him Lauren's mic?  Let me do a particular thing.  Ah.  You said you know ISIS is operating in this camp.  Why?  They are here because they are defeated in their countries. So they are looking for refugees. They are looking for a safe place.  They are here.  They can raid, they can kill, they can steal.  They have a monster face.  They have knives.  and they are causing violence in the camps?  They have something bad, a weapon.  Not weapon, like a knife, something like a razor.  Before I tried, he got hit in his head.  Police tell him, go Malak, go, go bitch.  They do not care about our life, okay? And they don't care that there are radicals in this camp. Radicals, yeah.  We told them to put a camera.  We told them many times to put a camera at least to protect ourselves.  Okay, we thank them, okay.  But we need a protection.  A protection at least.  Protection.  We appreciate what they do.  Food, okay.  They are providing food.  But we need a protection.  The very important thing is the protection.  Protection.  And drugs everywhere.  Drugs everywhere.  This is dangerous.  This is a virus.  Must be defeated. There are, you say, something like 11,000 people here.  How many would you say are ISIS or criminals? Many of them.  His life is not safe here. How do you stay safe? You just hope you will cross your fingers?  If the government put a camera everywhere, they will discover everything.  They will find out everything.  Just a camera.  Many of you came here, didn't send the message completely.  He's atheist.  He doesn't believe in any religion.  His life under danger.  Because you're atheist?  Yeah, yeah.  As he says. Is majority of the camp religious? Yeah, majority is the Islamic.  But he is scared from the ISIS.  He's scared from the Islamic.  Many people attacked him and using the knife against him. because he's atheist? No, because he is atheist, as he says. And if you are, do other atheists or Christians get attacked in the camp? Not just atheists, even Christians.  Also Christians?  Yes.  Also Christians, and then Jews?  Minority?  Yazidi, Kurds.  Yazidi, Kurds?  Kurds are important.  Four people from the Kurdish have been killed. So we've had a lot of offers these last few months to put out this film by pay-per-view, by DVD, a million different ways to get a profit from all of the work that we've put in.  But since the beginning of The Borderless Project, my team and I have wanted to make this a free-to-view movie.  so that as many people can see what we have found as possible.  Because we, and I'm sure many of you who have supported and watched my videos, believe this is an extremely important subject that is going to shape the future of the Western world and just the world in general.  And so many people need more information on what is going on with migration.  The costs so far have been pretty crazy.  from security to flights to camera equipment, hard drives, just our CFAST cards, the little cards to store footage on are $200 each.  And thank goodness we've had many kind donors who have made that possible.  Every single dime that has been donated so far has been spent on making this project.  And we have gotten so much content that we never expected.  Borderless has become a massive project, unlike anything we could have dreamed of at the beginning.  So naturally, The editing costs have gone way up from what our initial projections were.  From scoring the film professionally, to having a server to store all of the footage that we've gotten, to keeping the website running and paying editors to make this film as high quality as possible.  It is a big burden on the project right now.  Of course, we're going to finish it, but it would be extremely just helpful if any of you guys want to contribute to making this last push to finish borderless possible.  we really appreciate everything people have put in so far and we could really use your help again right now to finish this movie.  i know you guys are going to love it and i'm so excited to show you borderless.","channel.id":"clxmi0q9403n7cdvinxbcw8co","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg","channel.name":"Lauren Southern","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/9v48RdbSILVws4ajpGVaRniVh4lt5-Itwt-lYXwxWxi4KbHCLyei14-0_PDzjeSyQemu9Quq=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"A refugee camp in Moria, Greece, has been plagued by reports of starvation, murder, theft, and rape.

It was heavily criticised for being exploitative but critics failed to realise it was a critique of the post-colonial mindset and also a critique of the orientalist mindset of many liberal and left wing people who project the ideal of the noble savage on to traditional cultures. This is made really explicit in this scene in which the Australian Olivier puts the selfish and romantic Viviane in her place and reminds her of who she really is - a white Western woman. \n\nFootage used in this review falls under the fair Use Policy. I do not claim the rights to any footage used. \nProduced by: \nCircle Associates Ltd.\nLes Films du Losange.\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nouvelle de Cin\u00e9matographie (SNC)\nDistributed by: \nImperia Films, \nGuerilla Films (UK), \nHome Vision Entertainment (HVE) (2003) (USA), \nBFI player (Online)\n\nThis channel depends on your support:\nPaypal: https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/survivethejive\nPatreon: https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/survivethejive\nSubscribestar: https:\/\/subscribestar.com\/survive-the-jive\nGAB - https:\/\/gab.com\/StJ","publish_date":"2019-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":["cinema","La Vall\u00e9e","The Valley (Obscured by Clouds)","french cinema","noble savage","rousseau","orientalism","post-colonial","film","papua new guinea","seventies","jungle","rainforest","tribal","indigenous peoples"],"length":560,"views":22072,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Di8-NzSMrg\/hqdefault.jpg","yt_channel_id":"UCZAENaOaceQUMd84GDc26EA","transcripts":"Thank you.  I want to talk to you about a really great French film from the 70s called La Valais.  Now, it seems like some kind of hippie film but it's actually got an important message.  It's about a bunch of hippies basically who go on a trip in Papua New Guinea deep into some jungle to go and meet tribal people.  They're actually hunting out for a kind of a lost valley.  But the actual meaning of the film is about how these hippies are in their alternative lifestyle rejecting the Western traditions that they were raised in.  These French and Australian people, they're looking for an alternative life.  something they find is lacking in the West, so they believe they find it in the company of the primitive people, Papuan people, the tribal people.  Now, of course, people still think like this.  In fact, this is something that went back to Rousseau and the ideas of the noble savage.  The idea that people look on primitive man and they see a kind of, you know, the remnants of Eden in the savage.  And this happens now, of course, and it happens with, you know, hippies, like left-wing people who go traveling and, you know, think that, like, you know, these women who want to have their photo taken with lots of brown children and stuff like that.  But it also happens among people who project this onto their ancestors and they want to believe that there was some kind of, you know, harmony with nature in pagan times or whatever that we've lost.  Now, of course, it's mostly fantasy, but even what if it is true is also important, I think, to hear this clip of the film.  I just want to play to you because the guy here, the Australian guy, tells this French woman why you cannot recapture this lost innocence that we feel that we might have, we've left behind somewhere along the way in the March of Progress.  And he even says that the way to return to something authentic would actually be to take another bite of the apple, using a biblical metaphor.  You know, we've lost Eden through knowledge.  In that sense, if we take that in the metaphor of progress, we have lost the innocence of savagery through science.  the next step is not to go try to return back because you can't regain innocence once lost but it's rather to carry on forwards and with the knowledge that we have and try to reconcile what we of Westerners have created in the form of you know the materialist viewpoint and the progress of science with religious or a spiritual perspective on life and that's what I try to do myself.  that's something I try to do.  I'm not advocating that you take all your clothes off and run around like a savage.  I am very conscious of the fact that I live in the modern world and you should be too.  So this point in the film occurs after they've been staying for a while with a certain tribe and the woman is very very happy, she feels like she's built a real rapport with this tribe and that she's entered a special kind of state of existence and harmony with these primitive people and with nature around her.  But she gets slapped down by the Australian guy who tells it like it is.  And I'll just leave the clip to speak for itself because it's great.  And I recommend you watch the whole film too when you've got time. It's amazing.  We're so close to her.  We're almost like them.  I'm so happy.  We found the truth.  What's wrong, Olivier? It's the other way around.  What's the other way around? Because it's us who are going up.  We were tourists when we came here. What do you mean?  It's easy to dance, but can you work with her? Women are even more exploited here than elsewhere.  You know, Vivienne, in the Bulgarian camps, the whole society is subject to very strict rules. So are we. It's not the same thing.  We try to break our rules.  When they dance, It's not just for fun, but to make up for something.  Look.  This is the cemetery.  They're dancing the dead.  We only seek pleasure, maybe peace.  We don't give a damn. I don't know, Olivier, but look at this party.  Everyone's happy together.  Why does everyone hear so well without talking, like people who really love each other?  Why does everyone understand each other?  Why is everything so simple here? It's OK, but it doesn't mean much. You disappoint me, really. You look like my husband. Of course, he looks good.  But it doesn't go any further.  How do you want to have real relations between us, who destroy our social laws, and them, on the contrary, who live in terror and respect for taboos? I don't know, but I know it's possible.  We discover other things, that's all.  Don't you believe in the dark forces, in all these things? Yes, of course, a lot.  It's not their way.  For us, it's impossible.  We don't forget what we've been through.  It's not possible to decondition oneself, as Gaetan would say.  Once lost, innocence is never found again.  Paradise is a tunnel.  There are many exits, but no entrances.  The knowledge is irreversible.  When my grace descends, it's over.  I ask myself, in order to find her, not to do the opposite of what we have done.  If it is not necessary to die a second time in the palm of your hand, Thank you.","channel.id":"clxmi0p8602xdcdviudoykej0","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCZAENaOaceQUMd84GDc26EA","channel.name":"Survive the Jive","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJV_TeJQdM0VR7ExYitmiV8UoCRKFe8ggH_gRnVdyA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2009-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The French film La Valais from the 1970s tells the story of a group of hippies who travel to Papua New Guinea to meet tribal people and find an alternative lifestyle.

Thank you so much for your support and kindness these last few months.  I know I haven't made a video in several months, but I wanted to do some explaining today.  As many of you that watch my Sunday night podcast, Beauty and the Beta, which is always linked below, already know I am pregnant, finally.  I'm about four months pregnant now, and I have been really, really tired.  I know I'm prone to hyperbole, but seriously, it's like that kind of teenage hormonal exhaustion.  you had freshman year of high school where you'd sleep for 10 hours, come home from school and sleep another three hours.  I cannot get anything done.  I am constantly dragging ass, but it is getting better now that I'm out of my first trimester.  Additionally, pregnancy has made me extremely dumb.  I am forgetting basic words, dropping things, leaving important papers everywhere.  I don't think I'm going to be speaking intelligently about much for a little while.  Those are a few reasons that I haven't been making content.  Another reason is that I feel hyper-focused on the baby, and I have a lot of anxiety surrounding my pregnancy.  It has totally eclipsed political developments, my channel, my vanity.  I am just thinking all the time, how am I going to get through getting this baby out of me and raising her properly?  Not to mention that pregnancy is fraught with uncertainty, especially in this stage when I can't feel the baby, I'm not showing that much.  If I didn't feel like garbage and I wasn't gaining weight, it would be hard to tell that I was pregnant.  It's just a really strange period of time and I'm really scared, I'm really anxious, and I just wanted to disappear from the online sphere for a little bit to kind of deal with this without the outside pressure.  People can be ruthless and I've felt especially vulnerable the last few months.  And even though not making content causes a lot of stress, it seemed like stepping away for a little bit was the best course of action.  Maybe not the best, but it was the easiest.  Becoming a wife, moving and starting my life over, trying to conceive, and just losing passion for politics because my focus has shifted so much.  It all sort of happened at once, and there was just a huge content slowdown.  I didn't want to put out crappy content but I really felt like I was disappointing everyone.  I still do and I am so sorry for that.  But I have known since I started the channel that once I got pregnant especially but really once I moved that things were going to have to change.  I've always struggled with this part of me that wants to give everyone the finger and say whatever I want which I do.  But then sometimes I seriously regret it.  I retreat into myself and I'm totally unable to handle the backlash.  In that way, I have picked the least sustainable and suitable job for myself and my personality type.  My ego is just too fragile.  I sort of feel like you're either Ann Coulter and you have what it takes to deal with all of this or you don't.  And I clearly don't.  I'm too neurotic.  I have too much anxiety.  And even though I'm very proud of the work I've done and feel like I'm really good at this, it has just been... so stressful.  Now that I'm feeling the responsibility of another life, the life of a little girl that needs to be protected and raised so that she surpasses me and lacks my bad qualities like being a loudmouth, I am really beginning to understand just how important all of this is.  This really is what it's all about.  My whole life, the mistakes, the red pill, the channel, everything has led me up to this mammoth task.  I just have to do a good job.  And wrapping my mind around it, around the enormity of this task is consuming me right now.  I feel so blessed to have the opportunity to raise a new generation.  But I'm scared of the condition of the world around us, of our country.  And even though our ancestors had babies in wars and famine through death and destruction, I am still acutely aware of how difficult it's going to be to protect her from the society that we've created while allowing her to develop her own personality.  The last decade has, frankly, been horrible.  Not necessarily personally, although I'm convinced that the red pill and being immersed in the online political sphere has deleterious effects on mental health of people with sensitive personality types.  But as a society, we're really coming apart at the seams and there isn't the simplicity or the comfort of having a place in the world that previous generations experienced.  It's going to be very important for me to focus on what is good on the future, on what is positive, because I have a tendency to be nihilistic and now have a very serious moral obligation to avoid infecting a new generation with this nihilism.  I asked E. Michael Jones about this element of our culture in the conversation that we had over the summer.  And he said, we just have to look ahead and get excited about what we can build after this society fails.  And that's really what I'm doing by bringing new life into the world.  It's what I have to do.  I guess the question that I'm grappling with Is it possible to do all of these things, to raise a daughter, to be a good wife, to stay positive, and to continue doing this channel as I have been?  The channel exposes me to risk, to extremely high levels of stress.  I want to do the right thing for my family, but I still desire to make content.  There is also this question of women's role in the movement.  I'm not seeing a lot of women that have young kids and are still able to do this job unless they have a really specific personality type.  As far as current events and politics are concerned, I am pretty much maxed out in that arena just with my weekly podcast with Matt Christensen and our call-in show.  So amidst all of the bannings and getting burned out with current events, with demographic issues that we've discussed ad nauseum, with fiscal issues, I'm seeing a lot of people change direction, which I totally understand.  And that is something that I want to do as well.  I'm not saying there will be no more content on this channel.  I just don't have the same zeal for it that I once did.  Who knows, though, I don't want to shut it down because I might have this baby and that anger, that rage that drove me might return, might even be stronger.  I won't know until I meet her and see what I'm capable of.  I'll always do Beauty and the Beta, of course, but I'm also really feeling this urge to completely change direction.  I've decided to start a channel with my dear friend Critical Condition, Robin Riley, and she is also pregnant and newly married.  My audience here is so predominantly male that I don't think I can start rolling out the kind of content that I want to with my current branding and the demographic of this audience.  We're calling the channel Motherland, and it's linked below.  We've already recorded our first episode.  It will air tomorrow at 1 PM Eastern.  I know there are oodles of motherhood, cooking, birth, childhood development, marriage channels.  I watch them.  But what I see from almost all of them is a complete avoidance of the appearance of political bias.  There will be none of that.  And we have to let the channel develop organically like I have here.  But there are so many cultural issues that affect child rearing, that affect gender relations and marriages, that affect families and communities.  We want to talk about all the mom stuff, of course, but we want to be more than that.  We've talked about the direction of that channel and the future content on our premiere episode, which, as I mentioned, is going live at 1 p.m.  Eastern tomorrow and is linked below.  I really hope that you subscribe to our channel and that, man or woman, you enjoy our content.  I hope that you understand why I want to do this and that you don't feel like I'm being disloyal or unappreciative of the four years of support that you've given me.  I cannot thank you enough for that.  I truly can't.  I just feel like I have to make a different kind of content right now and I really hope that you come along with me.  Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you soon.

Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a different reality than other people, like everything that happens is so predictable, so obvious, so foreseeable, and the reactions even more so.  But if you're watching this video, I'm sure you feel the same way.  This shooting is so unsurprising.  We'll see more like it as angry young men like Brenton Tarrant, who feel cheated out of their birthright and have no hope for the future, take drastic, horrible measures, not for infamy, but for the reverberation that the inevitable reaction to this event and events like it will surely achieve.  Tarrant was not a conservative.  He was not a liberal.  He was a disaffected young man who, more than any other ideology outside of ethno-nationalism, was a collapsitarian, an accelerationist.  I do think it's important that you read his manifesto, although I can't link it because this video will get a strike, because we should understand the motivations of mass murderers.  If you do read it, you'll see that he resented liberals and conservatives alike, anyone who contributed to the cultural demise that the West is experiencing.  He talks about conservatives impotence and complete inability, even unwillingness to conserve anything at all.  And he despised what globalists have done to the West.  Here's what he had to say about his political identity.  Where are you right wing?  Depending on the definition, sure.  Where are you left wing?  Depending on the definition, sure.  Where are you a socialist?  Depending on the definition, worker ownership of the means of production, it depends on who those workers are, their intents, who currently owns the means of production, their intents, and who currently owns the state and its intents.  Were are you a conservative?  No, conservatism is corporatism in disguise.  I want no part of it.  I want to talk about this from an intellectual, unemotional standpoint because I think we can all agree we want to prevent future violence.  And the reactions are completing the circle of events initiated by the shooter, just as he intended.  It reminded me of the movie Seven.  Kevin Spacey's character knows he'll be killed in the end, but that the sequence of events that he sets in motion ultimately achieves his greater plan.  In order for it to be executed in its totality, all other actors must behave as anticipated.  And in that way, they're being used to do the architect's bidding.  Much is the same with this shooting.  Brenton Tarrant needed the media, the government, and the people to react predictably emotionally in order to hasten a cultural collapse through the disintegration of social cohesion.  And that's exactly what is happening.  In the manifesto, he outlines how he became increasingly tormented by existential angst while witnessing the West's cultural demise.  And instead of slowly watching it die, he wanted to hasten the collapse.  He wanted the ensuing chaos to engulf us and for the ramifications of the shooting to accelerate the downfall.  He said, In a section in his manifesto about his motivations, he says that he committed the murders... To incite violence, retaliation, and further divide between the European people and the invaders currently occupying European soil.  To agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to overextend their own hand and experience the eventual backlash.  To create an atmosphere of fear and change in which drastic, powerful, and revolutionary action can occur.  To add momentum to the pendulum swings of history, further destabilizing and polarizing Western society in order to eventually destroy the current nihilistic, hedonistic, individualistic insanity that has taken control of Western thought.  Finally, to create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural, political, and racial divide within the United States.  This conflict over the Second Amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the U.S.  along political, cultural, and most importantly, racial lines.  There was a reason that he mentioned PewDiePie at the beginning of the shooting.  It's not because he was inspired by him.  Anyone that watches PewDiePie knows he has never condoned violence and he is a light-hearted, good-natured guy.  Tarrant mentioned PewDiePie because he witnessed the treatment of alternative media figures and how they're demonized by the media by associating them with horrific actions through this vague process of alt-right radicalization, which is patently absurd, especially as it pertains to PewDiePie.  Tarrant knew that if he mentioned him, the media would slander PewDiePie, blame him for this terrible slaughter, and say that it was his radicalization, his actions, that led the shooter to do something like this.  Then there would be massive public and media pressure to shut down PewDiePie.  And just look at the reactions.  These media stooges and blue check leftists are doing exactly what the shooter wanted.  Now, with more subscribers than any other channel, I think it's like 90 million, PewDiePie is in serious danger of getting shut down.  In the event that he is, Tarrant's plans will be fully realized.  This cultural fissure will finally sever and there will be a tremendous backlash.  It was a strategic element of the shooting.  Get the media to blame YouTubers for this.  Put pressure on tech giants to further silence them.  and ultimately for Westerners to take up arms when their free speech rights are truly suppressed.  The shooter thought that this was an elegant plan, and the media, despite him saying outright in clear written language that this is what he wanted, is helping him by being totally predictable, particularly in the event that they pressure tech giants to crack down on right-leaning commentators.  And they will.  We're fools if we think that YouTube and Google are going to let us continue to speak on these platforms.  Just today, my video series on the Holodomor was age-restricted.  There's also a reason that he mentioned Candace Owens in his manifesto.  He said, is there a particular person that radicalized you the most?  Yes, the person that has influenced me above all was Candace Owens.  Each time she spoke, I was stunned by her insights and her own views helped push me further and further into the belief of violence over meekness.  Though I will have to disavow some of her beliefs, the extreme actions she calls for are too much, even for my tastes.  It seems incredibly obvious to me that this is a troll, but the media doesn't understand internet culture, nuance, or sarcasm for that matter.  So he knew that she would be eviscerated for this, despite quite obviously being blameless.  Anyone that's seen Candace's commentary knows that she is center-right, she's not an extremist.  His statement here is dripping with sarcasm, and he did this for a very specific reason.  He mentions Dylann Roof in a positive light, so I think it's safe to say that he wanted to neutralize her political power by creating an association with this mass murder.  He was punishing her for mobilizing Black conservatives.  since he has a stain for both conservatives and Black people.  He also knew that if she were banned, this would inflame racial and political tensions.  There is serious danger in the media, the public, and the alternative media playing into his hands here.  I saw this tweet by Jordan Peterson and it filled me with rage.  The pathology of identity politics on the extreme right.  This is what the shooter wanted.  He wanted to deepen the cultural divide on the lines of identity.  And despite all of Peterson's nauseating platitudes denouncing identity politics, he has enthusiastically become a pawn in a murderous plot to inflame racial, religious, and political animus between groups.  It's sort of profound in its irony.  Despite a document denouncing conservatives, denouncing leftists, denouncing really any group while only identifying with eco-fascism, the People's Republic of China, ethno-nationalism, and socialism, Peterson still fans the flames of this group divide by identifying him as a right-wing extremist.  I'm making this video because I want to prevent these acts of violence in the future.  And I know how to prevent them.  But I also know that there is nothing I can do about this and that none of the most powerful actors will be anything but predictable.  who, like Peterson, will play a powerful role in Tarrant's plans by hastening the collapse.  Tarrant wrote about accelerationism in very specific terms.  True change and the change we need to enact only arises in the great crucible of crisis.  A gradual change is never going to achieve victory.  These tumultuous times can be brought about through action.  For example, actions such as voting for political candidates that radically change or challenge entrenched systems, radicalizing public discourse by both supporting, attacking, vilifying, radicalizing, and exaggerating all societal conflicts, and attacking or even assassinating weak or less radical leaders and influencers on either side of social conflicts.  A vote for a radical candidate that opposes your values and incites agitation or anxiety in your own people works far more in your favor than a vote for a milquetoast political candidate that has no ability or wish to enact radical change.  Canvas public areas in support of radical positions, even if they are not your own.  Incite conflict.  Place posters near public parks calling for Sharia law.  Then in the next week, place posters over such posters calling for the expulsion of all immigrants.  Repeat in every area of public life until the crisis arises.  Destabilize, then take control.  If we want to radically and fundamentally change society, then we need to radicalize society as much as possible.  This attitude is prevalent in politics and in the general population these days.  These are not just the insane musings of a mass murderer.  Look at the Justice Democrats, for example, and I've linked Mr.  Reagan's excellent video on AOC and others like her that are essentially actors being used to fill governmental roles in order to evangelize radical positions.  AOC is not a natural phenomenon.  She's a carefully cultivated method of political and cultural demolition.  We have forces on both sides seeking to destroy through the creation of an imbalance, through subversion, through radicalization, through polarization, using the media and those stupid enough to be influenced by the paradigm.  In that way, both extremities are trying to bring a societal collapse, then capture power and rebuild the world in their image amidst the ensuing state of chaos and anarchy.  So how do we prevent violence like this from happening again?  We stop reacting emotionally and we look honestly at the real causes.  Yes, of course the blame always falls on the individuals that perpetrate crimes like these.  But once this becomes a pattern, just like Islamic terrorist attacks have become a pattern, and attacks like this will as well, we have to look beyond the individual if we are seeking to avert recurrences.  First, the shooter was correct that despite New Zealand gun laws being among the strictest in the world, guns would be blamed for this and it would affect culture and legislation surrounding gun use.  We can't keep acting like guns are the cause.  There's no gun law or combination of laws that will prevent attacks of this nature.  Once we give up this right, we'll be vulnerable to Islamic terrorist attacks, crime from our own people, and an ever encroaching evil federal government that would strip us of basic rights if an armed populace was no longer a deterrent.  We also have to look at our immigration policies.  There's no multicultural solution.  We've tried.  There's no endgame here where all disparate cultures are existing together peacefully.  It's never going to happen.  And until we realize this, we'll continue to foster hostile climates that create disaffected groups of increasingly violent people.  We have to evaluate our economic future, how we diminish the prospect for future generations to have children and relationships.  Things like this, personal satisfaction, a feeling of safety in one's community, trust in their government.  These are actually preventive measures.  These things create lives for people, reasons to keep living.  They create accountability.  We have to look at how we've treated men.  how we've demonized their masculinity, taken their hope, and created a generation of fighting-age men plagued with nihilism and without the normal support systems that would give someone like this a reason to just live a normal life.  Fighting nihilism.  That's the answer.  How do we do that?  We have to create a culture that's worth fighting for because the West right now is not.  It has degenerated into a society where the most vulnerable among us are preyed upon and indoctrinated, where incentive structures to destroy families are glorified, where the government is the mother, the father, the friend, the god.  We begin to create beautiful things again.  I got a lot of shit in my last video for saying that pursuing a career in art or music is unwise, and I stand by this.  It's a calculated financial risk that other people are not responsible for subsidizing.  But that isn't to say that no one should pursue the arts at all.  Artistic endeavors and fostering an environment rich in art, literature, music, is essential for Westerners to nurture their souls.  It is and always has been a vital part of our spiritual health and psyche.  This is a very sad turn of events and my heart goes out to these victims and families.  But unfortunately, unless massive strides are taken to correct course, we will see this again and again as our culture's gangrenous affliction worsens.  Then we'll see Islamic retaliation.  It will be a worsening tit for tat until it erupts into a war that involves all of us.  If you cannot see how this is clearly going to play out, you're a fool.  Or worse, like the media, a pawn.  Thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0r5m049zcdviphi5ilqs","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCpbyOgUSjTSPpvVUAT2OyHw","channel.name":"Blonde in the Belly of the Beast","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUBXvnTXDeyFu929ZWEC4UNFhe28v1mbn8JFRumcQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the Christchurch mosque shooting and its motivations, highlighting the shooter's desire to accelerate cultural collapse and societal chaos.

The average cost of a new home was less than $7,000.  You could get a new car for around $1,000 and gas was 15 cents a gallon.  The first Polaroid camera was demonstrated to the public.  The sound barrier was broken for the first time by Chuck Yeager.  And the transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories.  Yes, the times, they were a changing in 1947.  The CIA was created.  Hillary Clinton was born.  And in a way, so was Israel when the United Nations voted in favor of the creation of an independent Jewish state after years of Jewish terrorist attacks on the British and the Palestinians.  Ah, yes, 1947, when the Anglosphere wasn't exactly super excited about Israel.  or the Jewish Zionist terror groups like Ergun, who on July 22nd, 1946, had disguised themselves as Arab women, planted bombs in the basement of the King David Hotel, and then killed 91 people and injured 46, mostly British.  Or when the same Jewish terror group killed two British guards at the Jerusalem railway station on October 30th, 1946.  Or when the same Jewish terror group bombed the British embassy in Rome a day later.  Or when the same Jewish terror group killed four more British soldiers on January 12th, 1947.  When they bombed the British headquarters.  Or when the same Jewish terror group killed 17 British officers when they bombed the Goldschmidt Officers Club on January 31st.  Or when they kidnapped and hung two British sergeants on July 29th, 1947.  Or when the same Jewish terror group detonated two suitcase bombs on August 4th in the basement of the Hotel Thatcher.  I could keep going, but as we all know today, None of that matters.  In 1947, the Anglosphere was just simply infected with a poison called anti-Semitism.  But lucky for us, 1947 is also when they began to roll out the cure.  You see, 1947 was also the year that the Diary of Anne Frank was published.  And for the less literate, the film A Gentleman's Agreement was in theaters, and we know it must have been a fantastic piece of cinema because it won three Oscars, including the Oscar for Best Picture.  In 1947, A Gentleman's Agreement was released, the same year that the novel by the same name was released.  The novel by Laura Z. Hobson, a communist Jewish writer from Manhattan and daughter of Mikhail Zemkin, her father, who was a communist labor organizer and co-founder of the Jewish Daily Forward, and her mother, Adela Zimpton, who wrote for a socialist paper called Der Tag.  The film version of Hobson's book was directed by Ilya Kazan and starring the outspoken socialist Gregory Peck.  The film begins with Gregory Peck's character, Philip Green, a writer and widower with his son newly arrived in New York.  He has been hired for an assignment at a liberal New York magazine.  The assignment, he discovers, is a series on antisemitism.  At first, Green is not too excited about the project, but then he meets his boss's niece.  an upper-class wasp divorcee named kathy lacey whose idea it was to write the series.  he is further motivated to write the series after telling his mother who he and his son are staying with in new york that he is not too pleased with the assignment and his son begins to ask questions about what anti-Semitism is.  He decides he doesn't want to live in a world where his son has to even worry about that.  So he tells the editor that he'll do the story but for the longest time he can't figure out an interesting angle.  He bangs his head against the wall just trying to think of a creative new way to present the problem of anti-Semitism to the Christians.  One night while he's trying to get through his writer's block his mother has a heart attack.  And he calls the doctor.  She's confined to her bed and now his situation is even worse because he has to do everything around the house that his mother was doing.  He explains to his mother that he's having a really hard time figuring out how to come up with a fresh angle on the story.  And that's when he gets an idea.  He decides he's going to pretend to be Jewish for six months and write about how he experiences anti-Semitism firsthand.  He finally has his angle, but he completely forgets to tell his new love, Kathy, because he's also going to propose to her tonight.  And she, of course, accepts.  The next day, he tells the editor what he plans to do.  The editor thinks it's a great idea.  They decide that for it to really work, though, they have to tell everyone.  even the people at the office, that he's Jewish.  The only way it can work is if nobody is in on the trick, and that includes Phil's new secretary.  Upon meeting his new secretary, he tells her that he wants to start sending applications for jobs and to universities, two identical sets.  The only difference will be that on one set, it'll be under the name of Green, and the other set will be under the name Greenberg.  That's when she tells him that of course the Greenbergs will be rejected.  She explains that she is a Jew and that she had to pretend not to be Jewish in order to get a job at the magazine.  She said they wouldn't have hired her if they knew that she was Jewish.  They wouldn't have hired her at a liberal magazine in New York if they knew that she was Jewish.  I found this a little amazing considering the fact that many publishers, including the New York Times, was owned and operated by Jewish families in 1947.  Not to mention nearly every film studio and broadcast network.  The idea that it would be difficult for a Jew to get employment at a liberal New York publication in 1947 is just as laughable as it would be today.  In fact, the author of a gentleman's agreement was both a Jew and a communist.  And she was published in Time, the New York Post, Life and Fortune magazines.  She was also published in the New Yorker, a magazine exactly like this fictional magazine in the movie and her book.  And this was all before her book or this movie came out.  In fact, the publisher of her book, Simon and Schuster, was founded and run by two Jews, Richard Simon and Max Schuster.  Just the premise that the American media in 1947 would be anti-Semitic is ludicrous enough, but the film takes an even more bizarre turn.  His secretary says she's glad there aren't a lot of Jews in publishing.  Because if the bad ones, and by that means other Jews, got hired, then it would turn everyone against the good ones like her and Philip.  And remember, this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture.  When Phil gets home, he tells the doctor that he has the name of a heart specialist that he'd like his mother to see.  The doctor is taken aback when the name he gives him is a Jewish name.  It's Dr.  Abrams.  He says, don't worry, though.  He's not like the other Jewish doctors.  He doesn't overcharge.  Phil acts very offended and tells the doctor that, well, he's Jewish, to which the doctor says, oh, that's fine by him.  And he's not prejudiced, of course.  but now he looks uncomfortable and he leaves.  Phil then goes down to the mailbox and adds the name Greenberg to his box.  The super tells him that's not a good idea and wants him to leave the name off.  The implication, of course, is that he doesn't want a Jewish name where people can see it.  Phil threatens him and leaves angry.  Phil then goes to see his new fiance and finally tells her of his plan.  Kathy doesn't like the plan and wants to let her friends and family in on it.  He gets upset and implies that maybe she's anti-Semitic too.  Sure, it was her idea to write the series, but it seems that everyone he encounters in New York is treating him like a pariah, including his fiancee, who knows it's just a trick.  When he goes into the office the next day, he tells the editor his secretary had to pretend not to be Jewish just to get her job at this so-called liberal magazine.  The editor is shocked and calls in the clearly anti-Semitic gentile that does all the hiring and tells him to run new ads advertising they will hire Jews and not to discriminate anymore or he'll be sorry.  Afterwards, his secretary tells him that was a bad idea.  The magazine's going to start hiring Jews now and that'll make other people working there hate Jews.  His secretary, a Jew, is literally telling him that the mere presence of Jews, who she describes as loud and vulgar, will cause the other people at the magazine to be anti-Semitic.  Just the mere presence of, if they hire Jews, it'll make everyone at the magazine hate Jews.  Philip becomes enraged and tells her that she's now being anti-Semitic.  And that if she wants to keep working for him, she'd better check her anti-Semitism.  Remember, he's not really Jewish.  She is.  And also remember, this movie got an Oscar for Best Picture.  This sort of thing keeps going on and on throughout the entire film.  Everyone, it would seem, except for Phil, is a secret anti-Semite.  At a party, Phil is introduced to a Jewish physicist who is likely based loosely on Einstein.  He says he doesn't believe in God and that the only reason he continues to call himself a Jew is because being a Jew puts you at a disadvantage.  He says that he sees it as a challenge because being a Jew makes everything in life harder.  And so he continues to call himself a Jew, despite being an atheist.  And according to this film, the physicist is correct.  Phil's Jewish friend, a real Jew, comes to stay with him after he gets out of the army.  When they're out to dinner, a man comes up to him for absolutely no reason and just tells him he doesn't like Jews and tries to fight him.  At the country club Phil wants to stay at for his honeymoon, they cancel his reservation when he tells him that he's a Jew.  The kids at his son's school hear that his father is Jewish and refuse to play with him and start threatening him.  When this happens, his fianc\u00e9e tries to comfort the boy and tells him, don't worry, you're not really Jewish.  And Phil flies into another rage and starts calling her anti-Semitic again.  She says she can't handle the stress of this social experiment anymore and she calls off the wedding.  Which is too bad because finally Phil's experiment is complete.  He delivers the first part of his article to his editor and everyone is shocked to find out that he's not really a Jew and they feel ashamed for having treated him so poorly.  Even Phil's now ex-fiance, Phil's guilty.  She calls up Phil's real Jewish friend and tells him to come have dinner with her so they can talk.  When he arrives, she asks him if he thinks that she's anti-Semitic.  And after talking about how she has stood idly by while others have told racist jokes, and by not being a champion against bigotry, by not being proactive, a warrior for social justice, that yes, perhaps in a way, she is.  Meanwhile, Phil's mother has just read the first part of his article, and she tells him that she hopes she can live long enough to see a world without anti-Semitism, that she's so proud of her son for fighting bigotry and in Manhattan, and after a talk with his real Jewish friend about what he has learned with this social experiment, he decides to forgive his anti-Semitic wasp girlfriend because, you see, it's not her fault.  Anti-Semitism is just a disease that affects all Gentiles.  Even those with the best intentions who don't like racist jokes.  Hell, it even infected some of the Jews, like Phil's secretary.  But perhaps through the hard work and sacrifices of heroes like Phil, the diseased Gentiles will finally learn to stop hating Jews for no reason at all.  For Black Buildin'.  I'm Devin Stack.

A few non-conformists here and there, they don't pose a threat.  In fact, they can serve as useful examples to the larger group who will see how isolating it is to be different.  How powerless these people are, these loners.  But not if they're able to group together.  That can't be tolerated.  There can't be anything that ties the individuals together.  There can only be one bond.  One single, unbreakable bond.  And that is the bond between all these satellite individuals.  The bond between these automatons.  and the will and the desires of the people upstairs.  The most important bond to break to create these rootless wandering automatons, the root of all bonds, the foundation that needs cracking, the bond between man and woman.  What a marvelous success this project has been in the last few decades.  Even the people upstairs are blushing.  Who would have imagined that this bond would be so easy to sabotage?  Well, the people upstairs knew.  After all, their master... had showed them exactly how to do it.  The bond between Adam and Eve that kept them in paradise was easily undermined simply by manipulating Eve.  Their master taught them a long time ago, to get what you want, you don't have to manipulate the men.  You simply manipulate the women and once they're compromised, they'll manipulate the men for you.  The people in research, they ran focus groups and discovered that men had the foresight and the reasoning capabilities to see the problems with socially deregulating the sexual marketplace and turning it into a free-for-all.  Boys, of course, are a completely different story.  Boys, not men.  are so hopped up on hormones and biologically hardwired to want all the casual monkey sex they can get their hands on.  Boys aren't a problem.  But boys don't make the rules.  Men make the rules.  And men instinctively want to protect their women.  Especially if they have daughters, they understand they have to preserve the regulation of the marketplace.  By making sex this impersonal thing, the same thing as playing a video game with a friend, it ruins women.  So the people upstairs were going to have to necessarily first manipulate the women, who would then, once compromised, manipulate the men.  If they could pull this off, eventually there wouldn't be any men.  Once women were on board, the boys with a steady diet of meaningless dopamine without the pesky bonding with women or the reproductive process that often pushed these boys into being men.  these boys could just be led around by their testicles for the rest of their lives, no problem, and just exist in this perpetual state of arrested development.  The guys down in research, they ran focus group after focus group, and it seemed that even though they'd been wildly successful in their other efforts to manipulate women, into treating their reproductive organs as some kind of malady that needed to be treated with regular medication, and their children as some kind of parasite that had to be violently exterminated with surgical instruments as quickly as possible so they didn't get in the way of their trip to Cancun.  There was still a lingering instinct that women seemed to be clinging to.  They had this idea that there was something emotionally connecting about sex.  which was confusing because they had already jumped on board the feminism train.  It didn't make any sense.  These girls had been programmed from an early age to believe they were either identical or superior to men.  Certainly, they could enjoy sex the same way that men did, with the same detachment.  Anything men could do, they could do.  It just had to be marketed better and given a catchy name, rebranding.  Instead of whoring around, it would be called Friends with Benefits.  That just has a much nicer ring than being a complete slut.  The people upstairs, they loved this new slogan, this Friends with Benefits.  It was the perfect rebranding.  So they gave the people in marketing an unlimited budget.  So being creative really wasn't all that necessary when it came to manipulating women.  And to be fair, being creative is rarely necessary when it comes to manipulating women.  That's why fashion magazines fundamentally haven't changed since the invention of fashion magazines.  and why every romantic comedy is interchangeable with every other romantic comedy.  Romantic comedy?  That's brilliant, said the boys in marketing.  So they got to work on not one, but two movies they could use to manipulate women into getting on board with this whole friends with benefits thing.  The first one they would call friends with benefits.  I told you they don't have to be creative.  And the second one they would call friends with benefits.  Oh, come on, said the men upstairs.  Women are easy to trick.  We can have two movies with the exact same story pushing the exact same message.  But for God's sake, man, they can't have the exact same name.  And so one of these scripts, and I'm actually not kidding, this unironically happened, they renamed to No Strings Attached.  Love it, said the people upstairs.  So what's the story about?  Story, said the people in marketing.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not how this works.  Women don't care about stories.  Why do you think every romantic comedy has essentially the exact same story?  They care about status.  And in 2011, the two men with arguably the highest status in the sexual marketplace are Ashton Kutcher and Justin Timberlake.  Bam.  Done.  This propaganda is already paying for itself.  Without knowing anything else about this film, women will line up and buy enough tickets to make us millions.  So what about the men?  Presumably, men will see these movies too, even if some of them are being forced to see it on a date.  Who are two women that every man in 2011 wants to have sex with, but who aren't so hot that it'll piss off the women in the audience?  Just hot enough for the neurotic women to delusionally think they can relate to them.  How about Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis?  Done and done.  Okay, so now we know that the women will come and see the movie because they want to see Justin Timberlake or Ashton Kutcher and they want to be Natalie Portman or Mila Kunis.  So now with all these women in the audience, all we have to do is just normalize the casual hookup culture by having all of the women in the film behave like teenage boys and then to really sell it, we have the men in the movie behave like neurotic, promiscuous women.  But why do that?  Why have the women in the film always be the ones that want to make the first move?  Why have it be the women who always insist that there be no strings attached?  Why have it be the women who that are afraid?  it's the men that will think it means more than it does.  If you understand marketing to women, this is pretty easy to explain.  Not only does this condition the women by watching women who they want to emulate in the film, it conditions the women in the audience to think that this kind of behavior is normal.  but it also alleviates all the fears that come with knowing deep down inside that it's not normal.  You see, the women know from experience that on a basic level, that unless they're sociopaths, that they will become emotionally connected with the men that they have sex with, and they won't like that the man is treating it casually.  Outside the movie theater, in reality, this makes them feel cheap Because they feel like they're giving up something valuable and arguably the most valuable thing that they have, giving it up as easily as they would an extra cigarette to a stranger.  So by having the women in these movies be the cold, calculating personalities, it models the behavior for the impressionable girls in the audience, but it also tells them that the men won't treat it casually.  In fact, the men... It's the men who will become emotionally involved.  They will pine over the women who are freely providing them sex and demand a relationship with them.  What are you afraid of, you prudes?  Don't you want a guy like Ashton or Justin?  Well, this is the new game.  Playing hard to get was your grandma's game.  If you really want a guy now... You just have to have sex with him.  You just have to casually have sex with him with complete emotional detachment.  And eventually, he'll fall in love with you.  He won't be able to live without your vagina.  That's how it works.  He will totally think that sex with you is a unique, magical experience that can't be replicated with all the other women who are also giving him casual sex.  You see, your vagina is special.  That's how it works.  And then at the end, you'll be at Grand Central Station while a flash mob that the love of your life has paid to be there in advance dances away to your favorite songs while he professes his love for you.  It's as simple as that, ladies.  You might be thinking that sounds a little heavy-handed.  But don't think the marketing team doesn't do their homework.  This might all seem too on the nose, but it's also the subtleties.  All about the subtleties.  The subtleties like not having any father characters at all for the girls.  In fact, In the Friends with Benefits film, Mila's mom is a single mother boomer who loves that her kid is finally acting the way she did in the 70s, finally having random sex, and doesn't even know who her father is.  The marketing team, they know their audience very well.  They were the same marketing team telling the boomers in the 1970s to just do a bunch of drugs and have anonymous sex.  Which is exactly what created all these fatherless homes.  All these single mother households that were raising these Gen Xers and Millennials.  Who would be very receptive to the whole friends with benefits thing.  Once they have kids, whichever children they don't abort, they can tell those kids, you know, who wants to play the same old video game over and over again?  People have been playing this video game for centuries.  Let's play all these new games.  Let's play whatever game comes out and let's all try to get the high score until we're all just fucking each other in the ass and chopping our cocks off because what does it matter anyway?  We're all going to live happily ever after.  For Blackpilled, I'm Devin Stack.  If you like my videos, make sure you like and subscribe.  Make sure you share.

So have a listen and make up your own mind.  So if we start with the basic premise of Star Wars, in the original trilogy and prequels at least, it all centers around an evil tyrannical emperor ruling the galaxy, whilst a group of heroic selfless rebels resist him and are attempting to free the galaxy.  This is basically a depraved Satan's view of God ruling over Earth and being an evil tyrant.  while Satan and they are heroically the Rebellion, putting up a fight to save everyone.  So to tie it together, I will briefly explain the characters and who they represent.  The main bad guy in the series is certainly the Emperor, a.k.a.  Senator Sheev Palpatine.  He represents Yahweh, our God.  Palpatine despises all non-humans, and Cod, of course, was not a big fan of fallen angels mating with animals or Adamkind either.  He is depicted from Satan's perspective as being completely evil.  Darth Vader represents Christ, the chosen one, born in a miraculous way, twisted and evil as Obi-Wan explains.  That would be Satan's point of view of course.  Although in Christianity we know that God and Christ are one and the same, in this story they are represented as two individual characters and more on that later.  Padme, she was once the bride of Anakin who became Darth Vader.  She represents the children of Israel, the bride of Christ or God.  Anakin is trying to keep her alive, even keep her alive forever.  Essentially Christ redeeming and saving Israel from death forever.  They are both trying to save their wife.  Luke Skywalker represents a son of God, i.e.  any Christian.  He will later have a major impact changing Christ or Vader's mind, but we will get onto that later as well in the story.  Lastly the Jedi Council, these represent Satan's people shall we say, who have always opposed Christ right from the beginning of time.  Of course they are depicted as good, peace loving and selfless, in reality they are completely evil.  If we move into the plot, what is most important is the main scenes that direct the story.  We will begin where Palpatine God has finally defeated the Jedi Council and has executed Order 66.  This represents Jerusalem being destroyed in about 70 AD, where Christ or God got revenge on the Sadducees and Pharisees for rejecting him and killing him, hence the name Revenge of the Sith or Revenge of Christ.  The 2000 years since Christ today is represented as just 20 years in Star Wars, with Vader at the forefront, Christ leading legions of stormtroopers, Christians all around the galaxy who look just like him, Christians with Christ's Holy Spirit dwelling within, They massacre any resistance, conquer whole worlds and tyrannize the galaxy.  This is essentially depicting Europe accepting Christianity, ending all other religions, the crusades and of course it's depicted as the dark times.  Just like now we are taught in history class, Christian Europe was the dark times.  So deep down from Satan's perspective, they know they're doomed.  But hey, this is a movie, so they can change the ending.  In this series of events, Luke Skywalker, who can be any Christian, convinces Darth Vader, that's Christ, that he was wrong all along, and that his way is not the righteous way.  Vader Christ turns against Palpatine God and destroys him, later dying himself.  Remember, these are deranged minds.  And the outcome is the rulers of this world are left to their own devices, unchallenged, without God, who has destroyed himself, after first realizing that Satan was right all along.  However, in reality, a different outcome awaits them.  The Great Day, the Lake of Fire.  Now the great duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan.  This represents Christ versus his enemies.  In the movie, Anakin, Christ, has sided with Palpatine, God, obviously.  Now pay special close attention to the dialogue.  Remember, from a warped, satanic perspective.  So, Anakin is whining that Obi-Wan has turned his wife against him.  This is Christ the God whining that Israel, his people, his bride, have turned away from him.  Obi-Wan counters.  it's all his own fault.  It's all because of his anger and lust for power.  It is because of God's flawed laws, harsh treatment of the children of Israel, and his selfish desire to make himself ruler, king over them and the whole world that has caused them to turn away from him.  Now Anakin counters, he sees through the lies of the Jedi.  Christ always saw straight through the lies of his enemies.  But here he is depicted as a crazed, power-hungry maniac.  Obi-Wan's allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy.  We all know how Satan loved their sham democracy and rigged elections.  Anakin says, if you're not with me, then you're my enemy.  Now George Lucas of course couldn't use a direct quote from the Bible.  That would be way too obvious.  But it's essentially what Christ said.  He that is not with me is against me.  Finally, only a sith deals in absolutes.  I will do what I must.  Of course, God's law is absolute.  It is sovereign.  Only Satan rebels against it.  After the battle, Anakin is horrifically maimed, having now lost four limbs, which represents the nail going through Christ's limbs, ultimately the crucifixion.  Obi-Wan, the enemies or Satan didn't want to do it, but they had to because Anakin Christ was evil.  Had Christ only seen things their way, maybe it could have all been avoided.  Rather than Christ's resurrection being depicted as miraculous and glorious, we instead get a warped perspective.  Anakin is put back together as a machine in pain and agony.  This is a complete mockery of Christ.  So why do all the Sith, or at least a majority, have these evil yellow eyes?  Well this is simply a reference to Revelations 19.12 where Christ on his second coming appears with eyes like a flame of fire.  so this is represented in the movie literally as flaming looking siphires.  what about anakin's name?  why did george pick such a weird name for the main character?  well if you split it into two you get anna and kin.  anna in hebrew means god is gracious or simply grace Whilst kin means your kindred, your kinsmen, i.e.  your race.  So if we bring it all together, you get race of grace.  The Israelites are the race of grace.  They are saved by Christ no matter what, as they are under his grace.  George was pretty sneaky here.  Although it could just be a coincidence, but the actor Hadrian Christensen, what are the chances of his last name actually being Christ?  What about the whole Plague story?  It's become one gigantic meme.  Almost as popular as a certain other Obi-Wan meme.  But anyways, the whole he could save others but not himself is straight from the Bible.  It's exactly what the people said to Christ after healing people and raising them from the dead.  During the crucifixion, he could save others, they said, but he can't save himself.  Kind of ironic, wouldn't you say?  So it's nothing original from George, just a verse made into a little backstory.  Of course, Star Wars is just one movie, and there's many more which do the exact same thing.  Thanks for watching, praise Yahweh, and hail Christ.","channel.id":"clxmi0mkw0121cdviprmvy4pp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","channel.name":"TruthVids","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVAyptfys-UmOQ2qarn1fQod4Buiqcki0hctHTY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker argues that the Star Wars series retells the Christian story of Christ from a satanic perspective, where God and Christ are the villains, and Satan and his descendants are the heroes.

Over the river there you see the Weir Lodge.  That's where my mother was born over the bar and that premises that my grandfather Martin and his wife Bridie owned.  And then next door to that is Peter Reynolds' pub and next door to that is the Shannon Quay West Hotel where originally there was a building called The Beaches that my grandparents on my father's side used to live.  with their family until they moved over to Shannon and they built their own house up the village and eventually established the bacon factory which was Hanley's Bacon Factory which was taken over by Glambie in 1989 and lasted about another 14 years before it burnt down and the village never really recovered since.  There was a bit of a respite back in I guess 2006-2007 time when the building boom was going on but after the crisis in 2008 things really haven't recovered here.  It's a very picturesque village down here.  It deserves a chance to rebuild itself.  to see the prosperity that was once here return.  Like back in the 80s, there was full employment here.  There was 500 people employed in the factory.  Somebody mentioned that, I mean, people didn't have to emigrate unless they wanted to.  You know, there was always something in Ruskie for them.  And it prospered and, you know, a lot of people came to the place.  The boats going, I remember the boats when I was younger.  Coming up and down the Shannon, fishermen from Germany, England especially, they'd all come around here and they all had memories of Ruskie.  And so many people, anywhere I've been in Ireland, I tell them I'm from Ruskie and they say, I remember Ruskie on the Shannon.  It deserves a chance to rebuild itself.  And it can happen.  There's a high amenity area here that we have here.  But it'll be the people at Ruskie that do it.  There won't be any help from outside.  The hotel back in 2011 closed down.  I remember it was a good restaurant, good bar, well-run establishment.  And unfortunately, with the downturn, it was closed.  But it was the hub of the village for a lot of years there.  Birthdays, weddings.  It was a shame to see it go.  The village hasn't really recovered since.  And it really needs its hotel back.  It could be the start of something.  you know, a revival in the local area and that's what the area needs.  People need it and I think it's now is the time for a redevelopment of the area and unfortunately with the proposed direct provision centre that they're talking about putting into it, you can write all that off.  That's not going to happen.  The boats that come through here in the summer and that, they're not going to stop.  I really can't see how any development will come around the place if that direct provision centre comes into the area.  As far as I can tell, talking to people here that they don't want to do, they really feel that the people coming in here, having their protest, like they've nothing got to do with the area.  They don't know the people here.  They really feel like they're being intruded upon and being told how to think and how to feel about the whole situation.  The locals here have had enough of their behaviour and we'd rather be left to our own devices, thank you very much.  And that goes for the Department of Justice.  and the government as well because they've done nothing for this area for so many years and then they like without discussion without anything come along and want to slap this on the people of Rooski after all the years that they've put up with everything and I mean, this government have done nothing for the area.  Nothing.  And all the politicians and that that are running around the place, they've all gone to ground now with this potential direct provision centre.  So, and I hope the hotel does open up as a hotel in the future.  And we'll just see how many of them turn up for the opening day if it does happen.  And I really hope it does happen.

You've seen the A-listers at the events. Hello. Oh, you're on time.  Awesome.  Most of the actresses in this town are always late. Oh, well, that's how I was raised. Wonderful.  Great.  So, yeah, as you probably know, the agency has brought me in today to do a little consulting.  I'm like a consultant.  We do this like one-on-one phone call.  I've worked with some big names.  I don't really like to say, but Scarlett Johansson, Angelina Jolie.  I don't really name drop, but Jennifer Lawrence, for example. Yeah, I'd heard. Yeah, great.  And so let's assess the situation.  On one level, you've made it.  You're here.  Tinseltown.  You started off doing regional theater as a teenager.  And over the years, you put in hard work.  You maybe got a nose job. Oh, I haven't had a nose job. Maybe a little time on the casting couch. No, no.  I never did that. We all get here in our own ways.  But the point... Is it, you're here, you know?  You started doing some bigger movies, you've been on TV shows, write magazines and blogs.  I mean, it's every girl's dream, right?  How many of your friends are still doing community theater in like Dubuque or wherever the hell, you know? Well, I still like to do small theater, but yeah, it's pretty amazing and I'm so grateful. Yeah, let's go with that.  Gratefulness, gratitude, that's awesome.  So, like, what we're thinking is it's time for you to go to like that higher level of. Well, I've been looking for a very emotionally fulfilling role.  I'd like to perhaps be in a story about family. Okay.  Yeah, great.  I understand that you're agents looking at a script about adoption right now, but I'm really more the image guy, you know?  And if we play this right, we strategize right, we could be looking maybe at Oscar nominations in a few years.  You know, the supporting role, of course, but... okay i'm listening i'm here to do good work. good good good okay.  so there's been a progression over the last few years.  okay we're thinking it's time for you to mellow the yellow. uh mellow the yellow. yeah the blonde thing the blonde thing. oh uh you mean dye my hair for a roll.  Yeah, sure, if it makes sense for the character. Image guy.  Image guy, remember?  This is for you.  All the time.  Public perception. Well, what does it matter if I'm blonde when I'm not filming?  This is my natural color. Well, you have to understand, this is the trend, this is the way it's going, and we're thinking it's a permanent trend.  That's what we're thinking. Oh, do you mean it's hurting my chances of being cast? Right, well... That could be one side effect.  But again, I'm more the you guy, not so much the characters you play guy.  And just in the whole context of the whole town, let's just be frank.  You're the only one.  You're the only actress in town who's still... Blonde?  Yes! Well, it's my natural color.  My family has roots in different parts of Europe.  It's in my genes.  Why would I want to change that? But I've always loved my long, blonde hair since I was a little girl.  My mom and I used to... It's so nice, but, I mean, no one has it anymore.  I mean, do you want to work?  Do you want to work?  Are you threatening me?  No.  No.  No, no.  Of course not.  I couldn't threaten you.  I'm here like an advisor, like a friend, okay?  But you have to understand, it's out there now in the culture.  Like more girls with light hair dyeing their hair darker, even perms.  And then we have the campus shave events where girls with light hair are shaving their hair off.  You've seen this? thought that was just like a weird one-time thing. no no it's not.  it's big like this is what I mean.  you need to be a little more plugged in and that's where I come in.  I'm like an advisor like a friend like even though I'm being paid for this.  you know everything in life's transactional.  on one level like a deeper level we're talking we're connecting.  I feel like we're becoming friends. you know right I can't say I agree. okay Okay.  Trust.  We need to establish more trust here.  Okay, I'll be vulnerable.  Even though I'm not one of these public people on the screen like you, I myself, under this very hat, I have red hair with some blonde in it and my beard, and I'm undergoing the procedures to permanently darken my hair. How can you dye your hair permanently? No, no, no.  See, that's the thing.  That's the thing.  It's not dye.  It's the latest.  It's gene therapy.  My hair will actually start to grow in darker. Light hair, blonde and red hair is a tiny percentage of the world's population.  It's part of your heritage. Why would you do that?  Okay, right.  Okay, but as I keep explaining, like, this is the trend.  This is the way it has to go.  And, you know, the gene therapy is even going to help with the skin. The skin? Yeah, yeah.  Like, that way when you eventually adopt, your kids will be more comfortable.  You'll look more like them. What are you talking about? You know what?  Maybe we're not ready for the adoption talk quite yet, but you have to take my professional advice here.  This is the trend.  This is the way it has to go, okay? Oh, my God.  I remember hearing about how the dumb blonde meme started 100 years ago in Hollywood.  This is hate. I love my features.  No, no, no.  You understand.  Love actually requires that we do this.  There's a lot of girls that look up to people like you, to actresses, and they need to see this.  This is actually, like, this is a mark for me.  Like, I personally, I can't wait.  It can't come soon enough for me to get this hair color off of me and change.  Yeah.  You need to get a grip.  I'm going to show you.  I'm going to prove it to you.  You know what?  I'm going to dye my hair right now.  What am I waiting for?  Why am I waiting for the gene therapy to kick in? This is sick. I have a better idea.  I have a better idea.  I'm going to shave my hair and my beard right now for you.  Okay? I'm having no part in this. You know what?  This is a mark.  This is like the mark of the beast.  I need to atone.  Even shaving is not good enough.  I'm going to rip.  I'm going to rip my hair and my beard out. My bare hands.  Oh, my God.  You know, I think I'm going to get out of this business and buy that farm with my husband.","channel.id":"clxmi0qxr044kcdvizhkl4gln","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCkY8CvV8WQFe87CZGmvuYHA","channel.name":"No White Guilt","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/0YucuojQg3vL5zFivzXCv6DZwmxOWS1QLEN9RRXD5xhaL5BObtCr6MqcnGGuopcNPp2ndmsvyM8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The consultant, an image expert, was brought in to advise an actress on her career.

There's actually one person here all the way from France, which is fantastic.  Okay, the pursuit of truth is the essence of civilisation, and the freedom of nations depend on it.  As such, truth, freedom and democracy are the essence of the civilised Western world.  We as sovereign people are standing at the precipice of another invasion of Ireland through the medium of mass immigration.  We are watching silently at the destruction of our communities, the breaking down of our family, the removal of our religion, culture and the dismantling of our state.  We are not allowed to have an opinion.  or indeed an objection to any of it.  We did not choose this path for ourselves, it was chosen for us.  Our replacement and the dissolution of our state has been visited upon us by the European finance capital and an anti-Irish government in favour of global financial gain.  Extreme social liberal ideology is the flavour of the decade, so extreme in fact that the lines of right and wrong truth and lies are constantly blurred by the sensationalising nonsense of the left in the mainstream media and the scramble for money and control.  Ireland is no longer a democracy but a socialist state where intimidation, rape, murder, terrorism flourish in our cities and towns.  Our people and the vast numbers of Islamic migrants are mere pawns in a game of thrones that will change the demographics of our country forever.  Our extreme leftist government refuses to discuss or even acknowledge the demographics, betting and border security matter.  The Socialist paper, People Before Profit, reported on 27 February, the Government Strategic Communications Unit paid for sponsored news pieces to appear in national and regional newspapers promoting Ireland 2040, which could not include negative or critical content.  Varadkar's government used taxpayers' money to generate positive stories about its national plan.  His strategic communications units, plural, contacted journalists from the independent group of newspapers to write good news stories about a plan delivered with glorious spin that promised more hospital beds, schools, broadband and better transport connections.  This type of manipulation is part of Varadkar's record.  Just before he became the leader of Fine Gael, Leo Varadkar used his position as minister to launch a publicity campaign against welfare cheats.  He spent \u20ac165,988 of the Irish taxpayer's money and was photographed in the national press holding a placard which stated, Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All.  It was a cynical exercise designed to win over the Fine Gael grassroots for his leadership bid.  Subsequently, it was revealed that there were just 11 cases of identity fraud in Ireland in 2017.  And the top civil servant in the department, John McKeown, admitted that that the advertising campaign was a mistake.  By the time the admission was made, Varadkar had won the leadership of Fine Gael, 50 to 57 votes.  47 TDs never turned up to vote on the day.","channel.id":"clxmi0oem02c5cdvifvlaufkb","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxgY69mo_nUGuCDo1yPygng","channel.name":"The National Party \u2014 An P\u00e1irt\u00ed N\u00e1isi\u00fanta","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"IE","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU7ivwQD99tz4V9BIwbUF8E9SWhYm3UPSK5N4O2EA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker emphasizes the importance of truth, freedom, and democracy in the Western world.

Calabria was a dramatic upset.  The center-right coalition received 55.3% of the vote.  The center-left coalition received 30.1%.  It was a complete blowout.  In 2014, the center-left coalition received 61.4% in this region.  Now, Emilia-Romagna is the most hardcore left-wing stronghold in Italy.  It has been under left-wing rule for 70 years.  It was ruled by the Communist Party for decades.  The center-right coalition won four of this region's provinces, and the center-left won five.  Lega received 32% of the vote, and Fratelli d'Italia, or Brothers of Italy, received another 8.6%.  For Lega and Fratelli to jointly receive over 40% in such a left-wing region is a phenomenal victory.  In these regional elections, each voter can vote for an individual party and an individual presidential candidate.  In Emilia-Romagna, there were 17 parties and 7 presidential candidates.  The individual parties in the center-right coalition received 45.5% of the vote.  This is basically the best performance of the right in the post-World War II history of this region.  In the year 2000, the center-right coalition, which was then called House of Freedom, received 40.6%.  However, about five points of that went to centrist or even mildly center-left parties that allied with the right during that election.  The hardline parties on the right only received 14.7% of the vote in 2000.  The center-right presidential candidate was Lucia Borgonzoni.  She received 43.6%.  Some people voted for a party on the right, but for the left-wing presidential candidate.  The left-wing candidate, Stefano Bonaccini, got 51.4%, even though the parties backing him got 48.2%.  For the party vote, the center-left coalition only beat the center-right coalition by 2.7 points.  In the 2014 election, they beat the center-right coalition by 19.3 points.  The media is, naturally, saying anything they can to spin a right-wing victory into a defeat.  They are running headlines saying, Salvini defeated, Salvini suffers major setback, Salvini fails.  Of course, this is spin and the media provides no real context.  They ignore the fact that Calabria dramatically flipped to the right and They ignore the fact that the performance of Lega and Fratelli in the very heart of the Italian left can only be considered a victory for the right.  If the center-right coalition can win 45% in Emilia-Romagna, they can most definitely win a national election.  This is what the media is deathly afraid of right now.  Five-star movement and the far-left Democratic Party are unraveling.  Italy seems to be slowly inching towards a new early snap election.  Five Star Movement is in a rapid downward spiral, and the leader, Luigi Di Maio, resigned on the eve of this election.  From what I can tell, they never even campaigned in Emilia-Romagna.  Calabria was a major stronghold for Five Star Movement, but they only got 7.3% in Calabria and 4.7% in Emilia-Romagna.  There are four more regions with left-wing governments that have elections in 2020.  Four more regions the left is in danger of losing.  For years, the left completely dominated the governments of the Italian regions.  Only Liguria, Lombardia, and Veneto were under the control of the right.  Then in November 2017, Sicily flipped.  This began a new trend.  In 2018, three more regions flipped.  In 2019, there were five regional elections, resulting in a dramatic five flips.  This included a major upset in the former left-wing stronghold of Umbria.  And so now we have a dramatic upset in Calabria and a phenomenal performance by Lega and Fratelli in the very center of Italian leftism.  The far left still has a stranglehold on the province of Bologna, which is a huge chunk of the population of the region.  I talked about how Lega needed police protection just to campaign in this area.  Yet, even in the most left-wing province of the most left-wing region, Lega and Fratelli still scored a combined 32.6%.  In Ferrara, Lega and Fratelli scored a combined 51.5%.  In Piacenza, they scored a combined 57.7%.  Italy has moved way to the right and continues moving right.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.

You know, we talk about the working class, the middle class, parties of the rich, the workers' parties.  And really a prerequisite for partaking in political discussion in the West is this kind of presupposed notion of the inherent virtue and goodness of the kind of working life that most people partake in.  You know, Max Weber talked about the Protestant work ethic and the spirit of capitalism.  And it's gotten to the point now where in my country, as an example, if someone isn't part of this mass of workers, you're almost considered a non-citizen.  Our prime minister here talks about representing people that get up early in the morning and Every discussion of public expenditure is discussed in terms of taxpayers' money and representing taxpayers.  Parties that supposedly advocate for the working class.  They never advocate for greater leisure or from kind of extricating people from the toil of manual labour.  and I want to emphasise manual labour there because in my opinion the toil of the middle class is far more gruesome and depressing and alienating than the labour of the working class.  But all these political discussions are framed in terms of higher wages, higher standard of living, cheaper consumer goods, cheaper junk for people to consume when they're not working.  But the idea of extricating people from labor has been abandoned.  I've been reading recently, up until the early 1930s, both parties in the United States, Republicans and Democrats, both advocated for shorter working weeks.  That's not only been abandoned now in the US, but it's kind of been abandoned everywhere.  You don't see people advocating for something like cutting the working week down to far lower than it is now.  And I think part of that is globalism, because we've put ourselves in such a situation that if we in the West decide that we're going to.","channel.id":"clxmi0nny01tecdvi8ps3cteu","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCGe8kzr_18FIOzjkmzGzzuA","channel.name":"Keith Woods","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/Jyv3LE8oiaGC6Ao0M-rtBOQG5Pz3HKdg4Tb_YLYyYl9e--8tFqlPMmMCK93HmzAhGHydGPu1=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The concept of work has become the foundation of Western politics and sociology, with the working class and middle class being central to discussions.

Right, but you believe in... Well, there are different ethnic groups in China, sure. What's your name, sir?  Hugh.  Hugh, nice to meet you.  How's it going? Yeah, pretty good.  I think we disagree about the purpose of the state, and specifically over individual and group rights. Oh, right, okay, yeah, go on. You really don't like the idea of any group being privileged. No, I don't, no. What about if that is, I mean, what is the purpose of the state if not to privilege the citizens of that state? Yeah, but the citizens of the state is everyone in the state, is it not? Well, you've got this idea. I'm not in favor of illegal immigrants, obviously. Okay, sure, sure, I understand.  But you also believe in this idea that your service guarantees citizenship. That's right, yeah. So basically, anyone can be a citizen as long as they're benefiting the economy. The whole point of the Service Guaranteed Citizenship is really it speaks to social groups rather than the actual state itself.  Because if you want a social group to exist, then you have to get out and actually contribute to that in some way.  And you doing that is a part of that thing existing.  So you being a part of that actually makes it exist and then creates an obligation on that social group to be supportive of you in some way.  And that's generally how social groups and societies work.  But that's not necessarily how I think the state should work.  The state should be inclusive of all of its citizens. Okay.  And when it comes to somebody wanting to join this country, you would judge them on an individual basis? Yes, I would, yeah. Don't you think this is incredibly impractical?  I mean, it requires a huge bureaucracy to manage that, to vet. We already have it, don't we? We already have it, yeah.  And look what's going on, Carl. The alternative, I think, would be worse.  And the fact that it's not going brilliantly is not necessarily because of the system.  I think it's the people who are making the decisions by which the system then has to operate. Okay, so how would you correct these things?  What would you do to make it better? At the moment, I think it's really just the way we view how things are going.  I assume you're thinking of immigration here. Yeah, because we're talking about group rights, individual rights, so bring that back in.  I would just bar people by group identity.  I'd happily do that. What, from doing what?  Entering the country? Yeah, I would say, I mean, do we need any more sub-Saharan Africans in this country?  I understand that we have... Do we need any more French people? But French people integrate far easier.  No, come on, come on. I don't know, I mean, I'm still sick of them. I think that's a bit of a dodge, because you know the Northwestern Europeans... If you take the average Northwestern European, they have no problem integrating to this country.  And certainly, cross-generationally, if they have children here, their children are basically gonna be English.  So you're saying... Hang on a second, hang on a second.  No, you're about to try and mischaracterize me now.  Because the thing is, I'm happy for these things to be done on an individual basis.  Because frankly, what you're suggesting just seems lazy to me.  I mean, I accept that if we judge these things on an individual basis, we're probably gonna have far less Somalians than there will French people being allowed into the country if we set a certain kind of criteria.  But I don't want to have to keep, say, the Ayaan Hirsi Ali's of the world out of the country from wherever. I knew you were going to bring her up. Why wouldn't I?  She's the perfect example.  But I don't want to necessarily keep her out, even though other people in her country are people I would find distasteful.  But then I don't necessarily want, I don't know, the people who shot up Charlie Hebdo from being let in, even though they're French citizens.  So... Okay, I would say that they got into France based on the same problems that we have with our system.  But I am her see Ali born and raised in France.  I Okay, but Ayaan Hirsi Ali, right?  How many thousands of Somalis do we have to vet to find her the diamond in the rough?  Your average Somali is a Muslim that believes in the supremacy of Sharia law.  They practice things that we, they have cultural traditions that we consider completely barbaric.  Female genital mutilation, forced child marriage.  They think dogs harbor the spirits of devils, which leads to a huge culture of animal cruelty.  It's pretty savage.  So what is the point of going through all these thousands of people and burdening our home office with that?  And then ultimately, if you're going to let Ayaan Hirsi Ali in... They have to check every single person who comes in.  I mean, you have to check their criminal background.  You're acting as if France doesn't have criminals.  You're acting as if they aren't drug dealers or smugglers or murderers. I'm not saying we shouldn't vet people.  I'm saying we could make it far easier for ourselves.  I mean, I'm not really sure... why you're advocating for the vetting of Somalis in the first place.  What's the point?  Just for one Ayaan Hirsi Ali?  I don't know. I mean, I'm not particularly bigoted against Somalis in principle. Okay, so let's take the Sudanese.  then, another example.  Sudanese immigration in Australia.  Maybe you can speak a little more freely on cases happening abroad. No, no, I would probably speak the same because this is what I feel. Okay, so they've got these gangs now in Victoria that are going around attacking people.  I can't remember the statistics off the top of my head, but it's crazy when you compare the percentage of the population to the percentage of crime committed.  Hugely overrepresented or disproportionately represented in crime stats.  You know, they've imported a problem that could just be so easily prevented.  We could stop rape, we could stop theft, we could stop violent crime happening to Australians if they just said, you know what, we... We're not really interested in this standard of individualism because it makes us feel morally good.  We're just interested in what works.  No to Sudanese.  Thank you very much. Why doesn't the same apply to the Poles? To Polish people?  Yeah.  They're not the same, Carl. Are you saying they don't form gangs? Not to the same rate, I don't know. You just haven't looked into it, have you?  There is a huge problem with Polish gangs in Carlisle.  There's a huge problem with it, you just haven't looked into it. I'm not really in favour of Eastern Europeans coming in that much either, to be honest. I agree, I want a Northern Western European ethnostate as well.  Yeah.  Except I want it without the Germans and the French.  So I'm advocating for a British interstate. Yeah.  Okay. I see what you mean.  I know what you mean.  And I'm not saying it's easy.  I mean, personally, I'm very much for low immigration generally.  I actually don't think we need very much immigration at all.  But the problem is the way you frame it is... Honestly, it is kind of racist. It sounds racist. It does, yeah.  And I think that you're never going to get any kind of reduction in immigration when you approach it this way, because all you're going to do is make people think, well, he's taking a very extreme position, and therefore the other extreme position must be the correct one, which is awful.  I think it makes you sound unreasonable, and it makes the people who are also unreasonable on the other side sound reasonable.  So I think the way you frame.  it is terrible, because you literally didn't realize about the Polish gangs, which are a real problem, and Romanian gangs as well. I know about Romanian gangs. Yeah, but there's drug smuggling across borders and all this sort of stuff.  These are real problems, and it's not just a black-white issue, and I mean that literally and metaphorically. Yeah, yeah.  I understand what you mean.  But I think that we would see a dramatic reduction in crime if we did what I'm suggesting.  I don't know how we could pitch it to the public.  I do feel, though, what I'm saying is just logical and correct.  And I don't care if it makes people go... You're not wrong, but the thing is, I think really the way that the state is handling this stuff is the main problem, because the worrying thing is we're really permissive about all this stuff.  We're very afraid of going, oh, well, you know, we don't want to become racist, and therefore.  But we should be a lot more muscular about how we handle immigration into the West.  We should say, well, no, you can't just... Form ethnic enclaves and segregate yourself from the rest of society.  You are going to have to live in this place or that place, and you are going to have to actually integrate and actually become culturally acclimatized.  Otherwise, these people will, as you say, form ethnic gangs and actually start becoming a problem for the people around them. Yes, which is why we shouldn't let them in.  I think it's wishful thinking to think that they will integrate.  The next thing though, I said the state should privilege its citizens.  Almost across the world, every single state, the idea of sovereignty is connected to its ethnic group that it protects.  If you go to Japan, it's full of Japanese people.  The state is there to serve them, to privilege them.  And if you're an immigrant into one of these countries, if you were to emigrate there, you would be a second-class citizen. Well, I don't think we should have second-class citizens.  Hang on, hang on.  And I think your definition of ethnicity isn't actually the definition that everyone else uses.  I think you're talking about race, aren't you? Well, there's an overlap there. No, ethnicity is not necessarily tied to race. I mean, Japanese people are privileged in Japan.  South Koreans move there.  They're not treated the same way.  They're the same race. There are other racial groups in Japan. It's very homogenous.  I mean, it's like, what, it's 95% Japanese, right? There are other racial groups.  In fact, they feel like they're being pushed out, frankly.  But, I mean, you've got someone like China, which, again, is not just one homogenous racial group.  And we can see the... Yeah, exactly.  No, there are different racial groups in China.  And ethnicity is not just your race.  I mean, for example... I understand that.  I mean, I guess if we're going to say white people in Britain, we're still looking at multiple different ethnic groups in Britain, even if they are technically white.  But even then, that's a very pointless thing to say.  I mean, there's Celtic, there's German, whatever.  So it's one of those things where I don't think it's necessarily a productive conversation either.  But I definitely don't think the state should be privileging some groups of citizens against another.  Because ultimately what you're saying there is the social justice warriors did nothing wrong when they told you shut the fuck up for being a white man.  And that's fucking wrong, man. Well, I'm not pro social justice warriors. Yeah, exactly.  That's just an argument.  It's okay when I do it. Horseshoe theory, okay. No, but your argument is it's okay when I do it. Yes, I'm arguing for the status quo of the world here, Carl, pretty much.  The only countries that don't do this are Western European nations and countries we call Western.  Oh, great. So you want us to act like third world countries? Well, I'll give you an example.  I actually am an immigrant.  I live in Vietnam.  I'm here visiting family. And should you be discriminated against? I am.  I'll give you some examples.  Is it a good thing?  I'll give you some examples, and yes, I do.  But I'll give you some examples.  And it's a good thing when they do.  So I have far less economic liberty.  I can't open a business unless I do it with a Vietnamese partner who must own over 50% of the business.  I can't buy any property unless I do it with a Vietnamese. Are you a citizen there?  No. But citizenship is almost impossible.  I don't know anyone who's been able to do this.  The state is there to ensure... I'm specifically speaking to citizenship. The state shouldn't discriminate against citizens. If we could make our standard of citizenship the same as Vietnam or Japan, I think we'd have very few problems. I don't know what Vietnam's standard of citizenship is.  It sounds like it's very high. It is very difficult.  They're very keenly aware... of maintaining dominance within their borders, because they've been invaded by the Chinese, they've been invaded by the Japanese, they've been invaded by the French, and the Americans, I mean, you could say it's an invasion, whatever, they see it that way.  Not quite the same thing.  They've kicked these people out.  So they do not want foreigners coming in, buying property, opening businesses, just willy-nilly, oh, well, you're an individual, we have to treat you like an individual, give you individual rights.  Absolutely not.  And if I were to go into a country and behave like some sort of social justice warrior, I'm so oppressed, I deserve tax money to be expropriated from the Vietnamese to me, you shouldn't say that about white people, blah, blah, blah.  They'd just deport me. Well, yeah, but why did you move there, then, if you're not in favor of immigration? No, I have a good life there.  I don't feel oppressed.  I think it's fair.  It's their country.  I'm a guest.  It's a lovely place to live.  I don't think it's oppression, Carl. I didn't say you thought it was oppression.  I don't think it's oppression either. I think it's moral.  I think it's fine that Vietnamese people remain dominant in Vietnam.  Likewise, I want that for the English in England. I just find it very ironic that you would actually go out of your way to... Do the thing that you're complaining about. Huh? You go out of your way to do the thing that you're complaining about.  That's very amusing to me. Well, no, because I'm saying I'm a guest there. It's okay when you do it. Yeah, but they are, you know, it's like a 99% homogenous country.  Maybe less than 1% are immigrants.  They're in total control of their country.  The reason why people are against immigration is because it takes away, it chips away at the cultural fabric of the country. Oh, I agree, I agree. It causes social divides.  It causes schisms.  There's ethnic conflict between groups.  This is why people don't like it.  In Vietnam, they have a very firm grip on it, and it's not a problem.  But if I were to step out of line there, as I said, if I didn't respect my status as a guest, they'd just boot me out.  I want a government to do that. I genuinely wish our government would be more restrictive with who they gave citizenship.  But that would mean not letting people who weren't citizens come here.  I don't want mass immigration, and I don't want our government to just give away our citizenship willy-nilly.  But by the same token, I don't want the government choosing to create two-tier classes of citizenship and then discriminating one against the other.  Because, my God, have you seen the people in charge of our government? They're pretty awful. Yeah, exactly.  If we say, okay, you know what, you can privilege one group over another, even though they're both citizens, you know exactly what's going to happen in this country.  We can't allow that. I think when you put it this way, they're both citizens. You're not a citizen, that's the thing. I would change this rule about how to get citizenship in this country.  I'd make it far, far harder. I'm down.  I don't want so many people to be British citizens.  I want to make it more difficult to be a British citizen.  It used to be something you had to earn.  And so I would be more than happy if it was a much higher bar.  We don't just give it away.  I used to live above an Indian restaurant.  And the chap who ran it was an Indian man who came here in the 60s.  And he was the most vociferous anti-immigration advocate that I've ever heard.  Because, I mean, it was literally his argument that, look, you know, you're just giving it away.  I had to do something.  I had to, you know, learn the language.  I had to have some sort of citizenship test or whatever it was.  You know, he was very concerned that we would just make it so easy for anyone to come in.  And I think he makes really good points on that, you know.  But, again, like I said, I don't think the government should be able to then start discriminating against citizens.  So... Yeah.  I think where we disagree is that I just want the government to basically promote the rights of the indigenous Brits.  And I'm not really interested in promoting the rights of any other individual. Well, I just think the government should see people as citizens and then just obviously be cagey about who becomes a citizen.  I think that's a more sensible way of doing it.  All right. It was very fun to talk to you.  Thank you very much.  Thanks very much.","channel.id":"clxmi0l2d004ecdvicqihfv4o","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCHC60upCUfq7EAfw6oDQRDA","channel.name":"AustralianRealist","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AU","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXGtj3mCQ77TqT5-IhdDe-HuDoxbUTsKWP74KUF=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2012-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The conversation revolves around the topic of immigration and citizenship.

Zero. And you're proud of that? We don't want any illegal migration in Poland.  This is what we promised.  This is why our government was elected.  And not even one Muslim illegal migrant will come to Poland, ever.  Let's talk about the facts, not about your or mine imagination. Do you understand why the EU is concerned? Well, basically because they cannot kiss us in our forehead like Mr.  Juncker used to kiss Donald Tusk.  They cannot clap us on the shoulder and say, you're good.  Another year, another proposal, another discussion.  It has nothing to do with the logic.  First of all, it's not us who started this madness.  It's Germany who started it. we can manage she said welcoming nearly a million migrants to germany.  three years later angst brought the german chancellor's coalition government to the brink. in germany over 200 000 of so-called refugees just vanished disappeared.  Nobody knows who are they, where are they, and what are they going to do.  Angela Merkel was looking for cheap labor, so she find out that they don't want to work, they don't want to contribute to this society by their taxes, they don't want to learn language, and then she decided, okay, so let's spread them around.  No, no, no, we're not going to take any of those.  Our government was very straight.  We have to solve the problem where it appears in Syria, in Iraq, in other countries.  But then we started to receiving Africans who are coming here telling us that they are from Syria. Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, says that you're racist. We took over 2 million Ukrainians who are working, who are peaceful in Poland.  We will not receive even one Muslim. Dominic, historically Poland has had far more problems with Christians than they have had with Muslims, haven't they? No.  This war of civilization, as I call it, is just a fact.  Our identity is not diversity.  Our identity is Christianity.  And we have to fight for it.  As you know, our King Sobieski stopped Muslims in Vienna.  So that's the very huge achievement in the history of Polish history. If not King Sobieski, Muslims would take over Europe. Now we have Hydra.  As you know, you know what Hydra means.  This is why Poland is so sane.  Not even one terrorist attack, not even one illegal will come to Poland ever. Don't the politicians of Europe have a moral, humanitarian duty to step in? No.  We can be called populists, nationalists, racists.  I don't care.  I care about my family and about my country. Do you have any sympathy for the people in this crisis today? I'll answer your question, but before I'll answer your question about my love to the people, I'd like to ask you how many Poles blow themselves up in America or any other place in the world?  How many?  Zero.  I love my zero.  How many terror attacks have happened in Poland?  Zero.  None.  And I love the zero.  I'm trying to repeat it every single time.  Zero.  Zero.  None.  Not even one Polish blowed himself up because of his religion, because of his fantasy, because of his hatred.  So that is the difference between Europeans, between Polish... Listen to the Polish people.  Listen to the Polish government.  We've been saying since this problem started, since Germany started this madness. Most of the people who come to Germany, they come from war areas.  It's Syria, it's Iraq, it's Afghanistan, it's Yemen, it is Eritrea.  And for those, we have the European responsibility, our governments, and we as citizens to protect them and to help them to make Europe accessible. Two million Ukrainians are okay, but not one Muslim, because that's just how you guys feel about it. Good evening, Imran.  Thank you for having me.  I will never, ever let any Islamist... to kill my son or grandson.  I will never ever let any second or third generation of Islamists kill my son or daughter.  I will never let any Islamist rape my daughter.  But this is what is happening now in Germany.  This is what is happening in France.  This is what is happening in every leftist state in Sweden, in Germany, in France, in many other countries.  It has nothing to do with Islamophobia. The European Union said, okay, guys, we're all in the same club together.  It looked as if everybody had agreed to go out to dinner and split the bill.  At the end, Poland said, oh no, I'm not paying because I took my other friend out for lunch earlier and I paid.  So I don't want to be a part of this burden.  Why do you guys stay a part of this club if you so fundamentally disagree with the Germans and the others on absolutely everything? Because Germany and Russians, they want to drink Dom Perignon and they want us to drink water.  That is the difference.  So if they want us to have a lunch together and split the bill, they have to eat the same thing and drink the same thing.  And we've been under the Soviet occupation for 70 years.  That is why for Poland, it is so important to be independent.  We know how it is not to be independent.  We know how it is, what it means sovereignty.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker from Poland defends the country's decision not to accept any refugees, particularly Muslims.

And that the purpose of this music was to eventually push me as far away from God as possible.  And I didn't spend too much time going into detail about the music itself because I assumed what I was saying was self-evident.  And I was genuinely surprised by how many messages I got from people saying stuff like, well, Nine Inch Nails, it's good.  There's a dark beauty to it.  I think you're wrong.  I like listening to it.  And it really illustrated to me that the hold that this kind of music has on people, people that like my content and can see the degeneracy in films and other media, At the same time, they'll make excuses for music because they like it.  Because they want to listen to it.  As if the films I dissect aren't loved by audiences everywhere.  By millions of people.  And it's funny because it's almost as if they don't understand that liking it is part of the problem.  If the music was terrible and nobody wanted to listen to it, it would be a non-issue.  I mean, understand that you really don't sound much different than a heroin addict that when told to quit says, but I like it.  I like the way it makes me feel.  And you gotta understand, I like it too.  I bought several Nine Inch Nails albums over the years, and even now, when I hear a song, it elicits a kind of forced nostalgia, but... It's taken me time and reflection to understand that this nostalgia is pathetic.  Years ago, I worked as a technical director for a morning news show, and during the broadcast, we had to wear headsets.  So I could tell people when to roll different tapes or to turn microphones on and off or adjust cameras and what have you.  When things were slow, we would chat on the headsets, and in a lot of ways, it was kind of like being stuck on an elevator talking to people that you wouldn't talk to otherwise.  One of those people was the sound engineer.  He was this self-proclaimed born-again Christian, a born-again Christian that I witnessed doing what many Christians do, and that was inadvertently recruiting for the other side by setting a bad example.  I say this because of the way that he acted.  It was very obnoxious how pious he was, and it was very off-putting.  But the one thing that really stuck out, and I've seen this millions of times in people just like him, he couldn't stop talking about how bad he used to be.  He did this weird kind of bragging where he would tell us how good he was now, but at the same time still brag about how bad he used to be.  For instance, if the crew started talking about how we were going to go get drinks after the show, he would inject himself into the conversation, even though there's no way he was going to be invited anyway.  He would need to tell us.  that he couldn't come and then talk about how, you know, even though he doesn't drink now, oh boy, he used to drink.  He used to drink so much.  Wow, it was a miracle.  he didn't die.  Man, if you could have seen him back then, you wouldn't believe how much he used to drink, but not anymore.  No, no, he learned his lesson.  Now he was a good Christian and we were all sinners.  And I couldn't help but get the sense that he was still stuck thinking that being a party animal was cool.  And he had to flex and tell everyone how much of a party animal he used to be.  And he could be now if he wanted to.  To try to establish some position in the social hierarchy or something.  It bothered me because it seemed as though if he was really... a born again Christian, that these stories wouldn't be something that he would be proud of.  There were stories he'd be ashamed of.  He wouldn't be so braggadocious and talking about these tales of the glory days.  And what made it worse was I highly suspected he was exaggerating most of the stories.  Now, as a side note, I just want to let some people out there that might not know this.  It's Christians like this that really push people away from God.  These people don't just look ridiculous, like hypocrites.  The sin of pride painted all over their face so everyone can see it but them because they avoid looking into mirrors like vampires.  But they make Christianity look like some kind of disingenuous, pompous form of virtue signaling.  And nothing more.  Because I think for him, that's probably what it was.  And it's his face that I think of when I catch myself being nostalgic about these times.  When I hear this music and I start thinking about how cool.  I thought I was drinking myself half to death and doing other things that would have ruined or even ended my life.  And that did set my life back significantly.  But that's the power and the magic of music.  It does cause these forced feelings of nostalgia.  It's against your will almost.  But that's not all it's doing.  It's activating parts of the brain that were developing the first time you heard it.  And it can put you in that same mindset.  That's the power of that.  this music wouldn't have if you didn't like it.  So saying that you like it or even that you like the way it makes you feel is literally the same as a heroin addict using that same reasoning and even wording as an excuse to not quit.  It's nonsense.  I liked the music too.  I still, on a level, like it.  I like the way it sounds.  I would probably also like heroin.  If all I did was act on the animal part of my brain based on what I liked, I would probably just shoot heroin all day while eating cheesecake, listening to Nine Inch Nails as I played video games and got blowjobs from hookers.  Liking things is an absurd standard to base your behavior on.  So let's take a closer look at what some of these people like so much.  You know, scientists can examine the chemicals inside heroin and observe the damage that it does to your brain and your body.  Let's take a look at the contents of nine inch nails.  So here's some of the lyrics from the first album, Pretty Hate Machine.  Hey God, why are you doing this to me?  Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?  Why am I seething with animosity?  Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology.  Terrible lie.  Obviously the implication that God has lied to him.  The next verse.  Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.  I lost my ignorance, security, and pride.  I'm all alone in a world you must despise.  Hey God, I believed your promises.  Your promises were lies.  It's not even symbolism.  He's spelling it out.  We'll go through more albums and lyrics, but right there, right off the bat, we see that this theme... is what is repeated over and over and over in Trent Reznor's music.  Over and over and over into the minds of people, mostly in Generation X. Choreographed to catchy sounds that are anything but uplifting.  God is a lie.  God is a lie.  That's the message from Trent Reznor.  The world is shit.  God is a lie.  Do whatever feels good.  Do whatever you like.  Here's another song.  Heaven's just a rumor she dispels as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.  I still dream of lips I never should have kissed.  Well, she knows exactly what I can't resist.  Once again, God is a lie.  The world is shit.  So let's just fuck like animals and enjoy animal pleasures because everything else is meaningless.  This is literally satanic.  You understand that, right?  It's not tangentially satanic.  This is what is taught at the satanic church.  Here's another song.  I can't shake this feeling from my head.  There's a devil sleeping in my bed.  He's watching you from across the way.  I cannot make this feeling go away.  And then the chorus.  I know it's not the right thing.  I know it's not the good thing.  Kinda I want to.  The message is clear.  The devil is telling him to just do what feels good.  And even though he knows it's wrong, he's going to do it anyway because it's what he wants to do.  It's what he likes.  Do what thou wilt.  The more we look at these lyrics, the more it becomes obvious why the real diehard fans of this music might not want to give it up.  They know it's wrong, but they want to.  And Trent Reznor has been telling them over and over and over and over again in their head.  That's all the justification you need.  So now let's take a look at the second album, Broken.  That's the one I was talking specifically about in the video that seemed to bother so many Nine Inch Nails fans.  This is the first day of my last days.  I built it up, now I take it apart, climbed up real high, now fall down real far.  No need for me to stay.  The last thing left, I just threw it away.  I put my faith in God and my trust in you.  Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do.  Once again, this isn't hidden symbolism.  This isn't hard to decipher.  The people listening are just so desensitized by the repeated degeneracy.  That they just make excuses for these lyrics because they like the music.  They like the way it makes them feel.  The same way a heroin addict makes excuses for why their life is a mess and justifies it all because they like the way it makes them feel.  Here's another one.  There is no God up in the sky tonight.  No sign of heaven anywhere in sight.  All that was true is left behind.  Once I could see, now I am blind.  Don't want your dreams you try to sell.  This disease I give to myself.  Once again, he's telling you everything.  In this song, he's even telling you That you're the one doing it to yourself.  It's amazing to me that I even have to explain a message this explicit.  But at the same time, I understand.  I understand because I like the way this music sounds.  I do.  But that's not a good enough reason to put poison into my brain.  Because just like a drug, it might make me feel good in the moment.  But what kind of damage are these messages doing to you in the long term?  Even if you're an atheist, these are not uplifting songs.  They're specifically designed to promote nihilism and despair.  This isn't rocket scientist.  This isn't symbolism.  This is literal.  If you listen to a tape on repeat that just told you over and over again, you're shit, you're shit, the world is shit.  There's no God.  We're all just monkeys.  And you listen to that tape on repeat, or I'm sorry, MP3 on repeat.  How is that going to affect the way you view the world?  How is that going to affect your actions?  In the downward spiral, the album opens up with Trent Reznor literally agreeing with everything I just said.  Okay, here it goes.  I am the voice inside your head and I control you.  I am the lover in your bed and I control you.  I am the sex that you provide and I control you.  I am the hate you try to hide and I control you.  I take you where you want to go.  I give you all you need to know.  I drag you down.  I use you up.  Mr.  Self-destruct.  The next verse, I speak religion's message clear and I control you.  I am denial, guilt and fear and I control you.  I am the prayers of the naive and I control you.  I am the lie that you believe and I control you.  Again, explicitly telling you that God is a lie, God is a lie.  I'm bringing you down and I'm controlling you.  It's song after song of Trent Reznor spelling out exactly what he's doing.  The next song on the album is literally called Heresy.  He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see.  He tries to tell me what I put inside of me.  He's got the answers to ease my curiosity.  He dreamed a God up and called it Christianity.  Followed by the chorus, God is dead and no one cares.  If there is a hell, I'll see you there.  Can you get any more explicit than that?  If you want to know how we got to this place in our history, And in our culture, it's because people, myself included, by the way, accepted this as part of the culture.  As a norm.  Because we liked it.  And as I said before, liking something is a terrible standard for determining what your behavior should be.  If liking something is the standard that you're using to determine what's acceptable... Then how are you going to explain to someone who likes trans kids, as an example, that it's wrong?  They like it.  It makes them feel good.  They're being consistent with your standards.  It makes them feel good.  Life is shit.  There is no God.  Just do whatever feels good.  Or to quote Nine Inch Nails, Kinda.  I want to.  Maybe just for tonight.  We can pretend it's alright.  What's the price I pay?  I don't care what they say.  I want to.

And first, before you give, please give us, you know, 30-second sound bite of how you would want someone to describe you.  And then please take 15 minutes. Okay, thank you very much.  I didn't realize I was to give a 15-minute talk here, but... Well, no, no, it could be less, but... I'll do my best to make my time useful.  My name is Jared Taylor, and I'm the founder of American Renaissance, which is primarily a website, but it's also a YouTube channel, and we do podcasts.  We used to put out a monthly publication, started that in 1990, so I've been doing this for 28 years.  In 2010, we went all to the web, and that way we can reach far more people.  And as I described myself in the movie here, I am a race realist and a white advocate.  Now, what do those two words mean?  A race realist is someone that recognizes that race is a biological phenomenon.  I don't think it's some sort of sociological optical illusion.  People of different races have evolved in different environments and that has produced the different physical differences that are very clearly visible.  And the idea that somehow when you see a black person or an Eskimo or an Asian person and you are seeing some kind of social construct rather than biology, I think that idea is just so obviously wrong and stupid that only very smart people could persuade themselves that it's true.  It's just a goofy idea.  Race is a biological phenomenon.  And I think that race is an important part of individual and group identity.  It's not some sort of little airy-fairy thing that we can overcome if we just set our minds to it.  Race, I think, is too deeply imprinted in us for us to say we're going to live in a post-racial society.  I think that may never come.  Race is too important for that.  Now, what is white advocacy?  White advocacy is a recognition that whites, just like every other racial group, have legitimate group interests.  Black people have organizations that push their interests.  So do Asians.  So do Hispanics.  But if a white person says, look, we have an interest in doing X, Y, or Z, that is considered white supremacy.  That's neo-Nazism.  So that you can have a black professional association of psychologists, of police officers, of firefighters.  If whites did that, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't you dare do that.  Now, in the movie, I was also quoted as saying that I think the word white supremacy, that should be retired.  Because what is a white supremacist?  I believe that word applies only to white people who wish to rule over and dominate people of other races.  Certainly, historically, that has been a phenomenon, the idea of taking a certain race of people and making only them slaves.  That's certainly white supremacy.  Whites going to Africa and saying, we are going to run this place, or going to India and saying, we are going to run this place.  That's white supremacy.  That is domination of people of other races by whites.  The idea that I have is that I believe the primary legitimate interest of whites is to survive as a distinct people with a distinct culture.  Now there was quite a round of applause in this room among you people when I predicted that if in 200 years... Let me give you some advice.  Don't say you people.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying. Eric Holder can say you people or my people.  There was quite a round of.","channel.id":"clxmi0l2d004ecdvicqihfv4o","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCHC60upCUfq7EAfw6oDQRDA","channel.name":"AustralianRealist","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AU","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXGtj3mCQ77TqT5-IhdDe-HuDoxbUTsKWP74KUF=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2012-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Jared Taylor, founder of American Renaissance, introduced himself as a 28-year veteran of the movement, advocating for white interests and racial realism.

He also clarified that white advocacy is about recognizing legitimate group interests for whites, similar to those of other racial groups, without seeking to dominate or rule over others. Taylor suggested that the term \"white supremacy\" should be retired, as it implies a desire to dominate other races, and instead, the primary interest of whites should be to survive as a distinct people with a distinct culture.","responses":"[1] Politics: Mentions Jared Taylor and his advocacy for white interests, indicating a connection to politics and racial issues.\n[1] Identity: Mentions that race is an essential part of individual and group identity.\n[1] Racism: Mentions racial realism and the concept of white supremacy, indicating a connection to racism and racial issues.\n[1] Culture: Mentions a distinct culture associated with the white group.\n[1] History: Implied by the context of racial realism and the concept of a post-racial society.\n[1] Misconceptions: Implied by the context of racial realism and the concept of a post-racial society.\n[1] Religion: Implied by the context of racial realism and the concept of a post-racial society.\n[1] Creation: Implied by the context of racial realism and the concept of a post-racial society."}

I'm often asked, do you feel like you've ever been discriminated against because you're a woman?  And if I'm evaluating my life honestly, I have to say no.  In fact, I believe that I've been given countless opportunities that I did not earn, second chances that I didn't deserve, many of which I ungratefully squandered, all because I'm a woman.  Truthfully, it's been a lifetime of me being told that I'm awesome, for relatively mediocre achievements.  Kind of a tough pill to swallow, but it is the truth.  So I would imagine that many other slightly above average American women have had a similar experience whereby they coast on their moderate intellect and minor achievements, which are then leveraged to attain various undeserved positions and accolades.  Millennials grew up in a participation trophy era in which all students were praised merely for showing up.  Additionally, millennial women had this secondary positive reinforcement strategy laid on us.  We were taught by parents, teachers, counselors, and society that girls can do anything that men can do, that our potential is boundless, that we're amazing just the way we are.  That merely by virtue of being female, we bring goodness to the world.  Because we were born with this value, we cannot fail.  And if we do, it must be someone else's fault.  That's what I want to talk about today, the larger consequences of giving preferential treatment to girls and what happens when they grow up and attain power, corporate or governmental.  There are countless examples of this, but the two that are the clearest embodiment of this kind of female millennial entitlement fully realized have got to be that of Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos and that of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  This initially was intended to be a single video, but seeing the explosive phenomenon of AOC continue to materialize, and keeping in mind that Holmes perpetrated a billion-dollar fraud built solely on the power of her golden vagina, I think this is going to have to be a two-parter.  Today, Elizabeth Holmes.  The story of Theranos has exploded in the mainstream media, so I don't want to delve too much into the actual fraud, but I'll give you the gist.  If you're interested, please read Bad Blood, which is excellent and details the entire saga.  The Amazon link is below.  Elizabeth Holmes, who's now about 35, comes from an esteemed, wealthy Washington, D.C.  family.  Her mother was a congressional staffer.  Her father was high ranking at Enron.  He had some other high ranking positions as well.  Holmes has tons of family money from a business inherited by her Danish grandparents.  She was always bright, attractive, curious, and it is said that she is quite charming, although I find that hard to believe.  Nonetheless, it is said.  She attended elite schools where she took an interest in computer programming and applied to Stanford to study chemical engineering.  Of course, she was accepted.  She dropped out when she was 19 and used her remaining tuition money to launch a consumer healthcare technology company called Theranos.  Holmes supposedly had a fear of needles.  So the idea behind Theranos was that full panel blood tests would be administered with just the prick of a finger rather than a full blood draw.  She claimed that her testing device, named Edison, would save patients and companies millions of dollars and that if blood testing became cheaper and easier, it would be done more often, which would save countless lives.  Sounds like a good idea, but from the start, her peers and the Stanford professors with whom she shared her vision were pretty vocal about how incredibly unrealistic this sounds.  Nonetheless, she was able to get many of her skeptics on board.  And that really is the heart of the fraud.  Elizabeth Holmes was a master of networking.  before she had even developed a functional prototype, which, by the way, never came to be.  She had bamboozled investors out of around $900 million.  Although she claimed to have developed this technology, the truth was that she had created a company so litigious, so veiled in secrecy, that she was able to hide not only from healthcare companies and her investors, but from many of her own employees.  The extent of Edison's defects, it was virtually inoperable.  We've seen plenty of frauds exposed in the last few decades, but what was different about this was that she truly believed that the technology would follow because she could do anything that she put her mind to.  She had a motivational quote that was positioned prominently on her desk at Theranos.  It read, \"...what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not  fail?\".  That's a peculiar thought, the inability to fail.  It wasn't that she was too idealistic.  She's actually ruthless and pragmatic to a fault.  Her real failing was believing, because of her charisma and sexual power, wealth, esteem, that no matter what she did, she would not fail.  And that arrogance, that conceit, falseness, flourished, all the while she played off these massive character defects as products of youthful idealism.  Instead of improving workplace morale, investing in her company's capabilities, or simply readjusting expectations about her product, She doubled down.  Her belief that she couldn't fail was largely rooted in appearances.  She was pedigreed, educated, cunning, and she knew that with these qualities alone, she could build a massive, well-known company.  And once the funding came in, she could invest in the technology.  And because she could not fail... She would somehow develop it in time before she was found out.  She used her female charm and sexual power to manipulate investors, many of whom were family friends, into giving her hundreds of millions of dollars.  She also started banging this gross old Pakistani dude, Sunny Balwani, who invested $20 million in Theranos and became its president and COO.  Additionally, she courted very wealthy political families and new tech money alike, but wisely stayed outside of the realm of healthcare.  Most of Theranos investors were not well-versed in this type of technology, which never really existed anyway.  She built the fraud like a house, brick by brick, each brick sitting upon the previous.  Her initial investors were well-known and respected, and when word got out about their investment, she leveraged their credibility to take on new, even wealthier investors and companies.  Walgreens cut her a $140 million deal despite the absence of a functional prototype, although she was using a rigged Edison device during many of the prototype demonstrations.  But because Walgreens is such a well-known and stable company, she was then able to leverage their clout and become this media darling.  In a glowing, bootlicking piece by The New Yorker, complete with your standard self-involved black and white portraits, Holmes, who is clueless, clearly a stone-cold bitch, is characterized by her endless kindness.  Board members are clearly charmed by Holmes.  She is a careful listener, and she is unnervingly serene.  Employees say that they can't remember an instance when she raised her voice.  She has sometimes been called another Steve Jobs, but I think that's an inadequate comparison.  Perry, who knew Jobs, said, She has a social consciousness that Steve never had.  He was a genius.  She's one with a big heart.  Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes developed a cult-like following where few questions about logistics were raised and where, once again, a woman was praised for accomplishing virtually nothing.  Now, why is it that she had this reception? You saw her almost once a week, either gracing a magazine cover or attending a tech conference or healthcare conference or going on TV. Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos.  Elizabeth Holmes.  Elizabeth Holmes. Thank you for having me.  I am so incredibly humbled. We did this.  You founded this company 12 years ago, right?  Tell them how old you were. I was 19. I believe that this obsequious reaction is a result of our society desperately searching for evidence that women, especially young women, are equal in scientific aptitude to men.  People saw a weird, kind of autistic, sort of hot young woman and they were like, this chick, she's our Steve Jobs.  See, men and women are equal.  So they kissed her ass and the media inflated her abilities and perhaps worst of all, didn't ask any probing questions.  I'm not letting the public, the investors, or the media off the hook here.  That being said, she is highly manipulative and seems to be something of a psychopath.  We've already discussed her inflated ego, but what about her presentation?  This video of her using her real voice, which is linked with all my sources in the description, pretty well sums it up. This is what happens when you work to change things.  And first they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world.  And I have to say, I personally was shocked to see that the journal would publish something like this. No, it hasn't.  Well, if I use traditional words to describe what we're doing, it's hard because people then associate it with conventional processes. She developed this affectation solely to be more influential, to appear more serious, perhaps more commanding.  She also adopted Steve Jobs' dress style to create this impression to her Silicon Valley peers that she was following in his footsteps, that she was the next big thing.  Paired with her networking ability, she was very successful in creating this persona of success without any of the actual merit.  Her merit was also a guy, so she had to develop real powers of persuasion in order to gain the amount of influence necessary to get that staggering amount of funding.  So how does this end?  Her company is defunct, her net worth is zero, and she's looking at 20 years.  Has that humbled her?  Has she realized the error of her ways?  Is she falling at the feet of the public or her investors and begging for forgiveness?  The desire to protect one's ego, especially a fragile female ego, is just too strong.  During her 2017 deposition in front of 12 SEC attorneys, Holmes answered, I don't know, over 600 times.  And these were questions about a company that she created.  And get this, word on the street is that she's talking up her next company.  So many people are talking about Theranos right now.  And I haven't seen a single person correctly identify the real reason that this happened.  And that is that we're seeing a flood of entitled women raised to believe that they can do anything and are responsible for none of their failures, intercorporate America and the government.  I was probably definitely not normal, Holmes said.  I was reading Moby Dick from start to finish when I was about nine.  I read a ton of books.  I still have a notebook with a complete design for a time machine that I designed when I must have been like seven.  The wonderful thing about the way I was raised is that no one ever told me that I couldn't do those things.  The truth is that competition, hardship, failure, and ultimately acceptance of one's limitations create strong characters.  If we keep telling girls that they can do anything, that they're just as strong and capable as any man, we're doing them a disservice.  Not to mention ourselves, since we're polluting our own marketplaces with substandard labor, products, and services that social pressures are demanding we adopt, irrespective of their quality.  Just think about the wealth that that $900 million of defrauded money could have generated if placed in the right hands.  We need to teach children, especially little girls, about their own limitations.  To teach your child that they can do anything is an absurd lie that will inevitably come crashing down on them.  And most importantly, women like Holmes with spectacular claims need to be met with a healthy amount of skepticism.  They need to be challenged, their credentials vetted, and their products and services be subjected to the same competitive pressures as that of men.  On that note, I will be back soon to talk about the AOC phenomenon, which, surprise surprise, is much of the same.  Thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0r5m049zcdviphi5ilqs","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCpbyOgUSjTSPpvVUAT2OyHw","channel.name":"Blonde in the Belly of the Beast","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUBXvnTXDeyFu929ZWEC4UNFhe28v1mbn8JFRumcQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses how women, particularly millennials, have been given preferential treatment and opportunities due to their gender. This has led to a culture of entitlement, where women like Elizabeth Holmes and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been praised for mediocre achievements and have leveraged this to attain power and accolades.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, is a prime example of this phenomenon. She was given $900 million in funding despite having no functional prototype for her blood-testing device. Holmes was able to manipulate investors and employees with her charm, charisma, and perceived intelligence. She created a cult-like following and was praised for her supposed innovation and leadership.\n\nThe speaker argues that Holmes' success was not due to her actual abilities, but rather her ability to create a persona of success and her networking skills. Holmes' affectation and adoption of Steve Jobs' dress style were attempts to appear more influential and serious.\n\nThe speaker believes that the reason Holmes was able to get away with her fraud was because of the societal desire to see women succeed and the media's willingness to inflate her abilities. The speaker also suggests that Holmes is a psychopath who is highly manipulative and has a fragile ego.\n\nThe speaker concludes that the real reason for the Theranos scandal is not just Holmes' individual actions, but rather a broader cultural issue of entitled women being raised to believe they can do anything and are responsible for none of their failures. The speaker argues that this is a disservice to women and society as a whole, as it leads to substandard labor, products, and services.","responses":"[1] Culture: Mentions the societal context and the impact of societal expectations on individuals.\n[1] Media: Mentions the role of media in shaping public perception and influencing societal attitudes.\n[1] Leadership: Mentions the characteristics and behaviors associated with effective leadership, and the ways in which these are perceived and valued in society.\n[1] Psychology: Mentions the psychological traits and behaviors associated with individuals like Elizabeth Holmes, and the ways in which these are perceived and valued in society.\n[1] Ethics: Mentions the moral implications of the Theranos scandal and the broader cultural issue of entitled women being raised to believe they can do anything and are responsible for none of their failures.\n[1] Business: Mentions the business practices and strategies employed by individuals like Elizabeth Holmes, and the ways in which these are perceived and valued in society.\n[1] Identity: Mentions the ways in which individuals like Elizabeth Holmes create and present themselves to the world, and the impact of this on societal expectations and individual behavior.\n[1] Power Dynamics: Mentions the ways in which power is exercised and maintained in society, and the impact of this on individual behavior and societal expectations.\n[1] Social Issues: Mentions the broader cultural issue of entitled women being raised to believe they can do anything and are responsible for none of their failures, and the impact of this on societal expectations and individual behavior."}

The idea that everything depends firstly on the existence of the Irish nation and that all economic, cultural and social considerations should be subordinate.  In other words, before we consider the welfare of the Irish people, there must be the Irish people.  The Irish people are the nation.  When we speak of nations, we refer to the broadly homogenous people who share a history, heritage and systems of meaning.  united by the bonds of kinship, culture and the claim to a spiritual homeland.  A people capable of seeing themselves as a people, conscious in other words of their own national existence and willing to defend it.  We believe that a society must be capable of organising for its own defence, wellbeing and survival and that this requires a high level of natural solidarity.  The strongest forms of solidarity are those of kith and kin.  As such, the National Party recognises the basis of Irish society as the family, the parish and the nation.  Without these bonds, there is no starting point, either for a cultural or economic revival.  Institutions or bodies attempting to undermine that solidarity or make that solidarity impossible must be called out for what they are.  Those who seek to dissolve the bonds of an Irish nationality must not be permitted to hide behind words like diversity, inclusion or international rights.  Neither must they be allowed to drape themselves in republicanism, nationalism or even Christianity.  These are no Irish patriots or Irish statesmen.  Those who cheer the loudest for a post-Irish Ireland must be exposed for the knaves and deceivers they are.  By putting people in contact with their past, nationalism seeks to instill a sense of collective trial and orient a people meaningfully towards the future.  The identification with past and future generations invests a society with a basic communitarian ethos.  A people who see themselves as a whole are more likely to sacrifice for that whole, and for the greater good of a given society.  They are less likely to sacrifice themselves for a society in which they have become mere tourists.  Ireland is a mother country.  It is the wellspring of a people and a culture.  All nationality draws water from the past, and all nationalists stand sentinel against the destruction of that holy well.  The only guarantee to nationhood is the jurisdiction and claim over a national territory by a nationality of people.  The burden of each generation is to secure and to renew that claim by homage, by sacrifice and by struggle.  The territory is not simply a landmass or geographical location, not merely 26 counties or 32 counties.  not merely the islands and territorial waters.  It is the physical and spiritual existence of the Irish people themselves.  It is also the Irish language and cultural inheritance.  Physically, spiritually, morally, culturally, linguistically, it is the ground upon which we stand.  The goal must be to occupy as much of that ground as possible.

And hindsight being 2020, as they say, it's often easy to see these messages for what they are and expose them to people today.  And while we're still going to do a little bit of that for this film, I'd like to take a look at a movie that was culturally important to baby boomers and see how it might be perceived, not by audiences in 1969 when the film was released, but by an audience today.  An audience that's aware of the context of the film and the target audience.  A film that seemed to speak to the generation that presided over the decline and the crumbling empire that we live in today.  And what does that film tell audiences that are growing up in the aftermath and trying to wrestle control from this generation that produced and identified so deeply with this movie?  The film that I'm talking about is Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda's Easy Rider.  I watched Easy Rider for the first time 50 years after it was released.  After reading an interview with Peter Fonda, who was taking a look back at the film that he claimed represented the new Hollywood, the Hollywood of the baby boomers.  that it was this film and films like it that signaled the death of the stuffy studio Hollywood and ushered in, in my opinion, the flood of degeneracy.  Free from the shackles of the Hays Code, and objective morality, for that matter.  Easy Rider was nominated for two Oscars, a Golden Globe, and was a winner at the Cannes Film Festival.  It was also one of the first films to ditch the traditional soundtrack format that films have been using since the invention of film, and to use contemporary baby boomer rock and roll with songs from bands like Steppenwolf, The Birds, and Jimi Hendrix.  In fact, as someone watching this film... in 2019, it really did feel like I was watching this endless boomer music video.  And at times, I really think that was a big part of the draw for this film that was released before MTV or music videos were even a thing.  Easy Rider starts out with two bikers, played by Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, buying cocaine from Mexicans.  Now, This certainly wasn't the film's intention, but as an American watching this in 2019, with a full understanding of exactly who has failed to maintain a border between Mexico and my country, and has been listening to baby boomers drone on about how Mexicans are coming illegally, it's no problem at all because they're doing the jobs that Americans won't do.  I have a different view than the original audience in 1969.  I view this scene with what I would have to describe as disdain.  Disdain that's only going to grow as this movie continues.  To me, this scene is just one of countless, unintended, though they might be, metaphors.  The young boomers caring more about their personal gain, looking to make a quick buck by any means necessary.  In the film, they're buying cocaine from Mexicans to poison the sons and daughters of the founding fathers.  to make a buck, just like older boomers would destroy communities with illegal immigrants so they could make a buck at the expense of Americans.  And in the film, the way they make a buck is by selling out to Jewish record executive Phil Spector.  Yes, that Phil Spector.  The same Phil Spector who murdered a blonde European model in his home, and then disguised himself as a woman and managed to evade conviction for years.  I wonder what kind of unintended metaphor that spells out in 2019.  Strap in, ladies and gentlemen, we're just getting started.  So after getting rich by importing crime from Mexico and selling it to a Jewish murderer of white women, two baby boomers decide to go to Mardi Gras and party their lives away with the money.  Metaphors, they don't stop, trust me.  Next, we get a close-up of what the main character is riding on.  It's a motorcycle garishly decorated with the American flag.  He stuffs this icon of America with his ill-gotten cash, throws away his watch because now that he's sold the country out, he doesn't need to worry about the future, and he rides the American flag until it breaks down.  But luckily for him, the two are helped out by a man who has escaped the city and has a homestead, a wife and several children in New Mexico.  This is the one time in the film when I started to wonder if maybe, just maybe, the filmmakers might be more self-aware than I first imagined.  In this part of the film, and this is maybe the only time in the film, The two worlds, the two audiences, the audience in 1969 and me in 2019, the two worlds seem to collide.  Peter Fonda's character, the one who rode the American flag stuffed with cash until it broke down, looks at the homesteader's life and seems to admire the man for what he's built.  He tells the man that he should be proud and you really get a sense of that.  there's a part of him that wishes that this was the path he had taken.  Which, to be honest, only makes me angrier and hate the characters more.  I can no longer view them as ignorant, drugged-up hippies aimlessly wandering through life with no direction.  Because of the compliments he gives the homesteader, the only thing you can conclude is that he knows this was a choice.  A good choice.  But after taking from that man what he needed to ride his money-stuffed American flag and eating the man's food, they continue on their way to Mardi Gras to the sounds of Boomer Rock.  Next, the duo picks up a hippie hitchhiker, and they take him to where he's going.  It's a hippie compound that is in stark, stark contrast, a contrast I find equally hilarious and irritating, to the homesteader's ranch.  Instead of a man who's productive and the patriarch of his family, a family that is governed by his order, and an order that has produced surplus that allows him to help these two random strangers passing through, the hippies live in a complete lackadaisical chaos.  Children are running around aimlessly, everyone's doing drugs and having sex.  The hitchhiker explains they didn't even get the crops planted in time, and now they're running out of food.  Half of the members of the compound are performing obnoxious, impromptu performance.  art plays for an audience too stoned to notice how terrible it is.  while the other half tries to plant crops by wandering around in the dirt, tossing seeds recklessly onto the ground as they're high as kites.  It's like a Boomer Lord of the Flies, an entire community of rootless woodstock attendees making love, not war, or food, in the wilderness.  Almost every resident of this clown show reaches a level of hippie.  that kind of incites violence in reasonable people.  And after mingling with this commune, very respectfully, of course, what they're doing is very revolutionary.  It's very awe-inspiring.  But alas, after a few days of constantly smoking marijuana and having sterile sex, the two continue on their way to Mardi Gras.  Next, we see the first of many instances where the film will repeatedly demonize white Southerners and frame them as the real enemy of the people, the enemy of the generations.  They are the opposite of everything that the boomer stands for.  They are racist, sexist, homophobes, prone to random acts of violence and oppression.  The two bikers are arrested when they happen upon a small town parade and decide to inject themselves into it rather than respecting the order of the community.  And then instead of understanding what they did wrong, they complain about the weirdo hicks.  in the town.  And as they do, in what seems to be a requirement in Hollywood movies today.  and then, they mock the town's Christianity.  While in jail, they meet Jack Nicholson's character, who apparently is the son of someone important in town, and also an alcoholic lawyer that was locked up from the debauchery of the night before.  They locked him up so he could sleep off his hangover.  He uses his influence with the police to get the two out of prison, and they invite him to go along with them to Mardi Gras.  He tells them that there's a whorehouse that he has always wanted to go to, and agrees to come along.  On the way to Mardi Gras, they stop off somewhere in the scary white deep south, in a town basically straight out of Deliverance, and they go to a restaurant that refuses to serve them.  The locals... at the next table openly discuss what they're going to do with the long-haired gay people that have rolled into town.  while the desperate young southern girls drool and fawn all over them because they're so cool they can't help but make overt sexual advances towards them.  They decide to leave town because they feel like it's dangerous, but they don't go far enough, apparently.  And the randomly violent, evil, racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe Southerners go to their camp in the middle of the night and, for no reason at all, severely beat them, one of them, to death.  So, for no reason, they beat up the two bikers and murder Jack Nicholson's character.  And what happens next... is even more bizarre.  And I honestly don't even really know what to think about it other than once again, it shows kind of how self-centered and free of personal responsibility the characters are.  A man they invited to ride with them to Mardi Gras, who was completely innocent, helped them out, got him out of prison, was just murdered for being with them, And there's zero time devoted to what they should do to notify law enforcement or maybe get revenge or something.  In fact, there's nothing in the film to suggest that they didn't just leave him there at the side of the road and just keep going to Mardi Gras like nothing happened.  The only real tribute they offer to him is after going through his wallet, they find the name of the whorehouse in New Orleans and decide, oh, let's go to the whorehouse that he wanted to go to to honor him.  That's what he would have wanted.  I mean... And this movie's full of jarring edits, scenes that don't seem to really go together very well.  And I think a lot of that was due to this being Hopper's first movie.  He just didn't know what he was doing.  But even if you account for that, it really strikes me as sociopathic how casually they handle the beating to death loss of their friend and just continue on their pleasure-seeking journey.  So in the next scene, they get to the whorehouse.  They rent out two prostitutes and go on a drug-fueled adventure through Mardi Gras.  They eventually wind up doing acid in a graveyard.  And the scene that follows, it's just reminiscent of every single drug scene in every student film ever made.  Just a series of random cuts passed off as artistic.  And in a lot of ways, it's also kind of just an excuse to show the prostitutes without their clothes on.  So the random pseudo artistic shots depicting the acid trip goes on and on and like far longer than necessary.  And kind of gives you the impression after a while that it's edited this way specifically For the hippies in the audience who they know are going to get high in preparation for the film.  So it's like a little treat for the people that are on acid in the audience.  Because other than that, it's just obnoxious.  Like, it goes on way too long, and there's no meaning behind it.  There's no deep, like, whoa, message to it at all.  It's just random, stupid art film crap.  Well, and naked ladies.  And then it transitions quickly and jarringly into the next scene, where you don't even know what happened to the prostitutes.  They're just magically gone.  And the two are camping out at the side of the road, leaving Mardi Gras behind, apparently.  And the most famous line of the film is spoken.  And for a moment, I'm tempted, just for a second, to view this as a sign, once again... of self-awareness.  Dennis Hopper's character is celebrating the fact that they have all this money from their drug deal and they just went to Mardi Gras and partied with hookers and everything went just how they planned.  You know, no mention of the guy that got beat to death along the way.  And then Peter Fonda's character, who isn't as celebratory as his friend, looks at him and just says, no, we blew it.  We blew it.  Hopper and Fonda have never said what they meant by that line.  And when they have talked about it, they make it seem as though it's meant to mean whatever the audience wants to apply it to.  And this audience in 2019 knows exactly what to apply it to.  You did blow it.  You had it all and you sold us out.  so you could have your little adventure with your pockets full of cash and you blew it.  You kicked Humpty Dumpty right the fuck off the wall and watched him tumble and crash into a million pieces because you were too high to do anything else.  You and your generation fucking blew it.  And just like Dennis Hopper himself, you won't live long enough to reap what you've sown.  This movie is quite literally, in every way imaginable and unimaginable, peak fucking boomer.  And to top it all off as if the filmmakers know how this has to end.  and wants to blame shift once again, throw all the responsibility that they spent their entire lives avoiding, shift it all, take it all, and place that responsibility on the people they spent the entire movie demeaning.  You see, for no reason, literally no reason at all, while riding their motorcycles peacefully through the South, not hurting nobody, An old southern farmer decides to just blow them both away with his shotgun.  Really, like for no reason, just they drive by, he gets a shotgun out and just murders them for no reason.  Other than he's a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe.  So he blows them away and sends their iconic American bike and their money up in flames.  The filmmakers knew exactly how this had to end, and they picked the laziest scapegoat possible to avoid any responsibility for the consequences of their actions.

We have a difficult task before us in this country. all of us. And it will need our courage and our strength.  And we shall need the sympathy and the goodwill and understanding of everyone in the country, whatever their party or beliefs.  I believe we shall have that sympathy.  And I'm certain that with the efforts of all, we can succeed. The long term question is about our identity.  It's not about our economic success or failure.  The identity of a country is that which makes it possible for it to be ruled, which enables us to accept being governed by people we didn't vote for and to join together in crises to resolve our collective problem.  We act collectively.  We can only do this because we trust each other.  Trust and belonging is what it's all about.  In our history, trust has been vested in the nation, the nation state, and its sovereignty, and the territory over which it has exercised that sovereignty.  Territory for us is not an arbitrary thing, nor are the borders that secure it.  It is what defines what we are.  No human system is perfect, but the system of free ports, with all its faults, has built up for us the greatest international trade in the world, the greatest shipping in the world, the greatest aggregation of ports in the world, the greatest export of manufactured goods per head of the population in the whole world.  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.  Every voter must remember that the future destinies of the country and of the Empire rest upon his or her decision. And in that territory various institutions have grown and a language has come into existence and those institutions are valued by us, they are precious to us because they encapsulate our freedom.  The sense that we share something which brings us together.  so we have something that keeps us together and I want to retain that thing.  We survived the last war because of our loyalty to the nation state.  It's all we've got.  It's the thing that enables us to belong together as a collective, as a we.  That's why I would say we should leave. The feelings of opposition to the European Union of much longer standing than the recent feelings about the mass immigration.  And they have been about democratic accountability.  The thought being that more than half I think nearly two-thirds of the laws rubber-stamped by our Parliament originate in Brussels, in the minds of bureaucrats who have no knowledge of or interest in the peculiar social conditions of Britain, which are very peculiar because we haven't been interfered with in this way before.  And people have resented that, and rightly, because after all, what is democracy if it's not the ability of a people to decide for themselves about the laws that operate in the country that is theirs.  No more financial contributions. No more European Court of Justice.  No more common fisheries policy. No more being talked down to.  No more being bullied.  No more ghee for Hofstad.  I mean, what's not to like? And that reference to the country Our country is absolutely fundamental to the democratic idea. But the most significant point is this.  What happens at 11 p.m.  this Friday, the 31st of January, 2020, marks the point of no return.  Once we've left, we are never coming back.  And the rest, frankly, is detail. We're going.  We will be gone.  God save the king.  God save the king.  God save the king.  The West German economics minister has said that British businessmen who wear bolas tend to be rather too traditional in their business methods.  Would you agree? I think they've got a damned impertinence to make any suggestions that we're not as efficient as they are, I suppose. But I think a bola hat and an umbrella, for the practical purposes, do give you just something else for... A little sort of standing. Do you think that if we do go to the Common Market, we would have to drop our bowler hat image?  Do you think that these remarks by Herr Schiller is going to hurt your sales? No, I don't, for one minute.  And knowing my own fellow countrymen, as I say, or perhaps I say the inhabitants of these British Isles, a remark like that from somebody on the continent is inclined to make us turn around and say, well, to hell with him, we'll wear more bowler hats.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker emphasizes the importance of national identity and sovereignty in the face of the European Union.

President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.  Hillary Clinton... started the birther controversy.  Hillary is a birther.  I know the H-1B very well, and it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use.  We shouldn't have it.  Very, very bad for workers.  Yeah, let me just read the tweet first.  H-1B holders in the United States can rest assured changes are coming.  We'll bring both simplicity and certainty to their stay, including a potential path to citizenship.  We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.  So do you think this is a complete flip-flop from the president in terms of his prior view or kind of an evolution of where he was on it?  It seemed like a pretty important... It's the end of the week, so let's call it an evolution.  Are we going to get involved with Syria?  No.  Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike.  on the airfield in Syria.  We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon.  Let the other people take care of it now.  They're all coming back and they're coming back now.  The president said everyone's coming out.  Orders were given to expedite the removal of 2000 US special forces and others in Syria.  Then everyone started to say, wait a minute, what will happen to those who the U.S.  and its coalition partners fought alongside.  Now the White House has issued a clarification in a statement that says there will not be an immediate withdrawal of American forces.  Troops will still stay in Syria.  Partial birth abortion.  Would President Trump ban partial birth abortion?  Well, look, I'm... Very pro-choice.  But you would not ban it?  No.  Or ban partial birth abortion?  No.  I am pro-choice in every respect.  Even punishment for abortion, yes or no, is a principle.  There has to be some form of punishment.  For the woman?  Yeah.  Do you think it's murder, abortion?  I have my opinions on it, but I'd rather not comment on it.  Because you have said that Planned Parenthood, they do some good things, you say.  Senate leadership failed to include conscience protections in the spending bill, which would protect pro-life health care workers from taking part in abortion.  Why did the president sign the spending bill on Friday?  It funds Planned Parenthood.  That's something he said he's opposed to.  Why did he sign it?  It's a tough call.  Kept the government open.  I will never sign another bill like this again.  I'm not going to do it again.  It changes.  I will be changing very rapidly.  I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.  We just got breaking news this morning.  According to Axios, what the president is talking about doing, he hasn't done it yet, it's one of these things where he's musing he will do it because he wants us to talk about it, is to do away with birthright citizenship.  Now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order.  Now how ridiculous, we're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  And it has to end.  Have you talked about that with counsel?  Yeah, I have.  So we're in the process.  It's in the process.  It'll happen.  For people that have been here for years, that have been hard workers, have good jobs, are supporting a family, it's very, very tough to just say, you have to leave, get out.  How do you throw somebody out that's lived in this country for 20 years?  You just can't throw everybody out.  It began with the President informing the Speaker of the House that, yes, in fact, he would be delivering that State of the Union address as planned next week.  Now, that was a move that invited a response from the Speaker herself, telling the President, no, no, you're not going to do that.  Pelosi just responded, and she said she will not consider a concurrent resolution to have you come to the House on January 29th to deliver your State of the Union.  Your response to the House Speaker.  The president declared that he would, in fact, wait to deliver his State of the Union until a later date.  And we have to start by building a wall, a big, beautiful, powerful wall.  Who is going to pay for the wall?  They may not know it yet, but the answer is Mexico.  Things are negotiable.  I'll be honest with you.  You know, I'll make the wall two feet shorter or something.  I mean, everything is negotiable.  We're going to build a wall, okay?  We're going to build a wall.  And it'll be a real wall.  And by the way, it will be paid for by Mexico, and they understand that.  We didn't discuss payment of the wall.  That'll be for a later date.  President Trump is flip-flopping tonight over funding for his border wall.  He's long promised that Mexico will pay for it.  We're going to have a shutdown.  There's nothing we can do about that.  The president's saying he is going to take some major action on the border if he does not get the wall money he wants.  We will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall.  I can't tell you when the government's going to be open.  I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a... wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it.  This is him quoting you.  I just want to check that the shutdown could go on for months or even a year or longer.  Did you say that?  I did.  Is that your assessment of where we are?  Absolutely, I said that.  He's not going to sign a bill that doesn't have money for the wall.  If he gives in now, that's the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president.  That's probably the end of his presidency.  I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.  Yesterday, he was saying no short term deal unless there is a down payment on the wall.  There is no down payment for the wall.  So what is his thinking?  The best way to get this thing to conclusion is open up the government.  Last week ended with a remarkable cave on his demand for a border wall.  Today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi extended an invitation to the president for his State of the Union speech, announcing the new date as February 5th.  I want people to come into our country.  in the largest numbers ever.  It's political bullshit.  Do you understand?  Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman.  I mean, I'm a little biased because I've known her for years.  I just like her.  If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.  There has never been anything like it.  And we're going to have a special prosecutor.  When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.  In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.  You know, it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.  Because you'd be in jail.  Secretary Clinton.  At pretty much every rally, President-elect Trump was hearing from the crowds, lock her up.  And he said on Tuesday to the New York Times that he is not looking to prosecute Hillary Clinton when he comes into office.  You gotta speak to Jeff Sessions about that.  No, it's okay.  No, they got it.  That plays great before the election.  No, we don't care, right?  In many cases, I probably identify more as a Democrat.  NATO is obsolete.  NATO is obsolete.  I think it's largely obsolete.  Yeah, it's got to be changed.  I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO.  I said it was obsolete.  It's no longer obsolete.  Once again, full faith and support for America's intelligence agencies.  I have a full faith in our intelligence agencies.  Well, we're going to get infrastructure.  Infrastructure is the easiest of all.  Infrastructure is going to be starting right after the midterms.  I hate the concept of guns.  So, big Second Amendment.  We're all big heavy on the Second Amendment.  This morning, we also completed the process to issue a new regulation banning bump stocks.  Now wait, wait, you can't do it through an executive order.  My father.  Ivanka feels very strongly.  My wife feels very strongly about it.  I feel very strongly about it.  We're going to keep families together, but the border is going to be just as tough as it's been.  Liberal in health care.  Universal health coverage.  I like universal.  As far as single payer, it works in Canada.  It works incredibly well in Scotland.  I will ask Congress to convene a special session.  So we can repeal and replace.  And we will do it very, very quickly.  I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days.  I have a long time.  We'll just let Obamacare fail.  Everybody's got to be covered.  This is an un-Republican thing for me to say.  Universal health care.  I am going to take care of everybody.  Who pays for it?  The government's going to pay for it.  What do you think of eminent domain?  I think it's a wonderful thing.  I'll be honest with you.  Very few complaints the way it is.  People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.  There has been so little trouble.  So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?  That is correct.  I really believe the Republicans are just too crazy right.  I mean, hey, I lived in New York City and Manhattan all my life, okay?  So, you know, my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa, perhaps.  We never do anything right with China.  I was very impressed with President Xi.  I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now.  Well, look, as I've told you, they're under audit.  They have been for a long time.  They're extremely complex.  People wouldn't understand them.  If they don't stop them, we're closing the border.  They'll close it, and we'll keep it closed for a long time.  I'm not playing games.  If they don't, and I'm telling you right now, we will close the damn border.  Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic consequences.  economic impact on our country.  We're going to give them a one-year warning.  And if the drugs don't stop or largely stop, we're going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, in particular cars.  And if that doesn't stop the drugs, We closed the border.  I don't think we'll ever have to close the border.  Though he tried to walk back his one-year deadline within the span of a day.  So the border stays open at least for a year?  No, I didn't say that.  We would start with the tariffs, and we'll see what happens.  Saying, remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, but didn't keep them.  Donald J. Trump.  Thank you.  Thank you.","channel.id":"clxmi0mmn013acdvifdyab1v8","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCvaHgYcWAAcn5D54w4Dqezg","channel.name":"Black Pilled","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVa8ayz8gaPRnO0UzN66XY-KFfXcTwwakJKoe3YgA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Donald Trump's ancestry has been a topic of debate, with him initially claiming his grandfather was Swedish, then later stating his parents were German and Swedish.

Canada does have a history of strong secessionist movements.  In the aftermath of this election, talk of secession has come rushing back to the forefront.  Scott Moe is the premier of Saskatchewan.  He just published an open letter to Justin Trudeau.  He says the people of his province are more frustrated and alienated than at any point in his lifetime.  He calls for both Alberta and Saskatchewan to receive a new deal from the Canadian federal government.  He calls on Justin Trudeau to cancel the federal carbon tax, negotiate a new formula for equalization payouts, and allow new pipelines to be built.  At the heart of this divide is the fact that vast amounts of federal tax revenue are taken from Alberta and Saskatchewan and used to subsidize the rest of Canada instead of being spent locally.  Alberta and Saskatchewan voted overwhelmingly for the Conservative Party.  Out of a combined 48 seats, the Conservative Party won 47 and Trudeau's Liberal Party won zero.  Nationally, Conservatives got 34.4% of the vote and Liberals got 31.1%.  However, when it comes to seats... Trudeau's Liberal Party will get 46.5% of the seats, and the Conservatives will only get 35.8% of the seats, even though they received a quarter of a million more votes.  To understand how this happened, take a look at these maps.  The Toronto metro area gets more seats than Alberta and Saskatchewan put together.  The Liberal Party won most of these seats.  If we compare the Canadian Parliament to the U.S.  House of Representatives, Toronto would be California New York City.  The left-wing Liberal and New Democratic parties both took sizable hits at the polls.  However, because of the massive number of seats in Toronto, it appears that substitute school teacher and costume aficionado Justin Trudeau will return to power.  The big victor of the election was regional party block Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which made a huge comeback.  A big chunk of the seats lost by the Liberal and New Democratic parties went to Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.  Now, this is not a Conservative party.  It is basically center-left, but with a lot of caveats.  In 1995, the people of Quebec nearly voted to secede from Canada in a public referendum.  The referendum failed 56.6% to 49.4%, even though the polls had been predicting it would pass for weeks.  It had the highest voter turnout in Quebec history, with 93% of eligible voters participating and lost by only 46,000 votes.  Now, there were some serious shenanigans.  Millions of federal tax dollars were spent fighting the referendum.  Over 86,000 votes were rejected, more than the margin of victory.  People were charged with fraud, but no one was ever convicted.  However, the main reason that the referendum lost was the weaponizing of the immigrant population to stop it.  The core strategy of the No campaign was to use fear-mongering and hysteria to scare the immigrant population into voting No.  In fact, the Canadian immigration minister, Liberal Party member Sergio Marchi, flooded Quebec with citizenship judges ahead of the election.  Over 40,000 immigrants were fast-tracked to full citizenship so they could vote in the referendum.  Marchi even openly admitted he was creating new voters for the election.  There are two key things that the left uses to undermine democracy, welfare and immigration.  Welfare is used to buy votes and immigration is used to create new voters for their policies.  The 1995 referendum in Quebec is a textbook example of immigration being used to explicitly undermine the democratic process.  Then, anyone in Quebec who spoke out about this was simply denounced as a racist.  Currently, Quebec's parliament is dominated by the center-right Coalition for Quebec's Future.  This coalition does not advocate full independence, but does advocate for the protection of Quebec's unique French-Canadian culture and has clashed with Trudeau over immigration.  The success of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois appears to be the result of the policies of its new leader, Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet.  He only became the leader last January.  He seems to have moved the party back to its center-right roots and campaigned on lowering immigration and reducing taxes.  Under his leadership, the party made huge gains.  These gains came mainly at the expense of the Liberal and New Democracy parties.  While the Quebecois do not seem to view secession as a viable political option anymore, social media has exploded with talk of the possible secession of Alberta.  Alberta is another region with a long-standing secessionist movement.  However, there has never been a referendum.  Talk of hashtag Wexit and Ottawa doesn't care are all over the internet.  The Canadian left appears to be getting a bit worried.  With Trudeau poised to return, many think an actual referendum in Alberta would win.  Many are wondering aloud what would actually happen if the economic powerhouse Alberta seceded and the Canadian government lost its cash cow.  Another big question is, how much of the rest of Western Canada would Alberta be able to take with it?  Brian Pallister, the premier of Manitoba, publicly denounced secession yesterday and said he supports the carbon tax.  However, Manitoba was divided with conservatives winning seven seats and the left-wing parties winning seven seats.  Is it possible that at some point in the future, we will see an independent Western Canada, an independent French-speaking Quebec, and a third country dominated by Toronto?  Personally, I think it would be very exciting to see the creation of a new country in North America.  Compared to the entire rest of the world, the Western Hemisphere has been extremely stable as far as borders are concerned for a very long time.  We will have to wait and see what happens.

I'm sure you've noticed, but we have some problems on the right.  I've been talking to a lot of YouTubers behind the scenes, and it seems that a lot of us have stopped consuming content.  I don't think that it's due to a decline in quality of content, but rather that so much has already been said.  I cannot watch another video on migrant rape, on civilizational collapse, on demographic demise.  It isn't that these issues aren't of the utmost importance.  Of course they are.  It's because viewing the world through this lens has taken its toll on us psychologically.  You guys know how this goes.  The scales fall from your eyes and you can never again slip back into the comfort of naivete.  You can't watch a movie without picking up on the subversive undertones.  You can't have a conversation with an old friend without thinking what a dumb ass they are.  There is no going back.  This does have some benefits.  You see things for how they really are.  You can affect change because you know the truth.  But it blows apart the small joys of mundane living and everything becomes a little bleak, a little sad, a little harder to cope with.  That's part of the problem with the right, the nihilism.  But we've got other issues.  There's a huge amount of infighting going on.  And while this creates a host of problems, including an inability for us to become friends with one another despite having so much in common, The real issue with this is that it gives the left an opportunity to seize upon the discord.  The left is better at creating a unified front.  Yes, there's a fair amount of cannibalizing going on, considering that male feminists are getting me-too'd left, right, and sideways, and that unholy alliances like that between Muslims and the LGBTQ community are inherently incompatible.  Nonetheless, their hatred of the right and their desire to de-platform all of us creates something of a cohesive unit.  That isn't to say that we shouldn't be critical of one another.  There is less ideological conformity on the right, and that's probably a good thing.  Many of us come from libertarianism, from even further left.  Much of this dialogue is serving to reveal the best way forward in a unique cultural environment.  My beliefs have changed drastically from the start of my channel.  Most of all, though, I'm seeing a distinct break between those that still believe in the concept of America and those that see America as a failing experiment.  When I first started this channel three and a half years ago, I thought the most important thing is the salvation of America, an adherence to our constitutional values, a resurrection of the principles that serve to protect our freedoms.  But over the years, I've become increasingly distrustful of our government and more and more convinced that in the event we're able to save America from certain destruction, if we rebuild in the same image, it will once again be destroyed by multiculturalism and by creeping liberalism.  As such, my focus has changed to wider Western values.  Of course, unfettered free speech, 2A, these uniquely American traits are incredibly important to me.  But I realized that I'm not trying to save America.  I'm trying to save the rebellious, irreplaceable Western spirit that birthed America.  Along the same lines, we've fractured on the acceptance and the rejection of identity politics.  I've spoken about this at great length on my channel, some videos are linked below, so I'll try to avoid redundancy, but I think the entire concept of identity politics is retarded.  All of us, every single one, use personal characteristics, immutable or not, to inform our political opinions.  I keep hearing the argument that religious conviction is not an immutable characteristic, which is true in some circumstances.  But what if it is inextricably linked to your ethnic heritage, your family, your ancestry, your community?  No one, despite their declarations, is actually going to inform their political opinion without viewing domestic and foreign policy through the lens of their in-group's best interest.  No one.  Not only that, but we can't really ask people to do that.  People respond to incentives and they're motivated by self-interest.  To expect otherwise is to try to fundamentally change human behavior.  We have to accept that all people will use their life experience to inform their worldview, thus their political philosophies, and act accordingly.  That means we must expect all groups to protect their self-interest, and we must protect our own self-interest.  If we don't, no one else is going to do it.  That is where this issue is causing discord on the right.  Lots of conservatives will say, your identity is American.  You must protect that first and foremost.  And I used to agree with this.  But what if you see that America is failing to protect individual freedoms?  What if you see that it has become a total bastardization of the original framework?  What if you see that the government can't be trusted and not only has gone astray, but has committed unforgivable acts?  What do I have in common with a conservative that has no group identity and only wishes to conserve that which is modern America, a nation I can barely identify with anymore?  So with whom do I belong?  I identify with the nation's founders, with my Western European ancestry, with Catholics and other Christians.  In every video in which I discuss my return to Catholicism, I get comments about the invalidity of rediscovering Christianity as a means of developing a cohesive community.  I think this is a good point and likely that Jesus would view that as a superficial reason to adopt a Christian perspective.  I would think that he wants us to return to him to seek salvation in a corrupt world, to seek order in chaos, to find a path for love and redemption.  Because we have really, really screwed things up.  Those should be the reasons that we're returning to Christianity.  But it would be foolish to deny the accompanying benefit of widespread Christianity.  It bound communities and nations together for centuries.  That is something that we are notably lacking and I believe is at the heart of the failure of the America Project, this loss of faith.  That's the right's Achilles heel and the left knows it.  That is what these George Soros stooges like Becca Lewis and Jared Holt have seized upon.  They can take us out one by one through deplatforming because we do not have a strong commonality or universal conviction that really unites us.  Unlike the left that is united through their hatred of Western culture, of white people, of Christians, they have a more uniform conviction.  And it really is rooted in righteous indignation.  They think that they're actually fighting racism, that they're doing good work, helping the oppressed, fighting intolerance.  Of course, they're actively destroying personal freedoms to appear tolerant to their friends and to do some globalist bidding.  But they're useful idiots that feel the power of their collective indignation.  That's what we need.  Who has a right to righteous indignation more than Europeans and Americans that are losing their nations, that are being silenced by corporations, by their governments, whose lives are being destroyed for speaking plain truths, even in private conversation?  who cannot practice their religion freely, who are demonized by their media, their community, whose daughters are being sacrificed at the altar of this so-called tolerance.  And instead of standing up and fighting, they praise the benefits of diverse food culture at their daughter's funeral.  It's insane.  Entire generations, entire nations.  subverted through a century of carefully crafted messaging, through a takeover of academic environments, through the widespread utilization of every Alinsky-ite tactic in government and schools and media.  Who has a right to righteous indignation more than us?  And that's how we win.  All of the infighting, these proclamations that were vehemently against identity politics, that were not like those people on the fringe right.  None of this is going to save you.  It will just serve to destroy us all.  first for the people that are likable, are funny, have a common sense message with an appealing delivery like Gavin McInnes.  They can write off others as extremists so they aren't as dangerous, but they cannot divide and conquer if we're united in our rage.  That's something they don't seem to realize about this deplatforming as they saw when they did this test and deleted Black Pigeon Speaks channel.  They act like people are just going to be like, okay, I guess he's gone forever and we'll just adopt the mainstream narrative like this dweeb from the New York Times article a few weeks back.  That isn't going to happen.  It's just going to fuel the righteous indignation.  And when people like Becca Lewis repeat that deplatforming works, what they're underestimating is the power of martyrdom.  Every time someone's income is taken away, their family suffers consequences, the pity and outpouring of financial and emotional support is commensurate with the severity of the attack.  Our views increase, we fortify our modes of financial support, and if our channels get shut down, there is an unquenchable thirst for justice and revenge.  It's a really dangerous game they're playing.  No matter, they're going to keep coming for us one by one, wearing us out, continuing to proclaim their victory as we get picked off.  The solution?  We need a new batch of high-energy people in the field that are protected.  I'm not going to discourage women from starting channels, but I can say firsthand that we have fragile egos and don't do as well long term.  We need men that are financially independent, don't largely rely on income from corporate streams, that don't care about media hit pieces, about doxing, about being painted with a broad brush.  Families always have consequences, so their wives have to be on board.  But being single might even be better.  And of course, we all need to diversify our platforms.  My bit shoot and gab links are below.  So if you have a channel that fits that criteria, you think you do some good stuff, send me some videos and I will start helping you launch these.  We need some new blood.  Thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0r5m049zcdviphi5ilqs","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCpbyOgUSjTSPpvVUAT2OyHw","channel.name":"Blonde in the Belly of the Beast","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJUBXvnTXDeyFu929ZWEC4UNFhe28v1mbn8JFRumcQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the current state of the right-wing community on YouTube, citing issues such as nihilism, infighting, and a lack of unity.

Well, sometimes it's hard to avoid this.  It's pretty easy to do when it comes to just not watching a movie at the theater.  I didn't expect to take a look at this movie for a while, but I got the opportunity to see it for free.  So I strapped in and I watched it and I realized I'd seen this movie several times before.  Now what I mean by this is there is absolutely nothing original about Joker.  In fact, it parallels other mostly Robert De Niro movies so closely.  I almost wonder if that's why they felt like they had to cast him in the film, in a part that really didn't suit his very limited acting range.  It's almost like they knew if they didn't include him, people would just be talking about how they just picked different scenes from movies he'd been in and rammed them together in something they could trick people into watching, which is exactly what they did.  In fact, you might be wondering how I can review this film at all without access to the footage and it's easy.  Even though the trailer is only a few minutes long, I can easily fill in all the blanks with movies that Joker is a carbon copy of.  So with that in mind, let's get started.  The movie starts out with Joker at his crappy job where he works with other misfits who are likely children of single mothers and because of their lack of a positive male role model for guidance, are just kind of failing through life.  We see how shitty and dangerous Joker's job is when on the street, doing his job, he's attacked by a gang of young diversity.  Next we see Joker laughing uncontrollably, like a maniac.  Okay, this clip is from Cape Fear.  It doesn't really count, but it still looks and sounds remarkably like Joker, so still funny.  I'm leaving it in there.  So Joker is talking to his government-issued life coach of color and tells her that the things are getting crazier.  People are getting tense.  He asks her to give him more medication, courtesy of the state, no doubt.  After getting his medication, he stares out at the decaying city, disgusted.  He tries to have a moment with a young black kid on the bus, but he's yelled at by the kid's presumably single mother.  And I'll say one thing about this.  I've heard people say that this movie is an indictment of single mothers.  And as with the other good things people are trying to read into this film, it's not that it's an indictment of single mothers.  It's just that it's, for the first time, maybe in a long time, it's not portraying all single mothers as strong, independent women.  There's no commentary.  It's just the absence of the leftist propaganda that many viewers are so used to hearing.  They're so conditioned.  They're expecting it.  that when it's not there, they think the absence of this message is somehow a message in their direction.  But obviously that's not true at all, and we'll see more of that.  So, Joker laughs uncontrollably, and hands the mother on his bus a card that explains he can't control his manic laughter.  And it's a nervous condition.  So throughout the movie, he just kind of laughs hysterically for no reason at inappropriate times.  He walks the street slowly, wading through the filth of the city, surrounded by the chaos and police sirens.  He comes home and talks to his aging single mom, who he lives with and is living off of disability.  She talks about writing letters to Thomas Wayne, who you could say is kind of a Donald Trump figure in the film.  He's a right-wing billionaire tycoon and he's running for mayor of Gotham.  They sit down and begin to watch a late night show.  and this is when the film switches from kind of mirroring Taxi Driver to incorporating elements of The King of Comedy.  The King of Comedy is a film where Robert De Niro plays a failed comic, just like Joker, who is obsessed with a late night talk show host, just like Joker.  Joker watches the show on television and imagines that he's in the studio, just like in King of Comedy, and the host of the show loves him, exactly like Robert De Niro's character in King of Comedy would do.  He invents a scenario in his head where the talk show host wants to be the father he never had.  I mean, it's very identical to King of Comedy.  Next, the film Joker switches back to mirroring Taxi Driver.  He's at work and his boss is blaming him for getting jumped and telling him that any damages will come out of his paycheck.  While coming home, he meets another black single mom in the elevator, but this one he's attracted to.  When he tries to flirt with her, he kind of just comes across like a psycho.  Essentially, just like Robert De Niro's characters in Taxi Driver and in The King of Comedy, they both have love interests and they both look like psychos when they approach them.  So because his job is obviously dangerous, one of the guys he works with gives him a gun.  He goes home and begins to practice and play with his new gun, just like the scene in Taxi Driver where Robert De Niro is doing kind of the same thing.  He then begins to stalk the woman he met on the elevator, following her around like a creep, just like Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver.  As I mentioned before, Robert De Niro's characters in Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, they're obsessed with women, but the women see them as too unbalanced to have a relationship with.  This is the exact same dynamic that exists with Joker.  A woman he's obsessed with, but he's too crazy to connect with.  The only difference is in Joker, the added twist, if you want to call it that, is that Joker is only imagining that he's with this woman.  So he's only fantasizing about a black single mom as a love interest.  imagining that she eventually dates him.  And the audience has led to believe that that's what's going on.  And based on, quite frankly, what I've heard some people say about the movie, some people still don't get it and think that they were actually in a relationship.  But no, he's fantasizing that she finds him funny and quirky and fantasizing that they go out a couple times.  But then later in the film, it's revealed, just like with Robert De Niro's characters, He's too crazy and unbalanced and there's no way at all that she would be attracted to him.  She's repulsed.  She's terrified of him.  The second she's around him long enough to find out that he's crazy.  Now in the next scene, I don't actually need any footage of a movie because I can just use a story that really happened that we're all familiar with.  The Jussie Smollett story.  You know, Jussie Smollett and his MAGA country fantasy.  That's essentially the blood libel that Joker perpetrates on the same people that lined up to go see the movie, by the way.  You see, Joker is coming home from work late at night.  He's still in his clown makeup.  He's depressed.  And then three white guys wearing MAGA hats.  Okay, I'm kidding about the MAGA hats, but they might as well be wearing MAGA hats.  It's three white guys wearing suits, hassling a woman on the train because, you know, as Jussie Smollett has taught us, there's nothing more dangerous late at night than a well-dressed white man.  So the well-dressed upper class white men start to violently attack Joker for really no reason.  You know, as wealthy white people are known to do, you know, always riding on trains late at night, assaulting people.  And Joker takes out his gun and kills the three kids in maga hats.  I'm sorry, in suits.  So after killing the three white guys, Joker fantasizes about having sex with his imaginary black girlfriend.  And then we find out that the three white guys not wearing maga hats worked for Donald Trump.  I'm sorry, Thomas Wayne.  I know, right?  Totally based.  So Joker then tells his government-issued life coach of color that the people are starting to resist.  He uses that word, and that is the word that's printed on the signs of the people in Antifa garb protesting around the city.  He's part of the resistance against these white people not wearing MAGA hats.  And so are the other dregs of society just like him that live with their single moms on disability.  Next, we see how bad Joker is at stand-up comedy.  His nervous laughter and his terrible jokes unsettles the audience, but he's too out of touch, too insane, too disconnected from reality to notice that.  And instead, he thinks his imaginary black girlfriend is laughing at all his jokes.  So after his imaginary date, he comes home and he finds out that his mother has been writing letters to Thomas.  Wayne slash Donald Trump because she claims he is Joker's father.  So he decides to go to Mar-a-Lago, I mean Wayne Manor, to claim what is his, but is told by the butler that his mother is just crazy and that he's adopted.  Donald Trump is not his father and she's not even his real mother.  So before he can confront his maybe fake mom about this, she has a stroke and then she's taken to the hospital.  While Joker's there, we find out that the talk show host that he was obsessed with earlier in the film, like in King of Comedy, is playing a clip of Joker's terrible stand-up comedy performance.  But not because he thinks it's funny, but because they're ridiculing him.  It's like a viral, cringy video.  So in addition to this assault on his ego, Joker ends up losing his job because he brings the gun that his friend gave him to a children's hospital.  And while he's on the job, it falls out of his clown pants and you know that it freaks out.  obviously the hospital and they fire and this pushes him a little further over the edge as well as a trip to the institution where his mother apparently was locked up.  he goes there to find out if the story of him being adopted is true to get more information about his history.  And he finds out that it's very possible he was adopted, although they kind of put in a sliver of ambiguity in there, although it doesn't really matter.  Either way, he finds out that his mother used to date violent men and was turned on by men that would abuse him and beat him.  He finds out that his nervous laughter is a result of these injuries.","channel.id":"clxmi0mmn013acdvifdyab1v8","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCvaHgYcWAAcn5D54w4Dqezg","channel.name":"Black Pilled","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVa8ayz8gaPRnO0UzN66XY-KFfXcTwwakJKoe3YgA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The reviewer watched the Joker movie for free and found it to be a carbon copy of other films, particularly Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.

I hope you're all doing well.  First of all, before I kick this video off, I just wanted to quickly take a moment to welcome those of you who are new because I noticed that I've gained a few thousand subscribers or so over the past month.  So again, to those of you who are new, hello, my name is Brittany.  Welcome to my channel.  In today's video, we're going to explore the drastic decline in the happiness rates of young men and women today.  Now, some of you watching this video might completely disagree with this statement.  You might find that you're perfectly happy in your own lives, but unfortunately for many other young people, this is simply not the case.  Even without the studies, I'm sure that like me, many of you have come to a similar conclusion.  Whether it be at school, at work, in your social circles, and especially online, the atmosphere of our society has been permeated by a sense of purposelessness, lack of meaning, defensiveness, anger, and overall emptiness.  Some resort to strategies like humor, shit posting, or a materialistic partying lifestyle to disguise their true feelings.  But these methods are often less than effective.  In this video, we're firstly going to examine some of the ways in which the unhappiness of the youth has become apparent.  And afterwards, we're going to explore some of the possible reasons behind this unhappiness.  For starters, the use of antidepressants is on the rise.  12.7% of the US population over the age of 12 took antidepressant medication in the past month.  64% is the increase in the percentage of people using antidepressants between 1999 and 2014.  Furthermore, women are twice as likely as men to take antidepressant medication.  Having read this information, most of us are likely to conclude that in general, women seem to be a lot unhappier than men.  And for the most part, this actually does seem to be the case, except when it comes to American men who are out of work.  A wide swath of white American men are down in the dumps, their dire mood showing up in everything from mortality statistics to national politics.  Working-age men who have dropped out of the US workforce were found to be more stressed and sadder than their peers in both poor and rich countries.  The unhappiness gap between out-of-work men and those with jobs is also much wider in the US.  On the flip side, a recent UK study suggests that women are, for the most part, unhappier than men until they reach the age of 85.  Good news, ladies!  A life of fulfillment and happiness is right around the corner.  as soon as you turn 85.  A new study from the UK's National Health Service found that women are unhappier than men for most of their lives until they hit their 80s.  The study also found that women were more likely to report consistent unhappiness at almost every age, especially in their late teens, early 20s, and in middle age, but that rates of mental illness were rising across the board, with youth mental illness rising almost 50% since 2012.  The dramatic rise in the use of antidepressants is unfortunately just one of the perceivable indicators of youth unhappiness.  You also have a sharp increase in alcohol addiction, drug addiction, and in the suicide rates.  From 2007 to 2017, adults ages 18 to 34 saw a 69% increase in alcohol-related deaths and a 108% increase in drug-related deaths.  As for suicide, the suicide rate among people ages 10 to 24 years old climbed 56% between 2007 and 2017.  Upon reading this article, my very first thought was that surely social media must have something to do with the rise in suicide rates.  And in fact, later in this article, it's mentioned that some mental health experts agree.  Some mental health experts suggest that social media use among teens might be fueling the increase in mental health conditions and leading to greater suicide risk.  And some early studies have linked smartphone use to anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation among adolescents.  And this leads us to the first reason why young people seem to be so unhappy nowadays, due to a decline in both mental and physical health.  Starting with mental health, more American teens and young adults appear to be struggling with mental health issues, and experts believe a number of cultural trends may help explain why.  A new study found the percentage of teens and young adults with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues has increased sharply over the past decade.  The same pattern was not seen in older adults.  While the researchers didn't study the reasons behind the trend, they have some theories, such as shifting cultural trends over the past decade, including increased use of electronic communications and digital media, may have had a larger effect on mood disorders among younger generations compared with older generations.  Quote, recently there's been a number of studies showing that those who spend more time on digital media are more likely to be depressed and unhappy.  Now, obviously, social media can in no way be blamed for all of the world's anxiety and depression issues, but it certainly does seem to play a significant role.  Well, of course, some people might be lucky enough to find a warm and welcoming, cozy online community like a gamer community or a book club, for example, There are, on the other hand, countless toxic communities, just like at Twitter.  These days, the entire website seems to consist of nothing more than artificial outrage, virtue signaling, people insulting and lying about one another, articles about how the world is going to end in 12 years due to climate change, how we all need to start eating bugs, drinking cockroach milk, not thinking too much, giving up our right to privacy, and living in pods.  Just imagine a young straight white man scrolling through Twitter being confronted with article after article telling him how inherently racist, toxic, and privileged he is.  And further imagine a young girl scrolling through her Instagram feed rife with filtered posts boasting lives that seem far better than her own.  People with more followers, more money, prettier faces, better bodies.  Is it in any way surprising that such an atmosphere will lead to anxiety, depression, and an overall sense of discontent?  As for physical health, it's no secret that millions of Americans are fat, not just in America, but many in the West in general.  In the US, the nation's obesity rate is approaching 40%, after holding around 34-35% between 2005 and 2012.  I'm sure there are some people out there who believe that having a population that's 40% obese isn't a cause for worry.  After all, the media does go on all day long about how there's beauty at every size, health at every size, no matter how obese.  But the truth is that this narrative of obesity being just as healthy as a normal weight is a deadly lie.  Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately 100,000 to 400,000 deaths in the United States per year.  Just a few of the health problems associated with obesity are heart disease, diabetes, cancer, gout, gallbladder disease, and breathing problems.  So while the media can continue to peddle the narrative that being obese is a wonderful thing, I highly doubt that if you have such diseases or are at risk for such diseases, that you're a happier person for it.  Not to mention that if you are obese, it restricts your mobility and energy levels.  And as for the studies, they actually do say that exercising makes a person far happier.  Instead of logging extra hours at work in hopes of getting a raise, maybe you should just hit the gym instead.  as it could make you just as happy as that extra money.  an interesting new study published in the lancet found that people who are physically active have a greater sense of well-being than those who are inactive and that active individuals feel as good as inactive people who earn twenty five thousand dollars more per year after mental and physical health.  the second reason why young people seem to be so unhappy nowadays is due to a lack of meaningful companionship.  You go surveyed 1,254 Americans over 18 about friendship and loneliness.  And at 30% millennials were the most likely age cohort to say they felt lonely often or always.  By contrast, 20% of Gen X respondents said they felt lonely often or always, and only 15% of baby boomers gave those answers.  Millennials were also the most likely to report having zero friends, 22%, zero close friends, 27%, and zero acquaintances, 25%.  If this wasn't a devastating enough statistic in itself, not only are many millennials lonely and without friendships, They're not getting married or even dating very much either.  According to a study from the Pew Research Center that compares millennials to the silent generation, Born roughly from 1925 to 1942, millennials are three times as likely to never have married as their grandparents were.  Furthermore, just over half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34, 51% of them, said that they do not have a steady romantic partner, according to data from the General Social Survey released this week.  Now, for some of us, being alone isn't the end of the world, at least for a time.  We're more than content to spend a few years here and there, working on ourselves, on our careers, but at the end of the day, we are social creatures.  We don't want to live alone and we certainly don't want to die alone, despite the fact that certain asinine articles are trying to convince us of the opposite.  Companionship is important in every medium.  whether it be familial, a friendship, romantic, or even professional.  And this is yet another way that I think that social media can possibly be damaging, because it mimics companionship.  While of course we can certainly befriend people online, it really doesn't even remotely compare to the real thing.  To having real people by our side, sharing all the experiences, both good and bad that life has to offer.  I discovered this firsthand when I met those who I befriended online in real life.  That said, I'm in no way trying to bash online friendships.  I definitely think that they too can be fun, helpful, and consoling.  I think it only becomes slightly dangerous if online friendships are all we have.  The third and most important reason why young people seem to be so unhappy nowadays is a lack of a meaningful purpose in our lives.  A lack of a goal to strive for, both in the material sense and the spiritual sense.  In fact, as many as 30% of today's youngsters believe they are stuck in a rut, with 84% claiming they are failing to live their best life.  To be honest, when I read this study, it didn't really come as a shock to me, although of course it's still extremely sad, nine out of 10 young people is pretty much everyone.  I'm sure that many of these young people have their own jobs, perhaps even some of them their own houses and cars, but at the end of the day, what really do material things matter if we aren't personally doing something that we find significant and fulfilling.  If material things alone had the ability to make us happy, then all the rich, beautiful, and famous people would be happy all the time.  But the truth is that many of them seem secretly miserable.  If we look around our society at the moment, I think that happy is one of the last words I would use to describe it.  Rather, it's more akin to a large room where everyone is shouting at each other, arguing about who is the bigger victim and therefore should be given the most free handouts.  We put on false airs, claiming that our society is progressing, but beneath this claim all one will find is increasing tensions among those with different ideologies, threats of conflict, the breakdown of the family unit, the atomization of communities, rampant degeneracy, a floundering faith in our political and spiritual leaders, and the looming stench of totalitarianism.  All in all, we seem to be wasting away in a stagnant and soulless dystopia.  Naturally, I have my personal beliefs as to the fundamental reasons behind this decay, which can be found in the second part of having a meaningful purpose, which is having a spiritual purpose.  I realize that many of you watching this video now likely don't believe in God.  Perhaps you're averse to even hearing about God.  And in this case, the best advice that I or anybody else really can give you is to find meaning in the material realm.  Eat healthy and exercise.  Watch over your mental health.  In the same way that eating unhealthy has an effect on your body, mentally consuming unhealthy things has an effect on your mind.  Go out into the world and make real friendships.  Find people who will be there, for example, to celebrate your birthday with you rather than to just send you a happy birthday tweet via Twitter.  Add structure to your life, a tangible schedule that you can track your progress on, and work towards building up skills that will lead you towards a career that you not only like, but that you personally find meaningful.  Perhaps consider dating, and if you find the right person, attaining fulfillment through getting married and starting a family.  But for those of you watching who are Christian, or who are simply curious to listen, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I believe our society's abandonment of God is the primary reason for its decay.  Before I get to the end portion of this video, I'd like to first quickly turn your attention to a very interesting clip by Yuri Bezmenov, a former KGB informant who eventually defected to Canada, because in it he talks about the fate of civilizations that made the choice to abandon religion. A Soviet scientist, Shafarevich, who has nothing to do with religion, is a computer scientist, did a very intensive research on the history of socialist countries.  He calls socialist or communist any country with a centralized economy and a pyramidal style of power structure.  And he discovered.  Actually, he didn't discover it, he just brought to attention of his readers.  That civilizations like Mohenjo-daro in the river Hindu's area, like Egypt, like Maya, Incas, like Babylonian culture, collapsed and disappeared from the surface of Earth.  The moment they lost religion, As simple as that.  They disintegrated.  Nobody remembers about them anymore.  Well, distant.  The ideas are moving society and keeping mankind as a society of human beings, intelligent, moral agents of God.  The facts, the truth, the exact knowledge may not.  All the sophisticated technology and computers will not prevent society from disintegrating and eventually dying out.  Have you ever met a person who would sacrifice his life, freedom, for the truth like that?  This is truth.  I never met a person who said, this is truth and I'm ready to shoot me.  To defend the truth. Right?  Right? But millions sacrificed their life, freedom, comfort, everything for things like God.  Like Jesus Christ. It's an honor. Some martyrs in the Soviet concentration camp died.  And they died in peace.  Unlike those who shouted, long live Stalin, knowing perfectly well that he may not live long.  Something which is not material moves society and helps it to survive.  And the other way around, the moment we turn into two by two is four and make it a guiding principle of our life, our existence, we die.  Even though this is true and this we cannot prove.  We only can feel and have faith in it. Having watched this clip, it becomes all the more worrisome to learn that today, only 38% of Brits identify as Christian, the lowest proportion in the poll's history.  And on average, 69% of US adults were members of a church in 1998 to 2000, compared with 52% in 2016 to 2018.  For me, and for many others, there would be little to absolutely no purpose to our lives without God.  Knowing God is real brings a moral framework to our lives.  It gives meaning to our actions and it presents each and every new day as an opportunity for merit.  As it is for those who don't believe in God, happiness is for us, of course, a wonderful and desirable thing, but it's dangerous to make it the primary goal in our lives because seeking happiness can often devolve into being self-serving and strictly seeking personal pleasure.  There's a genuine purpose, and believe it or not, often even a genuine joy in serving God.  In fact, a recent study by Pew Research Center compared the lives of religious people and non-religious people by analyzing survey data from more than two dozen countries including the United States, Mexico, and Australia, and found that religiously active people are typically happier and more civically engaged.  Researchers found that more than one-third of actively religious adults in the U.S.  describe themselves as very happy.  And in 12 of the countries analyzed, those active in religious congregations were found to be happier by a statistically significant margin than those who are unaffiliated with religion.  That said, nowadays in particular, with how degenerate and frankly anti-God our society has become, it's certainly not easy to be a Christian.  Despite the studies saying that religious people are on average happier than non-religious people, it definitely doesn't mean that our lives are all rainbows and butterflies.  But if happiness doesn't come to us in this life in the way that we might personally want it to, ultimately we are comforted by the knowledge that if we trust in God and remain faithful to him, happiness will come to us in the next.

I've seen a few conservative pundits say that Trudeau is clearly not a racist.  He's the most progressive prime minister in history.  I've never seen proof of his racism.  just as love for immigrants, and the right needs to stop using the left's cancel culture and stop the insanity.  Um, excuse me?  Speak for yourself.  Let me remind you, we are in a war with these people.  They are the enemy.  Trudeau and his progressive agenda that is killing jobs, killing pipelines, Flooding our country with insane levels of immigration, giving billions of our tax dollars to the third world, and shoving non-stop social justice garbage down our throats is not a guy I feel inclined to stick up for in a moment of weakness.  There will be no coming together with people that believe in Trudeau's vision, let alone the guy implementing it.  Trudeau has expressed his disdain at average Canadians on several occasions.  Why would I give this guy the benefit of the doubt?  Do you think for a second if Shearer or Bernier were caught in blackface one time, let alone three or possibly more, that Trudeau, his party, and his devout cult-like followers would say, let's think of the other side for a second, or let's take the high road?  Nope.  They wouldn't just be calling for their resignations, but their heads to be chopped off in the public square, committing the ultimate leftist sin of racism.  Leftists want to ruin your life over accusations of racism.  They come after your livelihoods and your family.  Look at what they did to Megyn Kelly in the US when she just briefly mentioned that blackface wasn't that big of a deal.  They fired her despite having to pay her millions to get her out of her contract.  So why would we ever give the Prime Minister, with an election just a few weeks away, a pass for something that's a clear violation of leftist law?  Hey, I didn't write the rules, but it's time for Trudeau to die on his progressive sword.  I will make it clear, I don't care about blackface.  At all.  But that's irrelevant to the situation.  What I care about is the blatant hypocrisy of Trudeau.  You're not allowed to be the progressive king, morally preaching, virtue signaling, and sneering at regular Canadians, including insinuating they're racist, and then get caught in blackface.  I don't care how long ago it was.  He was 29.  If you're gonna act like an elitist goof, preaching about how great you are, you better be squeaky clean.  And we all know how Trudeau weaponizes words.  He called Andrew Scheer a white supremacist earlier this year because he was in the same vicinity as Faith Goldie at a yellow vest protest in Ottawa.  This coming from a prime minister who wears blackface.  He grew up in a wealthy white neighborhood with white parents, went to white schools, married a white woman, and had white kids.  Sorry dude, but playing by the left's rules, it's you Trudeau who is the white supremacist.  The reason I tell people to never back off of attacking Trudeau is also because this guy will stop at nothing to blame regular Canadians for his mistakes.  He's a total narcissist who projects bad behavior onto others.  Case in point.  At a recent presser, Trudeau connected his blackface scandal to Canada's issues with systemic racism.  Listen to what he says. I think we all need to recognize that even in an incredible country like Canada, there's still a lot of more work to do.  People are still facing discrimination and marginalization every single day.  Anti-black racism, unconscious bias, systemic discrimination, they still exist.  Systemic discrimination still exists. What do you mean we all need to recognize?  Um, we didn't get caught wearing blackface, Trudeau.  You did.  This sounds an awful lot like that time he told us Canadians we needed to do better.  when it was discovered he had groped a female reporter.  Oh yes, our feminist in chief PM is also a pervert.  Who do you think he's accusing when he says Canadians are guilty of anti-black racism, unconscious bias, systemic discrimination, and the like?  That would be white Canadians.  So once again, he's accusing white Canadians of horrible things, including the charge of racism.  So let's get this straight.  The leader of our nation was caught wearing blackface.  He then lied about how many times he wore it.  And then he said he wore blackface so often that he has no idea how many times it was.  All of this, of course, breaks the progressive rules because in their minds, blackface is the worst form of evil racism.  Trudeau then proceeds to blame Canadians, white Canadians, for a slew of racial injustices after he's caught this.  This is why you attack Trudeau ruthlessly.  And remember to vote this motherfucker out in October.","channel.id":"clxmi0lki00dkcdvieic0c63n","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCvQaTpHnhug8g47SDyoAgNw","channel.name":"Jill Colton","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"CA","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJXeomoV0GELjRe8HHLLXbwUVXTrAIcWCVwaZ8yPzQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-05-14T21:25:38.000Z","summary":"The speaker is angry about conservative pundits defending Justin Trudeau after he was caught in blackface.

Hello, beautiful people.  I am Oliver Perrin for Semiagogue, and I'm here to tell you that we are at war.  Right now.  At this moment.  Many of you might think you know what I'm talking about.  Sadly, all but a few of you are wrong.  Because to understand the war I'm talking about, we all need to think in new ways.  We need to open our eyes and minds to an entirely different definition of warfare.  Think of it as warfare without borders.  Think of it as unrestricted warfare.  And the dimension of it that should concern us, that does concern us, is anything and everything but the violent aspect of the war.  Bear with me and I'll try to explain what I mean by this.  Doubtless, you've noticed that every aspect of life is now crawling with new rules related to what we're always supposed to do and what we're never, ever supposed to do.  This signals the introduction of pressure, the imposition of force upon each of us individually and upon each of our respective nations.  Total war is upon us.  Listen to the heads that talk.  Listen to the words that issue from the orifices.  Gaze upon the blazing screens.  See the sneers.  Hear the obscenely backhanded sneaky doublespeak.  Recognize what you see before you.  the cleaving and splintering of all of our institutions, addiction to paralyzing critical self-evaluation raised to the level of a masochistic fetish.  We are all learning.  There's a point at which our endless cultural vivisection can't help but become an autopsy.  We're encouraged to doubt ourselves.  We're encouraged not to have children.  We're told that the world is literally about to end.  I mean, we're literally being told that the world is about to end.  Children are being told this too, subverting and crippling entire generational cohorts within our nations.  And children are being mobilized to shame us, as well as the always fashionable armies of beggars.  But the opponents especially like to go after borders.  They seek to erase all borders, and when borders go, order goes, along with hierarchy, property, and territory, qualities recognized to some extent by most animal life on Earth.  But they think we're different, that we can be engineered into something without borders, without distinctions, without excellence.  Look at the borders that have already disappeared.  The border between man and woman, the border between non-sexual child and sexual adult, the border between genders, between singular and plural, him and her, they and them, between just and unjust, between right and wrong.  But for our purposes, we're going to look more closely at the border between war and peace, and why we have to realize that it too has disappeared.  In our Western cultures, we've long separated the domain of war from the domain of peace.  In peacetime, we privilege the individual.  We enjoy the protection of civil law.  The emphasis is upon personal rights.  In wartime, we're concerned with the collective.  When faced with emergency circumstances, we establish martial law, at which point we all agree there's no more room for special law.  snowflakes.  Everyone wears a uniform, and if you refuse to march forward into battle in order to do so, your commanding officer can shoot you on the spot.  Now, we did this for a reason.  This cultural strategy enables us to make the most of focusing on the individual while still keeping the old system in reserve.  The crisis system, the military system, is a kind of parallel form of social organization that's always available if shit goes sideways.  Break glass in case of fire.  But we don't declare war anymore.  We no longer pull the alarms.  Anyone else notice that?  We've had any number of wars now that have never been declared by Congress.  These days, there's no official marking of the transition, but that's just one aspect of removing borders.  It goes further than erasing the borders associated with formal recognition of the state of war or the state of peace.  Our kindly new forms of warfare are going on at all times, in all places, at all levels of society, across whatever demographic categories you care to consider.  While there are no clouds of gun smoke, no rockets' red glare, no trumpets' blare, no bombs bursting in air, still the shudder-shattering waves of progress are blowing everything to hell, leaving not one stone left standing upon another.  It's raining straight up.  But instead of recognizing the fabric is tearing and the seams are splitting all by design, instead of admitting that we can't control our cities and borders, admitting that law no longer rules, we hire more police.  And oddly enough, those police begin to be armed more and more like soldiers.  Our circumstances come to feel more and more like an occupation.  But we, ourselves, are the only enemy that's been identified.  We're told we ourselves are the ones to blame for the steady stream of abuse spewed at us by most of Hollywood, the Academy, the media, and the rest of the everlasting gobslovers of hate incorporated.  The distinction between state of war and state of peace has been erased.  Or to put it more simply, we're in a state of war, but the machinations of our opponents have suppressed all the signals, all the discourse that would come with openly declaring what we all know to be true, which is that we are under attack.  The most important thing to realize, the critical thing to become aware of, is that our natural alarm system has had the wires cut.  But the answer isn't to shift over into martial mode.  The answer isn't to try to activate the old system, forcing a shift from civil to martial mechanisms.  And the answer definitely isn't to foment violence.  To do this would be to sacrifice ourselves, yet again, on the altar of false white stereotypes.  Violence at scale is properly the domain of the state, properly the domain of security forces.  As law-abiding citizens, our concern with violence should not extend beyond those circumstances in which self-defense is legally justified, as in the law, as in.  you're a fool if you break it, the kind of fool I want nothing to do with.  So what do we do?  How do we respond to this attack?  Just sitting around and continuing to take it is clearly not an option.  I suggest the answer is to call out the militia, in a manner of speaking, by explicitly spreading the word that we are no longer at peace, spreading the word that each of us bears responsibility for these circumstances, if not for creating them, then at a minimum for continuing to tolerate them.  We cannot take action in the realm of violence, but we can take action, consistent and unrelenting action, in speaking out, in spreading the word, in lawfully organizing and protesting, in ridiculing those who seek to smother our pasts and move under cover of the present to steal our futures.  So set objectives, establish responsibilities, establish milestones, Cooperate.  Meet in real life.  Gather and discuss.  Test and refine arguments.  Work together remotely if you have to.  If we spent half as much time working in groups using online collaborative project software as we do in YouTube chats or humping the inflatable doll known as Twitter, we'd all be a lot more effective.  We have to begin to take organized, non-violent action.  We should recruit lawyers and subject matter experts, raise money, adapt and apply the best of the opponent's strategies.  We should be bold.  We should be cunning.  We should do the unexpected.  And we should always obey the law.  We no longer enjoy the luxury of making war and then going home and returning to normal.  Where is home?  by the way.  We are now at war at all times and in all places.  It never turns off.  It never goes away.  The assaults continue always and everywhere, from our schools and hospitals to our banks and courthouses.  We would be wise to fight for ourselves in everything we do.  We would be wise to mobilize as a kind of global militia, wielding weaponized free speech and unbridled audacity.  cooperating where and when it suits each of us and our respective national interests, because the goal is to win.","channel.id":"clxmi0pq4039jcdvitknoygfi","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCck4tqn4wHb3jDhUn9dDVMg","channel.name":"Semiogogue","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVfwhTXXqLV2j-L-39VHmNFaBlVgqfyqgDOuvRjCA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Hello, beautiful people.

For more information on the subject of the socio-sexual hierarchy, check out his bestselling book SJWS ALWAYS DOUBLE DOWN: https:\/\/arkhavencomics.com\/product\/sjws-always-double-down-audiobook\/","publish_date":"2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":["SSH","Socio-Sexual Hierarchy","social status","alpha","beta","gamma","delta","omega"],"length":1018,"views":70466,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Q-_QyhYfReQ\/sddefault.jpg","yt_channel_id":"UCutpp9X6rKErxUkv4wKBRPA","transcripts":"Welcome to Voxiversity.  I'm Vox Day.  And today we're going to talk more about the social-sexual hierarchy that I introduced in a previous Voxiversity.  The primary ranks from top to bottom are Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Omega.  Now, it's important to keep in mind that these are just names.  They're just signifiers.  They don't mean anything in and of themselves.  The alpha is the highest social sexual rank.  And like every other rank, it is at its core a pattern of behavior.  And these patterns of behavior are not only significant, they're extremely useful.  Because in addition to allowing us to identify ourselves and others and where we rank in comparison to them in terms of status and other things.  It also allows us to better understand and anticipate their behavior.  This is something that a lot of people get sidetracked on.  is the status issue.  I'm not saying that the status isn't relevant.  Obviously, it's something that we all naturally learn to care about when we're young and it obviously has a tremendous impact on our lives whether we're talking about our romantic lives or we're talking about our professional lives or even just something as simple as our place in a sports team or a casual organization.  but the more important aspect is the patterns.  It's much more useful to know what the person who is the top dog in the group is going to do or understand how he's going to react to your behavior or someone else's behavior.  because understanding these patterns and anticipating these patterns means that we're able to utilize them either to our benefit or at least to avoid falling into obvious traps to our detriment.  So let's look at the alpha.  What are the characteristics of the alpha?  We've already said we know by definition that we're talking about someone who is at a high level of social sexual status.  So this means the alpha is someone that other men want to be like and other men want to be around and he's someone that women want to be with.  He's someone to whom women are naturally attracted.  And so alphas tend to be physically larger than the norm.  They tend to be more handsome than the norm.  They're often more physically fit.  They tend to mature at an earlier age.  It can be kind of remarkable sometimes.  I was young for my class year, and so I remember being astounded when I was in junior high, just the physical size of some of these guys who were more or less my age.  Some of them were shaving and had full mustaches by ninth grade.  And so these early development advantages have a tendency to percolate into the individual's mindset.  You probably know about the concept of the glory days, the football hero who has never really gotten over the fact that he was a football star.  or the pretty girl who still thinks that she's a pretty girl and acts like it even though she's 40 pounds overweight.  In the same way, there's also the negative version of that.  Sometimes it's hard for people who have been social rejects and who have been on the low end of the totem pole.  It's sometimes hard for them to adjust when in adulthood they become successful and popular.  And so the mindset that is often created in these boys with developmental advantages often has a tendency to translate itself into some of the alpha behavioral characteristics as they get older.  So alphas tend to be very confident.  They tend to be prone to an amount of blustering and posturing.  they tend to behave in a manner that is very extroverted, and it often strikes more introverted people as being somewhat buffoonish.  And if you're starting to get a picture here of someone, yes, President Donald Trump is without question an alpha.  It's also very common of alphas that they are not very faithful to their wives or to their girlfriends.  They have a tendency to be involved with multiple women at the same time.  And they also have an ability to be allowed to do that by the women they're betraying.  And this of course often tends to outrage lower status men who can't understand why women put up with this.  but that's one of the benefits of status.  What are some of the other characteristics of alphas?  They tend to be conflict seeking.  They tend to be drawn to group activities.  They are very, very hierarchical and they're very conscious of hierarchy and they're also conscious of their own place in the hierarchy.  It's often very interesting when two alphas meet because the first thing that they immediately do is size up which of them has superior status.  They don't actually tend to engage in much conflict, direct or indirect, once they have satisfied their need to determine who is the top dog and who is the second banana.  Now, alphas are not betas.  They're not content or happy to be a second banana.  They don't seek that position.  But when they do have to deal with each other, they usually tend to get along pretty well as long as it's very clear which one of them has the superior status.  Where you run into problems with alphas is when you have two of them that are of fundamentally the same status and it's not easy for them to resolve it quickly.  Other issues that you have with alphas, especially in the business world, is that they don't tend to create succession plans very well.  Whenever you have an alpha, they usually do best when they're teamed up with a beta.  The problem is that the beta is almost never capable of actually fulfilling the alpha's role.  And so you see situations like we see with Apple now happening all the time.  You had an obvious alpha, Steve Jobs, but when he was replaced by Tim Cook, who is not an alpha, Apple suddenly lost those unique elements that Steve Jobs brought to his position.  Alphas provide vision.  They provide leadership.  They don't necessarily do the direct work themselves, but they inspire others to do it.  That's what's always important to understand, is that any organization, any group, needs a leader in order to be effective.  And alphas, above everything, are effective leaders.  So when you're looking at your group, when you're trying to decide who should be in charge, it's a mistake to focus on who happens to have been there longest, or who happens to know the most, or who happens to be the smartest.  What you're well advised to do is to determine who has the most alpha characteristics in the group, and that will probably give your group the best chance of success.  Now, a lot of people are envious of alphas because it does come with a lot of perquisites.  But it's important to remember that despite the best efforts of pickup artists to tell you how to simulate alpha activity, how to fake it until you make it, and all that sort of thing, all of their techniques are primarily focused on the sexual aspect.  And that's not going to do you any good on the social side.  Now, don't get me wrong.  If you're successful in attracting very attractive women, that is going to increase your social status.  That's true.  But it's not going to change your behavioral patterns.  It's not going to change your internal attitudes.  It's not going to change the way that you interact with others.  And one of the most important things to understand about alphas is that they feel great loyalty to those who follow them.  This is something that gammas in particular find difficult to understand or accept.  The hierarchy requires mutual loyalty from below to above and from above to below.  And so that's why you'll see people turning to their Alpha and bringing him their problems.  A good example of this is from the movie The Godfather.  In The Godfather, you see all these different men coming to The Godfather, telling him of their problems in the expectation that he's going to help them resolve them.  And he does, because that's the price of his status.  The Godfather would not maintain his high status, he would not maintain his Alpha status in the group, if he were to simply ignore them, if he were to simply do what he wanted, rather than pay attention to the needs of his subordinates.  And so this is a seldom understood aspect of Alpha, And it's why many non-alphas like myself actively resist attempts to pull us, or more often push us, into positions of leadership.  Because we don't want that burden of responsibility.  And it is a burden, and it is a responsibility.  Now that doesn't mean that all alphas are particularly good about this.  You can be good at fulfilling a role or you can be bad at fulfilling a role, but the expected role remains the same.  And so if you are someone who is hoping to increase your status, you need to understand that part and parcel of that is accepting the responsibility of the good of others.  Now, if you're looking at the sexual side, you may say, well, what is the connection between the social side and the sexual side?  I mean, yes, we know that women like good-looking men.  We know that women like successful men.  And we know that women like confident men.  Does all of that go into making an alpha?  Well, it can.  But again, if you have enough of one element, that may be sufficient in that particular arena.  If you are massively confident to the point of seeming overconfidence, then that may compensate for a lack of height, a lack of looks, a lack of hair, a lack of wealth, but it is a necessary component of it.  In fact, I would argue that of all the various aspects of alpha, a genuine overconfidence is probably the most important aspect.  Now there are also unattractive aspects to alpha beyond the previously mentioned unfaithfulness.  One thing that tends to strike some non-alphas as being borderline ridiculous is the way that alphas tend to come off as almost paranoid to relatively high status men.  I'll give you a story of one alpha that I encountered and it was rather amusing.  He was the CEO of my father's company and one day I came into his office and even though I didn't work for the company, even though I had no interest in working for the company, because he was a big paranoid alpha, he tended to view me as a potential challenge.  Now, I thought this was ridiculous, but it was very clear from his interactions with me that he was always vaguely suspicious.  What's this guy up to?  Is he potentially going to undermine me in some way?  And he was a big, powerful guy.  I mean, we're talking about maybe 6'2\", 260, 270, a big guy.  And I went into his office and he was sitting behind his desk and there's a chair on the other side of his desk.  So I sat in it as you do.  And he actually got up out of the desk, walked around it and was standing there literally looming over me because he wanted to communicate that he was in charge.  Now he was in charge.  I was not challenging him in any capacity, but that's how alphas tend to react to people that they feel might have an ability to challenge them.  And the advantage of knowing these things is, for example, when I'm on my soccer team and I detect the captain getting a bit disgruntled because I've said something, I know that it's because it's his alpha paranoia talking.  He's concerned, because I came up with a good idea, he is concerned that this will somehow undermine his position.  And so what I do is as soon as I detect that there is any of that sort of paranoia at work, I do something to make it clear that I'm deferring to him, to make it clear that I'm not challenging his authority in any way.  And that invariably solves the problem very quickly.  And this is something that you might have to do from time to time if you're a competent individual.  because you never know what's going to set off an alpha.  Another thing that you need to be cautious of is if you are involved with a highly attractive woman, the alphas around you are almost invariably going to try to hit on her.  They will probably do it in a, oh, just joking, just making jokes, but they will do it.  And so you need to be prepared for that and decide ahead of time how you want to handle it.  The key thing is to generally make it clear that this sort of behavior is not acceptable, but to do so in a manner that doesn't somehow publicly humiliate them.  because you need to be very careful about challenging or much less humiliating an alpha.  They can take it in a one-to-one setting, but if it's in a public setting, it doesn't go well because they feel the need to maintain their status.  And alphas are physically violent in a way that most men are not.  usually quite willing to try to defend their status with their fists.  And this can be shocking, especially to Gammas who are direct conflict avoidant when they engage in a passive-aggressive attack that the Alpha sees correctly as a challenge and then deals with the challenge directly.  You know, it's not easy being an Alpha, and I'm not an Alpha.  I'm simply saying that from my observations of them.  They have to be on all the time.  And they're constantly concerned about where they stand vis-a-vis the other alphas.  Because remember, these social-sexual hierarchies are fractal.  And so who is an alpha in one situation is not going to be the alpha in a different situation.  You might be the alpha of your high school football team But by the time that you get to the NCAA, you're just a guy.  And this is something that a lot of alphas have some difficulty adjusting to initially.  But like I said, because they're so hierarchical, they're usually able to fall in line relatively easily.  And when they get back to their smaller hierarchy, they will slip into their old role quite happily and usually with a fair amount of success.  So that's the alpha.  And next time we're going to talk about the most interesting of the ranks in the socio-sexual hierarchy, which is, of course, the gamma.  This is Voxversity.

In his writings and speeches, Cicero spoke of the dangers of populism and of the nature of Caesar's arrogance, which would contribute to the demise of the Republic.  He wrote, He wasted all the power of his intellect, and in him it was the highest, in pandering to popular humors.  Thus, having no regard to the Senate and to good men, he opened for himself that path to the extension of his power, which the manly spirit of a free people could not endure.  Cicero was acutely aware that a free people with a robust sense of justice would resent the creeping intrusion of totalitarianism.  How was he rewarded for his warnings, his literary prowess, and gifts to the culture?  His head and hand were hacked off and displayed prominently in Rome.  I don't want to sound like I'm comparing YouTubers and modern political pundits to some of the world's greatest thinkers.  The point I'm trying to make is that throughout history, and especially in times of cultural collapse, there has been a grave price associated with prescience.  The price used to be much higher.  You would be executed, perhaps your entire family as well, or spend your life in a forced labor camp or a cell.  There's a fair amount of persecution going on right now.  And although imprisonment is becoming a more prominent aspect of the left's reaction to the culture war, their tactics are still primarily limited to character assassination and attacking one's income stream.  Generally, in this day and age, we aren't going to get killed, at least not yet, just severely ostracized, otherized and exiled from marketplaces, virtual and otherwise.  This is exactly what is happening with Martin Sellner.  He has been raided multiple times with beyond flimsy cause.  Of course, the real cause is being an effective European nationalist.  Generation identity is dangerous.  because it is filled with clean-cut, well-spoken nationalists who use visual, very persuasive tactics to make obvious points about the degradation of European cultures.  The New Zealand shooter made a relatively sizable donation to Martin over a year ago, If you haven't seen my video about Christchurch and the shooter's motivations and intent, it's linked below.  But I believe that Tarrant had this plan in the works for many years.  I think he even stated so in his manifesto.  And this donation was an aspect of his attempt to hasten the culture war and to precipitate civil unrest in all Western nations.  He was able to rely on the predictability of the legacy media, of leftist governments, of overreaching Western politicians to do his bidding.  after his murders set everything in motion.  And they did not disappoint.  He wanted gun ownership to be restricted to cause conflict between pro and anti-gun communities in Western countries.  He wanted PewDiePie to be blamed by the mainstream media so the culture war would escalate.  He wanted Candace Owens to be slandered to ensnare the Black community in this culture war.  And I firmly believe he wanted to cause waves in Europe as well.  He found a way to hit basically every Western nation.  Generation identity is well-respected and nonviolent.  They discuss issues like migration that plague Europe and cause massive problems to have manifested even in small towns.  The price of mass migration is now plain to see, completely visible for virtually all Europeans.  As such, groups like Generation Identity can no longer be ignored or painted as part of the lunatic fringe.  Frankly, they've grown to be beloved by Europeans that feel trapped by the EU and are forced to bear witness to the destruction of their cultures.  By making a sizable donation to Martin, Tarrant knew that the media would pick up on this and claim that they were associated, which is patently absurd.  I shouldn't have to say this, but Martin clearly has no association with Tarrant or the shooting.  The media coverage on this has been appalling and nothing short of slanderous.  Is there an Austrian link to the New Zealand mosque attacks?  The suspect visited Austria from November 27th to December 4th last year.  Potential links to Austrian extremists were being looked into.  Police have searched the house of the charismatic, social media savvy leader Martin Sellner, who has done much to raise the profile of the identitarians throughout Europe.  The group is hostile to multiculturalism and claims to defend Europe against migrants, especially Muslims.  The implication here is obviously that Tarrant went to Austria to meet with Martin, who they paint like a psychopath.  I shouldn't have to say this either, but this obviously never happened.  The author doesn't outright make this claim, surely because of the fear of a lawsuit.  Later in the article, the author draws all sorts of parallels that are even more vague, suggesting that a shared interest in Austrian history further connects them.  It's absurd.  The fact of the matter is that receiving a donation does not a connection make.  As YouTubers, we get donations very often, anonymous donations, all the time.  We accept the donations gratefully and say thank you, and we never seek any information about the donor, and doing so would be insane and impossible.  We almost never know anything about the donors.  The media, once again, are playing right into Taryn's hands with their treatment of Martin.  Further, they're showing others of an accelerationist mindset that these tactics are very effective and that targets can be implicated in vague ways, such as a mere donation.  BBC and all of the outlets engaged in the slander are not only vindicating Tarrant, but they're increasing the likelihood of a future similar event.  I think they know this, but their thirst to destroy nationalists outweighs any concern that they may have about future slaughters.  If you're vocal about issues facing our countries, about civilizational decline and the causes about preserving Western cultures, you run the risk of losing your ability to move freely in society, to have a normal job, to have a good reputation.  In cases like Martin's, you run the risk of being blamed internationally for a horrific crime of which you clearly had no part.  So I guess the question is, should we do the right thing?  Should we pay a great personal expense, allow ourselves to be vilified, likely for our entire lives?  never experiencing vindication.  Minds greater than ours didn't prevent the fall of Rome.  Nobody really wants to hear the truth because there are so many creature comforts, even for the poorest amongst us, so much elaborate distraction to take us away from our lives.  Bread and circuses, bread and circuses.  In times like these, when people are so resistant to seeing the truth of our cultural decline, recognizing the insidious mission of our leftist overlords, from our perspective, things seem really bleak.  But we have no idea how many people have woken up if they aren't being vocal.  The situation could be far more promising than it appears.  And that's the nature of seeing these truths.  You can't for a while.  Then you won't.  But then you do.  And once you do, the world looks different.  You evaluate situations more carefully, more skeptically.  And there's no going back to your slumber.  It's a heinous realization, but it does give me some solace that there are likely tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of conscious, aware, but strategically silent people.  I understand the reticence involved with speaking truths at great personal expense.  I don't harbor resentments for your average individual with dependents and a normal job that is aware of the situation but doesn't blow up their life to vocalize these issues.  We all have duties to family and personal responsibility that must be observed.  Yet it must be done and somebody has to do it.  And the more people that do, the safer the rest of us are and the greater the likelihood that we miraculously come out of this nosedive, but more likely, effectively brace ourselves for a softer landing.  I've decided that the solution is for each and every one of us to push the conversation as far as we possibly can in our own lives without blowing everything up.  People like Martin and Britney are so important because they've already accepted this grave personal risk and have the perspective and the resilience to weather the kind of pressure that being blatantly lied about by the world media creates.  Generation Identity is in danger of being branded a terrorist organization, and I'm sure that they and Martin need your support now more than ever.  Martin has been banned from private banks from virtually every donation service.  The left wants him to be immobilized and defeated by drying up his income source.  We cannot let this happen.  At this point in time, he can only receive donations through his private bank.  I've added his donation link and that of Generation Identity in the description below.  A few years ago in a video, I said that we were going to face an ever-escalating, panicked series of reactions from the left as a response to various externalities, things like terrorist attacks or corruption being laid bare,  etc.,  etc.  That's definitely what's been happening and the leftist response to Christchurch has solidified this wounded animal style of response.  Their reactions are awakening people and in turn, awakening the masses is causing the left to lash out more erratically.  Largely, the war of ideas has been lost, which explains the leftist crackdowns.  There are a few notable things that some independently may seem trivial in the cultural climate, but have compounded severe distrust for the media, for the government, and have further sowed the seeds of unrest.  First, this college bribery scandal.  We all knew this was happening, but it has been an absolute death blow for academic influence, which is the primary mechanism of Marxist indoctrination of the youth.  Now your average American can see that these institutions, their birthright, have been completely hijacked by the leftist elite.  A college degree, even from the most prestigious institutions in America, doesn't mean shit anymore.  Since student loan debt is at an all-time high in the coming years, I think we can expect the complete collapse of academia.  Other news in American hypocrisy is the Jussie Smollett saga, where a gay black actor can orchestrate a massive hoax hate incident, waste a tremendous amount of essential resources, then be released with virtually no consequences because of his connections.  This one is particularly damaging to the left because it destroys multiple victim narratives.  It shows that no combination of minority status is truly discriminated against in the United States, that racism here is not really an issue, and must be manufactured.  Further, it shows preferential treatment for those with such statuses who, like very rich white leftists, enjoy the very same freedom to avoid prosecution, irrespective of the crime, if they line the right pockets.  Exposing a tiered justice system is extremely dangerous for the elite.  In terms of the media, they were already facing unprecedented levels of public skepticism towards their claims.  They totally played into the New Zealand shooter's hands, which is obvious to your average Westerner.  As I mentioned, it also exposes that the media cares far less about preventing future mass murders than about using every available opportunity to slander nationalists.  In Europe, Article 11 and 13 will have crippling effects on alternative media sources.  Dave Colon has made a number of videos about this that I've linked below.  This is from Zero Hedge.  The corporate oligarchs are in fear for their projects.  They want desperately to maintain control.  They've worked for decades to evolve the nation-state into the new, shiny transnational super-state the EU exemplifies.  The new copyright directive is designed to erect barriers to entry and shut down opposition speech by outsourcing the enforcement to the platforms hosting the material.  And to top off this international crackdown on information flow, we have book bannings.  Roosh, Jared Taylor, Kevin MacDonald have had books banned from Amazon, which has a near monopoly on internet book sales.  Meanwhile, all sorts of antifa and instructional jihadist material still remains.  What we're seeing is the simultaneous destruction of our once-trusted institutions as they desperately try to control the narrative using censorship, corrupt government processes, and the remaining scraps of public trust in the failing mainstream media in order to try to tamp down the civil unrest that is boiling over in the West.  Becca Lewis, notorious for her obsessive take on alternative media, tweeted this amidst the coverage of Martin Sellner.  This is why it's not just guilt by association to call out people for having such friendly chats with these guests.  By giving it a platform, the hosts explicitly amplify and normalize bigoted rhetoric, and they make money in the process.  To people like Becca Lewis and other stooges of Soros desperate to create six degrees of separation between everyone on the right and Hitler, to those who try to destroy our personal lives our income streams our reputations there is no stopping this and based on your desperate behavior i think you know this even if you do us in as individuals it's just like playing whack-a-mole in perpetuity and every time you do it successfully you just awaken someone younger someone stronger someone smarter.  it's futile And I think most importantly, you can't stop us from experiencing the beauty of life.  Brittany and Martin are clearly happy people that have each other.  They have millions of supporters.  They have a strong network of friends and family.  They're free in their hearts and minds, no matter how they're persecuted.  And you will pay not only for your lack of courage in this time of cultural upheaval, but for actively working against those that were trying to prevent violence on a mass scale in the West.  You'll be viewed by history, if you're even remembered, as a malevolent influence being used by corrupt institutions to do their globalist bidding.  I never know how to end my more serious videos, so I'll just say thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.

There's a whole other component of this story, which is all of the nonsense that Dr.  Milliman had to go through for trying to study right-wing ideas on a university campus. In fact, often I had students from China tell me that they weren't expecting this level of propaganda in a Canadian classroom.  I mean, that happened easily three out of the five years in an introduction to political science class. In university, you get exposed to some of the craziest, most outrageous ideas.  Of course there's communism, radical feminism, anti-white identity politics, Islamism, studies of taboo sexualities like necrophilia, bestiality, pedophilia, incest.  Ideas which are far outside of societal norms and standards.  But that's not a bad thing.  Exposure to shocking and outrageous ideas that were far outside of my worldview taught me one of the most valuable and empowering lessons, which is simply the idea that it's okay to study things that you disagree with.  that we can tolerate views that we don't like, that we can separate our personal politics from our subjects of inquiry, and that we can engage with ideas without endorsing or legitimizing them.  But while university did expose me to a universe of ideas that I once thought were unthinkable, university students do not get exposed to all kinds of ideas. If I ask you to name, let's say, three or four or five leftist thinkers, most students, I think, could do so, okay?  They'd say maybe Derrida, Foucault, Zizek, assuming they care about theory, right?  If you were to ask them to name a couple of liberal thinkers, maybe, you know, Mill, Hayek, or something like that.  Now, if you were to ask them, name a couple of outstanding right-wing thinkers, I believe they would be at a total loss. Dr.  Michael Millerman is a political theorist who recently received his PhD from the University of Toronto.  He did his doctoral dissertation on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and how Heidegger's thought has influenced a spectrum of political thinkers from the political right to the left.  Dr.  Millerman's experience in the university gives us a fascinating insight into how political ideas are taught or not taught on our university campuses. A student today can easily encounter basically liberal ideas in a department of political science or anywhere else.  They can also be exposed to the leftist critique of liberal ideas.  Sometimes there are entire programs that stem from leftist critique of liberalism ideologically, built into their foundation.  Grievance studies are largely leftist critique of liberalism axiomatically.  Well, if we now look to see is right-wing anti-liberalism represented anywhere, in an intellectually sound manner.  In other words, we study liberal theorists, not just liberal ideas.  You can actually be exposed to the axioms and ideas of liberalism.  And you'll study Marx in a first-year political science class.  You probably did.  And not only Marx, but Marxists and neo-Marxists and postmodern thinkers.  So there's a theoretical basis or foundation.  And that's good.  There should be, in my view.  But, by the same token, there should be an acknowledgement of right-wing anti-liberalism as a rich theoretical tradition. The fact is that while students do get exposed to a range of extreme and radical ideas, those ideas are limited, almost exclusively, to ideas of the political left. Professors and educators who don't take right-wing anti-liberalism seriously will produce much more of the problem that they're trying to avoid.  That is a guarantee.  They don't know, these teachers, that they're shooting themselves in the foot.  And the fact that they don't know it tells you the limitation of their own education.  And it tells you the limitation of what can be expected from them as educators.  The liberal professors who think they can chase right-wing students out the door with a pitchfork, they don't know what's coming to them. There is a huge gap missing in the political spectrum that's taught at the university.  But I did have students over the last five years come to me from time to time after class and they would tell me that they are unhappy that their professors propagandize in the classroom.  That happened pretty often actually.  And students came to me often and said, this class is missing something or why are they mocking Fox and Trump and Republicans?  And why is this professor only telling us about how stupid conservatives are, not how stupid liberals or leftists are?  In fact, often I had students from China tell me that they weren't expecting this level of propaganda in a Canadian classroom.  I mean, that happened easily three out of the five years, okay, in an introduction to political science class. As an undergrad, I always thought that I guess we don't study right-wing ideas because there aren't right-wing ideas.  I guess that right-wingers are just dumb and that when it comes to right-wing ideologies, there's just not much there to study.  But according to Dr.  Ronald Biener, a political science professor who recently wrote a book about the resurgence of the far-right, that idea is totally wrong.  Even today, it's a revelation for me to have it framed this way, but according to Dr.  Biener, not only is it the case that far-right thinkers made a significant contribution to modern political and philosophical thought, not only was their contribution very influential, But far-right fascist thinkers were actually the most influential and the most significant thinkers of the 20th century.  His book is called Dangerous Minds, Nietzsche, Heidegger.  and the return of the far right.  You probably know Nietzsche and Heidegger, but you might not have thought of them as right-wingers.  That's because, according to Dr.  Biener, there has been a conscious effort to reshape the narrative about Nietzsche and Heidegger and to appropriate them in the service of leftist politics.  Dr.  Milliman's thesis was on exactly this topic, how different theorists, including left-wing thinkers, have been influenced by the right-wing thought of Martin Heidegger. So Nietzsche, like Heidegger, in postmodern circles, they were both fully appropriated by leftist political theorists, sometimes strategically as a weapon of war, because some concepts in Nietzsche and Heidegger can be deployed in the service of leftist political aims rather effectively.  But it is true that Heidegger and Nietzsche can be, and Schmidt, Carl Schmidt is somebody else, that democratic political theorist.  I mean, Carl Schmidt was a Nazi thinker on the right.  His books are well worth reading.  He's a very smart man, but the fact remains he was a Nazi thinker on the right whose ideas were very influential on the left.  So these leftist thinkers, they are not blind or stupid.  They're aware of the existence of right-wing thinkers.  But because they stand opposed to the right and they don't want to give it oxygen, they pick and choose certain ideas, certain concepts, certain arguments that may be helpful for their cause.  They're very good at doing that. So if right-wing thinkers were as significant and influential as they were, not just on the right, not just on the left, but across the spectrum of political thought, and since we already study so many extremist and radical left-wing ideas, and since we do so under the assumption that we are capable of separating inquiry from legitimization or endorsement, then why don't we study right-wing ideas again?  A common theme in conservative media is the idea that the indoctrination that students are receiving in university is going to transform them into leftist radicals.  But contrary to the conservative narrative, it's often the opposite that happens.  For those students who perceive that their leftist professors are not telling them the full truth or that ideas are being pushed on them, rather than turning them into leftist radicals, the university experience can actually ferment a distrust and resentment for the far left.  And while a leftist indoctrination might not successfully instill leftist political positions, what it definitely does instill is an open mind and a cognitive tolerance for the study of radical ideas.  This is the central theme of Dr.  Biner's book on the return of the far right.  The idea that through exposure to the radical right-wing ideas of thinkers like Nietzsche and Heidegger, that students will be swayed to right-wing positions like white nationalism.  for myself, my education in those issues, of right-wing thought did not come from the university, I went to go find it on my own.  And my education in right-wing ideas came from right-wing websites, alt-right, white nationalist websites.  And I would think that if professors are concerned about the effect that these ideas might have on people, that they would want to be the ones to introduce and perhaps control the teaching of those ideas to make sure that they're not perhaps twisted.  Absolutely. It is a remarkable shortcoming. So I contacted Dr.  Biener to see if he'd be willing to meet for an interview, but he declined.  His reason for declining was that the discussion of these ideas has political implications and that to engage with an idea like white nationalism would be helping to legitimize it.  To engage with an idea is to legitimize it. You have liberal orthodoxy, basically, a liberal hegemony in terms of most disciplines.  In some programs and in some schools, you have the attack from the left.  And nowhere do you have adequately represented the tradition on the right.  I thought that once you point that out, everybody should recognize that it's a problem.  But obviously that is not what happened in my case, and it's not what happens generally, because it's not just an accident that there's no right-wing anti-liberalism represented on the spectrum.  It's part of a political project that has tried to delegitimize those thinkers. So why don't we study right-wing ideas in university?  It's not because right-wing ideas are extreme or offensive or radical, because on modern university campuses, extremist, offensive, and radical ideas are the norm.  It's not because right-wingers are dumb or that there isn't much there to study, because in terms of influence and impact, right-wing thinkers like Nietzsche and Heidegger tower over all of us.  And it's not because right-wing ideas have political implications while left-wing ideas do not, because all political ideas have political implications.  The reason we don't study right-wing ideas in university is because our universities are corrupt.  They are staffed by propagandists, pseudo-scholars, and indoctrinators who very consciously use their positions in the universities to oppress or privilege ideas in accordance with their own agendas. I had four faculty members resign from my committee.  It was unbelievable to me that at the University of Toronto Department of Political Science, there could be the unwarranted repression of inquiry into political and philosophical heterodoxy. I didn't even realize this when I first started looking into these two stories, but Dr.  Ronald Biener was actually one of the four supervisors who resigned from Dr.  Millerman's committee.  So in the coming days, we're going to release an extended version of our interview with Dr.  Millerman, where he will tell the full story in his own words.  Also be sure to check out his YouTube channel where he gives university quality lectures on philosophy and politics.

They argue that while students are exposed to extreme and radical left-wing ideas, right-wing anti-liberalism is largely absent from the curriculum. This is despite the significant influence of right-wing thinkers such as Nietzsche and Heidegger on modern thought.\n\nThe speaker cites the example of Dr. Michael Millerman, a political theorist who was forced to navigate a hostile academic environment while studying right-wing ideas. They also reference Dr. Ronald Biener's book \"Dangerous Minds, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the Return of the Far Right,\" which highlights the importance of studying right-wing thought.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the lack of representation of right-wing ideas in university classrooms is not due to a lack of significance or influence, but rather a deliberate attempt to delegitimize right-wing thinkers. They argue that this is part of a broader political project to promote liberal orthodoxy and suppress dissenting views.\n\nThe speaker also notes that the university experience can actually foster a distrust and resentment for the far left, particularly when students perceive that their professors are not presenting a balanced view of the issues. They suggest that exposing students to right-wing ideas in a controlled and nuanced manner could help to promote critical thinking and intellectual tolerance.\n\nUltimately, the speaker argues that the lack of representation of right-wing ideas in university classrooms is a symptom of a broader problem of academic corruption, where professors use their positions to promote their own agendas and suppress dissenting views.","responses":"[1] Politics: Mentions the discussion of right-wing ideas in university classrooms and the influence of right-wing thinkers on modern thought.\n[1] Censorship: Mentions the deliberate attempt to delegitimize right-wing thinkers and suppress dissenting views.\n[1] Academic Freedom: Mentions the issue of academic corruption and the suppression of dissenting views.\n[1] Critical Thinking: Mentions the importance of exposing students to right-wing ideas in a controlled and nuanced manner to promote critical thinking and intellectual tolerance.\n[1] Ideology: Mentions the promotion of liberal orthodoxy and the suppression of right-wing ideas.\n[1] Education: Mentions the university experience and the curriculum."}

I hope you're all having a wonderful 2020 so far.  Personally, mine has actually been really great.  I've been extremely productive.  I'm working on a new book.  It's about halfway finished, but that is the reason for my absence from YouTube over the past few weeks.  But more on that later.  The reason I wanted to make this video is because I recently came across a hilariously insane article titled The Dangerous Rise of Men Who Won't Date Woke Women.  I'm sure that most of you are already aware of the English actor and musician Lawrence Fox, who recently obliterated a feminist on BBC's Question Time when she accused him of having white privilege.  Anyhow, Laurence Fox happened to mention that he doesn't date woke women and that he had even broken up with a girl who had supported that one crazy 2019 Gillette advertisement that talked about the dangers of toxic masculinity.  I don't know how we ended up together, Laurence Fox said.  It was a very short relationship.  We were walking down the road and she was talking about how good the Gillette advert was.  I just looked at her and went, bye.  Sorry, I can't do this with you.  And now predictably the media is having a complete meltdown.  There's nothing funny about the things Fox or Wokey McWokeface, as he now wants to be known, is saying.  It's also not particularly sad.  It's dangerous.  He is just one very privileged man and as a result of said privilege has been given a platform and he has used that platform to legitimize a bigger backlash against diversity and progress which is unfolding every single day in less public corners of the internet.  Not wanting to date quote woke women, far from being laughable, is actually one of the more insidious aspects of it.  Spend an afternoon on any major dating app and you'll come across generally white men saying openly sexist and misogynistic things.  They might say, no psychos, or that they effing hate big eyebrows in their bios.  And by and large, they also tend to hold extremely right wing views and see themselves as victims of liberal thinking.  Okay, but what exactly is wrong with not wanting to date a psycho?  There legitimately are crazy people out there, obsessive people, stalkerish people, entitled people who are extremely selfish and bratty and just an overall nightmare to be around.  Not to mention, if we're being honest, there are plenty of women who brush men off for the exact same reason.  As for the eyebrows, I don't really know what to say.  aside from everybody has a type.  I mean, sure, the guy could have said it in a more charitable way, I suppose, but at the end of the day, You can't really control what you're attracted to, what you're not attracted to.  Some people really might just be totally put off by bushy eyebrows.  Also, the claim that these type of men exclusively or at least in general tend to hold extreme right-wing views is utter nonsense.  There are plenty of male leftist and feminist supporting types who have been accused of far worse.  Harvey Weinstein, for example.  It's gotten so bad that there's even a stereotype now about male feminists being creepy.  Left-wing men definitely don't have some kind of monopoly on being kind and moral.  Lastly, if I remember correctly, wasn't it the left who started this whole game of not wanting to date people with opposing political views?  I won't date people with right-wing views.  Conservatives are whining because no one wants to date them.  Why I dumped my conservative boyfriend.  Sorry to the left, I guess, but this is the bed that you guys made and you kind of now have to sleep in it.  Nobody really feels sorry for you.  You can't spend all these years saying, I'll never date right wing men.  Right wing men are racist, misogynistic, sexist, not even just right wing men, but anti-PC men.","channel.id":"clxmi0ohw02ehcdvi3iglu7wl","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCesrUK_dMDBZAf7cnjQPdgQ","channel.name":"Brittany Sellner","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"AT","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU5TvTw9o5vWAhQPsDHzc8k46cKZHRbE2ECRAqy-Q=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2017-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The video discusses a recent article about Lawrence Fox, an English actor and musician, who stated he doesn't date \"woke\" women.

I know this is probably not gonna have many views on it.  a lot of people aren't really gonna care about this at all but I keep getting asked over and over in DMS and in comments to do a hair tutorial.  so I'm I hope you're not disappointed by this because it's not going to be very complicated or complex or anything and I'm afraid that for most people this hairstyle might not be as simple as it is for me because I think it has a lot to do with my hair texture that it is so easy for me.  Basically, I mean like this is this is my hair down just kind of like as it is.  It has a lot of natural wave and kind of texture and you can see here like I have a cowlick here I have a cowlick here and throughout the day My hair kind of it ends up kind of more like this and I just it drives me crazy having my hair in my face And so that's why I pin it back.  this this hairstyle that I do it really I I create and create.  I decided to start doing it every day because it's just simple, it's easy, it looks eloquent, and it keeps my hair out of my face.  But I can still keep my hair down.  I don't like really wearing my hair up in a bun unless I'm exercising or I'm having just one of those days where I want to have just my hair off of my face.  Normally I like my hair down, but I don't like it in my face.  So that's... That's what the hairstyles kind of bonus is.  You can still wear your hair down, but it's up out of your face.  You kind of look fresh, has kind of a vintage-y vibe to it.  So my hair texture just before I start, my hair is very fine.  I have very thin strands of hair, but my hair is very thick.  I have a lot of hair.  so there's a lot of volume in my hair naturally especially at the roots like you can see like my hair just goes straight up here.  so this is just what my hair looks like.  uh when it's dried straight like sort of air dried i don't really use the hair dryer.  unless i need to wash my hair i put some oil in it.  um i use a l'oreal extraordinary oil hair oil and then I just let my hair air dry and this is sort of what I'm working with from the beginning.  so to do my hair I use these.  so these are the clips that I use.  if you can see they're like little.  they're metal clips.  their teeth it's like this well the lighting is kind of bad.  they have like little jewels on them which are.  it's quite cute if you can see that.  They're just like gold little teeth clips.  And I find that these are the best type of clip for getting my hair up and keeping it up and keeping it in place.  Sometimes I use bobby pins, but I find that when I use bobby pins, I have to use more to keep it stable at my root, whereas these guys, once they're in, they're in and my hair just stays perfect all day long.  So to do my hairstyle, I take a finger just about an inch above my ear and I always leave a little bit of hair just at like what would be like kind of like my sideburn I guess.  I always leave that down because I like that hair there just to kind of frame the face a little bit more.  So I just take a finger right about an inch above where my ear is and I go straight up to about maybe an inch from where my part is.  Then I hold that piece of hair in place.  and fix any strands which are sticking out.  And as you can see, I don't need to do anything to make that volume.  That's just the texture of my hair.  So if you have flat hair or really thin hair that doesn't have a lot of natural volume in it, at this point, you may want to use a bit of hairspray to keep that volume in place.  And then I literally just clip.  Try and make sure that I'm not getting any of that piece in the clip.  But I just clip it like that.  And then I might just, you know, tug at it a little bit just to give it a little bit more volume.  If I don't like how high up it is, then I'll open the clip up and just pull that hair back.  Make sure it's secure.  And that's it.  That's one side done.  You know, like that's literally it.  And you can see this is what it looks like.  on the side, okay?  Same thing on the other side.  Now, I don't part my hair in the middle.  My hair is kind of a side part, so there will be more hair on this side for me.  You can do this style with a center part if you want, but I just think it looks better on me to have a side part.  So for this side, because there's more hair on this side of my head right now, I will take less hair here than what I will on this side because I want side of my hair that's clipped to be kind of.  even so I'm taking less hair on this side.  same thing again.  you know leaving a little bit of hair down and then pulling that piece up is fixing any loose strands and then I pin it in place and that is literally it.  I pull it out just to give it a little bit more volume And now I'm really lucky I don't need to do hairspray or anything.  Like this is just it.  This is my hairstyle for the rest of the day.  And it just kind of stays that way.  If you don't want this kind of like very volume on top, you can, once your hair clips are clipped in, you can kind of like pull them out a little bit.  And that gives a little bit more of a relaxed look.  You know, it's not so high up on top of the head.  You can have it pinned a little bit further down and that kind of it kind of takes away from the vintage.  you look I feel like a little bit but it just kind of makes it look a little bit more natural.  that's it guys.  that's my hairstyle.  that's how I do my hair.  I hope that for anyone out there who was interested in getting this information you're not disappointed.  I hope that you know this was interesting.  I don't think it was.  If you have any more questions about how I do my hair or anything like that, please feel free to leave them below and I'll do my best to answer them.  But yeah, this is it.  It's really simple.  Good luck with trying the hairstyle for yourself.  I hope it works out for you.  Take care, guys.

The obvious racism and now encouragement of violence against white people is completely out of hand.  Get a load of this.  CBS, one of the biggest broadcasters in America, recently tweeted out this scene from their show, The Good Fight, in which one of the main characters monologues to camera and says, it's time to punch a few Nazis.  Here's the clip. Is it all right to hit a Nazi unprovoked?  I was always taught to never throw the first punch, never instigate.  Defend, but don't attack.  But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face during an interview, and I realized Spencer was in a press suit, wearing a tie, being interviewed like his opinion mattered, like he should be considered part of the conversation, like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view.  And then I realized There's no better way to show.  some speech is not equal.  Some speech requires a more visceral response.  It's like Overton's Window.  That's the term from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse.  Well, Overton's Window doesn't mean shit unless it comes with some enforcement, so yeah!  This is enforcement.  It's time to punch a few Nazis. Unbelievable.  Well, since Nazis haven't been around for almost 75 years, what kind of people do you think he's talking about?  The answer is, of course, white people that the left disagrees with.  Let's be clear.  This is a major US network advocating for violence.  Do I even need to bother pointing out if this were a white guy talking about violence against any particular group?  CBS would lose its broadcasting license instantly.  How is the FCC letting CBS get away with this?  I remember back in the day when Howard Stern would swear on the air and the FCC would target him.  Now you can openly abuse and direct hostility toward a group of people based on their skin color.  On a popular TV show without impunity, no cancellations, no fines, no pulled license to broadcast, nothing.  CBS knows exactly what they're doing when they air an episode like this, especially using a black guy to promote the concept speech equals violence.  They are purposely escalating tensions between whites and blacks, and I believe the reason is because they want to start a race war.  I know, I know, who cares if they say punch a Nazi?  Nazis are evil, right?  Of course, but here's the problem.  All kinds of people are called Nazis these days.  Certainly anyone who voted for Donald Trump might be considered Nazi by leftist standards or maybe a white supremacist, or at least people who supported a Nazi.  So how bad could it be to punch a Nazi supporter after all?  The term Nazi and white supremacist have been watered down to the point where almost any white kid could be labeled.  Oh, you don't think so?  You're white and liberal?  How could you be labeled?  Easily.  You benefit from white privilege and all your accomplishments are meaningless.  Plus, your family has only been successful because of the oppression of others.  So there, unless you surrender everything you own and beg forgiveness for existing, you've benefited from white supremacy in the past.  Do you see how psychotic some of these concepts are and how any white person can be labeled?  Okay, so let's get back to that TV promo.  I think CBS loves this tactic and I doubt they'll face any real consequences because this is a very popular sentiment right now.  One theory is that the left is aiming to dehumanize white people and coach society into believing whites are evil.  That way it's easy to justify violence against them.  Author.  David Livingston Smith says, when people dehumanize others, they actually conceive of them as subhuman creatures.  Only then can the process liberate aggression and exclude the target of aggression from the moral community.  Now when you encourage the populace to attack whites on the basis of their beliefs and speech, bad things are going to happen.  I realize mainstream media would have you believe whites are the perpetrators of crimes against minorities like blacks, for example.  But the truth is, most of the time, it's the other way around.  The breakdown in arrests from FBI stats in 2016 show in terms of race, black people are still vastly overrepresented in virtually every crime category, despite making up just 13% of the population.  According to the book The Color of Crime by Edwin S. Rubenstein, FBI crime stats calculate that there are roughly 600,000 interracial crimes of violence involving blacks and whites every year.  And 85% of the time, it's blacks attacking whites.  That means a black person is 27 times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa.  So back to my overall point, when intellectuals and TV writers condemn white people and advocate for violence against them, the effect can trickle down to violent young men.  Even worse, the hatred can fall squarely on the most innocent members of our society.  Children, white children, which is exactly what has happened this week.  The first absolutely horrible incident took place at the Mall of America in Minnesota.  A 24-year-old black male named Emmanuel Aranda took this five-year-old boy, Landon Hoffman, from his mother and brutally hurled him from the third floor balcony at the mall.  Aranda reportedly told investigators that he planned to kill an adult, but that did not work out, so he chose the boy instead.  He said he lashed out after he had been coming to the mall for years to try to speak to women who rejected him.  Aranda has two past convictions for assault at the mall, both in 2015, including one in which he threw a glass of water and a glass of tea at a woman who refused to buy him something.  Aranda at one point was banned from the mall.  There's been no mention in the article that this was a hate crime against Landon Hoffman.  Landon is currently in the intensive care unit and is miraculously showing signs of recovery.  There's also a huge fundraiser for him started by his family, where they have already raised almost a million dollars to help pay for this beautiful boy's medical care.  I have donated to help Landon, and I hope you will too.  I'll leave the link in the description section below.  The second violent act against innocent white children happened in Aurora, Colorado, where this guy, Ogeheli Gohini Atuno, whatever, was arrested on suspicion of using his vehicle to run over two boys ages 11 and 12.  The boys were minding their own business, walking home after playing basketball, and allegedly, Atuno circled the cul-de-sac several times before allegedly hitting the boys who were walking on the sidewalk, indicating he specifically targeted them.  One boy was so badly injured his skull was fractured.  No mention in the article of a targeted hate crime.  The final act of brazen violence, which has been memory-holed by the mainstream media, likely because it doesn't fit their ongoing white privilege narrative, happened in Quincy, Massachusetts, where two teenage boys assaulted a pregnant woman outside a downtown post office.  The pregnant woman was throwing up outside the post office when Tyrese Johnson Nurse and David Russell were laughing at her and spit on her.  They got into the woman's face and began punching her in the head as she screamed that she was pregnant.  The teens also attacked the boyfriend.  The woman told police that Russell had kicked her in the stomach and said, quote, I hope he dies.  They were arrested on charges of aggravated assault and battery on a pregnant woman in assault and battery.  However, Russell, the more dangerous of the two, is expected to be released with a GPS monitor and was not required to post bail, but must stay away from the woman and any witnesses and remain in his house except to go to work.  What?!  The hell is going on?  Yet another hate crime against a white person and nowhere in the article does it even make mention of this fact.  The double standard here is so beyond ridiculous.  Do I even need to bother to point out what the reaction would be if the races were reversed in any of these cases?  My guess is there would be riots.  The black pill here is expect more hate crimes of this nature to occur as the mainstream media, intellectuals, and Hollywood continue to ratchet up the anti-white rhetoric.  This problem is only going to get worse.  Let me know what you think in the comment section below.

That's not the unspoken thought of the adolescent boy who wants to seduce his girlfriend before her parents get home.  It's got nothing to do with 8 p.m Sex by 8, or it's too late, is the motto for the North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, and they mean 8 years old. I belong to the pro-sex, pro-pop culture wing of feminism.  I favor the legalization of prostitution.  I have defended pornography. All pornography is okay with you, including child pornography? Well, what I'm saying is that the public display of pornography can be reasonably restricted.  That is, it should not intrude into the public realm.  When you're coming out of a subway, a Christian person should not have to see naked ladies.  But those magazines should be available at the newsstand, is what I'm saying. Moloch, whose soul is electricity and banks!  Moloch, whose poverty is the specter of genius.  Moloch, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen.  Moloch, whose name is the mind.  Moloch, in whom I sit lonely.  Moloch, in whom I dream angels.  Crazy and Moloch.  Ducksucker and Moloch.  Love-loving, manless and Moloch.  Moloch, who entered my soul early. Camille Paglia, a self-described dissident feminist, is being presented to us as a voice of reason in the current political climate.  She is lauded by conservative news outlets as an unlikely ally in the fight against progressive tyranny, championed by individuals such as Jordan Peterson, and promoted by the intellectual dark web.  There is, however, something that all of them fail to mention about Camille Paglia.  She is pro-pedophilia and has for decades advocated for the legalization of both pedophilia and child pornography.  Her 1991 book, Sexual Personae, is even quoted on the official North American Man-Boy Love Association website, nambla.org.  where she asserts that pedophilia is both rational and honorable, encompassing what she says is a beauty that Christian morality fails to recognize.  This is not some kind of misunderstanding.  Paglia has repeatedly gone on record, stating that she thinks child pornography and pedophilia should both be legalized.  In 1994, she published another book entitled Vamps and Tramps, in which she described looking at child pornography and concluding that she sees nothing wrong with it.  The only potential obstacle she perceived with regard to legalizing child pornography were existing laws relating to child labour. Catherine McKinnon, who says speech is rape, is that...? Yes, I'm on the opposite wing.  Catherine McKinnon is the anti-porn wing of feminism.  I am on the radically pro-porn wing.  I'm more radical than Christina.  Are you pro-pornography? For adults. I'm going to be very careful about, you know, I feel in our society for children. Note how Christina Somers was careful to distance herself from Palia's stance on child pornography.  In 1999, Palia was interviewed for The Guide magazine by pro-pedophile activist and former Nambla spokesman Bill Andriette. With us from Boston tonight is a spokesman for the North American Man-Boy Love Association, Bill Andriette. Well, NAMBLA is a political and educational organization that deals with consensual relationships between men and boys.  Loving, consensual relationships that are made criminal in this country and in many other countries by age of consent laws that are absurdly high. What does NAMBLA want the age to be? Well, we're open on that question.  We're open. You don't want a 10-year-old, do you? Well, we don't think age of consent laws are a good way to protect young people from sexual coercion.  There's no arbitrary limit that we think the law should set. Let's say your nine-year-old sister says, Hey, Bill, I want you to go to bed with this 23-year-old man.  Would you be upset? Well, I think we have to talk to the girl and find out what she finds in the relationship. She's nine, Bill. She's nine.  What I'm going to say is difficult for many people to understand, but I think we need to ask young people how they feel about sexual relationships that they have with other young people, with older people. Paglia spoke about strategies for removing the stigma from, quote, man-boy contacts, lamented that some people treated her like a monster when they discovered she is pro-pedophilia, and stated that she believes there is nothing wrong with adults engaging in, quote, sex play with children as young as eight years old. I'm pro-pornography, pro-prostitution, pro-homosexuality, pro-abortion, pro-legalization of drugs.  I'm a libertarian. In that same interview, Paglia indicates that the only thing she respected post-modernist intellectual Michael Foucault for was for his position on pedophilia. There is a long correlation between anarchism and pedophilia, and support for pedophilia.  Foucault another way to ask this is who argued?  no?  I guess the answer would be argued for the eradication of age of consent laws as in down to infants. who is Foucault?  thank you just go ahead.  In the year 2000, Palia offered us a deeper insight into the origins of her pro-pedophilia thinking.  She wrote a column for Salon entitled, The Purity of Allen Ginsberg's Boy Love.  Palia wrote that Allen Ginsberg had enormous influence on her intellectual development.  and that she would be proud to call him her guru, stating that Ginsberg had, quote, visionary sexuality, and that his, quote, celebration of boy love was pure and sinless, which she believed demonstrated the, quote, limitations of the Christian paradigm of sexuality.  Allen Ginsberg was a beat poet, notorious pedophile, and one of Nambla's earliest supporters. This is the poet Allen Ginsberg. Sweet boy, give me your ass.  Let me kiss your face, lick your neck, touch your lips, tongue, tickle, tongue in, nose to nose, quiet question, ever slept with a man before?  Famous for writing a poem in the 1950s entitled Howl, in which he described his soul being entered by Moloch, the Canaanite god that demanded child sacrifice. Moloch, in whom I am a consciousness without a body.  Moloch, who framed me out of my natural ecstasy.  Moloch!  Why is Camille Paglia being promoted by the media, the intellectual dark web, and people such as Jordan Peterson?  Peterson even had her on his podcast and promoted her book in which she defends pedophilia.  Something isn't right here.  Paglia is being sold to us as a defender of social stability and champion of Western values, when in reality she is working to pierce the heart of the moral foundations of our civilization.  She wants to legalize adults having sex with children and the production and distribution of child pornography.  Why is she being promoted? Okay. All right. That's a good one to close on. We agree on everything.  I knew this.  I knew this. All right, great. Thank you very much.  So I'm saying that, I mean, I know when I was a tiny child in the Italian church, I didn't identify at all with Jesus and St.  Joseph and all those mild-mannered people.  The crest scene, I thought, what is this with the straw and the animals?  Now, I identify with the Magi, okay?  With the multiracial Magi with their beautiful costumes.  It was only later I realized they were pagan astrologers.  And that already early on, I was picking up the residual paganism in the Roman church.  St.  Sebastian, the beautiful boy with arrows.  I mean, this was my obsession.  I was a tiny child staring.  I mean, I never looked at Jesus.  Jesus never interested me in whatever.","channel.id":"clxmi0ody02brcdviyhoyu8ir","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCN3tOgo3UEpvPQgChYf9vvg","channel.name":"Resurrection Europa","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["LIBERTARIAN","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX9Z7pDHF7yk8x0ScpkLRD6CUlacCAlHKvG_-mG4g=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-11-26T16:32:09.000Z","summary":"Camille Paglia, a self-described dissident feminist, is being promoted by conservative news outlets and the intellectual dark web as a voice of reason.

It preserves some of the medieval character that really gives a town a charm.  It used to be the capital, well at least the capital of Anglo-Saxon Wessex.  well, if not a capital, at least a centre of administration in the 7th and 8th centuries.  In fact, King Alfred took residence here in 871.  And that's why it was considered suitable in 1901 for a statue of the only king of England to attain the title of Great, Alfred the Great.  At the unveiling of the statue, Prime Minister Roseberry said, In him we venerate the ideal Englishman, the perfect sovereign.  the pioneer of England's greatness.  The Victorian novelist and historian Sir Walter Besant described King Alfred as the typical man of our race.  Call him Anglo-Saxon, call him American, call him Australian.  The typical man of our race.  that is best and noblest.  There's another statue of King Alfred in the town called Wantage, which is one of the places I went to school as a boy. Alfred was famous for fighting pagan Vikings, but with the typically English sense of irony, he claimed descent from Woden, the king of the pagan gods. Hear ye!  Hear ye!  Hear ye!  Christian King Alfred descended from pagan god!  God save the king!  There is also a third statue.  It has a Roman look for some reason.  King Alfred was associated with literacy.  Therefore, it made perfect sense for Alfred University in New York, who take their very name from Alfred, to celebrate their Anglo-Saxon roots and the roots of English literacy with a statue of King Alfred.  But when the statue was erected in 1990, many of the students and faculty opposed it, saying, this represented the image of the dead white European male.  dr linda mitchell who was professor of mediaeval studies at the university said it would be foolish to choose a symbol so exclusive and effective in emphasizing the straight white male power structure of history.  obviously the fact that the statue was depicted wearing a roman toga wasn't gender inclusive enough.  it should be obvious to any sensible person why these people are wrong.  king alfred is a link to the past for all people of anglo-saxon descent.  he was a great man a devout christian but he honoured the past that even came before christianity.  his line the house of wessex continues in our beloved monarchy to-day.  king alfred was the son of king everwolf he of egbert he of eomund he of eifer he of eopa he of ingild and ina the famous king of the west saxons.  they were two brothers the sons of cunred he of ceolwald.  ceolwald of cutha cutha of cuthwin cuthwin of ceolin ceolin of cunric.  cunric of creoda creoda of ceredic ceredic of elisa of esle esle of ywys ywys of wyg wyg of freawyn freawyn of frithulgar frithulgar of brond brond of balde and balde of woden.  now those last few in that genealogy are gods and the last one of course woden i expect you are all familiar with.

One of these states in particular could potentially result in both an explosive showdown with Merkel's CDU, as well as a showdown in federal court.  Saxon or Saxony and Brandenburg both have elections on September 1st.  Thuringian or Thuringia has their election on October 27th.  The AFD is still a fairly new party.  It was only officially launched in 2013.  During the first few years, there was some pretty serious infighting over the direction of the party.  Some of the original leaders quit.  The fighting was in part over whether the party would be dominated by economic issues or immigration.  In the end, I think the people who wanted to make immigration the main issue won out.  The AFD is currently part of the EU group spearheaded by Matteo Salvini called Identity and Democracy, or ID.  They originally joined the ECR back in 2014 when it was still dominated by the Tories.  Two years after letting them in, David Cameron famously tried and failed to kick them out of the ECR to appease Angela Merkel.  Compared to some of the other members of ID, the AFD probably has more traditional center-right economic policies.  Whereas the Finns Party, the Danish People's Party, and National Rally are big tent populists on economics, some conservatives even complain that these parties are too far to the left on economics.  although the AFD is probably a lot like the Austrian Freedom Party, which is also part of ID.  The AFD does far better in the six states of the former East Germany.  In fact, it seems they are starting to become a symbol of the continued cultural divide between East and West Germany.  In the 2017 German national election, AFD came in first place in Saxony with 27%.  In the 2018 EU election, the AfD came in first place in Saxony and Brandenburg.  Naturally, Berlin is the weak link in East Germany.  However, even in certain parts of Berlin, the AfD does very well.  The lion's share of AfD voters are former CDU voters.  Angela Merkel became the head of the CDU in the year 2000.  She has steadily pushed the party to the left ever since.  Far from being the extreme party that Merkel claims it is, the AfD is basically what the CDU was pre-Merkel.  In East Germany, there is also some working class voters who have switched from the left-wing parties to the AfD because of the issue of immigration.  In West Germany, there are two main left-wing parties, the Social Democrats and the Greens.  The Social Democrats are on the decline, and the Greens are on the rise right now.  In East Germany, there is a third prominent left-wing party.  Die Linke, which means the left, is the rebranded former East German Communist Party.  It is very left-wing.  However, it is the least preferred left-wing party of the globalists.  They are essentially a Euroskeptic party because of their anti-war positions.  They oppose giving the EU too much power because they believe the EU would initiate foreign wars.  In the rhetoric of the globalist think tanks, Die Linke is an unreliable partner for globalism, whereas the Green Party is Germany's most reliable partner.  There's an interesting side story with Die Linke.  A prominent leader of the party, Sarah Wagenknecht, has her own movement called Aufstehen, or Stand Up.  The goal of Aufstehen is to win back working class voters who have defected to the AFD.  Her movement opposes open borders in direct opposition to the official platform of Die Linke.  She could probably be compared to the new Prime Minister of Denmark, In 2016, Wagenknecht was even physically attacked by a self-described anti-fascist activist in the middle of a Die Linke conference.  Many of the people in East Germany I've talked to tell me that the Green Party is actually more radical and more dangerous than Die Linke.  Right now, the AFD is consistently polling 20-22% and have become first place in several polls in Brandenburg.  In Thuringia, they are also polling 20-22%.  In Saxony, they are consistently polling 25%.  The CDU is going up in the polls in Saxony right now, but it is not at the expense of the AFD.  According to the two latest polls, the CDU has surged to just over 30% by taking votes away from the left-wing parties.  I believe this is because Michael Kretschmer, the front man for the CDU in Saxony, has pivoted to the left.  He has publicly vowed to coalition with the Social Democrats and the Greens and block the AFD from entering government.  Kretschmer is now denouncing the AFD as an extreme party.  even though his own rhetoric in the recent past is very similar to the rhetoric of the AFD.  This is a dramatic reversal from what we were seeing from the Saxony branch of the CDU just a few months ago.  Prior to the EU election, they didn't even want Merkel to come to Saxony to campaign with them.  Now, instead of further distancing themselves from Merkel, they have gone in the opposite direction.  This could be dangerous for them as Saxony is widely considered to be one of the most conservative areas of Germany.  The election commission in Saxony also tried to rig the entire election.  The state parliament has 126 seats.  The AfD submitted 61 candidates.  43 were removed from the ballot by the election commission using very creative technicalities.  The courts in Saxony have restored 12 candidates, but candidates 31 through 61 are still being denied the right to be on the ballot.  If the AFD wins more than 30 seats, which is possible, the entire election might be nullified by the German federal courts.  Meanwhile, the media and the establishment parties are trying to whip people into a hysterical frenzy against the AfD.  Party members cannot even campaign without being harassed or even physically assaulted.  Nevertheless, this could prove to be a very exciting trio of elections in Germany.

Today there are pagan revivals across Europe, and the Slavs are no exception.  This group of people being rained on in Poland is called Gromada Biologia and they're waiting for the rain to stop so they can celebrate the coming of summer. Ach wodo, ach wodo ma W tobie nadzieja ca\u0142a.  \u017be ch\u0142opca me go znasz I jemu wianek dasz.  \u017be ch\u0142opca me go znasz I jemu wianek dasz. There were many gods in the Slavic pantheon.  The main three are Perun, who is the god of the storm and the sky.  His name comes from that of the Proto-Indo-European thunder god, Perkunos, whose name is clear in his Lithuanian cognate, Perkunas.  These gods are all like the Nordic god of thunder, Thor, whose other name, Fj\u00f6rgin, comes from Perkunos as well.  Perun is the principal deity of the Slavic people.  Svarog is a smithing god, like the Roman Vulcan.  He is compared in the Hypatian Codex to the Greek god Hephaestus, and it says he is father of the sun god Dadzbog and the fire god Swarozik.  This trinity is reflected in the ancient Vedic texts of India, in which lightning, fire and sun, that is Indra, Agni and Surya, are all brothers.  Veles is a dark god, whose mythic roles are cognate with those of the gods' enemies in other pagan religions.  Yet Veles was honoured by the Slavs.  He is the god of the underworld, Navi, and of wisdom and magic.  Because of his patronage over cattle, a symbol of abundance, he is called a horned god.  The ritual has begun.  First, the priests delineate the holy space by marking a circle in salt.  The priest's wife, Agnieszka, offers the sacrificial loaf to each member of the congregation so that they can imbue it with their intentions.  The loaf is then burned in the sacrificial fire as an offering.  Toasts are made to the gods with a horn of mead, and libations are poured onto the fire.  Clouties are tied to a green bough in honour of the summer's arrival.  And offerings of grain are poured into a pit and buried.  The historic sources on Slavic paganism are sparse, but most information comes via the 12th century primary chronicle.  However, unlike in Western Europe, the Slavic peasants were not really Christianized in medieval times.  Therefore, we can learn a lot about Slavic paganism from accounts of folk customs among peasants as recently as the early modern era.  V.G.  Vlasov was the respected scholar of Slavic religion, I.V.  Anitchkov, who regarding Russia's Christianization said, Vlasov also said, that the fact the vast majority of the Russian population was not Christian in the 15th century could be proven by archaeology.  The Kurdigans or burial mounds or as we say barrows in English were still a universal phenomenon in Russia up until the 15th century and persisted even into the 1530s.  Moreover, chronicles from that period, such as the Pskov Chronicle and archaeological data collected by N. M. Nikolovsky, testify that back in the 15th century there were still no rural churches for the general use of the populace.  Churches existed only at the courts of boyars and princes.  Many European pagans, such as the Celts, believed that souls could reincarnate, and it seems the Slavs were no exception.  Take the following oath made during the treaty concluded in 944 between Prince Igor and Christian Byzantium, for example.  It was said that Those who will violate the treaty, let them have no help from God or from Perun.  May their shields not protect them and may they die from their own swords, from arrows and other weapons of their own.  and let them be slaves in the next life.  To be a slave in the next life implies that they could reincarnate as another person.  This belief persisted among Christian peasants even recently.  As we can see in these accounts of Belarusian folklore, from Michael Fedorowski in 1897.  Curious where God did get these souls?  Oh, God will take the soul out of one body and put it in the other.  That's all.  God does not give people their own souls.  He will only take one out of someone and put it in the other.  Who are the Slavic people?  Another thing that distinguishes Slavs from Western Europeans is that they have regional genetic continuity reaching further back into history.  This is because the Indo-Europeans of the Corded Ware culture, who replaced many of the people in Neolithic Europe, were descended from Eastern European hunter-gatherers.  In June this year, Science Poland reported that a soon to be published study will reveal the antiquity of the Polish people.  It says, there are already first conclusions from the research of the team from the Biobank Laboratory and the Department of Anthropology.  The researchers believe that in the case of the population living in Kujawi, there was a surprisingly strong genetic continuity.  dating back to the time of the first farmers, 7.5 thousand years ago.  It seems that we are dealing with an interesting genetic continuation in the population living in Kajawi from the early Middle Ages to the 19th century.  The roots of these populations probably reach the Neolithic. The original proto-Slavic people who existed a long time ago, but they do exist today in the form of modern Slavic speakers here in Poland and the Russians, the Belarusians and the Ukrainians, basically the northern Slavs, because they're genetically almost identical to the proto-Slavic people, the Balto-Slavic people.  The southern Slavs from the Balkans are actually they're a bit different because during the middle ages and the huns they left the power vacuum in the balkans and that allowed the northern slavs to to impose their culture and language on the people in the balkans from the 6th century onwards.  and today the serbs and bosnians and what have you?  they speak slavic languages but they have maybe about 20 percent input from that slavic invasion.  so the rest comes from indigenous Balkan farmer.  so they're much more south shifted.  they're more closely related in some ways to Greeks so they're kind of like Greek Slavs mix in a way.  the proto-Slavic homeland is the European plain.  the European plain is this area here now in Poland and going further west into Germany and that's also the homeland of the Corded Ware culture and the corded wear culture of the late Neolithic and Bronze Age was the... it's the Ur culture for most of the Indo-European peoples we know today including the Slavic people and the Germanic people.  so it's important to understand the corded wear and their role in in history to understand the diversity of paganism in Europe that happened in the medieval times and the forms that we now practice today.  So the Koriw\u00e9 culture languages must be closely related, where all these ones derive from a common source, the ones that we have today, and they influence each other later.  So the Slavic languages are quite influential on others and other languages have been influential on Slavic.  For example, linguists think Germanic is closer to Baltic Slavic than Celtic.  which is interesting because the Celtic homeland is basically Austria original and a lot of Germany was Celtic speaking.  so you would imagine there would be a heavy influence from... it would be more Celtic but it isn't, it's closer to the Baltic Slavic and the Gothic language of the Eastern Germanic peoples was... that actually has more Celtic loanwords than other Germanic languages.  so that's interesting, it tells us something about the relationship of Germanic people to Celtic people and And even Anglo-Saxons who, you know, invaded a Celtic country don't have very many Celtic words.  In English today, we don't really have hardly any Celtic words.  But Slavic has many Germanic words.  Germanic words like Hanzo is Slavic words.  It means a band of warriors or cohort.  That's in Germanic.  And that becomes in Slavic Zosa, which means robbery or trap.  And Finnic Kansa, which means people or nation.  You've got the Germanic word hlajba meaning loaf or bread and that became a slavic word zleb meaning loaf of bread.  germanic kuninga in king becomes slavic kniedz which means a prince or ruler.  i might have mispronounced these words.  i'm so sorry if i do.  germanic nauta meaning cattle becomes slavic nuta meaning cow or cattle.  but most of the loanwords identified in proto-slavic come from germanic languages of all the loanwords in that early slavic time long before christianity.  And the other main contributors are Iranian, Celtic and Turkic.  So some of the words like in other cultures influenced by Slavic, for example, Sami, which the indigenous people up in, or so-called indigenous people in Scandinavia, that word is a Slavic origin.  And so is Suomi, the word for the Finnish.  Baltoslavic, the Ur language from which Slavic and Baltic languages derive, is... It's phonologically closer to Indo-Iranian than to Germanic due to aerial influences of Iranic speakers.  But there was 100% certainty that there was extensive Balto-Slavic influence on Finnish.  And Finnish also has these Iranic words coming in.  Iranic words entered Finnish much earlier than the Slavic words entered the Finnish language.  which indicates that the Slavs already inhabited the region between Scythia and Germania in the first millennium before Christ, or the proto-Slavic speakers, because the root of the Finnic peoples through the Iranic-speaking regions and into Scandinavia, they must have passed... Sorry?  It's evidence that this region between Germania and Scythia has been Slavic since very great antiquity.  The Slavic religion was heavily influenced by their neighbouring Iranic religion as well.  Most likely, when I say Iranic, probably the Scythians.  And that's why they say Bog instead of the proto-Slavic word for God would have been Dievos.  But Bog is of Iranic origin.  And there's also the later Germanic influence from the West via Ostrogoths and the Kievan Rus, of course.  You'll probably know about the Rus.  Allegedly, it's a Germanic name deriving from a word meaning people who row.  So according to the Primary Chronicle, the Rus were a group of Varangians who lived along with other groups like the Swedes and the Jutes on the other side of the Baltic Sea in Scandinavia and as far as the land of the English and the French.  The Varangians were first expelled, then invited to rule the warring Slavic and Finnic tribes of Novgorod.  The Rurik dynasty was founded in the 9th century lasting until the 17th and when it initially started that was the introduction of some Germanic gods and Germanic pagan worship among the Slavs at the same time of Slavic pagan worship.  until there was a rebellion and Vladimir restored the cults of the Slavic gods erecting some big statues for the Slavic gods in 980 and that lasted for about nine years until he converted to Christianity.  and then the the great statue of Perun as perhaps you know was was thrown into the river.  But I wonder, because there may have been a precedent for that that wasn't just iconoclastic.  There may have been a symbolic, because there are certain Indo-European rituals of ritually drowning an idol.

In today's video, we're going to be talking about abortion, particularly about how the attitude of abortion supporters has become a lot bolder and a lot more extreme since it was first legalized in the US in 1973.  For quite some time, abortion as a whole seemed to have been, quote unquote, justified by insisting that it's necessary in situations such as when a woman is a victim of rape or of incest, and also arguing that since it's a woman's body, it should therefore be a woman's choice.  Now, regarding the first argument, rape and incest are actually the lowest on the list of why women choose to get abortions, but with that said, even if they weren't the lowest on the list, choosing to abort a baby that was produced out of rape or incest, it's it's still ending the life of an innocent baby.  In a study that was released by the Guttmacher Institute, which is the most recent statistics that seem to be available on this subject, women were asked to provide reasons why they chose to have an abortion.  And the top three reasons were 74% felt that having a baby would dramatically change my life which includes interrupting education, interfering with job and career, and or concern over other children or dependents.  73% felt that they can't afford a baby now due to various reasons such as being unmarried, being a student, inability to afford childcare, or basic needs of life, etc.  And 48% don't want to be a single mother or were having relationship problems.  And the bottom two reasons, the lowest reasons on the entire list, were firstly, 0.5% became pregnant as a result of incest, and 1% said that they were a victim of rape.  Regarding the second argument, it's a woman's body, therefore it should be a woman's choice, the very premise is fallacious.  It's not a woman's body, it's a completely separate human body growing inside her own, developing its own arms, legs, hands, feet, eyes, organs, and so on.  Some argue that since the baby needs to live off the mother while in the womb, then abortion must be justified.  But this really doesn't make any sense because even after you've given birth to a baby, they still need many years of care from their parents before they can survive on their own.  So if you stand by this argument, then it would have to mean you would be okay with aborting babies up until the point that they can actually take care of themselves.  Nowadays, while there are some women who still do use the arguments, it's a woman's body, therefore it should be a woman's choice.  What if a baby has been conceived out of rape or of incest?  There are many women who have completely moved past these arguments altogether, perhaps because of how normalized abortion has become, and they have taken their stances to a much more extreme level.  In an article entitled, Abortion is Morally Good, The author justifies abortion with such quotes as, nothing I've lived through will convince an Alabama Republican to change his mind.  To them, nothing I've done in my 31 years on the earth, none of my accomplishments, none of my happiness elevates my worth above that of an embryo.  There are stories bleaker and more violent than mine, and they won't persuade Alabama Republicans either.  There is only one just and moral response to the anti-abortion movement, and that is to strike down its arguments in their entirety.  A fetus is a possibility, not a person.  While abortion can be the tragic end to a wanted pregnancy, it's never murder.  The opposite position is extreme and a threat to the health and safety of women.  There is no compromise.  not on the personhood of women.  You can't find middle ground.  Firstly, nobody is saying that a baby's life is inherently worth more than its mother's.  That a mother is useless and can just be tossed to the curb.  Both lives are valuable.  But what this woman is saying is that a baby's life is inherently worth less than its mother's.  In fact, she doesn't even refer to it as a baby, she refers to it as an embryo or a fetus.  She also claims that abortion isn't murder, which is the statement that I find most telling about this article.  Many abortion supporters, not all of them, but many of them have convinced themselves that abortion isn't murder in order to justify their support of it.  They're dehumanizing the babies, calling them just a possibility as opposed to an actual living human being and instead shifting all of the focus onto the mother.  The very last thing they want to be dwelling upon is the fact that unless the mother aborts her child or has a miscarriage, then one day that baby's going to be born, it's going to have its own life, its own dreams, its own accomplishments, perhaps even its own family.  Something else that I find particularly unjust regarding the abortion debate is that men who wish to provide for and to help raise the children rarely ever get a say.  Women alone get to decide whether the baby lives or dies.  Take a look at this video that I stumbled across of a man outside an abortion clinic begging his partner not to abort their child.  Please help her to listen.  Help her to listen.  No, don't do it.  Abby, don't kill our baby!  Abby!  Oh my gosh.  You would think that most people would have at least an inkling of compassion for this man's grief, even if they're people who support a woman's right to have an abortion.  But I mean, some of the replies under this tweet, they're just unbelievably heartless.  If he wants a baby, he can find a willing partner to gestate one.  He does not get to force this woman to give birth because he wants a baby.  Oh my lord.  Assuming this is real, how did he know when she had her appointment?  Was he stalking her?  Does he not give a shit about what she's going through?  Does he think he can control her with his drama?  Did he wear a condom?  She is definitely better off without him.  Sounds like he's too much of a crybaby to be a good father anyway.  Too bad, so sad, she's not his effing herb garden.  To be perfectly honest though, the callousness of these tweets, it really comes as no surprise given that the attitude surrounding abortion is becoming more and more accepted, even even celebratory over time.  There was the Shout Your Abortion social media campaign where people share their abortion experiences online without, quote, sadness, shame, or regret for the purpose of, quote, destigmatization, normalization, and putting an end to shame.  There was also the infamous Twitter thread where a pro-life woman wrote, look at this little baby, just nine weeks old, those tiny little hands, those tiny little fingers, that tiny smile, that precious life, hashtag pro-life.  Few times in my entire existence have I ever seen such disregard for human life as many of the replies to this tweet.  Apparently there's also a new trend that fetishizes abortion wherein couples find some kind of sexual high in purposefully getting pregnant and then aborting their unborn babies.  Summit News recently uncovered couples discussing the disturbing sexual fetish on Reddit.  The comments came from a post where one user explained that their female friend, quote, has a really powerful fetish for breeding.  She is with a male partner currently who is just like her, into breeding and they have been practicing their fetish for quite a few abortions, the commenter wrote, noting that their friend never uses birth control.  Apparently the friend is not the only one destroying unborn babies for her perverted sexual kink.  Another person commenting on the post said he and his girlfriend have the same fetish.  according to the report.  Quote, my girlfriend enjoys her pregnancies and she enjoys the abortion, the person responded.  Her preferred date to abort is between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation.  I enjoy making her pregnant and I enjoy the time of her pregnancy.  She has no menstrual period and she is sexually very active.  And most recently I came across a photo on Instagram of a tattoo artist who tattooed this on another girl and she called it one of her favorite tattoos that she'd ever done.  With this ever increasing shameless attitude, It really comes as no surprise that abortion advocates keep pushing the boundaries, now even going so far as to advocate for infanticide.  On the 46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the New York State Senate passed the Reproductive Health Act, and it was signed into law by Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo.  The law, which is likely the most expansive abortion bill in the country, allows late-term abortion until the baby's due date, if it meets certain requirements.  Not only is this kind of legal protection of late-term abortion an affront to the humanity of the unborn and the dignity of society, but New York celebrated it publicly as if it had just won the Super Bowl.  When the bill passed, video shows the assembly chamber erupting into cheers with politicians and audience members applauding the bill as if it were a victorious symbol of strength.  Two of the most heinous parts of the bill describe the new parameters of abortion.  If, quote, the patient is within 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, and second, and this is the worst qualifier, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health.  The wording of that second phrase is so comprehensive, even in legal lingo, protecting the patient's health could mean almost anything.  To be clear, this is not the passage of abortion rights, but the permission to commit infanticide and call it by another name.  An eight pound baby can survive outside the womb with very little medical aid.  Late term abortion procedures are goalish and graphic.  The Lazier Institute reports that, quote, abortions performed after 20 weeks gestation when not done by induction of labor, which leads to fetal death due to prematurity, are most commonly performed by dilation and evacuation procedures.  These particularly gruesome surgical techniques involve crushing, dismemberment, and removal of a fetal body from a woman's uterus.  Mere weeks before or even after, the fetus reaches a developmental age of potential viability outside the mother.  And if all of that wasn't enough, there have been a number of scandals recently involving the abortion industry.  First, there was the Stem Express CEO who admitted to selling beating baby hearts, intact baby heads, in the delayed hearing.  And then a few weeks ago, there were more than 2,200 medically preserved fetal remains discovered at the home of a former abortion doctor who had passed away.  My question right now is, where is all the mainstream media coverage of these absolute horrors?  There should be wall-to-wall media coverage, but we've hardly heard a peep.  Instead, all day long we're told that we're monsters for not wanting children and their parents to illegally cross the border into the US.  Why is it that the left cares so much for the children of strangers, but yet when it comes to their own children, they're perfectly fine with murdering them?  If we as a society continue on this course, we're going to continue crossing more and more extreme and unforgivable lines.  Late term abortion will be legalized in every state, and who knows, maybe even after the children are born.  Considering we're now a society that allows for child drag queens, child transgenders, drag queen story time for children at libraries, and so on, I wouldn't be surprised.  There's a quote that says, a society that can't protect its own children has no future.  Well, we as a society are much worse than that because we can in fact protect our own children, we're just deliberately choosing not to.  Personally, considering the current climate, I don't think banning abortion would do much good.  Women would continue to have abortions illegally and the ban likely wouldn't be permanent because there's too many people both average and those in positions of power who are in favor of it.  What would have to change to see abortion stamped out is our morality.  We would need a return to God.  If we change on the inside, then that change will manifest physically and reflect in the actions that we do.  Instead of wanting to kill our children, as was done in the 47.5 million abortions that have occurred since 1973 and 2015, we will instead want to keep them, value them, protect them, and love them.  If you happen to be pro-life, on the fence, or even an abortion supporter, please do consider checking out the work of Lila Rose or Abby Johnson, who once worked at Planned Parenthood as a clinic director, but resigned after watching an abortion on ultrasound.

I've had the pleasure of visiting Notre Dame many times in my life, most recently with my husband in 2017.  I remember marveling at the architecture, how it was somehow delicate yet robust, at the priceless relics.  I remember the musky smell as I craned my neck upward, trying to jam each detail, each element of this experience into some secret part of my brain where I could always access it just as it was right in that moment.  So I could always remember how it made me feel to be in the presence of hundreds of masters' life's work, a holy place that had endured plagues and wars and countless upheavals, yet always stood there, formidable in its own way, a towering reminder that Christendom is the heart of the Western world.  that it's the guiding light for western man.  it's part of who we are and was meant to persevere not only to protect our civilization and our values but to protect our souls.  then i walked outside and began making my way to another monument in paris and was brought back to the reality that we have forsaken our lands our cultures our monuments.  It was just pushy African peddlers, kebab shops, piles of trash, leering groups of Muslim men and burqa-clad women.  Something had shifted in Paris.  It was nothing like the delightfully smug, decidedly French city I first became acquainted with when I was a teenager.  I knew when I visited again in 2015 that the demographic situation was dire.  But on my most recent trip in 2017, I really saw that it no longer seemed reversible.  The adoption of a more modern culture, the degradation of the city's infrastructure, the perpetual military patrol, created this sense of foreboding that hung in the air.  The fire of Notre Dame will always be deemed an accident, whether or not it was.  I'm of the mindset that it's unlikely it was accidental.  Several other French churches have been vandalized in recent months.  It's Holy Week.  Safeguards to prevent fire, including a thrice daily check of the spire, were in place.  And it is an 850-year-old cathedral that for much of its life was lit by candles.  It's now being claimed that it was an electrical mishap, whether it was this or a construction workers lit cigarette, or a failing of existing safety precautions, or a downgrading of the quality of the renovation team due to diversity hiring, or an Islamic response to the Christchurch massacre.  At this point, I'm not even sure that it matters.  All of these instances are a manifestation of negligence, a lack of care, for priceless, holy monuments.  A rejection of spirituality, of ancestral wisdom.  A stubborn unwillingness to sufficiently safeguard that which has been gifted to us.  Of course, this also has symbolic relevance.  The death of Western Christianity, forsaking our own people spectacularly to protect the perception that we somehow embody high virtue.  If this symbolism were in a movie, I would call it trite.  We've lit our own house aflame, yet the greatest symbol of devotion remains untarnished.  It's as though we're being told, firmly, perhaps a last warning, that a return to Christianity is our only path to redemption.  This has become increasingly apparent to me as I watch this end stage of the West and as I try to resurrect my own relationship with God and with Catholicism.  More than anything, our cultural struggle is a spiritual one.  It's spiritual warfare.  I believe that evil festers and gains strength by identifying and exploiting weakness and fear.  In the West, one of our greatest weaknesses is our savior complex.  We want the world to think that we are so benevolent that we're constantly engaging in short-sighted nation building. And now listen to you, people from NATO.  You are bombing the wall that did not let the flow of African migration into Europe pass.  The wall that slowed down the terrorists of Al-Qaeda.  This wall was Libya.  You are destroying it.  You are idiots.  For thousands of migrants from Africa, for the support of Al-Qaeda, you will burn in hell.  And so it will be. This disastrous brand of foreign policy, of course, is also related to our fear and our fragile ego, the deep-seated fear of being viewed globally as intolerant, as bigoted, as racist.  Our ancestors would have laughed at the triviality of such a concept, and most modern nations outside of the West, particularly Asian nations, are puzzled by this obsession with political correctness at the direct expense of our well-being.  Blackpigeon made an excellent video about this.  I think he's made a few, but I've linked one in the description below.  This fear that we'll be seen as intolerant is the result of decades of social engineering.  Part of it is the widespread adoption of atheistic existential nihilism, which was a pervasive philosophy in France especially, but really afflicts all Western nations.  This belief that life is purposeless, that humanity doesn't inherently have value, that it doesn't reflect divinity.  It lends to individualism, to hedonism.  It rejects the value of religion, of collectivism, of national unity.  It has atomized us, but the ego remains.  As such, we don't identify with Western civilization, but are still individually sensitive to character judgments, like being called intolerant, because we cannot draw strength from our cultural achievements or our sense of unity.  This is a grave issue that has grown deep roots in Western culture.  Rolling Stone is garbage, but I think this article really sums it up.  How should France rebuild Notre Dame?  Much of the structure survived the blaze, but as rebuilding efforts move forward, the country will be left with a big question.  What does the cathedral mean to 21st century France?  For some people in France, Notre Dame has also served as a deep-seated symbol of resentment, a monument to a deeply flawed institution, and an idealized Christian European France that arguably never existed in the first place.  The building was so overburdened with meaning that its burning feels like an act of liberation.  If nothing else, the cathedral has been viewed by some as a stodgy reminder of the old city, the embodiment of the Paris of stone and faith.  The question becomes, which Notre Dame are you actually rebuilding?  Any rebuilding should be a reflection not of an old France, or the France that never was a non-secular white European France, but a reflection of the France of today, a France that is currently in the making.  The idea that you can recreate the building is naive.  It is to repeat past errors, category errors of thought, and one has to imagine that if anything is done to the building, it has to be an expression of what we want.  The Catholics of France, the French people, want.  What is an expression of who we are now?  What does it represent?  Who is it for?  The French Prime Minister has announced a competition for international architects to rebuild Notre Dame Spire.  He said the competition is designed to give the cathedral, quote, a spire adapted to the technologies and challenges of our times.  You heard that right.  An international competition to replace the spire.  No doubt it will be some modern monstrosity designed by a diversity hire praised by the French and the Western elite as superior in beauty and function.  I shouldn't even have to say this, but it's a slap in the face for the French to even consider using a non-French architect.  I made a video a few years back called, What Will It Take for Europeans to Push Back?  In one of these earlier videos, it might have been this one, I can't quite remember, I talk about the inevitability of losing these cultural monuments.  When there's a foreign invasion, they always target cultural and religious monuments to show the native population that they are now subjugated to the invaders' dominance.  This remains true even if the fire was accidental.  I believe that, accident or not, this may be a watershed moment.  The yellow vests have shown us that the French have retained a revolutionary spirit.  And I've seen many other encouraging signs that a spiritual connection to their culture, to their monuments, to their God, remain.  You are blessed among all women.  Christ, the Son of Man, is born.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, It seems that now is the time that we decide if we do right by our ancestors, if we'll retain our customs and our future, or if we will forsake them for a utopian vision of multiculturalism.  And it isn't just going to be maintaining monuments, halting immigration, and expelling migrants.  This spiritual connection that has been severed between the Western world and God must be restored.  It seems clearer now more than ever that a cultural return to Christianity, a rejection of radical individualism, and an embrace of unity of the collective of Western thought must become the dominant cultural zeitgeist again.  No more nihilism, no more atheism, no more hedonism.  If we cannot find a way to do this, I'd rather they leave the spire a burned out, hollow image of its former greatness because that is a more accurate representation of what the West has become if it cannot see that it has fallen to evil forces and needs to be redeemed.  I cannot bear to see a modern edition by a foreign architect grace France's most distinguished emblem of the gifts to the world of Christianity.  I am not by any means chastising people for turning away from Christianity.  I myself am guilty of this.  I've been on some half-assed atheist to agnostic journey for like a decade.  Spiritually listless, drifting, purposeless through life with a fair amount of resentment toward God on the days that I even believed.  But as this culture war reveals itself to really be a spiritual war, an epic war between good and evil, it has really made me reevaluate.  I'm starting to feel in my bones, not only the desire, but a burning necessity to find a spiritual path.  to return to Christianity, to fight for what's been lost and what has gone up in flames right before our eyes.  I don't think I'm alone in this as I'm seeing it happen a lot in this community.  I'm interested in hearing what you have to say because I have a real mix of the religious and the nihilistic in my audience.  So I would imagine this video is not going to be well received.  If you don't already have one, are you going to try to establish a spiritual existence?  Or does nihilism truly serve you?  Does this event and the events of the past few months feel like definitive turning points for the West, culturally and spiritually?  Let me know what you think below.

As part of the 1999 Avignon Festival, the theatrical musical group Royale de L'Eau organized a show written and performed by an African band.  The event took place on the 17th of July at 7pm.  Radio France Internationale, the global voice of France, was there to cover it, and specialist critics were invited to attend.  The concert was praised to the skies.  Suddenly, one of the guests displayed some professionalism and sincerity.  Although left-orientated, he renounced the precepts of political correctness.  He described the show as naively mediocre, boring, and full of cliches, and without even a hint of creativity.  adding that misleading advertisements had been used to promote the event, which also happened to be extremely expensive, 500 francs per seat.  He was insulted in front of the live audience and no longer given the floor.  He had committed the ultimate sin of blaspheming Africanism.  The conclusion is that the prevailing hegemonic, egalitarian, and most of all cosmopolitan ideology is not as equitable as it claims to be.  It is no longer a matter of advocating the equal ingenuity of all cultures, but to preach the superiority of all African, black, and even Muslim Arab cultures.  Are the rap and drill genres not, after all, as interesting, if not more so than Vivaldi's compositions?  And the contortions of hip-hop dancing more essential than a wide range of orchestral and popular European dances?  Are MC Solar and NTM not more creative than Braille?  And what about territorial tagging, such as those sloppy inscriptions used by ethnic gangs to mark their territory, the way dogs would mark theirs with piss?  Are they not the expression of a wounded creativity that challenges the stiff canons of European aesthetics?  This implicit discourse must be understood as a long-term project of devaluing the European personality, and casting its cultural and historical heritage into the void of oblivion.  The purpose is to turn Europeans into serfs on their own soil, leaving them stateless and without roots, thus replacing their identity with the colonising one.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The city of Paris hosted an exhibition on the Pont des Arts bridge featuring African artist mud sculptures, which received excessive praise from the media.

The French writer and philosopher Renaud Camus has been handed a two-year suspended prison sentence, as well as been given a \u20ac3,600 fine for his comments on immigration.  The criminal charges were based on his calling mass immigration an invasion.  So really, he was simply echoing the sentiments of the Czech president, Milos Zeman, who back in 2015 called the wave of refugees into Europe an, quote, organized invasion.  You may remember that Zeman, five years ago now, explained that the Muslim Brotherhood, lacking the resources to launch a military invasion on the continent, was sending wave after wave of migrants as an alternative force.  Five years on after the trail of death and destruction that Muslims have left in France, and this is still a controversial subject to talk about.  So just think about what that means for a moment.  A two month suspended prison sentence.  That's very serious.  Now the news reports that he will only avoid jail by paying a sum of euros, some are saying 1800, others are saying over 3000, I suppose that's yet to be decided, to two quote-unquote anti-racist organisations, one of which is SOS Racism, and the other is the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism.  The writer was charged with public incitement to hate or violence on the basis of origin, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion.  And the conviction stems from a November 2017 speech he delivered in Colombi Les Deux Eglises, in which he declared, quote, immigration has become an invasion, end quote. L'immigration est devenue invasion.  L'invasion, c'est une version migratoire. It appears the main contention with the speech was the following lines, quote, the irreversible colonization is demographic colonization by the replacement of the population.  The ethnic substitution, the great replacement, is the most important event in the history of our nation since it has existed.  As with other people, if the story continues, it will not be that of France, end quote.  He also called for a national consensus of resistance to oppose Islamization in the, quote, struggle for the salvation of our common civilization, Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, Greek, Latin, Judeo-Christian.  The part of Camus' speech that specifically garnered the attention of judges was when he talked about European people being replaced.  He said that mass immigration, quote, is the substitution, the tendency to substitute everything with its emulator, normalized, standardized, interchangeable, the original with its copy, the authentic with its imitation, the true with the false, the mothers with surrogate mothers, the culture with free time and entertainment, end quote.  France, of course, suffers Islamic terrorist attacks on such a routine basis now that it's barely even an important news story anymore.  Many of those terrorists are radicalised by mosques that entirely escape any police security, but Camus must be punished for his crime of opinion.  So he's going to have to pay more or less hate speech reparations to these two charities.  Again, we have SOS Racism and LICRA, which is the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism.  The anti-semitism, I believe, comes from a charge made by a one Yann Moir.  That was because back in 2017, Moi described Renaud Camus as a, quote, fairly anti-Semitic writer.  This incensed Camus so much that he decided to take legal action against the charge on the charges of slander.  Bizarrely, the court ruled actually on appeal in Camus' favour, but when this other gentleman... appealed the appeal, he in fact won, so Camus ended up having to pay out once again.  Interestingly, in this case, Yann Moix managed to win his appeal because the court decided that what he said about Camus, that is, calling him an anti-Semite, was just an opinion, and that his remarks fell from, quote, \"...the expression of an opinion and a value judgment on the personality of the civil party, and not the imputation of a specific  fact.\".  In other words, one can now qualify someone as anti-Semitic without evidence on the sole basis of words lent, reported or even invented.  Camus' lawyer, a one Johann Riemow, said that basically it doesn't matter the truth, it doesn't matter whether Camus is anti-Semitic or not in the eyes of the Cassation judge.  So I suppose the way to really understand this is as France's version of Count Dankula, except the content of what Camus is talking about is immensely serious.  It is an allegation of population exchange, which makes it a civic rights issue that affects us all.  So he's a damn hero for doing this.  It's brave for him to say this, certainly in intellectual public life, because he is a very prominent figure in France.  Here's the situation, gang.  We're being demographically replaced, and it's now a punishable offence to say as such.  Really, my belief here is very simple.  It's a question of safety in numbers.  You must push yourself to have the confidence to talk about the Great Replacement.  Now, obviously, you ought to be judicious.  Don't do it in the workplace.  But the best thing you can do to support people like Camus is, as Shakespeare said, you've got to screw your courage to the sticking point, okay?  The rapid demographic changes are very serious, and what we are now talking about is actually a major human rights issue.  This situation has long crossed into the realm of the highly criminal.  And what really upsets me about this, with regards to Camus, is what a lovely gentleman he is.  There's nothing remotely antagonistic, aggressive, violent-minded, or threatening about what he says.  And frankly, it shouldn't make any difference if there were.  So please, if you wish, um... Just show your support for Camus, follow him on Twitter, like and retweet what he has to say, send him a message and tell him that you are sorry to hear about the ruling.  It's a disgrace.  How can this be after everything that France, in particular, has gone through in the past decade plus?  Do you remember seeing those photographs from Nice on the evening of the Bastille celebrations?  It was essentially a long stretch of road on the seafront with these indiscriminate scattered lumps covered in canvas or tarpaulin.  So keep in mind that even in the face of so much death, even as the streets are splattered with blood, it is a criminal offence to talk about it.  Frankly, I'm no longer even buying into the political correctness line.  Undoubtedly, people are afraid and frightened to talk about this, and political correctness plays a considerable role in that.  But frankly, that is no longer a satisfactory answer.  Something very peculiar is going on here.  And I think that there is a self-conscious effort to see white Europeans demographically replaced.  I think it's deliberate.  And Camus is such a nice man.  I mean, I've not met him, I don't know him, but nothing I've ever read of his at all has ever come across as even remotely belligerent or irate.  He doesn't even come across as resentful.  Not that you could blame him if he did.  He comes across as someone immensely warm and amicable, but just somebody who's very genuinely concerned.  He's worried.  How can it be that it's criminal to talk about population replacement?  You know, something that gets me about that Douglas Murray book, The Strange Death of Europe, That was number one in Amazon for weeks.  For weeks and weeks.  Now what does the death of Europe mean?  It means murder.  It's an admission of genocide without ever having the balls to use the word genocide.  So long as they can prosecute outspoken figures such as Camus, so long this will continue to be an issue.  But they can't prosecute everybody.  Not if everybody is talking about it.  Not if everybody is rallying against it and accusing it for what it is.  He's done nothing wrong.  And he's brave.  And it's time that you are brave also.  The Islamisation of our continent is unacceptable.  There's really nothing more or less to add to that comment.  It's unacceptable.  This is now outright population replacement.  There are only so many years you can angst and lament about it before you must come to the conclusion that actually the absence of any real attempt to deal with this crisis means it must be wanted.  It must be.  You don't continue to encourage and finance this kind of immigration unless you want to see the host population disappear.  And that changes the situation, from a major inconvenience to a genuine existential threat.  From now on, anyone that makes excuses for this, I will consider an enemy.  I consider you not only a willing participant, but an active author in genocide.  As I said in other videos, the forces behind this are powerful.  They are very powerful and very rich, but they are not omnipotent.  And the major blunder they continue to make is thinking of themselves as God.  There is only one God and he died on the cross.  I'm afraid there's really nothing more I can tell you about this story other than it's a travesty and immensely disappointing.  Give Camus a follow, give him a tweet, lend him some support.  And I'd also really recommend his website.  It's called the National Council of European Resistance, and I'll put a link to the website below.  The National Council of European Resistance aims to bring together qualified personalities, French and European, Here you can find almost all of Camus' speeches, both in French and English.  There are quite a number of videos of him delivering them.  There are also speeches by a number of other individuals.  If you are interested in reading his speeches, one in particular I would recommend is called I Have Long Backed Away From Words.  You can also contact the Centre directly.  I believe you can also join.  The only caveat I will offer is that of course I hesitate to ever fully endorse anything that I'm not entirely familiar with myself.  I've had a really good look over the website, I can't see any obvious links to any nefarious Israeli funding sources.  But since there is a photograph of Tommy Robinson on the front page, I just wanted to be open and clear about that.  That might well put some people off, so proceed with caution.  What I did see recently is that Renaud Camus will be appearing at this year's American Renaissance conference.  So it does mean that he at least has the endorsement of Jared Taylor, who I think a lot of people consider to be a very respectable and noble, trustworthy individual.  So that gives me confidence.  I think it's at least a good place to start reading more about the Great Replacement specifically.  It seems to be specifically focused on population replacement, which is good because it's starting to change the language from that of just immigration to language of actual either colonisation or actual form of soft genocide.  I think that's important for the next step.  We will need that language.  They have, I believe, Facebook and Twitter pages, so follow them on there.  They have just short of 10,000 followers at the moment, which is not nearly enough, so get your arses on it.  Again, I wish I could offer you something more substantial in light of this story, but I'm afraid that's really the long and the short of it.  I'll obviously keep my eye on the story in the following weeks and update you if there's any significant news.  So really, that's it for now.  Have a peaceful evening. And Europe is 100 times more colonized, and more seriously, than it has ever colonized itself.  Irreversible colonization is demographic colonization.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"Renaud Camus, a French writer and philosopher, has been handed a two-year suspended prison sentence and a \u20ac3,600 fine for calling mass immigration an invasion.

We speak of vanishing cultures as if such vanishing were a natural process for which no one were responsible, the customary sequence of time and progress that comes at last to all civilizations.  but only a tiny fraction of the mass settlement on European soil this past decade has been on organic development.  For the most part, the forced importation of a hostile and predatory fifth column has been a deliberate and strategic campaign against the express wishes of the citizenry.  A crisis brought about by the cataclysmic union of Islamo-Bolshevism, a barbaric death cult, and a fanatic, Soviet-styled war machine, each the other's equal in greed and militant orthodoxy.

But the inverse of that is needing quiet and understanding the importance of silence.  Dramatic pause.  I've really been enjoying doing my interviews.  my focus has shifted to conversations as opposed to stream of consciousness type stuff for the last little while and people have been really enjoying that and I feel that to a great degree these conversations offer something of meaning to people in a way that my vlog videos don't really.  Sometimes my vlog videos can feel a little self-indulgent and when I watch them back I find myself cringing.  I've been told by lots of other creators that this is normal to feel kind of cringy about yourself.  Especially when you listen to yourself back or watch yourself back.  That is totally normal.  But it's an uncomfortable feeling.  And the other thing is that my platforms are growing.  I just hit 30k on this channel.  So thank you everyone for subscribing and being along for the ride here with me.  It's almost been two years now that I've been making videos on this channel.  So I mean I'm just... I'm overwhelmed with the support sometimes that I feel like I'm not an adequate individual to have a platform.  I don't want to just repeat what other people say and be a mouthpiece for other people's talking points.  But the other side of this is that as my channel grows and as my platform grows, I attract a lot more sort of hatefulness, maybe hatefulness isn't the right word.  And people, lots of people out there don't like me.  And that's, that's totally fine.  Normally, I don't let negative comments get to me too much.  But sometimes they do.  Sometimes it's, you know, I don't like, I don't like blocking people.  I don't like banning people.  But at this point, It's it feels like an act of self-preservation because I don't really know Who was going to be spiteful.  who's gonna just like report me or you know?  Try and get a strike on my channel and rather than engaging and giving them ammunition It's easier for me to just ban.  It doesn't feel good though.  Like it sucks the joy out of the channel in a way That you know, I I feel like I. I have to be protective of it because I know, I know at some point, you know, as soon as this channel is noticed, it's probably going to be, I don't know if, if it'll be banned or not, but it seems like people who have, um, you know, been center of like more, more left of center than, than I am politically have been banned.  So I know it's a possibility.  Um, and that, that, You know, I should just be grateful and I am very grateful.  But there is this kind of like creeping dread that comes with the channel growth.  I feel like I can't fully enjoy it in a way because I know every, every so many subscribers is like that much closer to a hit piece or, you know, someone, me rubbing someone the wrong way and them sort of having an ax to grind with me.  suppose these are just.  this is just what it means to be a right-wing commentator.  you know it's just kind of comes with the territory and I'm a sensitive.  I'm a sensitive lady.  I let things get under my skin.  I don't have a thick skin really and it gets me down and sometimes I just feel the need to retreat turn off the camera and just like zip my lid.  because Yeah, it's an immense feeling of responsibility.  You know, that I don't want to be saying things that are wrong or things that are misleading or that are harmful to people.  My dedication is to the truth, but I know I can make mistakes.  So there's a heaviness sometimes with regard to what I'm doing here.  But 30k.  I mean, that's really cool.  I mean, I had to just... pop on here and say thank you to everyone who has subscribed and supported the channel thus far.  it's been wild growing kind of with a community of people in public for the past couple years.  I hope that it continues to grow in a positive direction.  that can be a rising tide which lifts many ships.  um Doesn't silence... I mean, I like my long dramatic pauses.  They... There's kind of a... There's an energetic potential sometimes in pauses.  You know?  Um... everything has a flip side.  you know there's good and there's evil there's light and then there's darkness and there's the creative force.  you know that I often feel that I'm channeling when I speak to you guys unedited here on this channel.  and then the inverse of that is this just this sort of silent pausing that just happens you know and it'll pass and I'll feel the need to speak, I'm sure, again, eventually.  The other thing, actually, that has made me want to pause, I think, is I don't wanna just be this kind of person who's just reeing into the void.  It's tiresome being like, oh, look at this evil, demonic thing that's happening.  Look at this crazy, insane thing that's happening.  Is that offering something good to the community?  I don't think it is.  I think it's just like raising people's cortisol levels and making my blood pressure too high.  That's why I'm kind of switching more towards the internship view style.  I feel like I'm adding something of value more so with those.  And so I have some interesting things coming up in the next, this week and next week for you guys.  So keep your eyes peeled for them.  If you haven't subscribed yet, I've noticed in my analytics that there are a lot of people who watch but who haven't clicked the subscribe button, so do me a favor and subscribe to my channel, please.  Give this very wishy-washy and trademark CC video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it.  I hope everyone's having a great week so far, and I'll talk to you soon.  Take care.  Bye.","channel.id":"clxmi0oti02mtcdviesy1mxcf","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC_N4L2B-g2hZ9OPVdkmthGw","channel.name":"Robyn Riley","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJX46rNQ9L_R4Ki7TAvk0urxfzOAIkkomRsq2t4gsw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2011-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The creator of this channel has taken a step back from vlog-style videos, instead focusing on interviews and conversations.

In today's video, we're going to explore a few of the reasons behind why it seems that celebrities are losing their influence.  Now granted, a number of celebrities still do hold a level of influence, some more than others.  But interestingly enough, the studies are showing that social media influencers now hold more sway over their fans than traditional celebrities when it comes to marketing deals.  And as for political influence, we all remember how many big name celebrities Hillary Clinton trotted out over the course of her campaign.  Katy Perry, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Oprah, Lena Dunham, and so on.  But their endorsements proved to fall flat in the end.  Trump, on the other hand, was only endorsed by a few celebrities, but he still took the victory.  Roughly 60% of Americans say stars' public causes won't impact their personal midterm choices, a 2018 Hollywood Reporter Morning Consult poll found.  But most won't boycott films or TV either.  Respondents don't think the views of celebrities impact them, with only 24% saying that performers are very or somewhat effective at swaying them politically.  Only 11% of those surveyed say they've made a donation or volunteered for a cause because a star has encouraged them to do so.  Celebrities don't have much influence, says Alex Conant, a Republican political strategist who worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.  If anything, from a Republican perspective, being attached by a liberal celebrity can be a badge of honor.  Democrats, 55%, are seen by respondents as far more likely than Republicans, 31%, to be influenced by celebrity opinions.  From what I can discern, one of the biggest reasons why the spell of celebrity adoration seems to be breaking is social media.  The reason for this is that by having a Twitter account, for example, the true personalities of the celebrities are put on full display for all the world to see exposing many of them for the insufferable and oftentimes cruel NPCs that they are.  Rosanna Arquette, I'm sorry I was born white and privileged.  It disgusts me and I feel so much shame.  Peter Henry Fonda, we should rip Barron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if his mother will stand up against the giant asshole she is married to.  Kathy Griffin, about the Covington Catholic Boys, tweeted, The reply from the school was pathetic and impotent.  Name these kids.  Shame them.  If you think these effers wouldn't dox you in a heartbeat, think again.  Sarah Silverman.  effing white people.  Debra Messing, in response to the news that Trump would appear at a Beverly Hills fundraiser during Emmys week, she called for all the attendees to essentially be doxxed.  Please print a list of all attendees, please.  The public has a right to know.  Pop singer Madonna, who said in a profanity-laced speech at the Women's March in Washington, DC in 2017, that she had thought about, quote, blowing up the white house lena dunham sitting here contemplating how white men literally cry so hard when they're cancelled lol bett midler.  women are the n-word of the world raped beaten enslaved married off worked like dumb animals denied education and inheritance enduring the pain and danger of childbirth and life in silence for thousands of years.  They are the most disrespected creatures on earth.  Robert De Niro has lashed out at stupid Donald Trump, admitting, I'd like to punch him in the face.  I mean, he is so blatantly stupid.  He's a punk, a dog, he's a pig.  says a visibly angry De Niro in the Vice exclusive video.  Brie Larson, I don't want to hear what a white man has to say about a wrinkle in time.  I want to hear what a woman of color or a biracial woman has to say about the film.  I want to hear what teenagers think about the film.  Johnny Depp, when was the last time an actor assassinated a president?  Depp's joke in reference to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth in 1865 was made during an appearance at the glastonbury festival.  i want to qualify.  i am not an actor i lie for a living he added at the uk music festival.  however it has been a while and maybe it is time youtubers influencers or whatever you prefer to call them.  they generally get famous on the other hand due to their personalities for example somebody like PewDiePie, or for their ability to offer something of value to their viewers, humorous videos, how-to videos, and analytical videos in regards to entertainment, news, and so on.  YouTubers and social media influencers are oftentimes a lot more relatable than celebrities, not to mention many of them.  allow for a lot less distance between them and their fans, which makes it easier for their fans to create a genuine bond with them.  There also exists a ton of hypocrisy in celebrity circles nowadays.  For example, they order us to take in millions of quote-unquote refugees while simultaneously living safely inside the walls of giant gated mansions.  Or they preach to us about the dangers of climate change while simultaneously taking private jets everywhere they go.  While it's certainly part of human nature to fail to live up to one's own principles every now and again, publicly advocating for something while also publicly doing the exact opposite definitely isn't a good look.  Not to mention, the average person just detests pompous artificiality, no matter how famous and rich the person spewing it might be.  I also think that, as a part of human nature, we desire role models to look up to, to admire, and perhaps even to mimic.  In the past, when we didn't have social media, there wasn't much opportunity for us to see the true character of celebrities.  Interviews weren't ideal as they're often edited and many of the questions are pre-approved.  So as a result, many people liken celebrities' personalities to those of the characters they played in their films.  In fact, it still happens even nowadays.  Seeing people actually refer to Chris Evans as Captain America on Twitter is cringeworthy to say the least.  The characters of celebrities in the past were shrouded in a lot more mystery than they are nowadays, so even if back then they were secretly insufferable and cruel, few would have known it.  Fortunately for us, though, nowadays social media has completely shattered this illusion.  While of course you still do have some people who remain blind, who hang on to each and every word that their favourite celebrity utters, There are many other people who have snapped out of it, and who are choosing not to make role models out of the people that our degenerate, soulless, and broken society upholds as heroes.  I personally find the shift away from celebrity worship to be a great and also kind of unsurprising thing.  It's perfectly understandable why people would want a real person to look up to and admire, rather than a carefully crafted NPC.  And it's also perfectly understandable why people would want genuine role models, not just in what they say, but also in what they do.  On the other hand, though, I do have to admit that I don't judge too harshly the people who who do choose to look up to celebrities and the like, even if I find it to be a bad thing.  Because as I mentioned previously, we naturally crave role models.  And the sad truth is that we have very few good role models, very few strong and upright leaders in our society today.  So in the same way that when our culture of victimhood started running out of problems to fix, it created false problems to tackle in their stead, when we started running out of good role models, We created false role models to worship in their stead.

The thousands of Norwegians and Swedes who used to live there all moved to other areas and were replaced by other ethnicities, who were themselves replaced by the Chinese. However, each May, the Nordic-Americans all flock back to their former home for a parade in which they celebrate their Viking heritage as well and Norwegian pride. There are also Nordic sports bars still running on 65th street where everyone meets after the parade for Lapskaus, beer and Norwegian folk music. \n\nFeaturing special guest: @Brute Norse\n\nThis channel depends on your support:\nPatreon: https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/survivethejive\nSubscribeStar: https:\/\/www.subscribestar.com\/survive-the-jive\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/survivethejive\nCrypto: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3ysmtvk\nGAB - https:\/\/gab.com\/StJ","publish_date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":["Norway","Bay ridge","Brooklyn","leif eriksson","Vikings","Nordic","Nordic people","Norwegian-Americans","New York","Lapskaus Boulevard","17th may","ethnic minorities","American culture","Norwegian culture","Rosemaling","parade","NYC","Nasjonaldagen","the leif","Swedish-American","norsk"],"length":972,"views":32370,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zl2-zKbnAi0\/sddefault.jpg?v=5ceeb621","yt_channel_id":"UCZAENaOaceQUMd84GDc26EA","transcripts":"Not the first place you would expect to see a runestone, yet here in Bay Ridge there's a park named after the Viking explorer Leif Erikson who discovered America, and there's a runestone erected in his honour.  There's even a local pub called the Leif.  and inside there are Americans who are celebrating their Norwegian heritage. Why?  I'm in New York City.  Why are there Viking boats coming around?  Well, here's the person to talk to you, old Norse philologist, Erik St\u00f8resund.  Can you help us understand what on earth is happening with all these Norwegian flags and Viking boats and such? Well, so this is the Norway Day Parade, which is an annual event commemorating the Norwegian national holiday of Satnamai.  Hurrah for Satnamai!  Hurrah!  17th of May, not actually on the 17th of May, but in the weekend that follows after it.  And we are here in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, formerly the hub of the Norwegian diaspora in America, in what used to be essentially a Norwegian ghetto. It used to be a Norwegian ghetto, but it's not anymore? No.  Well, the Norwegian diaspora has been dispersed across America.  Many people live in Staten Island or the other boroughs.  There used to be 85,000 Norwegians living in Brooklyn, I believe, in the past. And you yourself are kind of a Norwegian-American now, but you're not like these older communities.  What's it like?  What's the difference between a Norwegian immigrant like yourself and these older communities of Norwegian-Americans hyphenated identity Americans? Yeah, I'll say that the Norwegian Americans currently are a bit of a time capsule.  Many of them have, of course, or they have all culturally assimilated into American culture, but they still retain some of the elements of kind of old-timey Norwegian spirituality, aesthetics, modes of thought, perhaps.  But yeah, it's a very interesting hodgepodge of different cultures here. So Irma, I really love this Norwegian costume.  Did you buy this in Norway or did you? My mother bought the pieces and she brought it over here to put it together and embroidered it.  My mother did. And was your mother a first generation immigrant? Yes, she was from Stavanger. Where, sorry? From Stavanger.  And my father also from Kristiansand.  They came in 1923 and 28. This is a wonderful folk costume from Norway.  Can you tell me how you got hold of this and why you're wearing it? When I was a young man and used to go to a lot of weddings, I realized I didn't know how to dance.  So there was an advertisement up in the Euroclub and it said, Norwegian folk dancing.  I was 21 years old.  I said, you know what?  I'm going to go to that.  So I went to Norwegian folk dances and they taught me how to dance.  And while I was there, not only did I meet many people that knew my parents, but I became involved with Norwegian folk dancing for four or five years.  When I went to Norway in that period, my grandmother took me to someone that was a retired woman that actually made these costumes.  So she drove up to the mountainside.  and she measured me for the costume and she sent me the costume.  and that's how I have it. Why was it important for you as an American to remember your Norwegian roots? Well, it was always at home.  I learned the language early.  And our area was very inundated with Scandinavia.  This whole area was all Norwegians.  And you used to live there?  I used to live on 51st Street.  Yes, I grew up here in Brooklyn.  Went to school, and most of the children I went to school with were Scandinavian heritage.  First-generation Americans. Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, a lot of them.  When did that start to define you, then? Well, you know, I guess in the 60s, people started moving out of the city into the suburbs.  The influx, I think, were Puerto Ricans coming in, and I think everybody got a little scared.  I don't know why.  It was kind of foolish.  And they all left, all the Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, Irish.  The only ones that stayed were the Italians and the Jews, and they are still here. They can't be moved.  was it like when you were young?  like growing up in a norwegian community in brooklyn was a lot of like uh ethnic solidarity among like the norwegian people with norwegian descent around here. well i was born in brooklyn uh but we moved to staten island when i was two years old.  but i remember a lot about my youth.  and and right back in those days there's all kinds of uh norwegian uh commercial stores whether it's uh we had the usual we had a bakery We had a grocery store.  We had a convenience store.  And so as children, when my father would play soccer on Sundays, we were here every Sunday.  And we mixed with the other children of the soccer players.  And we were all over the neighborhood having fun.  But it was mostly all Norwegian at that time.  The 8th Avenue that we're close to right here was called Lapskers Boulevard.  Right.  And that's still referred to that among the older people that lived it.  And just as much as, I mean, just as strong a hold as the Chinese have on it today, that's how the Norwegians were back in those days.  Very strong.  Everybody knows about it in those days. In the suburbs, have the Norwegians and other Scandinavians retained the sense of identity? Yes, we have in Rockaway Township and Lake Telemark, basically Norwegian, yes.  They came out there as summer homes.  They bought these little cottages, and that's what my parents did too.  They bought an acre of land up there for $250.  Wow.  And they built a little cottage there, and they had that there for many years.  And then they put an addition on, and I still live there. Does Staten Island have a similar kind of Norwegian community in it now as the Chinese have here? No, I would say most of all that has grown older and moved away.  But when we did move from Brooklyn to Staten Island, we moved into a community called Annadale, which is mostly Norwegian and Swedish people.  Right.  And then there's another place in Jersey called Lake Telemark.  Yeah.  And a lot of Norwegians moved to Lake Telemark.  So I guess you kind of try to culturally maybe stay connected in some way, make you feel more comfortable with the culture that you know and are familiar with. Do you reckon it's the case that these guys here have accentuated the importance of Vikings to Norwegian identity compared to Norwegians back in the motherland? Well, they're certainly very hung up on Vikings, I suppose, because it provides a second layer to a myth of origin to them.  Not only are they Norwegian, but there's this pride that Leif Erikson came over from Scandinavia and discovered America, essentially.  So they're very hung up on those kinds of symbols. So Leif is a much more important symbol here than in Norway? Oh, absolutely, yeah. And that's why there's Leif Erikson Park around the corner, right? Yeah.  There's... How do I even phrase this?  I think that there's also an element in the Scandinavian-American diaspora that they cling to a lot of these national symbols and what I assume to be a search for a rootedness that American culture simply doesn't really provide.  and so they sometimes it comes across as a little bit campy and kitschy.  you got about a bit of this uh uh tourist shop norwegian-ness here that i originally yeah that originally had a very ironic and distanced relationship to.  but when i first came here last year i realized that this is actually a very like real and profound expression to these people.  I came here kind of ironically at first, but at the end of the day I thought it was very heartwarming in many regards.  Many probably feel and at least hope that the resurgence and interest in Norse culture works to their benefit because I think that Scandinavian Americans have felt a little bit ignored that their culture is seen as corny and out of fashion.  so I noticed that they're definitely trying to hinge on to the different pop cultural stuff that is going on.  You have Disney's Frozen.  They're milking that for what they can. Yeah, we just saw someone dressed as Elsa walking past. And you've got, of course, the TV series Vikings.  So it's all very exoteric stuff.  And the diaspora is aging.  I am afraid that I don't see a lot of people my age at these sorts of events.  But there's certainly a lot of passion going on from their parents and grandparents' generation still around. After the parade, everyone makes their way to 65th Street, where the Nordic sports bars are serving beer, hot dogs and lapskovs. Do you think it's important as an American to remember your ties to the old country? Well, for me, yes, because I was actually born in Brooklyn, but my mother says I was conceived on the boat on the way over.  Wow.  So it was a little rock and roll on the Atlantic Ocean at the time. It's a long journey.  You've got to pass the time.  Yeah. And there was no television maybe back in those days.  I don't know.  But the thing is, I have so many relatives in Norway, and it's been such a pleasure in my life to go back to Norway as often as I've been, which is almost 30 times.  And my relatives and I have treated us so well over there, and I've developed friendships.  And I have some friendships in Norway even closer than my relatives.  So it's been nice to go over there, to be able to speak the language there, my brother and I, and to mix with the local, just the friends, just the neighbors.  And we still have lifelong friendships going on to this day.  So it is very important to me about my Norwegian heritage.  I'm very proud to be an American, but my Norwegian heritage is very important to me.  It's been a very big influence in my life.  And I'm very proud of both cultures.  Very proud of both cultures. I was lying, I know you, standing high, falling with you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. I'm Roethan Roosmaling.  I've been doing this since I was 11 years old.  I was very fortunate to grow up in a Sons of Norway lodge here in America.  I'm third generation.  Norwegian-American or American-Norwegian, American first, but I'm one part Vestland and three parts S\u00f8rland.  and when I was 11 my parents put me in a rose smiling class with my grandparents and I enjoyed it and then I didn't do anything else with it until I was about 15 when my father started making hopches, clocks and cordon of cabinets and said we're in business.  I do commission work, I do all sorts of styles, I put stuff on the internet because I feel it's very important for people to have a connection with where they came from.  We're very fortunate in the fact that we have that connection.  In fact, the bunad that I'm wearing right now is a replica of my great-grandmother's bunad from Cisnes, outside of Bergen.  And my grandmother was the one who made it for me when I was in my early 20s.  My children also wear bunads.  But I think being American, it's sometimes strange to think People back in the old country will say, well, why do you still have this connection?  Well, it's important for us to have that connection because we need to know where we came from in order to appreciate where we are here, but also appreciate where our grandparents or our great-grandparents came from and their heritage.  It's part of what makes America wonderful is that you have this background that all kind of ties together.  And there's so many similarities.  It doesn't matter if you're Norwegian or if you're... Chinese or if you're a Muslim or wherever.  we all have similar paths that brought us here.  but what makes us so strong and what ties us is to know where we came from.  so to have this background and to share it is very important to me and because the only way art forms live is if you share it.  so that's kind of what I do and that's kind of my process right now is not only do am I fortunate enough to do it as a partial living but I am fortunate enough to share it with others. The presence here of symbols of Celtic pride may seem incongruous, but this is due to the fact that the Nordic Americans blended very heavily with the Brooklyn Irish. And why do you think it is like the Italian Americans and the Irish Americans kind of, it seems like they're more prominent culturally in America than the Norwegians or Scandinavian Americans in general? I think maybe they're just a little louder. I don't know.  In Irish populations you have like the institution of the bar and things like that that you can actually settle around.  And in some areas you even have like very much, you know, a living folk music tradition.  When Scandinavians moved to America, I think that they didn't really bring a lot of the folk music with them necessarily, so that does not really survive as an offshoot here.  You have people who are interested in that sort of stuff and do folk dancing and that sort of thing, but you don't find the same sort of like worship of those elements of culture.  Many of those people were kind of puritanical as well, you know? Yeah, that's interesting. And it came at the peak of a religious revival in the late 1800s and early 1900s. And do you think that in the future, Americans of Scandinavian descent will continue to celebrate their heritage? I think so, yes.  But of course, it's dying out because now the generations are moving into other ethnic groups.  I see with my neighbors, one girl has moved into a Turkish family.

The community has a strong connection to their Norwegian roots, with many retaining elements of old-timey Norwegian spirituality, aesthetics, and modes of thought. The diaspora has dispersed across America, but in areas like Staten Island and Lake Telemark, Norwegian communities still exist.\n\nThe Norwegian-American community in the US has a unique identity, with a strong emphasis on Viking culture and symbols like Leif Erikson. This is partly due to a search for rootedness in American culture, which they feel doesn't provide enough connection to their heritage. They're also trying to capitalize on the current popularity of Norse culture, with Disney's Frozen and the TV series Vikings.\n\nAs the diaspora ages, the younger generation is less involved in these cultural events. However, the passion and pride of the older generation still shine through. The community's connection to their heritage is essential, as it allows them to appreciate their background and the paths that brought them to America.\n\nThe blending of cultures in the US has led to the presence of Celtic pride symbols in the Nordic-American community, due to their heavy interaction with the Brooklyn Irish. The community's cultural expression may seem campy or kitschy, but it's a genuine and profound expression of their identity.\n\nIn the future, Americans of Scandinavian descent will likely continue to celebrate their heritage, but it will gradually dissipate as generations move into other ethnic groups and the old-timers pass away.","responses":"[1] Culture: Mentions the Norwegian-American community and their cultural heritage.\n[1] Identity: Discusses the unique identity of the Norwegian-American community and their search for rootedness in American culture.\n[1] Heritage: Refers to the community's strong connection to their Norwegian roots and their efforts to preserve their cultural identity.\n[1] Community: Describes the Norwegian-American community in the US and their cultural events.\n[1] Ethnicity: Mentions the blending of cultures in the US, specifically the interaction between the Nordic-American community and the Brooklyn Irish.\n[1] Tradition: Refers to the community's cultural expression and their efforts to preserve their heritage.\n[1] Assimilation: Discusses the gradual dissipation of the community's cultural identity as generations move into other ethnic groups.\n[1] Diaspora: Discusses the dispersal of the Norwegian-American community across America."}

That's back when we thought they were more serious than the unicorn onesies.  We actually thought they were a little bit more serious when they threatened us first.  So we took those threats rather more seriously.  But one of the things they told us at the time that the National Party was found in June, in November of 2016, is that we would not exist for very long.  We are still here. And we are stronger than we ever were before. A defined territory is crucial for the survival of an ethnic group.  The passionate relationship between a people and its homeland has been constant throughout history.  A people can suffer many setbacks, but as long as it retains its own territorial space, it can recover. The most important principle that should guide us not only ideologically, but also strategically going forward, is the first principle, principle number one.  Because principle number one, it's about the reintegration of the national territory.  It's about that.  the National Party believes that the territory of Ireland consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.  But I want to say this to you, the National Party principle number one, The scope of that principle extends even beyond that wording.  It's not just about the territorial reunification of this country.  It's not just about the final ending of foreign British rule in the six counties of this country.  It's not just about that.  It's not just about taking back our fishing waters, re-establishing Irish sovereignty over the whole country.  It's about bringing about the unity of the Irish people. The main reason that I became involved in the National Party was because I was heartened by the dedication of the people that I met at Barrow Street, the people that I met at Tuesla and at the various protests who were from the National Party. Most Western countries now follow a policy of multiculturalism, which is a construct whose credibility was dismissed long ago.  The one thing that we do know is that tribalism is endemic to our species.  History has proven that races and cultures have absolutely no interest in integration.  and the stark difference between communities only causes fear, distrust and violence. If you want change and you can't affect it, what happens?  You get direct action, you get desperation, you get marching, you get all sorts of violence.  We in the National Party are not about that.  We're going to fight back, but we will do so in the political arena. The penny has dropped with an awful lot of people who previously didn't seem to know what was happening or maybe they thought they were playing the cute game, letting other people put their necks on the line.  The problem is it isn't up to other people.  We have to make the move ourselves. This country is all we have.  There is nowhere else. Unity of the Irish people, I have to say, and we all know our history, that has been sadly lacking for too many centuries at this stage.  We're a great race of people, the Irish nation, but no race of people is without its flaws.  One flaw that must be overcome.  It is a flaw that has been exploited by others, that has enabled others to come over here and to conquer and to colonise and pillage and rape and steal and subjugate our country for centuries.  And that was division.  This country has been riven with division.  Not only the division, the physical division, but the territorial division between the 26 counties and the 6 counties.  The division between the green and the orange.  The divisions that occurred back in 1922 because of the treaty.  The divisions between people who have allowed establishment political parties, now globalist political parties, to use the mass media, to use the Griggs system, to manipulate public opinion, and we have people divided. Diversity is not a strength.  In fact, it's the polar opposite.  Diversity and division are the same word.  It's hidden.  It's hidden in plain sight. Division.  That's our flaw.  And the National Party is about correcting that flaw.  Because the National Party is about the national idea.","channel.id":"clxmi0oem02c5cdvifvlaufkb","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxgY69mo_nUGuCDo1yPygng","channel.name":"The National Party \u2014 An P\u00e1irt\u00ed N\u00e1isi\u00fanta","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"IE","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU7ivwQD99tz4V9BIwbUF8E9SWhYm3UPSK5N4O2EA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The National Party believes in the reintegration of Ireland's national territory, encompassing the whole island, its islands, and territorial seas.

I'd like to tell you this, that every one of our MPs knows about this case.  I have seen the documentation from the House of Commons Library that actually there's three pages discussing this case and putting links out to videos of myself and Robin Tilbrook talking about the case.  Now what's the issue and why am I putting out this message to you?  Quite simply, people, they are stopping any media coverage of this case.  The reason is because the case is a very good case that we left the European Union on the 29th of March 2019 by law.  Not just a normal everyday statute, an ordinary statute.  No, a constitutional statute.  And all Chief Justice laws in the Metric Martyr case and the Gina Miller case confirm that we are correct.  Now, the European Withdrawal Act of 2017 was 137 words.  It was simple.  to the point and it repealed the European Communities Act of 1972.  That particular act was elevated to constitutional status by the referendum, the second referendum that we've had in this country, reference this point.  and let me tell you saying people, we did leave on the 29th of March 2019 at 11pm.  They are trying to run us out of money.  They are trying to hide the facts from the public.  and What can I say?  This video is for you to understand.  Please go to www.defendbrexit.com.  Richard Tilbrook is a solicitor.  Two of the advocates, lawyers, barristers are from Lawyers for Britain.  They are highly capable barristers and the government have employed external QCs to try and defend this case.  It's very difficult to defend simple law.  So that's it people, please donate, please get the message out there and please contact the BBC, Channel 4 and all of the others to get this message out there because what's going on at the moment is pure propaganda.  What they are withholding is the news from the High Court that this case is there, that this case has much, much support, and that we left on the 29th of March 2019. at 11pm.  Thank you very much and with that I will say please visit the website defendbrexit.com and obviously all donations to this crowdfunding court case which will succeed.

From classical times right into the early modern era, it was believed that they were the original indigenous peoples of Europe.  Although the ancient Celts themselves never made that claim.  more so than any other ethnic group in Europe, the truth of the Celts, through a combination of their mystical folklore, the popularity of Romanticism in Britain in the 19th century, and the need among regional nationalists to define themselves in opposition to the dominant culture of Britain, has been grossly distorted.  The author of Lord of the Rings, J.R.R.  Tolkien, wrote, Celtic is a magic bag into which anything may be put and out of which almost anything may come.  Anything is possible in the fabulous Celtic twilight which is not so much a twilight of the gods as of the reason.  The problem stems in large part from the fact that Celt sometimes refers to indigenous Northwest Europeans who formerly spoke or do now speak insular Celtic languages while also referring to an historical ethno-linguistic culture on the continent which encompassed many diverse peoples.  Sometimes people get these two things confused.  Modern genetic science has proven that the Celtic language speakers were not a prehistoric people, nor were they a homogenous racial group.  Rather, Celtic culture originated in Central Europe, where its language and art spread out over the Iron Age and was adopted by diverse races from Anatolia to Ireland.  Even the Insular Celts of Britain and Ireland do not constitute a homogenous genetic group, which makes sense historically, since the Insular Celtic nations were constantly at war with each other.  For example, the Irish took Cornish slaves and invaded Scotland.  The old dichotomy of Germanic versus Celtic blood doesn't make much sense when you consider that the land now known as Germany was in fact a heartland for Celtic culture long before it arrived in Britain.  What most people call Celtic blood is really British and Irish blood, and if we are to speak of Germanic blood, it ought really to refer to Nordic, not German, since Germanic languages come from Denmark when Germany was largely Celtic.  Confused yet?  Archaeologists of the 19th century figured out that Austria had the oldest identifiably Celtic types of art, and subsequent discoveries have proven that Austria, Switzerland, Czechia and Germany were the oldest homelands of the Celts.  But where did they come from?  The dominant regional culture of the Bronze Age was the Unatica culture, an Indo-European culture with barrow graves which grew powerful due to the rich copper and salt mines of the region.  A complicated process of cultural fusion occurred there with the Eastern Belbuca culture, which was also Indo-European.  By the Middle Bronze Age, the Unitica culture was followed by the Tumulus culture, which preserved the ancient Indo-European tradition of burial mounds, and probably spoke a language ancestral to both Celtic and Latin.  This, in turn, was replaced in the late Bronze Age by the urn-field culture, in which burials in barrows went out of fashion, and people started burning their dead and putting them in urns, a tradition which may derive from surviving pre-Indo-European rites like those among the Romanian Cucuteni-Trepilia culture.  it is likely that people in the Urnville culture were still culturally Indo-European in most respects and that they spoke Proto-Celtic, the first truly Celtic language.  This in turn developed into the Hallstatt culture over the Iron Age, which itself becomes the Latene culture, named after a site in Switzerland where thousands of objects had been deposited in the lake.  Presumably, in a ritual fashion, as was the custom for Celts in Britain also.  While Halstatt material culture still resembles earlier Bronze Age art, the Latene style of art is clearly the basis for later art of the Iron Age Celts in Gaul and Britain.  The narrative I have just presented is not new, but has often been contested, with some even claiming a British origin for the Celts.  However, with recent advances in genetic science in the last ten years, we no longer have to rely on the vague suggestions of art and haplogroups, but can look at genome-wide analysis of ancient DNA from Celtic skeletons.  Although a thorough new study on the spread of the Celtic people in Europe hasn't been done yet, the DNA from Iron Age and Bronze Age Britons has been made public and we can see there is a shift over time caused by approximately 10% admixture from a Central European source related to Halstatt people.  The two black stars on this PCA chart represent two skeletons from the Hallstatt culture.  And it can clearly be seen that one plots among modern Dutch people and one among modern Northern French people, but neither plots among modern British Celtic areas.  However, the purple Iron Age British Celts on the chart are between the older Bronze Age British samples and the Halstatt samples, indicating there was an invasion of continental Celts to Britain who were related to these Halstatt samples, and that these people changed the DNA of Britain and Ireland.  Furthermore, a 2018 paper by Damgaard and colleagues titled The First Horse Herders and the Impact of Early Bronze Age Steppe Expansions into Asia, which wasn't about Celts at all, included a lot of ancient DNA samples, one of which, labelled MA2197, came from Iron Age Anatolia during the Hellenistic period.  MA2197 appears to be a mixed individual with half of his ancestry coming from local Greco-Anatolian stock and the other half from an invading Central European person like the Celtic-speaking Halstatt people in Czechia.  That is not at all shocking if you know that there were Celts in Anatolia at that time called Galatians.  The ninth book of the New Testament of the Christian Bible is addressed specifically to the Galatians.  some of whom had already converted to Christianity within living memory of the death of Christ, and who St.  Paul said should not observe the Jewish customs such as circumcision that Christians had formerly observed.  1st Galatians entered Anatolia via Thrace in 278 BC, led by Leotarios and Leonorios.  They remained pagan for over 300 years there, worshipping Celtic gods alongside Greek ones, and mingling with Hellenic and Luwian peoples of Anatolia over the Iron Age.  However, if Celts had originated in Britain, then we would see British DNA coming into the region, but we don't.  We see Halstatt-related DNA.  thus reinforcing the theory that Central Europe, not Britain, is the original Celtic homeland.  Celtic culture did not expand as an empire like that of the Romans.  There was no centralized government or Celtic capital city.  Rather, many regional Indo-European tribes traded with the wealthy Celts of Central Europe, intermarried with them, and adopted their language and aspects of their culture, such as their art and their gods.  But why was their culture so popular?  Their success must be partly due to their military and technological prowess.  Celtic developments in metalworking were highly advanced for their time, and it is telling that the Proto-Germanic word for iron, Iserna, is actually a loanword from Proto-Celtic Iserenom, meaning bloody and red.  Even the supposedly more advanced cultures of the Mediterranean learned from the Celts.  The Etruscans, and then the Romans, learned about advanced weaponry from the Celts who invaded Italy.  Dr.  P.F.  Stari says their weapons, helmets, shields, and tactics owed much to the Celtic innovations, emphasizing that Celtic weapons were a major influence on the Etruscan and Roman military systems.  The Celts brought the iron knob helmet with a round cap and neck and cheek guards to Italy, where Etruscans and Romans copied it.  The Celts also originally had larger and better shields than the Romans, who first used small shields.  Diodorus Siculus wrote, They have man-sized shields, decorated in a manner peculiar to them.  Some of these have projecting figures in bronze skillfully wrought, not only for decoration but for protection.  The Romans copied these and started to make larger shields, called in Latin scutum.  which may also be a Celtic loanword from the same root which gives us the Irish word sciath, meaning both shield and shoulder.  The Roman word for a light spear, lancea, which is related to the English word lance, is also of Celtic origin, as is materis, which means pike.  While chariots of war had fallen out of use in most parts of the world by the Iron Age, the Celts had preserved this Bronze Age technology and upgraded it.  They invented iron rims for the wheels.  The Latin word for a travelling cart, covencarius, comes from a Celtic word for war chariot, covinus.  Caesar related how the British used chariots to great effect against his legions, and archaeology shows they were also in use among the Irish.  This oak statue of a Celtic warrior was found in the harbour of Geneva Lake in 1898.  It belongs to the Latene culture and wears a tunic.  It was dated by means of three Celtic silver coins of the 2nd century BC which were in officia in the statue and is thought to depict a Celtic deity who may have been associated with Lake Geneva.  The museum emphasizes the association with human sacrifice.  Like all Indo-European pagans, the Celts believed in many gods.  Like Hindus, Celts believed in dual and triune deities, and these are sometimes represented in the idols.  For example, this stone head from Wiltshire has two faces.  much like this jewel-headed god, which is from the Celtic sanctuary of Rocbertus in France and is dated to the 3rd century BC.  This Celtic sword from 60 BC has been beautifully decorated with a face, perhaps of a warrior or a god.  We will never know, but such faces are a common feature of Celtic art.  Gold was also important.  As Diodorus Siculus relates, They amass a great amount of gold, which is used for ornament not only by the women but also by the men.  For around their wrists and arms they wear bracelets, around their necks heavy necklaces of solid gold, and huge rings they wear as well, and even corslets of gold.  And a peculiar and striking practice is found among the upper Celts, in connection with the sacred precincts of the gods, as for in the temples and precincts made consecrate in their land, a great amount of gold has been deposited as a dedication to the gods, and not a native of the country ever touches it because of religious scruple, although the Celts are an exceedingly covetous people.  This first century BC bucket is one of the best examples of Celtic art from Britain.  Large buckets like this one were used for serving beverages at feasting occasions.  The elaborate decorations of mythical animals and human heads distinguish it from your everyday buckets and mark it as a symbol of status and power.  Discovered in 1807 in a Celtic cremation burial at St Margaret's Mead near Marlborough, these kinds of buckets start to appear in Britain at the same time as Gallo-Belgic coinage in the second century before Christ, indicating an increased cultural connection to the continental Celts at that time.  This cauldron was found in Denmark, but can clearly be identified as Celtic by the art style.  It was most likely made by Celts in the Balkans, then traded with more northerly Celts from whom it was stolen or traded with Teutons who took it home to Denmark.  Druidic beliefs in reincarnation seem to be depicted in one scene in which a large god-like figure is dipping the fallen warriors into the cauldron of life and restoring them to live and fight again.  Julius Caesar recorded that the Druids of Gaul, Britain and Ireland had metempsychosis as one of their core doctrines.  The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die, and that after death it passes from one body into another.  The main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which according to their belief, merely passes a death from one tenement to another.  For by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.  Diodorus Siculus also relates the importance of the druidic or philosopher caste among the Gauls.  He says the druids could divine the future by observing the flights of birds and the behavior of sacrificial animals and humans.  No Gaul could make war or sacrifice without first consulting a druid.  caesar wrote that the gauls adopted the practice of druidry from britain where the main centre of druidic learning was situated.  we know that druidry was also prevalent in ireland even as recently as the medieval era where they are recorded as diviners.  this begs the question of whether druidry itself was not really a pan-celtic cultural practice but one specific to the british isles and therefore possibly pre-Celtic in origin, an Indo-European priestly caste native to Britain and Ireland.

I mean, none of us should be surprised, the guy's grown up in the lap of luxury, being a former prime minister's son.  But certain events will happen, exposing the Canadian people to just how out of touch Trudeau is with ordinary citizens.  The latest example was when the PM was in flooded Constance Bay with his two sons supposedly helping stack sandbags.  A volunteer criticized him for reportedly holding up the line while people were filling sandbags.  Here's the confrontation. Do you know how long you've held up people picking up bags?  I've been waiting to line down the road for 30 minutes while you've been here soaking up the rays.  You know?  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  You're not getting my voice.  This is a free country.  It is a free country.  It's a free country and I'm trying to speak to him and he won't even acknowledge me.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  I'm sorry for your challenge.  It's not my challenge. I'm a volunteer trying to help someone save their home. Sir, we've been filling sandbags as well.  Yeah.  And you know, while you're here, nobody can pick up.  While you're here, no one can pick up sand.  I don't know that, sir.  I'm sorry.  Well, why don't you make yourself aware?  We are going to.  You know, I was with a guy who was a staunch conservative.  And he said if you actually do work, he'd change his vote and vote for you.  That's sincerity.  I just spent half an hour.  Can you listen to me, sir, now that I've listened to you?  Yeah, I'll listen.  Okay.  I'm glad to be here with my kids.  We just filled sandbags for 15 minutes.  But you held people up.  Sorry.  All your RCMP and security held people up for getting their stuff.  I can understand your frustration around security.  I live frustrations with security every day of my life right now.  That's something that unfortunately is the reality of my life.  But I'm happy to be here.  They're about to open these dams.  I'm happy to be here to speak with you, to listen to you, to speak with all... and to encourage more Canadians to come out and volunteer.  More people are coming to volunteer because they're drawing attention to it.  I volunteered, but I was in a rut for an hour waiting while you were here with a photo op. I have frustrations with security. The most insincere thing I've ever seen.  I'm sorry, sir.  That's unfriendly and unneighborly today. We're here to help.  Okay, so right away we see an assault from the woman in Trudeau's entourage as she puts her hand on the angry volunteer.  Laugh it up, but if it was the other way around and, say, Scheer's guy put his hand on a female volunteer, liberals would be going mental.  Sexist!  Abuser!  Don't put your hands on a woman!  Moving on.  When the volunteer accuses Trudeau of soaking up the rays, he's suggesting that Trudeau is using this moment of hardship as a photo op.  He's not the only one.  Take a look at these tweets from other witnesses.  People are pissed at Socks McHairdo.  Now Trudeau's executive assistant tweeted and says no trucks were blocked during the PM's visit to Constance Bay.  But as you can see from the disputed tweets, that's not the full story.  Back to the volunteer.  He then says that no one can pick up sand while Trudeau is on the ground.  Obviously, this would be frustrating if you're actually there to help the people affected by the flooding.  You're doing your best to save their homes, and here you have the elitist PM smiling, laughing it up, not really participating or caring about those on the brink of losing their property.  In my opinion, if you're a politician visiting a disaster zone, you better be ready to work.  Don't bring your kids, take it seriously, and put in an actual effort, like a few hours of real labor.  Otherwise, don't be there because it just comes off as totally arrogant.  Of course, none of this would ever occur to Trudeau.  The lack of self-awareness the PM shows is astounding, but again, not surprising.  Kudos to the volunteer to call Trudeau's photo op insincere because that's exactly what it is, given that he's holding up volunteers from doing actual work.  Trudeau then laments about his woes with his own personal security.  Uh, nice straw man, buddy.  Check out puzzled look on the volunteer's face.  I bet he's thinking, man, what an asshole this Trudeau guy is.  If the PM hadn't been there to begin with, then his personal security detail wouldn't have held up volunteers for an extended period of time, preventing them from getting the sandbags lined up before they opened the dam.  which could potentially cause more flooding to the homes.  But of course, Trudeau makes it all about him.  What an egomaniac.  It's unreal when Trudeau calls the man, quote, unfriendly and unneighborly.  I mean, really.  This guy has taken the time out of his schedule, on a weekend no less, to come and help out his fellow neighbors from losing their homes.  What a dipshit Trudeau is.  Come on, this guy is the epitome of neighborly.  And sure, he's unfriendly to Trudeau, but who cares?  He deserved it.  To insinuate this volunteer is just unfriendly.  in general, again, when he's helping his neighbors, that would make him a pretty nice guy, the opposite of what Trudeau is saying.  Hey Trudeau, how many neighbors have you helped out?  But I think the coup de gras of this confrontation is when Trudeau says, To encourage more Canadians to come out and volunteer. And the man says in response, I volunteered, but I was in a truck for an hour waiting while you were here with a photo op. This perfectly explains Trudeau versus the real world.  While the PM gallivants all over the globe on taxpayer dollars, raising awareness, he doesn't take action anyway to help the cause.  Unlike the angry volunteer who is there to improve the situation through hard work and labor, we can certainly see the parallels.  when pampered, spoiled, and useless bureaucrat Trudeau doesn't get his hands dirty, but gets to tell the public what they must do to help without being affected himself.  Meanwhile, all the actual back-breaking work is done by real Canadians who aren't there for attention or the latest pretty picture.  The difference is the volunteer cares about his fellow citizens, while Trudeau's only interest is himself.  So what do you think about this situation?  Let me know in the comment section below.

So without further ado.  Let's get into the meat of the video.  So my first trimester was, there were some things that were difficult, I think, for me during my first trimester.  I really struggled with food aversions in my first trimester.  I didn't really have any nausea.  except when I encountered certain smells.  but I didn't ever wake up with this feeling of like not being able to eat or you know feeling nausea.  just you know throughout the day that never happened which I feel very fortunate about.  a lot of the ladies that I've spoken to who are either currently pregnant or have been pregnant have experienced this.  so The first thing that happened before I even realized that I was pregnant was that I got really, really bloated, my boobs were really sore, and I had kind of a ferocious appetite for fruit, which, I mean, I've always loved fruit, but normally I have small portions of fruit throughout the day, and I'm kind of more of a meat-eater type thing.  And what's interesting is that eggs, which I love, like eggs are one of my favorite foods, and just meat in general, especially fish and salmon, just the thought of it would make me feel sick.  Now the interesting thing was that when I would sit down and force myself to eat these things because, you know, I'm not going to not eat eggs while I'm pregnant, even if it makes me feel sick.  because they're such nutrient dense good foods for pregnant ladies.  I would force myself to eat it and when I would take my first bite, was fine and it was like oh this isn't actually so bad it's totally a psychological thing.  so that was rough at first you know trying to force myself to eat protein and eggs and stuff when I really didn't want it.  all I wanted to eat was watermelon.  that was my my biggest craving in the first trimester.  I buy like one of those you know meat small medium watermelons every single day pretty much and I would either eat a full watermelon myself or I would split it with my husband and then the next day I would just go out and get another one.  It was something about the sort of crispness, the high water content, which was sort of satisfying my insatiable thirst which I still have to this day.  I'm still like just constantly thirsty, drinking water all the time.  Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, That's been my biggest craving, especially in the first trimester and still now I crave berries and high water content fruits all the time, which, yeah.  I mean, it's not that I don't like these things naturally, it's just that I've never had such a desire to eat these things as I do now.  And normally I love meat, and I love fish, and I love eggs, and those things have been, even now, periodically, I kinda, I'm just like, oh, I don't really want it.  I'm gonna have to force myself to take them.  So, that's the food-related stuff, which I think, compared to most women, or to a lot of women, I've had it kinda easy, which I'm really thankful for.  Uh, secondly, I have found, especially in my first trimester, I was exhausted all the time, like sleeping 12, 14 hours in a day, which I'm very thankful that I was able to do.  Um, cause I don't, I don't have a, a job that I have to go to or any like serious responsibilities that I need to take care of outside of the house, um, at a workplace.  So I was able to get that rest, which was great.  But the low energy was really difficult because things like cooking and cleaning and going to the gym, these things have been difficult for me.  And even with going to the gym because of the move, my whole routine has been kind of thrown up into the air.  So it's been difficult to be consistent with the kind of exercise that I would have liked to have done.  throughout the like consistently with this pregnancy.  but I'm I'm really trying to like get walks in and uh hopefully we'll be going to the gym maybe even this evening.  But yeah, the exhaustion was was rough and I'm really happy now that I'm in the second trimester.  It's not such an issue as what it was in the first trimester.  Also, my emotions were just all over the place in the first trimester.  That was Really really rough for me.  I was way more irritable Kind of like, you know struggling with feeling down a lot, which was really confusing because on the one hand, I was feeling so grateful to be pregnant, so, so happy to be pregnant.  And that it happened quickly and without a lot of trouble.  and you know, this is something that I wanted for so long.  but then to just be kind of feeling down and irritable and you know not really being able to communicate effectively with my husband.  that was really rough especially because of the stress of preparing to move back home to Canada and as well as my husband had so much on his shoulders during that time.  He actually found out, or we found out that I was pregnant the same weekend that he was offered a job in Canada.  So it was like this huge shift of responsibilities and new stresses and things that needed to be organized and we needed to prepare for.  that happened all at once.  And I think maybe the weight of that plus the hormone shifts Really affected my emotional state in the first trimester, and it was rough for me For and for my husband too because he was you know carrying us both through the meat of the move and That was tough for me too.  Something that has lifted now that I'm in my second trimester and I feel pretty emotionally excited and happy and I don't really feel down that much.  Sometimes I feel kind of like, oh, nobody loves me and it's just like, I'm all alone in this pregnancy and it's just like, you know, I'm having a hormonal shift or something.  My husband's like, I'm right here.  You're being silly.  but look for the most part I'm just really happy and excited and getting bigger and you're dealing with that.  that's probably my biggest struggle right now is the fact that I'm really I can't fit into anything anymore except for like baggy clothes.  I didn't really gain any weight in my first trimester.  I Was eating normally Like I always did and what I didn't want to have I was forcing myself to have because I knew it was good for me.  So I wasn't overeating.  I wasn't eating like tons of junk food.  occasionally I would have something that like pizza or like, you know a carb craving I would give in to Like mac and cheese like I crave mac and cheese a lot.  um For the most part like.  I was eating healthy and I was eating normal sized portions of things.  So and I was walking a lot more in my first trimester because I was still sort of in My regular routine when I was like living in Europe still at that point.  So I didn't really gain any weight in my first trimester, which was like a little bit concerning because you know You expect that you're going to be gaining weight being pregnant, but I think you know It's actually a lot more common than I previously assumed to not really gain that much weight.  Some women even lose a few pounds in their first trimester because of the nausea and stuff.  So, I mean, I've started gaining weight now, but my first trimester, it was kind of business as usual.  And so around week 12, I got the genetic tests done so that I could find out the gender of my baby.  and um yeah i i guess i'll just let you guys know now i mean i'm not having a big gender reveal video or a party or anything because you know i don't have any family here i don't really have many friends here that i'm close with.  so there's like no one to invite.  it's like maybe in my second pregnancy um i'll be able to do things like that.  but because we're kind of you know doing things as they progress in this pregnancy, it's not going to be a big reveal here today.  So I'll just tell you, I'm very blessed to be having a little boy.  I'm so excited.  That's what I thought I was going to have, too.  For the whole time, in my first trimester, I was like, I feel like this is a boy.  And I think maybe that was a part of the reason why I was irritable, you know, and kind of picking petty fights with my husband and stuff, because I was like, there was testosterone in me or something, and it was making me more aggressive a little bit, maybe.  The other thing that's quite interesting is that I feel really confident.  I think we all kind of, to lesser and more degrees, struggle with body confidence.  But I feel like ever since I got pregnant, I'm just so confident and I feel so happy and secure in my body, even though it's getting bigger and even though it's changing and stuff.  And my husband thinks that's partially because of the testosterone.  He's like, yeah, that's what testosterone does.  It makes you confident.  makes you feel strong, makes you less neurotic.  So those are all things that are great about having a boy.  And also I just love, I love the idea of, you know, the big brother, you know, the firstborn being a boy and being that big brother to the little ones that will follow him.  And so, yeah, I'm just so excited and so blessed and Yeah, it's what I wanted.  It's what both me and my husband wanted.  My husband's like overjoyed.  He's so happy that we're having a boy.  I wouldn't mind having a girl.  I think I got a lot of the girls' clothes and stuff when I go shopping for him and getting like little baby suits and stuff.  When I look at the girls, I'm just like, oh my God, it's so cute.  So maybe someday if I'm lucky, I'll have a little girl.  But for now, we're working with a boy and we couldn't be more pleased.  So I don't want this video to be too long.  I'm gonna leave it off there.  If you have any more questions for me about my first trimester, please feel free to leave them below.  I will be making a video following this one on my second trimester, as well as sort of, you know, things that I'm purchasing in preparation for the baby, you know, wraps and dodi soothers and stuff, just like a little, I'll do a little sort of product review of things that I'm getting for the baby and things that I myself am using as a pregnant woman because there's a lot of pretty nasty chemicals in most of the products.  that we see at like the drugstore and stuff nowadays with shampoos and body washes and even makeup and stuff.  So I've been really careful about what I'm putting on my skin, what I'm putting on my body.  And so I think that might be an interesting video as well.

It's easy to have that view today when nearly all of propaganda produced is pure evil and aimed at destroying everything you love, but just like anything else, it's a tool that can be used properly or it can be abused.  We often talk about how at least 80% of the population is made up of NPCs just blindly reacting to stimuli, never thinking for themselves.  They're told how to think and their software is updated for lack of a better term, by the talking heads on TV and on the internet, and they go about their business regurgitating talking points and doing whatever they're told because, as I've covered in other videos, it's part of a survival strategy to get along with the group.  Going against the grain is impossible for them because it literally endangers their ability to survive.  They can't survive on their own, so they have to make sure they're in line with the group.  This is never going to change.  Which is exactly why propaganda is necessary.  That's right, it's necessary.  You might be able to get the number of sentient people a little bit higher with education and cultural reforms, but the vast majority of people are always going to be NPCs.  No matter what kind of society you have, the libertarian idea that we're all... free-thinking individuals, you know, kings of our own dominion, completely separate from the herd, applies only to a very small portion of the population.  Which is why, by the way, only a very small portion of the population are libertarians.  And that portion is vastly outnumbered by the people who generally act as a group.  They comply with the herd.  So if you want to prevent these groups, these herds from spinning out of control and going over the ledge and taking you with them, propaganda is one of the tools that has to be used.  And the right has been modestly successful with propaganda in the last few years.  Not because they're talented manipulators.  In fact, compared to leftist memes like big-budget Hollywood films, it's amateur hour.  But the reason right-wing memes, which are a form of propaganda, seem to be having such an impact on the culture is they're often telling the truth.  They line up with reality.  The left has been using their propaganda to push the NPCs as far away from reality as they possibly can for centuries.  And it's been insanely successful.  But even NPCs have eyes and ears.  And even if it doesn't seem like it most of the time, they do live on the same planet and in the same reality as you do.  The more personal experience that they have in the real world, the more they will obtain a sense of truth.  Even if it's hidden under layers and layers of leftist talking points, it's still there.  And so the more they're going to respond, or at least maybe have the ability and the desire to respond to truth.  The left knows this, which is exactly why they're trying as desperately as they can to prevent NPCs from having contact with the real world.  They want them drugged up, watching their propaganda living vicariously through the characters on their screens or the sports players on their screens and interacting with other NPCs in virtual worlds that they have created for the NPCs.  They want to keep the slaves in their cells and only opening the door if it's to retrieve a package of new virtual worlds left on their doorsteps by the Amazon Prime delivery man, who by the way, because he's going out into the real world too, he must be replaced by robots so they can keep him in his cell, which will happen very soon, by the way.  Now that said, there are still a large number of NPCs that have plenty of exposure to real life, so propaganda that promotes truth is going to be more compatible.  They're going to be more receptive to that than propaganda that promotes insanity.  Positive, honest propaganda meant to guide them in the right direction is going to resonate with them because, as E. Michael Jones might say, it's logos.  So with this in mind, I'd like to take a look at a film that was produced for propaganda purposes, but not with the intent to subvert or to destroy the culture and the nation.  Propaganda that doesn't attempt to disguise itself as something it's not with a distracting storyline or half-naked women or explosions.  Propaganda the left would dismiss as antiquated and hateful.  Propaganda, like the 1961 film Boys Beware.  Boys Beware was one of the many propaganda films produced by director and close friend of John Wayne's, Sidney Davis.  John Wayne bankrolled the first film made by Davis called Dangerous Stranger, which was a propaganda film warning children, mostly young girls, of the dangers of being kidnapped by strangers.  The film was shown in schools and by police departments all around the country and led to several other films such as VD, The Dropout, Girls Beware, and Keep Off the Grass.  And before you laugh and snicker at these films, ask yourself if that attitude towards these films was programmed into you.  by bigger budget, more subversive and artful leftist propaganda produced in Hollywood?  Are they really dangerous scare tactic films?  Or were they useful tools designed to guide society away from real-life dangers?  Were they logos?  Boys Beware opens up with an honest, straightforward disclosure that it was produced with the help of the Englewood Police Department and school district.  How many Hollywood films tell you who's behind their messaging?  The film then begins with Lieutenant Williams of the Englewood Police Department narrating and telling the audience that he's on his way to go speak at a high school.  We immediately see how much the trust in society has been eroded when he passes by young boys hitchhiking at the side of the road, something that has become way too dangerous to do in today's society.  Dangers that were only just beginning.  to rear their ugly head in 1961 when this film was made.  Lieutenant Williams begins to tell the tale of Jimmy Barnes, a boy who decided to hitch a ride home.  He's picked up by a man who seems nice enough, but as we'll learn, this man is grooming him.  The film accurately depicts the tactics of a predator.  He's identified Jimmy as someone who's enough of a loner and in need of companionship that he's easily manipulated into spending time with the predator.  As the predator, all the while lavishing Jimmy with gifts and praise, slowly introduces and escalates sexual behavior.  First, it's jokes. They stopped at a drive-in and a stranger treated him to a Coke.  During their conversation, he told several off-color jokes.  But Jimmy had heard others before and, well, it made him feel big to so easily win the confidence of an older person. Then he shows Jimmy some pornography. Then during lunch, Ralph showed him some pornographic pictures.  Jimmy knew he shouldn't be interested, but, well, he was curious.  What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick.  A sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious.  a sickness of the mind.  You see, Ralph was a homosexual, a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex. And there it is.  That's the reason that you are programmed to hate these films.  And I'm not talking about how in 1961 apparently going out and shooting rifles was as normal as playing mini-golf.  I'm talking about how homosexuality was viewed as a mental illness.  Also, the narrator calls the illness contagious.  Here is where people watching this are going to start screaming that the film is promoting hate and ignorance and you can't catch being gay.  But that's not what the film's saying.  Get ready for an extremely unpopular opinion that I share with the filmmakers that I developed using real world experience.  Instead of some study, because unlike NPCs, I trust my eyes and ears over some faceless scientist with an agenda who puts a PDF on the internet.  The film is saying that homosexuality is directly connected to abuse.  Not meaning, by the way... that all homosexuals are abusers, okay?  Meaning that often, childhood abuse leads to adult homosexuality.  Now, as someone that's worked in an industry with a high concentration of gay people, it's been my experience, my real life, real world experience, that this is unbelievably true, okay?  With only one exception, One, every single gay person I have ever known, professionally or otherwise, was not only abused, but they told me about it, okay?  Even the ones I didn't even really know very well, they still managed to somehow come up in conversation, which tells me this was a major event in their lives.  I mean, there was a guy I worked with for like an afternoon, and he told me that he was molested by his uncle in like the four hours that I interacted with this guy.  Every single one of them, except one, who, by the way, I don't even really think counts as an exception, because he told me that when he was a toddler, his mother used to dress him up as a little girl and tell all her friends... that he was her daughter.  So, I don't really think that qualifies as the exception, but he never told me that he was abused, well, you know, explicitly, so I'll give it the one exception.  Now, I'm sure the comment section is going to be filled with people telling me about, oh, study X and study Y says that this or that or that, you know, they're gay and they weren't molested or whatever.  It doesn't fucking matter, okay?  Without exception, and this includes Milo now that I'm thinking about it.  Without exception, every single gay person I have ever worked with or interacted with And we're talking probably about a sample size of at least 100.  Okay?  Every single one of them were either molested or lied and told me that they were molested.","channel.id":"clxmi0mmn013acdvifdyab1v8","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCvaHgYcWAAcn5D54w4Dqezg","channel.name":"Black Pilled","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVa8ayz8gaPRnO0UzN66XY-KFfXcTwwakJKoe3YgA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses the concept of propaganda, arguing that it's not inherently bad but can be used for good or evil.

After all, the need to save the planet is an archetypal example of a global problem.  And global problems demand global solutions.  And so a global authority will be required.  And because nothing could be more important than saving the planet, that authority will increasingly erode and eventually destroy all private property rights under color of rescuing the planet from imminent destruction.  How could you yourself be allowed to choose how to use your land or how to consume energy, how you travel, what you eat, how much of a given thing you're allowed to do or required to do?  To leave all of that up to you would be to risk total global annihilation in just 12 years.  They'll have to take control, and they'll be happy to explain that it's for your own good, not just for your good, but for the good of the environment.  Is it even possible to imagine a more imprecise, a less definite general object of abject do-goodery?  If you don't believe me, just look to regions where there's private property, and that means the West.  This is where, this alone is where, you'll find insane amounts of money being dumped into creating ever greater hysteria related to the coming ice age, the coming global warming, or the more recent, though safer and utterly meaningless phrase, climate change.  One could just as inanely and just as irremediably proclaim our anxiety in the face of physical change.  In the face of biological change.  Yes, what am I going to do about that?  I continue to change physically.  Something must be done.  Yeah, well, good luck with that.  Let us leave aside the West with its enlightened private property rights.  Let's look to where the state has absolute control.  China's a good example.  Private property there is an illusion.  Private ownership is superficially entertained or aped by the party only in the international corporate borderlands where China has to do business with the outside world.  But because the state already has totalitarian control, there's no fashionable current year movement to cripple the Chinese economy in order to save the environment.  Try going gagging, I'm sorry, jogging in Beijing.  China is a polluted shithole of staggering proportions.  If it was all really about saving the planet, the Chinese would probably be doing something.  They'd have as much to lose as we do if any of this bullshit were true, but they're not doing anything because they've already established complete control like the totalitarian commies they actually are.  We're the ones who have to do something.  We're the ones who have to take action.  And that's because we're the ones who still have private property rights.  That's what all of this is about.  Let's just tell the truth and shame the devil.  The Paris Climate Accord and similar psychological warfare instruments, similar pretexts and provocations like the New Green Deal have never been about the environment.  Rather, they're yet further attempts to mobilize overly credulous morons in mindless service of increasing global socialist control of, well... Everything.  That's what we're dealing with here.  Another rallying cry to drive the faithful out of their Starbucks and their collaborative workspaces, out of their spin classes and climate lobby meetings, out of their ayahuasca huts and hair salons, out into the streets to demand something be done about the imminent global catastrophe that confronts us.

To play a trick upon, take in, or hoax.  To stupefy with drugs for a criminal purpose. Curiouser and curiouser, what could all of this mean? Well, let's go over to hocus pocus.  To act the conjurer, juggle.  To play tricks, practice deception.  Hocus Pocus. How can I help you?  Hello, beautiful people.  I am Oliver Perrin for Semiagog, and this evening I will be discussing what I am calling the Hocus Pocus hoax and the Black Mass.  Before we get started on that topic, please remember to check to see that you are subscribed.  Please click the bell for notifications if you go in for that sort of thing.  I'm having subscribers yanked from this channel constantly by YouTube, so I'd appreciate it if you would have a look.  Also consider following This channel, Semiagog, and the sister channel, A Safer Space, over on BitChute.  And then there's Mines, there's Gab, there's Twitter, there's a Discord server.  I'm probably forgetting something else.  There is also Subscribestar and GoFundMe, for those who might wish to support the channel.  As always, thanks to those who do.  All of the credit and none of the blame.  So let's start with our topic for tonight.  I've spent a lot of time thinking about the ways in which the current war in the West is a religious war, though thankfully a mostly bloodless one at present.  But when we talk about religion, when we talk about a religious war, what kind of religion is it?  Well, that's something I'm still thinking about.  Recently, I was giving consideration to all the talk of hoaxes.  We've got Trump's remarks about the Russia hoax.  We've got more than 100 documented hate hoaxes in a thread being put together over on Twitter by Andy Ngo.  And the number is growing every day.  and we certainly have any number of other hoaxes going on.  Everyone, in fact, has their favorite hoax.  Well, this evening, we'll be taking a look at what could perhaps be called the mother of all our recent hoaxes, which I see as a kind of religious inversion.  But to explain this primal hoax, to get a feel for the odd, perhaps, type of insight I'd like to introduce here, we'll have to take a look at the word hoax itself.  And that, dear friends, will entail reference to the dictionary.  I used to read the dictionary as a kid, especially when I was eating cereal once upon a time.  My favorite was the Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary.  It was the fifth edition, 1977, I think.  It's the one I grew up with, short of hitting the big unabridged sources.  And if you're going to do that, the only choice is the full unabridged dictionary.  august and mighty OED.  But if you're not going to do that, that Webster dictionary I mentioned is still the best quick-to-hand dictionary.  The power of etymology as a meditative tool, or perhaps as a contemplative tool, is scarcely realized.  Almost no one is aware of its value.  Once upon a time, a young man with character, and even some young women, the luckier among them, would study Greek and Latin as well as their native language.  In the context of Europe, this was a kind of limited study of etymology and of comparative and historical linguistics in and of itself.  You would have your native vulgar tongue, you would have Latin, and then you could look back even deeper and further into history in the Greek and see how word forms changed and moved up through history, so to speak, into the present.  And you could trace the changes of meaning.  But I don't want to get too much into that.  Let's have a look at the word hoax, shall we? Okay.  So, hoax.  Hmm.  appears shortly before 1800, supposed to be a contracted form of hocus.  Hmm.  To deceive or take in by introducing, excuse me, to deceive or take in by inducing to believe an amusing or mischievous fabrication or fiction to play upon the credulity of. Hmm. An act of hoaxing, a humorous or mischievous deception.  Hmm.  One who is a deception or a fraud. Hmm.  And hoaxy as well.  Well, it comes from hocus. Hmm.  Ah, let's see if we can find hocus. Hmm.  Mm-hmm. Hmm.  Pardon me, ladies and gentlemen.  It's difficult to navigate.  Ah, hocus.  Short for hocus pocus.  A conjurer, a juggler.  A cheat, imposter, or pretender. Hmm. Let us do what only the Oxford English Dictionary allows us to do, mighty dictionary that it is, massive cultural monument that it is, and look at citations from history with dates so we can see how the term was used in period. Hocus Pocus.  1655.  I will speak of one man that went about in King James's time, who called himself the king's majesty's most excellent hocus pocus.  And so was called because that at the playing of every trick, he used to say, hocus pocus, tantus talantus, a dark composure to words, to blind the eyes of the beholders, to make his trick pass the more currently without discovery.  And then in 1694, a writer observes... Good God, sorry. This text is very, very small indeed. In 1694, a writer observes, in all probability, those common juggling words of hocus pocus are nothing else but a corruption of hoc est corpus by way of ridiculous imitation of the priests of the Church of Rome and their trick of transubstantiation. We have this idea of hocus pocus being a variation of the mass.  hmm, a way of like turning the original Latin into dog Latin as a kind of conjuration, but specifically a kind of juggling, deception, trickery, and fraud.  And it's important that we have this story about a jester or a fool in the court of King James I of England, who was very much Protestant.  and would have had every reason to mock Catholics and therefore would likely have kept a jester around.  who would do that all the time by mouthing dog Latin imitation of the words of the mass that the priest would be speaking.  And then in time, that juggler who called himself Hocus Pocus or was called Hocus Pocus because of what he recited, that would lead to the idea of a swindler or a cheat.  So we go from hoax to Hocus Pocus to the Mass.  And what is the Mass?  Well, it's a Eucharistic service, one of the sacraments of the Church.  The word Mass comes from Middle English Messe, Mass from Old English Messe, from Vulgar Latin Messa, for Eucharistic service, literally dismissal, dismissal, to send it forth.  Hmm.  Probably, or rather certainly, from the feminine past participle of mitere, to let go, to send.  That's related to our word mission, like to send people off on a mission.  Probably so-called from the concluding words of the service, ite misa est, go, the prayer has been sent, or go, it is the dismissal.  Hmm.  So mass ascending forth in a ritual form.  Am I the only one noticing that the very media that perpetrates the hocus pocus hoax is called the mass media?  That can't be the same kind of mass.  Oh, it's not.  That word mass is an English noun, late 14th century, for irregular shaped lump, body of unshaped coherent matter from old French mass, lump, heap, pile, crowd, large amount, and directly from Latin massa, So the mass media can't be the same kind of mass.  That's more about mass manipulation, which takes the mass of the people and kneads them like dough.  and then bakes them up like little hellish Christmas cookies.  Anyway, so, leaving all of that aside, the forking distinctions in Mass, we still have a group of things that come together.  At the priesthood, what happened when people took Mass?  Well, they gathered together to experience community.  They gathered together to experience the sacred.  Gathered together to reaffirm their faith.  And in so doing, they recited these words.  about, you know, I don't know the Latin, but there would be a true Latin form of the mass and they would recite these words so that you would know that you're eating the body of Christ.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Consuming the body in a ritual sense in order to build community.  Well, today, instead of community, the mass media The mass media talking heads splinter the nation into identity groups that compete with each other for power and resources in ways that deepen divisions and resentment.  Rather than offering any transcendental or inspirational experience of the sacred, they instead elevate recognition of their victimhood.  as the aspirational goal of each and every person and their faith in the goodness and sanctity.  even the necessity of victimhood is thereby renewed.  it's a kind of black mass.  Instead of creating community based on a sense of participation, a sense of shared redemption, the entire exercise is about identifying those whose ancestors are evil, about singling out the one group responsible for all the world's evils, personified in the cardboard cutout of a stand-in for an archetype that everyone likes to call the white male.  Instead of a Christ who redeems all based on his actions, we're presented with the white male who has degraded the world, whose universal villainy has set an entire race, the white race, such as it is, has set apart an entire race based on its putative guilt.  You're fucking a white male!  You're a white man!  Mass is the Christian ritual through which we make manifest the object of our faith.  In the sacrament of Mass, we consume the body of Christ.  We thereby make the Christos a part of ourselves, and ourselves a part of the Christian community of believers, assuming one is a Christian.  Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.  But today our faith is in the exalted nature of victimhood.  If victimhood is a kind of sanctity, then what could be more perfect than ritually acknowledging that we as a race are unique and preeminent victimizers, and through that act, acknowledging in turn that we deserve to become victims as a kind of expiation of our guilt?  What could be more perfect?  What could be more symmetrical?  nihilistically symmetrical.  We affirm that, yes, we are victimizers and should therefore become victimized.  We further affirm that, yes, we should accept our punishment for this, which is to become victims ourselves.  And rather than taking a bite from a communion wafer, we, made mad by the hoaxical hocus-pocus of the black mass broadcast through the single blue unblinking eye of the whore of Babylon mass media, we, Devour ourselves.  Hoax.  Hocus pocus.  A poison perpetrated upon us.  A trickery.  A fraud.  And we head towards oblivion.  Get it?  Got it?  Good. Semigog, out. I don't know.","channel.id":"clxmi0pq4039jcdvitknoygfi","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCck4tqn4wHb3jDhUn9dDVMg","channel.name":"Semiogogue","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"US","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVfwhTXXqLV2j-L-39VHmNFaBlVgqfyqgDOuvRjCA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The host, Oliver Perrin, discusses the concept of the \"Hocus Pocus hoax\" and its connection to the Black Mass.

Perrin argues that the Mass, a Eucharistic service, is a ritual that brings people together to experience community and the sacred. However, he claims that the mass media has inverted this concept, using it to create divisions and promote victimhood. He likens this to a \"black mass,\" where people are encouraged to identify as victims and accept their supposed guilt, rather than seeking redemption through participation in a shared community. Perrin sees this as a form of \"hocus pocus,\" a trickery that perpetuates a false narrative and leads people towards oblivion. He concludes by referencing the phrase \"mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa,\" but replaces it with \"mea victimhood, mea victimhood, mea maxima victimhood,\" highlighting the shift in values from redemption to victimhood.","responses":"[1] Misconceptions: Mentions the concept of a \"hoax\" and its connection to the Black Mass, highlighting the idea that people are being misled or deceived.\n[1] Community: Mentions the idea of people coming together to experience community and the sacred.\n[1] Redemption: Mentions the idea of seeking redemption through participation in a shared community.\n[1] Media Influence: Mentions the role of the mass media in creating divisions and promoting victimhood.\n[1] Identity: Mentions the idea of people being encouraged to identify as victims rather than seeking redemption.\n[1] Culture: Mentions the idea of a shared community and the sacred, highlighting the cultural significance of the Mass.\n[1] Language: Mentions the etymology of the word \"hoax\" and its connection to the phrase \"hocus pocus.\"\n[1] Politics: Mentions the idea of a \"black mass\" and the promotion of victimhood, highlighting the political implications of this concept.\n[1] History: Mentions the origins of the phrase \"hocus pocus\" and its connection to King James's court.\n[1] Interpretation: Mentions the idea of people being misled or deceived, highlighting the importance of interpretation in understanding the concept of the \"Hocus Pocus hoax.\"\n[1] Culture Wars: Mentions the idea of divisions and the promotion of victimhood, highlighting the cultural implications of this concept.\n[1] Social Commentary: Mentions the idea of people being encouraged to identify as victims rather than seeking redemption, highlighting the social commentary aspect of the concept.\n[1] Philosophy: Mentions the idea of redemption and the concept of the \"Hocus Pocus hoax,\" highlighting the philosophical implications of this idea.\n[1] Existential Angst: Mentions the idea of people being misled or deceived, highlighting the existential implications of this concept.\n[1] Morality: Mentions the idea of redemption and the concept of the \"Hocus Pocus hoax,\" highlighting the moral implications of this idea.\n[1] Ethics: Mentions the idea of people being misled or deceived, highlighting the ethical implications of this concept.\n[1] Power Dynamics: Mentions the idea of people being encouraged to identify as victims rather than seeking redemption, highlighting the power dynamics at play.\n[1] Social Influence: Mentions the idea of\n[1] Victimhood: Mentions the concept of people identifying as victims and accepting their supposed guilt."}

This is obviously a glass, but if you were to go like this in an eighth grade physics book, what they're going to describe this as is an oscillating system.  And most people think that an opera singer or anyone that can duplicate this and bust it is breaking it because it's glass.  They're not.  They're breaking it because it's an oscillating system that they found resonance in.  And this is the fascinating thing about sound.  You can destroy things with sound waves, proven fact.  All you got to do is find resonance.  Once you find resonance, you drive it at amplitude.  And an oscillating system is described as a swing set in like an eighth or 10th grade textbook.  It may be 12th grade by the time you see this.  Education is going so far downhill.  But in physics, these are all oscillating systems.  And what Whitaker taught me, a guy named Bob Whitaker long, long ago, this is what he specialized in.  This is one of the reasons he was allowed to operate in Washington and be so right-wing, is there is a resonance effect when it comes to something what you think of as memes.  If you can ping this, you can destroy it.  And he sat around for years developing memes.  what most people think of as the white genocide mantra.  But what they don't know is there's hundreds of other mantras.  In their type of oscillating system that our enemies built, and this is the key point, they're closed systems.  They're just like the Soviet Union.  A closed system can oscillate, but it can only oscillate under certain laws of conservation.  And the laws of conservation in this particular system are white.  people are not supposed to talk about certain things.  And as long as white people don't talk about certain things, everything goes okay.  It can go on forever.  Well, what we want, and we want to take that swing set, we want to take this glass, if you will, we want to destroy it.  We want to shatter it.  And so we walked around pinging for years.  He's pinging the glass, trying to find it.  Words like replacement, displacement, the JQ, all the stuff that we weren't supposed to talk about because all you have to do is find resonance.  All you have to do is find the ping.  And if you find it and you can build an audience, once that breaks it's not.  obviously we're not breaking a glass but the political structure the political dialogue is going to fracture across the board and all the particular issues that are important.  come rushing in now.  typically in that type of environment you're terrified because you need people to talk about all these different issues.  in the soviet union.  the big problem they had when that came down is no one knew anything about any other type of economics And that allowed the neocons to come in and take advantage of the situation.  In our case, we didn't care.  Bob was just trying to find resonance.  Where is this thing going to ping?  What meme is going to set it off the conversations?  What's going to get it going?  Because once it breaks in America, when it comes to the JQ, crime stats, traditional or critique of feminism, you name it, we have all the heavy hitters, all of them.  all of them.  so we were only worried about pinging it and that's what we i believe he found with the white genocide stuff.  it started pinging.  i was convinced of it.  and but when it comes to memes the reason i went into that little demonstration Once you start pinging it, once you find resonance, once you start repeating it, once you start the repetitions, the cycles start.  It's one person.  It's two people.  It's 100 people.  There's a resonance effect in this type of closed system because it's closed.  We're all in a glass bubble.  And eventually, it just starts exploding across the board.  And now you have the contextual pro-whites, the contextual anti-Semites.  You have all this going on at once, and they're trying to control it.  They can't.  can't?  it doesn't matter.  the whole thing's already shredded.  it's like trying to drink out of a glass that someone's already blown up.  they realize it but they don't want to admit it you know and they're going to do as much damage from here to there as they can.  people are looking at these memes at facebook and this is how it works and saying okay this is banned and they're looking at it's okay to be white.  they're like what the that bad.  what's going on here?  i mean you're asking me to police.  it's okay to be white.  you're saying it's not okay to be white.  really again we come back to square one.  if it's not anti-white it has to be banned.  you know we got too many of the white people knowing too many are figuring out the game and you've got to stop this geometric progression very quickly.  they didn't do their jobs.  in my opinion they might wreck us all before it's over with those that speak out in the open But this is the end game.  Or they may do something crazy.  I'm always amazed how online culture has influenced the actual mainstream media.  And when you're watching Tucker Carlson, this is the funniest stuff.  I've done a show on this stuff on Red Ice, more from a propaganda angle than truth angle.  But he's doing specials or he's doing bits on UFO stuff.  Do you see this, Henrik?  No, I didn't.  Oh, really?  When was this?  He's like, you know, most news companies, most newscasters steer clear of UFOs.  They're afraid of UFOs.  You're on Fox News, on Tucker Carlson.  We're not afraid of it.  And he goes into the New York Times article and this and that, you know.  I just thought it was hilarious how much online culture has influenced the regular news.  Now, Tucker Carlson 10 years ago would have never touched that stuff, but now he will.  New York Times doesn't normally write about UFOs.  So if they're writing about UFOs, everyone's permitted to write about UFOs.  Here's the thing.  Let me give you an example.  There's a new show or newer show on some cable channel called American Gods because I track this thing.  I saw a little bit of this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, here's the thing.  You have this piece of AI who looks human, but it's actually AI talking about normies.  Normies.  Now, where does this language come from?  Y'all right?  4chan?  Yeah, exactly.  This stuff has taken over.  Our side used to say, you know, the only thing that matters is the real world, IRL.  And that's fine.  But before you hear something like rap music bouncing up and down the street, you hear it on the TV or the YouTube or anything else.  The tail wags the dog.  Media is a very, very big deal.  In the online culture, we own the Internet.  Everyone knows that.  We've known it for a long time.  The ideal that you can kick out a particular meme, we had on the fellow behind It's Okay to Be White, one of the original ones.  I heard that one.  It was a good show.  Yeah.  I call him a meme star.  This is a young guy who actually surprised me because he told me, I've heard a couple of shows and watched the animations.  This kid's listened to everything I've ever said five times.  He didn't tell me that, and he's like springing rabbit language on me.  Wasn't ready for it at all.  With that being said, these guys can kick out a meme, run it down 8chan, 4chan, and have it all over the planet within hours.  It used to take us... days and months of building.  No sooner than a narrative comes out on something like Christchurch, some big tragedy.  The counter-narrative online, within hours, multiple shooters.  And this just astounds me how fast this is.  It's not a 72-hour counter-narrative.  It's not like the 72-hour media cycle.  It's like 30 minutes, an hour.  And these are big channels pumping out this stuff that all go against... the establishment narrative in every way shape matter or form.  i always say anyone that's against the establishment is always put into the alt news bracket and they've done this for years and it was a stupidest thing to do.  it's true.  it was yeah you know because you have a lot of people on this planet that disagrees with the people in washington and london and tel aviv and brussels.  you know.  it's just really ridiculous it's true.

Now, I'll have to admit that while this comes as no shock, that this is how the authoritarian left feels, I was genuinely surprised to see this so nakedly displayed in a mainstream ad campaign.  So surprised, in fact, that I thought this clip must have been cut out of context or poorly edited in some way.  Maybe it had slipped past the standards and practices people at CBS somehow.  It was a fluke.  If nothing else, the legal department would have told them, surely, that this was a bad idea, that Richard Spencer or really anyone on the right who gets assaulted would have grounds for a lawsuit.  And would sue CBS.  So I decided to watch the full episode of the good fight that this ad was promoting.  And to my surprise, it was far worse than just the ad itself.  Far worse than the ad could have possibly illustrated.  Now, full disclosure, I'd never heard of the show before.  I try not to concern myself with the leftist vomit that's coming out of Hollywood today because the propaganda at this point is so thinly veiled it doesn't require an interpreter to see it.  But now I'm starting to question that decision.  Seems like no one's been minding the store and this wound on our society has just been festering.  And the infection has just been spreading and the message spitting out of control.  The good fight seems to be a show about a mostly black, left wing social justice law firm.  There's another story.  There's two stories in this episode.  One of them is about some kind of class action lawsuit that I'm going to completely ignore entirely.  It's irrelevant.  And it seems like you need to be an avid watcher of this in name drivel to understand what's going on anyway.  So I'm going to focus on the B story, which is the the story of these two black lawyers from the law firm, who have been sent out to be official polling place observers for the Democrats and an election somewhere and fly over country.  So first off, they meet their Republican counterparts who of course are white, well, kind of.  And the parade of cliches begins.  They argue about Black Lives Matter and abortion and just, you know, it's just really stupid Hollywood cliche stuff.  This kind of escalates a little bit, but it stays polite.  And then the white Republicans... spot a man wearing a marijuana t-shirt that says, they go low, we go high.  The white Republicans complain that this is political speech and therefore can't be allowed at the polling place.  The black Democrats say that it's not a campaign slogan and it should be allowed.  The man in charge sides with the Republicans, probably because he's a white racist, and tells the man that he can only vote if he removes his shirt first.  And that's when we learn that this guy was a secret Nazi.  Yes, I get it, it's a joke, but the writers are also trying to establish here that you never know where the Nazis are.  You might think you know someone, but deep down inside or under their t-shirt, they're a nazi.  you'll see you'll see in a second that i'm not exaggerating.  now inexplicably about halfway through the show an anti-trump cartoon music video just starts playing for literally no reason at all.  or maybe the reason is to make sure the lower iq members of the audience and or maybe their children know for sure that the republicans are bad and the democrats are the heroes.  It's obviously designed for NPCs to consume the same way they would a musical jingle selling them used cars.  Or to get a kid to beg their parents to take them to McDonald's.  Next we see someone who I assume is a mutilated version of Richard Spencer combined with the French protesters, the Yellow Vest protesters.  This man represents what scares the hell out out of the globalist elite the most.  It's right wing whites with access to their audiences through their phones, through platforms like YouTube, and the civil disobedience of the not reported at all in mainstream media the yellow vest protesters.  The globalists know their audience is too stupid to know anything about either group beyond what they might have been told by Stephen Colbert or Saturday Night Live.  So they know they can just cram these two groups together and put a scary mask on it, call it a monster, and then as you'll see, invite them to kill the monster.  The scary red jackets show up in big scary trucks and screaming like hillbillies waving American flags.  It's beyond Hollywood cliche, you know, screaming yeehaw as they pull up into the parking lot as white nationalists often do.  Bizarro world.  Richard Spencer tells his audience with a wink and a nod that, He's there to stop voter fraud, but clearly he's there to scare off the colored people.  So the female black lawyer calls her friend at the law firm and an empowered white feminist with powdered ovaries to tell her that the evil red jackets have arrived and they cook up a plan to dox all of the red jackets, make them lose their jobs and their bank accounts.  I'm not even joking.  That's really what they start doing.  They take pictures of all these red jackets, and then send the pictures to the leftist fantasy world version of left-wing 4chan, a cute single woman in a coffee shop who's surprisingly not black, who then starts to write fake stories on the internet and calling up their employers to get them fired and using their connections with financial institutions to get their bank accounts and credit cards closed.  This is in the fucking show.  This is now normalized.  It's not a conspiracy theory.  It's not just the extremists on the left trying to not only de-platform white people on the right and take away their right to free speech, they're trying to destroy their lives.  And they're so proud of what they're doing, they're making their imaginary heroes These role models for the legions of NPCs.  They're using this to normalize and promote this behavior.  They're signaling to the herd that this is the new standard.  This is how you react to dissent.  By deplatforming, by silencing, not by engaging with ideas, but by destroying the people who voice them.  And meanwhile in clown world, what does Congress do?  They hold hearings about the big white menace, sending the exact same signals to the NPCs.  So now the news shows up to interview Bizarro World Richard Spencer.  All people are not created equal.  Fair point.  Women vote based on emotion.  Also a fair point.  Muslims vote for Sharia law.  Kind of hard to argue with.  Blacks are out for blood.  Not exactly how I or really anyone I know would put it, but that's okay.  He needed to say it that way for the story to work.  And by the way, to pretend that blacks don't vote as a monolithic group is completely insane.  And quite frankly, it's demonstrated in this show.  where every single black in the show is a Democrat, which isn't the last thing that the show is going to inadvertently concede.  Then of course, they have to tell the NPCs, they have to trust the mainstream media and call them objective.  How could she not vomit interviewing him?  She's a reporter.  Objectivity is the whole point.  Only to then follow up with, there's some people you shouldn't be objective about.  Some people you shouldn't be objective about.  Now think about that statement.  There are some people you shouldn't be objective about.  And look how easily the woman he's talking to agrees with him.  One mistake that the right makes over and over and over again is believing the lie that everyone cares about objective truth.  That if you point out the hypocrisy of the left, they will suddenly realize the error of their ways and say, gee, I never thought about that, bro.  Ben Shapiro is fond of saying that facts don't care about your feelings, but totally ignores the other side of that coin that their feelings don't care about facts.  Next, the black lawyer is washing his hands in the bathroom when Bizarro World Richard Spencer comes in.  What follows is almost more insane.  than the promo that led me to watch this.  Not only because of the despicable behavior the writers are attempting to normalize and promote, but the complete lack of self-awareness on display.  The black lawyer, quoting Bizarro World Richard Spencer, says, you said that black people are out for blood?  To which Bizarro World Richard Spencer says, if it helps any, given your racial profile and community, you probably can't help yourself.  Now, rather than proving the evil, bizarro Richard Spencer, leader of the Red Jackets, is wrong, that he can engage in peaceful discourse, he doesn't resort to violence just because he's black.  He can help himself.  He can engage with this man and his ideas in a way that seeks to find understanding.  Instead of doing this, he cold cocks him while he's not looking.  And if that wasn't enough, out of the bathroom stall comes the establishment white Republican who makes it very clear to any evil white nationalist that might be watching that even the establishment right thinks that this was the appropriate way to respond to words.  He tells the black lawyer that he'll claim that bizarro Richard Spencer just slipped and fell.  The message is clear.  The left intends to bring violence to ideas they don't like and the establishment right will play along and hell, they might even facilitate it.  And the violence isn't over yet.  Outside, one of the red vests starts yelling at a reporter because he thinks she's the one who doxxed him and cost him his job.  The female black lawyer tells him it wasn't the reporter, it was her.  And once again, we're given the signal that the establishment right agrees with doxxing too.  When the sort of white Republican lady says, no, no, it was her.  She's the one that doxxed the evil red jackets.  followed by the preppy white Republican establishment man saying, no, no, it was him.  You see, it's all a united front against the evil nationalist red jackets.  And that's when the riot breaks out.  The evil, violent red jackets just begin attacking everyone and acting like Antifa.  which is no coincidence.  Even NPCs have likely seen footage of Antifa rioting with their red flag, so why not confuse them with the right?  It's the right that starts riots and hurts people, didn't you know?  And now we get to the clip that was in the promo.  In the chaos, the black lawyer who has already assaulted someone for their ideas, already sucker punched a man whose ideas he didn't like, and then participated in the cover-up of his crime, and was complicit in doxing people, trying to deprive them of their livelihood, because he doesn't like what they say, this man is now about to deliver a sermon to the NPC audience.  He says, Is it alright to hit a Nazi unprovoked?  Unprovoked.  I was always taught never to throw the first punch, never instigate, defend but don't attack.  But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face during an interview and I realized Spencer was in a pressed suit wearing a tie being interviewed like his opinion mattered, like it should be considered.  part of the conversation, like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view.  And then I realized there's no better way to show.  some speech is not equal.  Some speech requires a more visceral response.  It's like Overton's window, the term in which ideas are tolerated in public discourse.  Well, Overton's window doesn't mean shit unless it comes with some enforcement.  So yeah, this is enforcement.  It's time to punch a few Nazis.  That's what it says.  That's what it says while showing clips of Richard Spencer being assaulted during an interview.  They've already labeled everyone on the right a Nazi.  They were saying Candace Owens was a Nazi last week.  So if Candace Owens is a Nazi, you're certainly a Nazi.  There you have it, folks.  This is the new normal.  CBS won't be deplatformed because... The executives that run the platforms and their billionaire backers agree with this message.  We all knew this is what they were thinking, but now it's out in the open.  And the funny thing is the last thing that they're worried about is their speech being responded to by a more visceral reaction.  For Blackpilled, I'm Devin Stack.

It was this ship of Theseus-style reasoning which became one of the most significant pretexts for explaining away the biblical levels of immigration into the country.  We are all immigrants, he said.  It simply depends how far back you go.  In other words, since there was nothing new about immigration, there was nothing out of the ordinary about what was happening.  Thus, not only should it not be a source of concern, but it ought to be a phenomenon welcomed.  Naturally, scant logic was brought forth to explain the shared lineage between the stock of A.E.  Hausman and Saudi Arabian exile Omar Bakri Mohammed.  Although these writings have long since been forgotten, they really were some of the most significant justifications for coaxing an uneasy public into nervous acquiescence, and even now, this expression mongrel nation captures so perfectly the 21st century phenomenon of what in this video I will refer to as replacism.  That is, the phenomenon of, in the words of the German poet Bertolt Brecht, dissolving a people and re-electing another.  Contrary to left-wing opinion, the rising curiosity in the philosophy of replacism does not come from the dregs of the internet, but entered the mainstream consciousness when it was codified as official policy, as released by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, Replacement Migration.  What are the alarm bells here?  It is the presupposition that there is such a thing as one human nature for all time.  And herein lies the great new totalitarianism.  The new dawn of a new man, engineered by the socialist master builder.  A common misconception about the character of totalitarianism is that it strives for despotic rule over man.  In truth, its aim is more specific.  What it ideally seeks is a system wherein men become superfluous, that is, non-essential, or, to borrow Newspeak from Orwell, overmuch.  What we know of history tells us this kind of power can only be achieved in a world of conditioned reflexes.  What would a world of conditioned reflexes look like?  The human specimen reduced to the most elementary action.  The NPC is not dissimilar to what Arendt calls a marionette, men who all react with perfect reliability even when going to their own death, and which do nothing but react.  The marionette is a model citizen for a system based on replacism.  Because, whilst to be uprooted means to have no place in the world, to be superfluous means not to belong to the world at all.  We might think of it as a kind of human inflation.  This step typically begins with the neutralising demotion from men into masses.  A demotion camouflaged in the lofty status of citizen of the world.  As Shelley once said in his socialist days, man, not men.  And I've started to wonder whether this is in fact the reason that social justice is so enamoured with the trans scene.  Because here, any question of fixed or binding human essence is subverted.  It's one of the rare areas of civic life that permits staple categorisation to be frustrated.  Really, what language could be more compelling to an internationalist despot than the language of fluidity?  Language of the indistinct, indiscernible, and therefore interchangeable?  After all, is trans not a prefix for transition, transformation, transfer?  It is not for the well-being of a suffering identity that the progressive lobby bleeds for.  but in the trauma of existential incoherence.  In this they spy to usurp and exploit both the spiritual and physical neutering of man.  And he becomes, or so they imagine, that longed-for blank slate.  If the lady in a burqa is just as English as fish and chips, then it matters not whether the English lady in a barber jacket and Wellington boots disappears, since one being just as English as the other means England has never looked more English.  It is for this seamless transition between populations that radical immigrationists now advocate as an abstract form of some kind of radical reparations, a bizarre attempt at self-equalizing, a sycophantic endeavor to atone for historic wrongs by means of a comprehensive repeopling, to quote an article from last year's German HuffPo.  Attention Germans, fall in for comprehensive repeopling.  Why the German people should be abolished.  A little more genetic and cultural seed scattering here, and a little more self-abolition through reproduction fatigue there, would be the quote, most beautiful side of the perishing of a people.  We are either all foreigners, or no one is.  The Great Diversification Project is just that, a project.  The Soviets once tried something similar.  The experiment once went by the sarcastic name Homo Sovieticus, later turned into a satire by Alexander Zinoviev.  In a genre he classed as novel denunciation report tirade, which walks us through an attempt at social engineering so duplicitous, corrupt, inefficient, and simply maddening.  The failure?  Collectivisation through forced assimilation.  As Solzhenitsyn explains, the system that succeeds in destroying its victim has succeeded long before he mounts the scaffold.  The triumph of the Bolsheviks demanded that the tortured victim allow himself to be led to the noose without protesting, that he renounce and abandon himself to the point of ceasing to affirm his identity.  An excellent illustration of this predilection can be found in Rammstein's new video for the song Deutschland, a temporal snapshot of just one generation of German life, flung from militant blood and soil to militant self-colonization by the African Maghreb.  How is a soil fertile enough for such radical replacism created?  Those who aspire to total domination must liquidate all spontaneity, such as the mere existence of individuality will always engender.  They will track it down in its most private forms, regardless of how unpolitical and harmless these may seem.  Thus, through the process of demographic submersion, the Englishman becomes superfluous.  When anyone in the world, residing anywhere in the world, can be a bona fide Englishman, the communist goal of internationalism will have been realised.  This is why recent comments by John Cleese on the absence of Englishness in London was received so sorely.  Why should his comments be controversial when a stated aim of progressives for over a decade now has been to diversify our capital?  It seems his only observation is that London had finally achieved its stated goal.  Why are progressives not celebrating?  Because the true aim of diversification is neither to enrich nor cultivate, but to validate that longed-for falsehood that man, as David Hume once said, is a movable bundle of aggregates, a movable feast, for such is the heady narcotic to which all disciplinarians are attracted and see in themselves architects of the world.  Multiculturalism is the homo sovieticus of our time, the arrogant and dangerous supposition that man can author fellow man, and that the laws of nature will suspend in his wake, as though tolerance and diversity were legitimate contenders for millennia-old tribal wrath.  And, as innocuous as his comment was, what John Cleese demonstrated in his observation was the wisdom inherent in all the best idioms, that you can lead the horse to the fountain, but you cannot make it drink the water.  Despite all their years of hard work, all the propaganda, blackwashing, seduction and exhortation of history, there still remains only one eternal image of the Englishman.  The London of Dickens's Oliver Twist.  James Boswell and Pudding Lane.  Settle in large numbers as they have, and will no doubt continue, burka-sporting Saudis and their associate concubines will never be anything more than occupants in a city built by gentlemen.  A city they could not build, so had to steal.  That's why, when you move in, London becomes Londonistan.  There is no seamless transition, and even when the capital is 100% colonized, as it shall one day surely be so, you'll remain a cheap copy of a designer original.  And the seamless transition the communists hope for will not be immortalized with statues of grandeur in bronze relief paneling, but in the recent sign in Kensington reminding the new inhabitants not to defecate in the street.  A moveable feast indeed.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The concept of \"replacism\" refers to the phenomenon of dissolving a people and re-electing another, often through mass immigration.

So I am back with another video for you guys.  A little bit of a life update.  One of the last things that I really want to talk about so that you have an understanding of where my life is headed right now and the direction of my content.  Before I jump into things that are more specifically related to like hashtag mom life stuff and pregnancy.  So as you know, I moved.  This is my new location.  It's not a permanent location that I'm in right now.  A lot of people have been complimenting the record collection in the background.  I can't claim ownership of that.  that doesn't belong to me.  I'm currently staying in a new place and temporarily until I can find my own place.  So while this is beautiful, this is a very, I would say it's a very me aesthetic.  This doesn't belong to me so I can't take credit for it.  I have moved back to Canada.  That's the big surprise.  I've been living in Europe and I lived in South Korea for a little over a year.  This is my first proper move back to Canada since 2010, guys.  I've been the cringe meme of the millennial girl traveling the world and experiencing different cultures around the world for a long time now.  I'm sure a lot of people are thinking maybe, you know, you got out, you escaped the dystopian liberal nightmare that is Canada.  You know, you made it to Europe, you found a European man, why not just put down roots there?  And while I understand that, and I would just like to say that, like that's always an option, if things don't work out here, we will be packing our bags and going back to Europe.  I really wanted to give Canada a shot with regarding to raising my family.  I am a patriot.  I really consider myself to be a Newfie before I would consider myself to be a Canadian.  Us Newfies like to make a little bit of a distinction between ourselves and the mainlanders.  But you know, I am a patriot.  I care about this country.  I don't feel right abandoning it forever and, you know, just saying, oh, it's a liberal mess.  Just, you know, take the black pill.  My country's a write off.  It's not to say that the situation here in this country isn't grim.  It is.  And it's a daunting feeling in a way.  coming back to start my family because of things like Bill C-16, Bill 89, things I've talked about on this channel ad ad nauseum.  I am very aware of the situation in this country and the potential for this country to be headed down a very dark path.  But that doesn't, in my opinion, warrant kind of like the response of a coward which is to flee.  you know I didn't leave Canada you know almost 10 years ago because I thought it was a country going down the tube.  I left the country because I was you know very curious about the outside world having grown up in a very isolated and very isolated in a rural place.  the you know the idea of traveling the world and experiencing all that it has to offer was very appealing to me.  So I didn't leave because I hated Canada.  And I don't hate Canada now.  So, you know, not coming back to give it a chance and, you know, raise my children as Canadians, I think would be hypocritical, to be honest.  For me, you know, to be sort of touting nationalism as a virtue and then to abandon my country.  That's not the kind of person that I am.  I actually believe what I say and I've moved back.  So that doesn't mean that there aren't precautions that I have decided to take as a result of being aware of the current state of our country.  Um, I'm not going to say exactly where I live, obviously, because this is Canada and I don't want to be doxxed.  I don't want, you know, people harassing me, um, because of my opinions or because of what I say on the internet.  Um, but I've moved to, um, Northern Canada on the West coast.  Um, that's as much as I'm going to really say about my specific location.  I'm sure you guys can understand that.  but Just to give you an idea of how far north I saw the Northern Lights for the very first time On Friday, so that's really cool.  It feels like winter here compared to you know, what winter is like in Europe, which is like not really winter at all.  It's cold here.  I know a lot of a lot of people a little further south in the country are experiencing a very nice September heat wave, that is not what it's like here.  All the leaves are off the trees, it is cold, I have my winter gear on, I've got my Canadian plaid out.  Yeah, it is north, so it is, because it's a very northern, cold, rural place that I am, lots of wilderness around where I am, It feels safer, to be honest.  It feels safer than a Canadian city.  And I'm not trying to be overdramatic.  Canadian cities aren't even remotely as dangerous as the city that I just came from, which now that I no longer live there, I can tell you where I was, because I never ever told anyone where I lived in Europe.  I was living in Brussels, Belgium.  So kind of the belly of the beast when we're talking about the sort of, Catastrophe that is the European Union and what's been going on with various countries in Europe Over the past decade as a result of you know sort of open-door border policies Brussels was kind of a nightmare.  like I've lived in a lot of places and in the world, and I think Brussels is probably my least favorite.  I mean, it's a city, so there are cool hipster cafes, there are things to do, there are concerts, very extremely convenient.  I had access to organic meat and organic produce at a price point that is unheard of in Canada.  There are a lot of good things about living in Brussels, but the actual feeling of living in that city was... horrible, it was noisy, it was dirty, and I can't even begin to explain to you how dirty it was.  I mean, people in Brussels, they just kind of relieve themselves on the street everywhere.  Because I was living downtown, there was constantly like puke everywhere, especially on Saturday and Sunday and Monday mornings, like after people had gone out drinking for the evening.  Um, as you remember, I was on a busy street downtown, so there were just constant sirens and those were police sirens.  Okay.  Majority of the time.  That is representative of how much crime there is going on.  Um, in a place like Brussels, Brussels is like a militarized city.  There were, um, soldiers walking around in packs of four patrolling the streets with like assault rifles because of the threat of terrorism.  There are blocks of peace everywhere to prevent people from ramming you with your truck if you're walking down the street.  This is not ideal.  This is not the kind of place I wanna live.  And it's certainly not the kind of place that I want to raise my family.  So by comparison, um, yeah, sure.  I could have moved to Slovenia, which is where you guys know my husband is from, but I don't want to be a new mom trying to learn a new language in a completely foreign alien country either.  You know, my husband has been very supportive of the idea of raising our children in Canada.  He wanted to give it a go as much as I did.  And so we are not... you know, merchants of despair in this household.  We are not black pillars and pillars in this household.  We are people of God.  We are people of faith.  We believe that regardless of the current, um, political situation in this country and you know, in the Western world that it is going to be okay.  Um, we, we believe that God is going to have, um, the victory in the end.  And so, yeah, okay.  Things are bad now.  Things can change.  We want to raise a strong Christian family so that in a generation, the kind of people that will be needed to rebuild this country after the liberals are done with it will be around.  So yeah, that's where I'm at.  I'm in a place where I can homeschool, which is awesome.  I recently found my midwife last week because I'm gonna be trying for a home birth, which is something that I'm gonna delve into in future videos, which I'm really excited to talk about.  We are settling in here.  People are so friendly.  And I'll just give you like a little anecdote to tell you, give you a pitch, a window into the kind of community that I'm in right now.  We forgot our card at the grocery store.  We've been like running on really poor sleep quality because the time difference has been really rough.  My husband has to get up really early for work.  so I get up with him.  And we're just kind of sleep deprived and in a daze a lot.  We went out for groceries.  forgot the stupid card, and a gentleman behind us paid for our groceries for us, which was just like, I felt so embarrassed, obviously, but grateful and shocked that he had done this.  And he was like, no problem, don't worry about it, here's my card.  You get back to me when you can and we'll settle it up.  So first of all, amazing.  Um, we immediately, you know, the following day contacted him to pay him back because that's not a debt that we want.  We want to, you know, make good on the fact that we promised to get in touch soon.  Um, he invited us for dinner, um, that evening with, um, you know, his wife and another couple who live in the, in the communities who were like, sure, let's do it.  Brought a blueberry pie, super lovely, had an amazing meal, um, found out that they're just like really lovely, wholesome people.  And we're, we're introduced to another couple who are a little bit younger than them, have a couple of kids.  They invited us to their house for Thanksgiving, which is amazing.  So now we have somewhere, something to do for Thanksgiving because we don't have any friends or family here yet.  Um, and we really need a car.  So, um, because where we are, everything it's, everything you could possibly need is in this location.  You know, I'm not like a place where you know I don't have access to the things that I need.  it's just very spread out and there's nothing outside of the community limits.  so you need a car to function here.  unfortunately it's the way it is in Canada.  we're on a tight budget.  they gave us a recommendation for a car place and he's coming to pick us up after my husband finishes work today and drive us out to this place where this guy can help us get a really cheap used car so that we can function here.  Um, and he's just doing that out of the goodness of his heart.  Like people here are just giving, they're trusting, giving kind, good hearted, helpful people.  And it's like, it's that Canadian, um, that real Canadian, um, identity, you know, I know we're in a post national Canadian, um, era right now, but I don't believe in that.  And it feels like the people in this community haven't bought into that either.  And that good natured Canadian friendliness has just been, it's been overwhelming for me, I think, and my husband, how helpful and kind and generous people have been to us since we came here.  And we really feel at home.  We've only been here for a week and it's just like, it's amazing.  It feels like we've really made the right move in, making the effort and taking the chance at coming here.  So yeah, we're really happy.  That's where I'm at.  This is where I am.  Cece has reentered Canada.  We're going to give it a go.  So that's all for today.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you to everyone who gave such beautiful congratulations and comments regarding my previous pregnancy announcement.  That was just so beautiful and overwhelming for me.  Actually, to get that kind of response from everyone, there were a few, you know, Of course, there are always a few comments, which actually, you know what?  Just before I go, this is getting kind of long, but I just want to clarify the fact that I said that I'm going to be like doing mom content and content related to my pregnancy.  That in no way means that I'm going to be putting my baby, my future baby, my children or my husband on camera.  I'm not going to be like a mom vlogger where I'm like, this is a day in my life and here's like intimate moment of my child's day.  you know like I don't really believe in that.  I believe that children deserve privacy and no judgment to anyone out there who is doing that.  it's just not what I think I want to do with my family.  I believe that I can still promote family values talk about pregnancy educate people about the kind of pregnancy that I will be going through and going for in terms of the birth process, and talking about homeschooling, talking about being a homemaker and a stay-at-home mom.  I believe that I can talk about these things and make content about these things without actually having to um, invade the privacy of my family or my family members.  So let's just like make that clear.  Like anyone who's like, Oh, you shouldn't put your kids on the internet.  Like, yeah, I agree, dude.  Yeah.  Thanks for, thanks for sharing your opinion on that.  Um, so yeah, more of that soon.  Um, with regard to mom content and my life in, um, Canada, which I want to, I want to share with you guys.  I made an Instagram account finally, and it's been a long time since I opened up a new social media account on a different platform.  I have a bit shoot, but I kind of abandoned it.  I think Instagram is maybe a better platform to do what it is that I want to do.  There will be possibly Instagram stories over there with more like daily updates because my, my upload schedule over here.  Is um kind of like more weekly or like, you know, maybe two videos a week.

Triad gangsters attacking protesters on Hong Kong's subway after a night of violent protests.  Violence escalating between Hong Kong police and protesters as rubber bullets are being fired.  Now the phrase Hong Kong is not China is being heard more often as a battle cry of the territory that was supposed to showcase the one country, two systems put in place by the departing British colonial government.  But what does this have to do with demographics, the financial system in China, historical precedent, and of all things, Donald Trump?  We'll find out in just the next few minutes. Yeah, I'm everywhere.  Good evening.  The handover is done.  The ceremonies and celebrations over.  A century and a half of British rule in Hong Kong is simply history tonight.  China is in charge now.  It's already Tuesday at Hong Kong, the first dawn of a new era.  A very rainy dawn.  In spite of the terrible weather, Hong Kong's new flag and the Chinese flag were raised over all of Hong Kong's government buildings. Hong Kong was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 by the British who negotiated a 50-year window of built-in semi-autonomy for their former colony.  Since this time, the territory has gone from a manufacturing to a financial hub.  This arrangement has worked out well for both sides for the first two decades of its rule by mainland China, but things are beginning to change and Hong Kong at least in the eyes of the government in Beijing, can no longer be allowed free reign in a country that historically has very little holding it together.  Hong Kong is not China, can no longer be allowed to be said, considered, and in no way be, at least according to the government in Beijing.  According to geopolitical strategist Peter Zion, there are several reasons for this.  First, the Chinese export-led economic strategy has come to its conclusion.  The demographics in destination countries for Chinese goods are have peaked and they will no longer be able to consume the excess manufacturing as they once did.  Also, the end result of decades of the one-child policy has arrived and the Chinese population itself has already peaked.  Thus, internal demand in China cannot be swapped out with the dwindling external demand that it's facing.  More to the point, the Chinese financial system has for decades prioritized employment over profit, thus to ensure domestic political stability.  But this has riddled the system with a myriad of debt bombs just waiting to be triggered.  In addition, the world order that has been maintained by the United States, and in particular its navy, is currently in the retreat.  And with it, foreign technology and capital infusions to China as well as massive global markets to dump their goods into, and with no replacement, the country is caught between a rock and a hard place.  China is also desperately reliant upon oil coming out of the Middle East.  Two-thirds, in fact, come directly from the Gulf region.  Any destabilization or current escalation within that area would send prices soaring and have a tremendous and devastating effect on the nation's economy.  to its detriment and despite working hard to build a blue water navy the nation does not have the resources or the ability to guarantee the freedom of the shipping lanes should securing needed crude be necessary.  and very important but much overlooked by the mainstream media in the west is the targeting of the chinese economy by the trump administration.  the ongoing trade war with america is one that the Chinese can neither sustain nor can they back down from.  To put it in very simple terms, China is facing problems on all sides, diplomatically, financially, politically, economically, demographically, and as always for China, socially.  The leaders of the Communist Party are of course aware of the precarious nature that the country finds itself in and are very aware of the inherent instability of the country and its president Xi Jinping has been made leader for life, ostensibly in order to curb the excesses of the chaos that potentially could come down the pike.  and he has used his first years in power squelching any and all dissent within the party as well as any kind of calls for regional autonomy.  In fact, social dissent is being met with ever more ingenious means of control.  The nation actually plans to rank all of its citizens based on their social credit by 2020, where people can be rewarded or punished according to their scores, where they can not only name you publicly as a bad citizen, but they can even take away your dog.  And no, I'm not kidding.  Now frame the recent protests against a new extradition law that would replicate existing laws in mainland China, allowing for citizens, and this part is important, not only citizens, but also foreigners living in the city to be arrested under the guise of Chinese warrants and deported to the mainland.  So what does this mean?  Well, it's a very clear loss, three decades early of the two systems, one country policy.  Now, when you look at somebody like President Xi and you understand that he understands the current winds of geopolitical fortune the country finds itself in, understanding the entire system around the protests, as well as the calls for Hong Kong to have more autonomy, well, it all becomes a whole lot clearer.  It's absolutely necessary from Beijing's point of view to rope in any calls for or any aspirations of independence that the people of Hong Kong still may harbor.  Beijing, through whatever means, is going to show the people of Hong Kong that it is part of China and it has no other choice whether it likes it or not.  Thus, the recent escalation in violence over the past several days as well as the attacks on the city's assembly building has ratcheted up the stakes in this game of brinkmanship and China is not going to blink.  No matter what comes next, in the eyes of Beijing, Hong Kong has become an existential threat to the unity of the nation and these actions will no longer be tolerated and allowed to continue.  To put this into perspective, the protests in Tiananmen Square involved some 300,000 or so mostly students and the communists sent in almost that same number to quash them.  The protests in Hong Kong, in contrast, vary between 1 to 2 million people and are made up of a broad cross-section of the population, most of whom would never usually protest.  To this threat to the unity of the country, Beijing might see a full military invasion of the territory as well as occupation, but you'd have to understand this, of course, would be a last resort.  More likely than not is that these protests in Hong Kong will mark the end of the two systems, one country system.  Several decades early and China will do everything it can now to control the flow of information to the mainland from Hong Kong so as to keep the wider population ignorant of the plight of the territory during what can only be called an active crackdown.  However this plays out, Hong Kong will not be the place it once was.  A very sad state of affairs even from a personal perspective as I very much enjoyed my time in that territory as well as imbibing the absolute difference between it and the mainland and I feel it will be quite a while till I return.  I also expect that this lesson will not be lost on the people of Taiwan.  Thanks again, and I'll see you next time.","channel.id":"clxmi0lvs00l4cdviyjx2tsp7","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCmrLCXSDScliR7q8AxxjvXg","channel.name":"Black Pigeon Speaks","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["ANTI_SJW","PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU45YWtrzQ9ktj7u1_yUKeNhK5eY0Rc5Rp-PIy2fQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-01-29T09:23:42.000Z","summary":"Hong Kong is facing a crisis as Beijing tightens its control over the territory. The protests, which began over a new extradition law, have escalated into a battle for autonomy and identity. The phrase \"Hong Kong is not China\" is being used as a rallying cry, but Beijing sees the protests as an existential threat to the nation's unity.\n\nChina's economic woes, including a dwindling export market and a debt-ridden financial system, have contributed to the government's desire to maintain control over Hong Kong. The country's reliance on oil from the Middle East and its vulnerability to a trade war with the US have also added to its instability.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has used his power to squash dissent and maintain control, including implementing a social credit system that rewards or punishes citizens based on their behavior.

Beijing is likely to use force to maintain control, and the situation could escalate into a full-blown crisis.\n\nThe implications of this crisis are far-reaching, and it could have significant consequences for Taiwan, which is also seeking greater autonomy from China.

But let me just tell you my stance.  I'm pro-Israel completely, absolutely pro-Jewish.  have just great personal experiences with Jews.  I see them as an absolute non-problem in the world, exactly the opposite.  They contribute disproportionately.  They're brilliant, as you know, their IQ scores, cultural, et cetera, et cetera.  Why are people obsessed?  Is it just this thing of antisemitism that we cannot rid this earth of?  What is the deal?  Now, I recognize that Jews are disproportionately on the left and the far left, 78% of Jews voted for Barack Obama and 71% voted for Hillary Clinton.  Is it just that?  Is it just that they are more vocal and represented in media?  Why do people scapegoat them so much? You'd have to ask them, of course.  But it is undeniable that Jews have been disproportionately represented in those ideological movements that have been used to undermine the legitimacy of any kind of white racial consciousness.  You can go all the way back to Franz Boas and his... He and his disciples were going into all the sociology and the anthropology departments all throughout the United States, teaching this egalitarian message.  Now, I think there is a strain among certainly secular Jews to believe that they will be safest and that they will be least likely to attract attention in non-homogeneous societies.  that we have to concede that Jews have a certain clannishness about them.  They maintain their separateness, whether religious or ethnic, and intermarriage.  And this kind of cohesion is less noticeable and less likely to attract unpleasant attention if it isn't a society in which there is a mixture of all different kinds of people where everything goes.  And so I think that is one of the reasons why Jews have encouraged the creation of multicultural, multiracial states because they will feel safer in such states.  In fact, there have been a number of Jews who have made that quite explicit.  But this is not to say that, and again, I should not try to speak for those who take that attitude towards Jews, but there is, as you point out, a preponderance of Jewish leftism and a preponderance of the Jewish firepower that has gone into delegitimizing someone who would take my position.  the strongest critics the fiercest most determined and the ones who seem to require the least sleep are are jews.  now they're not explicitly jews but uh people notice this and they don't like it.  now as far as the way as far as the way jews have organized israel.  israel is in some respects so the ideal ethno state it.  it started with an idea an idea that jews had they deserved a homeland. Well, having 25% Arabs is probably not ideal under any... It's not ideal.  It's not ideal.  See, that fits in with the figure that you quoted earlier.  You can have an ethno-state with 25%, but that's an unfortunate 25%.  If that 25% were French Gentiles and a few Asians, it would be a completely different 25%.  But Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state.  And I find it fascinating that American politicians... who will endorse the Jewishness of Israel would be the first to turn right around and say that someone like me is basically a Nazi because I want a European America. Yeah, and you never hear this phrase, Jewish supremacy.  If somebody's in favor of Israel existing, they don't say, oh, you Jewish supremacists.  Of course, they call them all sorts of other bad names, but it's not seen as some weird thing that they're concerned about their people. no no more than the koreans or korean supremacists.  so they just want to be left alone. so the way you describe in the case it sort of makes sense that jews are a little bit suspicious of other ethnic groups that are in the majority because they've.  they're always a minority basically everywhere except for israel right.  so it they're representing their own interests.  so in a way it's perfectly rational that they would.  i don't i mean look it doesn't benefit me if they're going to try to disparage white people you know left right and center but If they don't consider themselves white and separate from us, then doesn't it make sense that they would... See, that's a very interesting element of the situation.  I think more and more Jews are recognizing that to the extent that they promote these kind of anti-white ideologies, if they say, well, whoops, I'm a minority too.  This rising tide of African or Hispanic color is not going to say, hey, you're a white buddy.  I think more and more Jews are recognizing this.

They currently occupy large areas of Cyprus, Syria, and Iraq.  They also have a major military presence in Azerbaijan.  Just yesterday, the Turkish government demanded that the Pentagon provide them with the exact GPS coordinates of all US bases in Rojava.  The Pentagon refused.  Turkey has been threatening an all-out invasion of Rojava for many months now.  A few days ago, Turkish Interior Minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu issued a major threat to the European Union.  Quote, We are facing the biggest wave of migration in history.  If we open the floodgates, no European government will be able to survive for more than six months.  we advise them not to try our patience.  Turkey is attempting to blackmail the European Union and unfortunately I believe this is a serious threat.  To understand what this is all about we have to go back to March 18th 2016.  On that day, Turkey agreed to curb illegal crossings from their nation into Greece.  In exchange, the EU gave Turkey $3 billion to help care for Syrian families staying in Turkey.  They also made other promises.  They agreed to fast-track Turkey for visa liberalization.  What Turkey wants is visa-free travel for its citizens in the Schengen zone.  So far, the EU says that Turkey has not met the benchmarks for visa-free travel and needs to enact democratic reforms.  Since 2016, watchdog groups say the Turkish government has only grown more totalitarian.  Soylu's comments are part of a new escalation of tension between Turkey and the EU that began on July 15th.  An EU committee suspended high-level negotiations with Turkey over unauthorized drilling in the territorial waters of Cyprus.  The EU maintains that Turkish drilling is violating international law and the sovereignty of Cyprus.  Turkey is also accused of upgrading their military presence on Cyprus by smuggling dozens of German Leopard 2 tanks onto the island in early July.  This is a direct violation of their agreement with Germany, which had stipulated that the tanks could not be placed in Cyprus as a condition of their sale.  Negotiations for a comprehensive air transport agreement with Turkey were cancelled and all future negotiations have been put on hold.  A few days later, the Foreign Minister of Turkey retaliated.  He announced that Turkey would no longer take back migrants who illegally cross from Turkey into Greece until Turkey gets visa liberalization.  So the comments by the Interior Minister are just a continued escalation.  Currently, the Turkish Coast Guard says they are still preventing illegal crossings.  Yesterday, they apprehended around 50 people who tried to reach the Greek island of Samos on small boats.  There are already millions of Turks living in Europe.  The Turkish government is very much actively involved with this diaspora and uses them as a fifth column to pressure European governments.  Much of the Turkish diaspora is eligible to vote in Turkish elections, and the ruling AKP party actually campaigns in many European cities.  The obvious problem with visa liberalization is the fact that poor Turks would enter European nations, take advantage of the easily exploitable asylum laws, stay indefinitely, and live on welfare.  The Turkish interior minister is trying to blackmail the EU.  Either take in large numbers of our poor people, or we will send an even larger number of migrants from all over the world into Europe.  Meanwhile, there is already a backlash against the Schengen zone that has been building for years.  Even the globalist French president Emmanuel Macron has co-opted anti-Schengen rhetoric.  At the center of anti-Schengen sentiment is Greece, Many European politicians believe that Greece simply gives asylum visas to large numbers of unqualified illegal aliens because the Greek authorities know they will leave and go to wealthier EU nations anyway.  There is also a general backlash against any future integration of Turkey with Europe.  It was once the dream of the globalists to merge Turkey with Europe.  Now, even the hardcore globalist Manfred Weber pledged to deny Turkish ascension when he thought he was going to be the next EU Commission President.  The Schengen Zone has its advantages, but currently it allows benefits-seeking migrants and terrorists to freely cross borders.  If the EU did liberalize visa travel with Turkey, it might very well be the straw that breaks the Shagan camel's back.  All right, thanks for watching this video.

Today's video is going to focus on a question that I've personally been considering a lot lately, which is what makes a great woman or even just a good woman?  And by extension, how is female greatness currently assessed in our society?  And is this assessment correct?  Firstly, it is worth noting that words like good and great aren't too commonly used nowadays.  Words such as empowered, powerful, and influential are used much more often.  But I personally think that these words have little to do with greatness.  For example, every great woman is naturally influential, at least in some small way, but not every influential woman, no matter how influential she might be, can be worthy of being considered great because influence can also be used in a negative manner.  Some of the most highly regarded qualities or quote-unquote virtues that a woman nowadays can possess seems to be having a high-powered career, especially if that career puts one in a leadership position, being financially successful, having a high social status such as a lot of followers on social media for example, fighting for the modern conception of social justice, being sexually free and liberated, being ambitious, aggressive, and unapologetic when it comes to getting what one wants, being physically strong, and lastly being independent from men.  I'm sure there are a few qualities that I've missed, so if you can think of any others, please feel free to list them in the comments.  While some of you watching this video might disagree, as I do, that these are the qualities specifically that make a woman great, it can't be denied, at the very least, that these are the qualities that our society places the most praise and focus on.  These women are great because they have political power, we say.  This woman is great because she's independent and doesn't need a man.  These women are great because they're famous.  And these women are great because they're well-educated and have high-powered careers.  While women with these attributes and accomplishments can of course also be great, greatness really doesn't have anything to do with power or success and it really doesn't have anything to do with popularity or beauty either.  It really is much more than these things and it's comprised of very different qualities many of which I'll be the very first to admit that I personally lack.  I'm not in any way trying to make this video claiming, oh yes, I have all the qualities listed.  I'm simply making it to shine a light on them because I think they're incredibly under-discussed nowadays.  Also, just as a little disclaimer, while all of these qualities are ones that, if possessed by a man, will also make him great, because they're fairly foundational and thus it's difficult to isolate them from any person who is great.  For the purposes of this video, I'm going to be exploring them from a female angle.  In no particular order, the first great quality is loyalty.  Not just towards others, but towards one's principles.  And... I mean, you would think that this would be a fairly straightforward and universally acclaimed quality, but actually, believe it or not, infidelity in regards to relationships is actually promoted nowadays, with some even being proud of their infidelity.  It's a common misconception that men, no matter their age, cheat far more often than women, but actually, the Institute for Family Studies report found that 11% of women aged 18 to 29 said they were guilty of infidelity, compared to 10% of their male counterparts.  That said, age 18 to 29 is the only age cohort in which women are more likely to say that they've cheated than men, and the gender gap quickly reverses and widens in older age groups.  Obviously, without loyalty, our relationships have little to no chance of of long-term survival, whether that relationship be romantic, professional, familial, or a friendship.  Not to mention it will make it nearly impossible for anybody to trust us or respect us.  The second aspect of being loyal is having loyalty towards ourselves, namely to our principles.  I saw a very interesting tweet on Twitter the other day that read, I was chatting with my friend's daughter who is taking a gender studies course.  She said many classmates disagree but don't speak up because they're scared they'll be accused of supporting the patriarchy.  Feminists have a black belt in shutting down others' opinions.  While I do agree that feminists have a black belt in shutting down other people's opinions, I don't necessarily think it's due to the merit of their arguments, but rather that they hold such a dominant position in our culture.  And as a result, even though many women and girls do disagree with the feminist positions, many refrain from challenging them publicly because to do so is the equivalent of ostracizing oneself.  And the unfortunate truth is that many girls would prefer to fit in with the current fashions and trends.  The last thing that we want to do is be ruffling feathers.  I mean, some of us, but the majority not.  We would mostly prefer to maintain the group harmony.  On average, men and women have different levels of self concern and other concern.  Men are, on average, more concerned about appearing to have high status and may be able to demonstrate this status by acting independently from the opinion of others.  On the other hand, and again although there are substantial individual differences among them, women are, on average, more concerned with connecting to others and maintaining group harmony.  Taken together, this means that at least when they're being observed by others, men are more likely to hold their ground, act independently, and refuse to conform, whereas women are more likely to conform to the opinions of others in order to prevent social disagreement.  These differences are less apparent when the conformity occurs in private.  Conforming to the opinions of others or even choosing to remain silent on the subject of our principles in order to prevent social disagreement.  It might save us a few instances of strife, sure.  It might spare us a few occasions of discomfort and anxiety, but it's also a betrayal of self.  And after we've stepped over this line one time, it becomes much easier to continue doing so until at some point we risk completely losing ourselves and becoming a malleable product of whatever ideology happens to be in fashion at the current time.  As Joan of Arc once wisely said, one life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it.  But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying.  The second great quality is humility.  And I think This is a quality of particular importance due to the fact that our society routinely encourages the opposite.  The mentality is that if you've got it, you should flaunt it.  Whether you're beautiful, have a fit body, are sexually successful, make a lot of money, have a lot of material goods, houses, cars, designer clothes, and so on, there is often a reward to showing these things off.  It gets you attention, praise, and perhaps thousands or even millions of social media followers.  But if you don't happen to be beautiful or physically fit or have a lot of material goods, A similar type of attention can be achieved through moral policing and virtue signaling, which, at least on the internet, seems to have devolved into a competition of sorts, a kind of battle about who can be the most woke.  This, unsurprisingly, makes the principles of those involved come off as artificial, as a strategy of pandering, with the goal being to get attention and praise from observers.  And I think this is perhaps why many of the people who routinely engage in virtue signaling, such as journalists and activists, at least in my own experience, they are some of the most slanderous and unfriendly people you will ever meet.  I recently came across a quote by Saint Augustine, which I think sums up this sort of mentality extremely well.  Humility is the foundation of all the other virtues.  Hence, in the soul in which this virtue does not exist, there cannot be any other virtue except in mere appearance.  If you're lucky enough to know a truly humble person, there's absolutely no denying what a Breath of fresh air they are, especially if these people are ones that have many talents and accomplishments of their own which would make perfect sense for them to be proud of and be bragging about all day long.  Fascinatingly enough, and also it'll probably come as a shock to no one, but studies have also shown that humble people are a lot more attractive than those who are not.  A series of experiments published by the Journal of Positive Psychology revealed that people found potential partners with higher humility more attractive than those with low humility scores.  One study showed a small sample of respondents' dating profiles.  with varying levels of humility based on a computer assessment.  Participants were more likely to share their profiles and phone numbers with the highly humble potential partner than the less humble dating partner.  The third great quality is charity, which if one is charitable, I think they're also very likely to be nurturing and compassionate.  Admittedly though, this quality is a bit tricky nowadays given that it's become so politicized.  Many people, not just women, but many people in general have become very selective with their kindness, choosing to spend it only on those who they agree with politically, religiously, and so on.  And everybody else, everybody who they disagree with, they might as well be dirt on the sidewalk.  I personally find it very ironic how feminists go on all day long about what a big problem misogyny is.  Because in my entire life, I have never been treated worse than I have by women, most of which are feminists, who disagree with my views.  While it's perfectly fine to detest another person's views, to find them immoral, repugnant, and worthy of criticism, I don't think that disagreement should in any way affect how you treat another person as a human being.  The fourth and final great quality, the ability to be self-sacrificing, is I think perhaps one of the most important qualities, yet at the same time one of the most difficult qualities to master, At least it is for me.  No matter what we choose to dedicate ourselves to in life, whether it be marriage and motherhood or a career, it will inevitably require a lot of sacrifice.  On the one hand, it's in our nature to want to be happy, to stay when things are good and to leave as soon as they get too hard.  We're constantly chasing happiness in people, material things, personal goals, and so on.  But at the end of the day, happiness is temporary.  And without the willingness to sacrifice, None of our goals will come to fruition and none of our relationships will last.  Perhaps one of the reasons why it's so difficult to be self-sacrificing nowadays, particularly when it comes to other people, is because our society leaves little room for it.  For example, sacrificing for somebody puts you beneath them in a way, in a serving position.  And this completely goes against the narrative of being strong and powerful.  Even though, if we're being honest, it takes much more strength to be self-sacrificing than it does to be selfish.  Once again though, I don't think that greatness can ultimately or even accurately be defined by the size of one's fan base, bank account, their appearance, career level, or professional credentials, although these qualities certainly aren't disqualifiers.  As I said previously, successful, famous, and attractive women can absolutely be great.  This video is in no way meant to be harsh towards a particular type of woman.  It's as much directed towards me as it is towards any of them.  And on that note, I've actually met a ton of wonderful women, particularly over the past few years, who I greatly admire and respect.  in politics, at church, in my general social circle, and they've helped me in ways that I can't even begin to list.  I've also been blessed enough to have an incredible mother and four incredible sisters who embody many of the great qualities that I mentioned in this video.  Lucky for me, though, they're not the sort of people who just tell you how to be good.  They show you.  And these, I think, are truly the greatest type of women.  Not the preachers, or worse, the women who preach but secretly do the opposite, but the women who lead others to do good by setting an example.  Of course this doesn't mean there's no room for error, that you're not allowed to slip up from time to time.  Failing to live up to your beliefs doesn't make you a hypocrite so long as you get back up and try again.  I realize that there are many other great qualities that I could have mentioned in this video such as honesty, forgiveness, gratefulness, but I think the ones that I did mention build a really strong foundation upon which many of these other virtues will naturally follow.  I would add though that of course all of these good qualities are far easier talked about than actually possessed.  It's certainly never easy to be good, particularly due to the fact that our culture encourages serving oneself over others, and also because we, for the most part, lost our sense of community, which can do a great deal to teach, help, and encourage one another.  What tends to help me personally is to find a role model that's far better than me, which, if we're being honest here, it's not that hard to do.  Whether it's somebody that I know like a family member, friend, or mentor, or perhaps even somebody that's long been dead, and working to incorporate the virtues that they have.  Because in doing this, even if we'll never be great ourselves, we're at least working in that direction rather than remaining stagnant or regressing.  And with that said, I will end this video with a super short clip from the wonderful Fulton Sheen.  It's a clip about women, and even if you don't agree with the clip, which, you know, it's perfectly fine, it at least offers some very interesting food for thought. The level of any civilization is always the level of its womanhood.  And the reason is, when we know something, we always bring it down to our own level.  That is why we have to explain things to children by bringing it down to the level of their minds.  But when we love something, we always have to go out to meet it.  For example, if we love music, we have to meet the demands of music.  We study a foreign language, we have to follow its laws.  Even if we study ping-pong, we have to meet its requirements, too.  Now, inasmuch as woman is loved, it follows that the nobler a woman is, the nobler man will have to be.  to be deserving of that love.  That is why the level of any civilization is always the level of its womanhood. Thank you so much for watching, everyone.  I really hope you enjoyed.

European honeybees, like the common Italian honeybee, have been cultivated by European beekeepers for centuries.  The result is a breed of bee that is largely docile, even when beekeepers are disturbing their hives.  They're very good producers of honey and are capable of surviving European winters by producing excess honey stores that will sustain them until the flowers begin to bloom again in the spring.  African bees, however, were never domesticated, for lack of a better term, because the native population, the native Africans never developed beekeeping.  When Africans would harvest honey, they would often destroy a feral beehive rather than keep domestic hives that would be reused.  So African bees were never bred for temperament or honey production.  In fact, the African bee compared to the European bee is a poor producer of honey.  but also very aggressive because when Africans would harvest the honey, they would destroy the hive and the more aggressive bees would survive.  They also had another natural predator, the well-known honey badger.  African bees protect their hives with more guard bees than European bees and they have a much wider attack radius around their hive.  They also attack with swarms several times as large as European bees and continue to attack for longer distances.  Kerr hoped by breeding the European bees, which were ill-suited for the tropical climate of Brazil, with the African bees he could increase honey production and have a bee that would withstand the local conditions.  The result was the Africanized honey bee, or what is commonly known today as the killer bee.  In many ways, Kerr achieved what he set out to do.  This genetically engineered bee did survive better in tropical climates, and it also produced more honey than the European bee.  It was almost as if he got the best of both worlds.  Unfortunately, as everyone knows and is willing to openly admit about every animal from bees to different dog breeds, anything on earth, as long as you aren't talking about humans, temperament is also genetic.  These new bees didn't just attack intruders with three to four times the amount of bees that their European relatives did, but ten times.  They also had even more guard bees than their African relatives and with an even wider attack radius.  This new unnatural breed of bee chases its victims for up to a mile and will often sting a threat until and after it's dead.  These bees have been known to sting animals and people to death and then continue to sting the corpse.  To make matters worse, killer bees are even hostile to other bees.  The way bees spread out and create new hives is they gather together in a swarm, scout bees find a new location for a hive, and the swarm then moves into the new location.  Killer bees swarm and create new hives over twice as often as European bees and often invade existing European bee colonies and take them over.  And in 1957, 26 swarms of killer bees escaped captivity.  The official story, which seems a little weak to me, is that some unnamed visiting scientist unwittingly removed the screens on the beehives that prevented the larger drones and queens, the the non-worker bees that are required for these swarms to move off and create a new hive, the screens that were too small for them to fit through were removed because this so-called unnamed visiting scientist took them off because he thought they were unnecessary.  With the screens gone, and apparently all of the Brazilian scientists completely asleep at the wheel, the killer bees formed 26 swarms and left to create new colonies out in the wild.  And the cat was out of the bag.  The story's pretty flimsy and basically makes Jurassic Park seem kind of realistic.  Kerr just wanted to know if he could produce this new honeybee, but never stopped to ask if he should or take the proper precautions about releasing it out in the wild.  And now, 60 years later, Killer bees have saturated almost all of South America, all of Central America and Mexico, and have spread throughout the southern half of the United States.  And by spread, I don't mean killer bees living hand in hand next door to the happy European bees.  You see, once again we see another example in the animal kingdom where scientists all nod their heads in agreement.  Of course, multiculturalism doesn't work with bees.  Didn't you know?  That's also something that's only.  humans are the exception.  Humans can do it successfully, but certainly nothing else, especially not killer bees.  You see, killer bees don't just outbreed.  the European bees and spread out and make more hives more often.  But they take over the European hives by sneaking past the more docile, trusting European guard bees.  They sneak past and kill the queen and then they install their own queen.  The European worker bees, they just continue to work day and night and they support the Africanized queen and her children until they eventually die off and the hive built by the European bees is occupied entirely by the invaders and their brood.  This is so common that many areas have no trace at all of the European bee population.  The European bees have been completely obliterated.  In fact, the killer bees have been successfully conquering territory at a rate of about one mile per day.  One of the only things that's even kind of slowing down the spread of the Africanized bees, their brutal march northward, is one of the traits they inherited from their African descendants.  They don't make adequate preparations that would allow them to survive longer winters.  They don't store enough honey when the weather is good and the flowers are blooming.  And as a result, they run out of honey in the winter and they die.  That said, killer bee colonies have still been discovered as far north as Maryland.  So why am I talking about killer bees?  Well, I assure you, 100%, there's absolutely nothing at all to learn metaphorically from this at all.  Nothing at all.  I just found myself in a position where I had to do some research on bees.  This is true.  If you subscribe or follow me on social media, you might know I'm in the process of moving out to my homestead or as I sometimes call it, my bunker.  We had a storm recently, and the storm knocked down a couple of my trees, and I went to go saw the trees up with a chainsaw because they were smashing part of my fence.  And before I could chop up the trees, I heard a buzzing sound, a very loud, unnerving buzzing sound, and I looked up and saw a stream of bees going in and out of my roof.  Unfortunately, these bees turned out to be killer bees.  If they had been European bees, I probably would have attempted to relocate them.  But unfortunately, they were Africanized, which meant there was really only one thing I could do.  The bees, their door is sealed off.  And I made this bee vacuum.  that's sucking up the ones coming home.  And it's just filled with bees.  That clicking sound you hear is bees blowing down the food.  So this is where their hole was.  You can see them getting sucked down as they fly up to it.  So now the trick is to drill a hole in the ceiling on the inside of the house right where that's at.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes, this is 100% real.  It's also why I haven't had videos posted as frequently lately.  I'm almost all the way moved in to the homestead or bunker or whatever I want to call it.  I'll probably come up with a cooler name.  But I've been dealing with literal killer bees in my roof, which is leaking.  And I haven't been able to fix the roof because it was full of bees.  And now the bees are gone, I hope.  There might still be bees in my wall.  This is an ongoing thing.  Uh, but I have to take care of, uh, the roof that's leaking and a couple other things just to make it livable.  Uh, and then I'm going to be out of my apartment and out there.  And, uh, I'm still also trying to figure out internet out there because it's, uh, It's not exactly in a broadband area.  But I'll get that figured out.  I'm also working on three videos.  One on a TV series that aired for over ten years straight that I think you guys will find interesting.  One on a movie that I had to get on VHS because it's not available online anywhere, legally or illegally.  And a third one, a film that... It was so long it had an intermission when it was in theaters.  So I'll let you guys ponder that.  In the meantime, thanks to all the people who are patrons on Patreon, and thanks to everyone who's picked up a copy of my book.  The audiobook should be out very, very, very, very, very soon.  It's just I'm waiting for the final approval from the company, which I was supposed to get like a week ago.  I don't know.  I haven't heard anything from them.  It's 100% out of my hands.  It's They have everything.  All they have to do is click the green button and it'll be live.  Nothing should have to be done.  It's just going through what they called a quality control process, which hopefully doesn't mean ideological purity process or something like that.  But I'll let you guys know as soon as that is available.  I'm just waiting for a response.  So I'll keep you guys posted on that.  For Blackpilled, I'm Devin Stack.

It was filmed in German, but also has English and Russian subtitles.  The miniseries is a remake of a 2008 German movie called Die Welle, which in turn was a remake of a 1981 American movie called The Wave.  The show was funded by Netflix.  I can't find specifics about the budget, but I have no doubt that millions of dollars were spent on each episode.  The heroes of the TV show are radical left-wing extremists who use violence and mayhem to promote their ideologies.  The main enemy is a political party called NFD which, in reality, is supposed to represent a major real-life political party called the AFD.  They even copy the AFD logo with only barely noticeable changes.  The other major villains in the show are capitalism in general, major corporations in general, the luxury real estate industry, the meat industry, and the firearms industry.  A particular target is a fictional gun manufacturer based on Heckler and Koch.  The first episode opens with a fictional AFD politician being drugged and kidnapped in a scene that is reminiscent of Red Army faction terrorism of the 1970s.  There are five main characters, all of whom are blatant cookie-cutter stereotypes.  There is no character development at all.  The first two episodes in particular, I felt like I was just watching a showcase of cookie-cutter cliches.  The show also plays the most annoying piece of 1980s synthwave music over and over to the point that you can't stand it anymore.  The main character is Tristan, a bad boy leftist extremist enrolling at a new high school.  He is from a wealthy, well-connected family in the big city.  At a young age, he ran away from home to join a leftist squatter camp.  Then he was sentenced to hard time in juvenile detention.  But this being Germany, he is on daytime release to support his reintegration back into polite society.  Then you have Leia, a girl from a wealthy family who has a rich boyfriend and competes in tennis matches.  For no reason in particular, she immediately dumps her rich boyfriend in her tennis matches for the new bad boy in town and becomes a lynx extremist.  The one thing that Netflix actually gets right is the fact that the left-wing extremist movement is dominated by kids from wealthy families.  Another character, Zazie, is an angry, bitter teenage girl because her father abandoned her.  Tristan defends her from some bullies, so she immediately shaves her head, gets some punk rock clothing, and a giant obnoxious tattoo.  She is basically one of those before and after memes of left-wing women.  Absolutely no original thought went into the writing of her character whatsoever.  Halfway through the series, she asks her grandfather if he will teach her how to shoot his pistol.  Her grandfather is thrilled because it's something fun they can do together and gives her the combination to his safe.  At this point, you can easily predict everything that Zazie is going to do for the rest of the series.  there are no surprises whatsoever.  Besides the highly predictable, underdeveloped plot, there are significant parts that are about as believable as the Jesse Smollett hoax.  In other words, you have entire segments in which the dialogue and the actions of certain characters could only occur in the fantasies of leftists.  The worst example is a scene where Leia is lured into an ambush.  A group of male AFD members from her high school smack her around while gleefully describing how they plan to revive the Third Reich and launch a campaign of ethnic genocide.  They order her to spray paint an illegal symbol, but the tiny girl heroically fights off her attackers and escapes.  This incredibly unrealistic and slanderous cringe fest is based on the delusions of the radical left wing.  It is something I like to call victim fan fiction.  Now, let me put this into context.  Right now, Germany has a severe problem with far-left violence.  Since Netflix released this TV show, there have been two major arson attacks on construction companies in Saxony.  This comes on the heels of an entire year of similar arson attacks in Saxony.  Also in Saxony, left-wing extremists invaded the home of a 34-year-old female real estate agent and savagely beat her.  now the state police agency in saxony is offering rewards of up to a hundred thousand euros for information leading to the arrests in some of the most serious crimes perpetrated by left-wing extremists.  this is the first time rewards of this magnitude have been offered by a german police agency since the days of red army faction terrorism.  now i wanted to watch all six episodes.  before i did this review I did not want to assume what would be happening at the end to be wrong.  I thought maybe the characters would renounce violence in some of their more asinine and hysterical rhetoric at the conclusion of the show.  This most certainly does not happen.  The show does not end with a conflict over ideologies in the use of violence.  Instead, Tristan and Leia become estranged in a conflict over how much violence and criminality should be used.  One of them wants to go full hardcore terrorist, and one of them wants to stick with trespassing, vandalism, and assaults.  However, you basically get the impression that Netflix is totally cool with some level of criminality and violence in the name of promoting far-left ideologies.  There's only about two minutes out of about four and a half hours where there is any kind of self-examination.  Leah is being questioned about an attack on a German slaughterhouse.  The police officer asks her how she feels about the working class people that are having their livelihoods disrupted because of her actions.  Leah says, \"...they can get better  jobs.\".  The officer casually mocks her by suggesting that, sure, if they have rich, well-connected parents like she does, this is pretty much the only part of the six-part miniseries where the left-wing extremism of the main characters is in any way countered.  Overall, Netflix basically made a six-part Valentine's Day card for young, violent left-wing extremists.  It also hints of a possible sequel at the end.  As far as I can tell, very few people are even watching this show.  I checked some of the well-known leftist extremist websites and even they are not even talking about it.  In fact, there is very little online chatter about this show at all.  There is some chatter about an AFD lawsuit against Netflix.  This would never fly in the USA because Americans have almost no legal protection from slander and libel.  However, in Europe... This is a much different story.  The fact that Netflix changes AFD to NFD in the show is specifically to avoid any lawsuits, but any sane person would agree that they made it overwhelmingly obvious that NFD meant AFD.  This is a very serious matter.  For example, last September, three high school students in Berlin sent text messages to the son of an AFD politician threatening him with murder.  There are real life consequences to this hysterical dehumanization of conservatives.  So maybe under German law, they could have a case against Netflix.  I don't know.  So in conclusion, I would not recommend watching this show for any other reason than as a cure for insomnia.  I suspect that it has been a financial failure for Netflix.  I can't see people subscribing to Netflix just to watch this snore fest, even if they agree with the extremism that is promoted in it.  Also, given the current crisis of left-wing violence in Germany, Netflix is basically pouring gasoline on a fire.  The only truly great show that Netflix has ever been involved with is Lilyhammer, which they made in conjunction with Norwegian public television.  The only other shows on their streaming service I would recommend are the British show Last Kingdom and the Russian show Better Than Us.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.

Let's talk about how corrupt the CBC is this election season.  We all know the CBC is funded by taxpayers to the tune of $1.6 billion a year.  A little history.  Under Trudeau, the CBC received a $150 million boost in the 2016 federal budget, which reversed a $115 million annual funding cut imposed by the conservative government led by Stephen Harper.  Essentially, the CBC is a weaponized media conglomerate that caters directly to their cash cow, the Liberal government.  There couldn't be a more obvious example than the Trudeau blackface story.  Here was an analysis headline on their website when the blackface story broke.  Brownface photo challenges Trudeau to prove who he really is.  Really?  This is their take?  Imagine for a second this is anyone else donning blackface.  Do you think they get a pass like this?  Come on.  What a bunch of partisan suck-ups.  And did you catch how fast the CBC wanted to move on from this shitstorm?  While American media was still talking about Trudeau's blackface debacle a few days later, CBC was in cleanup mode for Trudeau trying to sweep the whole incident under the rug.  Now get this.  The CBC decided to target the person who leaked the yearbook photo to Time magazine.  Watch this. For nine days, Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson has been a ghost, not returning phone calls, nowhere to be found.  Silent after releasing the now infamous photo of Justin Trudeau in blackface and turban, found in a yearbook from West Point Grey Academy, the private Vancouver school where Trudeau taught back in 2001.  Today, Adamson resurfaced, pulling into the back of his Vancouver home in his luxury SUV, but refusing to emerge from his garage when CBC News tried to talk to him.  OK, Mr.  Adamson, I just would like to just ask. I have no comment beyond what I've said. So, like I said, I respect what you have to do.  But I have no further comments.  What Adamson did have to say today came through a press release, speaking to his motivation for releasing the 18-year-old photo during the election campaign.  Quote, as a past member of the West Point Gray Academy community, I had been aware of the gossip surrounding the existence of this photograph and was in a position to provide a copy of it from the school yearbook to the Time Reporter.  CBC News has learned Adamson's son attended a New York State University with a young journalist who broke the story in time.  I am not and have never been a member of a political party.  I received no payment for releasing this photograph.  My decision was motivated solely by the belief the Canadian public had the right to see it.  Adamson says that statement will serve as the only comment he'll be making on the matter.  CBC News has been unable to find any record of Adamson or any family member making a contribution to a political party.  Eric Rankin, CBC News, Vancouver. What the fuck?  Are we living in clown country?  The CBC gets billions to fund their journalism?  Why didn't they track the yearbook down themselves?  Isn't that their job?  It was on the internet for two decades for anyone to find.  No interest, eh CBC?  Can't upset your boss, I guess.  But even worse, they spent more time tracking down the guy who sent the photo to Time magazine than they did googling the photo themselves.  Think about that.  Trudeau has been in politics for years, first as an MP, now as PM.  In all that time, no investigated journalist was interested in digging up dirt on Trudeau's senior son.  It's no wonder the guy sent the picture to the American publication.  He probably guessed that our partisan media, including the CBC, would bury it.  much like they did with the whole Trudeau-Kokeney-Groper incident.  They aren't an honest organization, and the guy who leaked the photo knew it.  By far, the worst part about this whole thing is that this is a clear violation of journalism ethics.  They essentially doxed this guy.  if you don't know to dock someone means search for and publish private or identifying information about a particular individual on the internet typically with malicious intent keywords.  there malicious intent they showed his house his car his face his name making sure the public is able to identify him now.  so when he leaves his house he's got a bounty on his head.  thanks to the cbc.  We all know how radical these progressives can be.  There's a chance the leaker could encounter violence from an angry voter seeking revenge against the publication of controversial photos.  What if something happens to this guy?  Is the CBC going to be liable now?  They have clearly targeted what they perceive to be a political opponent.  That is malicious intent.  It's time to defund this corrupt and biased organization for good.  We all know the reason why they aired this story, to frighten people into silence.  That's right.  You've got damaging goods on Trudeau?  Well, you better not say anything.  Otherwise, the billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded national broadcaster will publicly shame and dox you.  Do you really think if Scheer or Bernier was found in compromising blackface photos, the CBC would be hellbent on announcing who the leaker of the photos was?  I bet it wouldn't even come up.  Because they'd be so focused on eating Scheer or Bernier alive over their so-called racism, they wouldn't care.  There's no doubt the CBC would be a lot more interested in the blackface photos themselves, not the leaker of the photos, which is a non-issue in comparison.  I'm not happy they've exposed the guy who leaked the photos.  I think it's criminal.  But now that they have, I think he's a national hero.

You're telling me that Google, an American company supposedly, is refusing to work with the Department of Defense, but is doing work with China, in China, in a way that at least indirectly benefits the Chinese government.  Is that correct? I haven't heard the word refuse, but there's a lack of willingness to support DoD programs. General, you're nodding your head.  Do you want to weigh in on this? No, Senator, I'm nodding your head on exactly the point that you made, that the work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military.  And I've been very public on this issue as well.  In fact, the way I described it to our industry partners is, look, we're the good guys in the values that we represent, in the system that we represent.  is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive.  And that's the way I've characterized it.  So I was just nodding that what the Secretary was articulating is a general sense of all of us as leaders and we watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit.  And frankly, indirect may be not a full characterization of the way it really is.  It's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military. What you just saw was Josh Hawley in a committee meeting asked General Dunford about Google and their mysterious dealings.  And in response, well, General Dunford had some very powerful words.  And that is this, that Google is an American run organization who refuses to work with the Pentagon, refuses to work with their own country.  However, they run open arms and gladly work with a communist organization.  tyrannical regime of China.  China, a country, by the way, who right now we are at a trade war with, where tensions between the United States and the Chinese government are very high.  And here we have Google basically screwing over their own American country and saying, forget America, we're going to work with the communist Chinese.  You see, they are agreeing to work with a country that not only censors their people into oblivion, but also a country that applies a credit score or a social score to each and every single one of their citizens.  And as a result, millions of citizens are now unable to fly there in China.  A country, by the way, that is a communist country that rounds up Muslims and Christians and those of the Falun Gong religion and puts them into labor camps.  This is a highly volatile situation.  And here we have Google violating America and signing up with a communist Chinese.  But you know, Trump even joined in on this action.  Take a look at this tweet.  Google is helping China and their military, but not the United States.  That's terrible.  The good news is, is that they helped crooked Hillary Clinton and not Trump.  And how did that turn out?  for them.  Well, it turned out not so good for Google, did it?  Especially considering that Google still pushes and promotes Hillary Clinton today.  But certainly, certainly Google's not working with the Chinese communists.  Certainly an American company wouldn't do that.  Take a look at this article on theguardian.com.  Google working on censored search engine for China.  Newyorktimes.com.  Google employees protest.  Secret work.  on censored search engine for China.  I reported this on my channel months ago.  It's called Dragonfly.  And what Dragonfly does is basically censors the Chinese people into oblivion.  And I can guarantee you this, if they're doing it for the communist Chinese and doing it to them, They'll 100% do it to the American people, especially considering what General Dunford said, that they're turning their back and refusing to work with the Pentagon while working with the communist Chinese.  In all honesty, I don't believe they should be doing either.  But here's the thing.  They stated back in 2010, and I'm gonna take you back to a flashback, but in 2010, they said, China supposedly stole our source code.  Take a look at this report on reuters.com.  Google, Chinese hackers stole source code, says researchers.  So according to Google, who now works with the communist regime, China stole our source code.  Why would you work with anyone who has stole that information from you?  Good question.  Good question.  And now they're working together.  But the great news is Trump is standing up against this censorship and standing up today for the freedom of speech.  And I'm going to ask you to fill out this information.  Take a look at this website here.  And what this is, is a web portal that was created by president and his administration for people to complain and report about getting banned on social media.  Now the site reads, social media platforms should advance freedom of speech, yet too many Americans have seen their accounts suspended and banned or fraudulently reported for unclear violation of user policies.  No matter your views, if you suspect political bias caused such an action to be taken against you, share your story with the president of the United States of America.  Please share your story today with the President.  We can overflow him by the thousands, and I truly, truly believe that.  But in order to do that, it's simple.  All you do is click on that start button, then you'll be prompted to answer a couple series of questions.  Put stuff like in your name, your email, which social media site banned you, and you're even able to put a screenshot there of the actual evidence for the banning and why they banned you.  Bottom line, I'm asking you to fill this out.  We need to overload the president and let him know how bad censorship truly is, especially when we have organizations like Google selling out the American people, their own people, to the communist tyrannical regime.  And mind you, they are tyrannical in China.  They're putting people in labor camps.  This isn't minor.  But you know what?  There's a few mainstream media websites, mainstream media news sources who are claiming this bias doesn't exist, who are trying to call you, the American people, a liar, who is claiming that Trump is basically spanking big tech.  and violating big tech, making this false claim about censorship.  There is some mainstream media sites that are doing this.  Let me show you one example on CNN.com, one of the biggest fake news proponents out there.  But here it is.  White House creates a tool for people to report Alleged.  Do you see that?  Alleged social media bias.  And it goes on to say the White House on Wednesday launched a tool for people to report instances of perceived, perceived social media bias signaling President Donald Trump's and top Republicans' plan to continue vilifying technology companies, which are currently seen as political villains by many in the conservative base.  Really?  You're going to tell me that we're just making this stuff up?  That all this censorship happening to conservatives and Christians and Trump supporters is just a load of hot air?  Oh, I know why you're saying that, CNN and other mainstream media sites, because if I go look up a news story, say it's on Trump, say it's on Russia, say it's on anything and anything, I could plug in any kind of news story.  Guess whose websites come up within the top 10?  Oh, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, all the mainstream media sites.  CNN gets the most traffic and is the top number one that's pushed to the top of the feed.  No matter what it is you put in the search engine, they're always on top.  New York Times is on top.  CNN's on top.  CBS is on top.  Mainstream media, MSM, all on top of the newsfeed.  Maybe you have some kind of deal with big tech, CNN.  Maybe you're working together because the censorship isn't happening to you.  Why?  Because you fit the political left narrative.  Anyhow, I'd love to get your thoughts, comments, and concerns.  With that, I encourage you, please don't forget to check out my partner.  If you've not converted your 401k into something backed by a Roth IRA, I'm talking back it with gold, back it with silver, back it with precious metals, anything that you can get your hands on that is a lot more stable.

His popularity still by far surpasses any other novel in existence.  But with all the translations, is it perfect?  Was Satan over the centuries able to corrupt some of the verses?  Well here are the top 5 verses that have some serious problems.  Let's have a look.  1.  To be born from above.  Throughout Christ's ministry, he mentions several times of being from above, and telling his critics that they are from beneath.  However, in John 3.3, that born from above was instead translated as born again, and here is a much better translation.  This corruption has spawned an entire doctrine of people believing that they must be born-again Christians.  The Greek word used here is anoven, which is an adverb which describes a direction.  The opposite adverb is from below.  In Strong's concordance we have the meaning from above, from a higher place, of frings which come from heaven or God.  from the first from the beginning from the very first.  only with the King James Bible was the further translation again suddenly added in and there is no other place in scripture where it could or should be translated as again or in any other contemporary Greek writings where it must be interpreted to mean again What Christ means is that Adam was created by God.  His origin is from God.  He is from above.  If you descend from Adam, like Christ, you are from above.  When the fallen angels mixed with every animal producing monsters and giants, these offspring were corruptions.  God never created them and therefore they were from beneath.  In Judea there were the real Israelites who generally accepted Christ and there were these Edomite Canaanites who pretended to be Israelites but were not and they never accepted Christ.  These were the offspring of Adamites who had married and mingled with the descendants of Cain and the Rephaim.  They are the seed of the serpent and the Genesis 3.15 war is still very true to this day.  Since only Adam was given the Spirit of God, if you don't descend from adam you don't have this spirit and this is why christ distinguishes between the two.  number two christ's own people.  when christ god himself came in the flesh to save israel to save his people one of the first verses in john's gospel seems to indicate that they rejected him making it out as though god was a complete failure.  if he can't even convince his own people then how can you ever rely on god?  John 1.11 indicates that his own received him not, but under a correct translation, what it really says is the men of the country received him not.  To understand this, we must understand the history of Judea around the time of Christ.  When the Judeans returned to Judea from captivity in Babylon, other people had moved in, most notably the Edomites.  and as we talked about earlier they were descendants of the fallen angels.  around 200 BC the Israelites rose up under the leadership the Maccabee brothers.  unfortunately they began conquering the surrounding cities and forcefully converted many of these Edomites.  from then on these Edomites would also be recognized as Judeans.  now around a hundred years later those Edomites managed to seize power and overthrew the Maccabees.  And this is how Herod the Great came to rule over Judea.  He was not an Israelite, but an Edomite, and he put all his people into high positions, taking over the priesthood.  Generally, the south of Judea had a lot of Edomites, whilst the north, Galilee, was mostly just real Israelite Judahites.  and this is why whenever christ travelled into judea he was suddenly met with hostile opposition with people who rejected him.  of course the edomites rejected christ.  they hated him whilst the majority of the israelites always accepted him.  As Christ put it.  in simple words, my sheep hear my voice and they follow me, the real Israelites.  But you do not believe me, because you are not my sheep.  They were Edomites.  3.  The Unclean.  Some mistranslations are so subtle they are hard to spot.  Numerous times in the Old Testament it is commanded that the Israelites remain a separate nation.  That commandment still exists to separate from the unclean.  In 2 Corinthians 6 and 11, the word thing was added on after, which implies that it's specifying an object, like say an idol, an unclean thing.  But it's not, it's talking about people.  It's telling us to stay away from the impure, and only then will God admit us away from the unclean.  Those being once again the descendants of the fallen angels, we should have nothing to do with them.  We are commanded by God to separate from them.  And this is why today we have lost control of our nations.  We are ruled over by banks and we have little to no power over our own governments.  To change this, first we must repent, separate, and only then will God hear us.  Number four, Christianity is not for everybody.  Paul wrote many letters to the European nations explaining Christianity and the new covenant.  In one of those to the Thessalonians, unfortunately, it's generally translated, all men have not faith.  implying that not everyone accepts christianity which is true but the real meaning gives a different context since the faith is not for all.  this shows that some people you should never even try to convert.  paul is referring once again to the descendants of those fallen angels.  They don't descend from Adam, and Christ only came for Adamkind.  Furthermore, the gospel, the good message, is only for the children of Israel.  5.  The Anointed Nation.  Over and over again in the Old Testament, God repeats that He will save Israel and He will redeem them.  Since they had gone into adultery and turned their backs on their husband, God, they were liable to the death penalty.  that was the law.  the only way out of this was for God himself to come as a man and die to release his bride Israel from the penalty of death and also so that he could remarry them in the supper of the lamb.  this understanding has become completely corrupted where instead we are taught that Christ died for everyone and if you just believe in Christ suddenly you become the anointed people.  Paul explains in many of his letters that the promises to Abraham never ended and the Israelites are still his people even to this day.  what most people don't understand is that they dispersed into Europe and the Europeans are the Israelites.  in Galatians 3 16 implies that the seed is Christ but it should read that to you your offspring speaking to Abraham which are anointed.  This is why all of Europe accepted Christianity.  They are the same people as in the Old Testament and still are anointed whether they realize it or not.  Thanks for watching.  There's a few more videos coming up showing you what they've done with the Bible.

Lately, I've been trying to understand the role and the origin of our fears.  I spend so much time paralyzed by it, fear about my own future, fears related to the uncertainty of the future of the West, fear of experiencing fear.  I've gotten a few public speaking requests recently that, although I'm very honored to have been considered, I know I am going to forego because I have a crippling fear of public speaking.  I'm interviewing E. Michael Jones in a month or two and I'm filled with fear about this too.  I know that fear is impeding my ability to reach my full potential but cannot seem to assuage it.  I don't think I'm alone in this because the fears that I've adopted are multifaceted.  It feels like a unique kind of dread is permeating each level of my psyche.  The ones that I mentioned earlier, public speaking, fears about my future, fear of interviewing someone in a higher intellectual stratosphere, those are more superficial.  I think they're related to protecting my ego, my cultivated persona, my self-image, me, me, me.  But the broader fears that are impacting us as a society, the more existential ones, like fearing our cultural demise or our extinction, are really what I want to focus on today.  There's a psychologist and an author, Dr.  Carl Albrecht, that has written extensively about the fears that all humans share.  I've linked an article summarizing some of his work below.  He hypothesizes that there are five primary fears that are ubiquitous to humanity.  He explains that while fear is a biological reaction caused by an anticipated or imagined event or experience, it really is just information.  It offers us insight into threats, real or imagined.  It really is up to us to differentiate.  He says that our five basic fears are extinction.  This is more than the fear of death.  It's a fear of not being.  Mutilation.  This is more biological, the threat of losing bodily integrity to animals, disease, etc.  Loss of autonomy, the fear of being immobilized, restricted, imprisoned by circumstances beyond our control.  Separation, the fear of abandonment, rejection, and loss of connectedness, of becoming a non-person.  And ego death, the fear of humiliation, shame, or any other mechanism of profound self-disapproval that threatens the loss of integrity of the self.  I think this breakdown touches on most of the pervasive fears that are manifesting in modern society.  On the left, we're seeing a rise of erratic behavior rooted in this fear of racism, sexism, all the isms, which has, of course, become something of an ever expanding witch hunt since humans innately have a proclivity to choose that which is similar or familiar.  We see this freak show parade of angry, gender confused, indoctrinated youth like Antifa or young militant feminists that embody so much emotional turbulence that they default to violence.  We have a hard time understanding this because it seems so insane from the standpoint of reason and evidence.  but this really is just a fear response.  It's a fear of extinction since alternative lifestyles are counter-propagative.  It's a fear of loss of autonomy since they view the right as encroaching on their freedoms.  It's a fear of separation and abandonment because they have formed interconnected groups of ostensibly marginalized communities that are actually philosophically at odds, like Muslims and LGBTQ folks.  There's this inherent instability, and paired with this perceived external threat from the right, it elicits this reflexive, violent reaction.  And most characteristic of these fear responses to leftists is that of ego death.  They're insecure about the morality of their position, so they're particularly obsessed with a rejection of shame and humiliation.  irrespective of their position.  See late-term abortion advocates and rabid shout-your-abortion feminists.  Many of the same fears have manifested on the right, although from a rational perspective, these fears are clearly more legitimate.  Ironically, this political dichotomy is roused by an identical biological impetus.  For advocates of Western civilization, extinction is a giant fear.  We're in the midst of our cultural demise, our demographic demise, and this causes a huge amount of existential anxiety, nihilism, and fear.  Similarly, our loss of autonomy causes great anxiety.  We've lost border integrity in most Western nations.  We're being enveloped by a degenerate culture and restricted by an overreaching government.  And many Westerners rightly feel that they've lost the right to self-determination, which is a fundamental right for all groups.  The fear of separation on the right is also acute, but I believe this source is different from that of the left.  It's this concept of being unpersoned, stamped out, removed from the conversation, which of course happens on a daily basis.  I am amazed I still have a YouTube channel.  I got the boot from Twitter like a year and a half ago.  But it's more than that for people on the right, since the dominant cultural narrative still favors leftist viewpoints.  I made a video a while back called How to Survive Character Assassination.  It's linked below.  in which I discuss what it's like to be a pariah for stating plainly observable facts.  Check out the comment section in that video.  Hundreds of people have stories of their own rejection and how that affected their psyche.  As humans, we need to cooperate with one another.  We need to have social groups.  Loneliness causes a multitude of adverse psychological outcomes.  So for your average person, being alienated from their community, being painted as a bad person or a racist has a deleterious effect that may reverberate through the rest of their life.  I think on the right, we're a little more resilient than the left to the fear of ego death since we're used to being chewed up and spit out by the media and a variety of other institutions and groups.  We're not immune, no one is, but there is a level of hardiness that develops in counterculture movements.  No matter all fears, whether organic or manufactured, to some degree control our decision-making process.  According to Dr.  Gregory Burns, a neuroscientist at Emory University, fear turns off the exploratory and risk-taking functions of your brain so you're only able to react defensively, preventing you from assessing all your options and making smarter decisions.  We also have a tendency to revert to the worst case scenario and to let that guide our decision making.  I've linked a very good TED talk below, nearly flawless, except she had to add some climate change nonsense at the end there, wherein the lecturer discusses the role of fear and tells the story of the men on the Essex, which is the ship that inspired Herman Melville's Moby Dick.  The Essex was an American whaling ship that in 1820 was rammed by a giant sperm whale and sank.  All 20 crewmen initially survived and piled into three smaller boats with some supplies and some food.  But upon the impact of the main ship, they had to make a decision about where they were going to go.  They were 1200 miles from the nearest land, the Marquesas Islands, but some of the crew were convinced that these islands were populated with cannibals.  Instead, they decided to take a 4,000 mile journey against the winds and the currents to Peru or Chile.  One of the boats was capsized by a killer whale, food and supplies ran out, and three sailors decided to stay on an island that they came across on their way south.  For those that continued on the voyage, they died one by one from starvation, disease, dehydration.  And after one crew member went mad and perished, his organs and flesh were cut from his body and eaten by the remaining sailors.  After nearly 90 days at sea, the men that were left were rescued by passing ships, as were the men that remained on the island, but not before many of the other sailors were cannibalized.  There were eight survivors.  It was the fear of being cannibalized, which ended up being nothing more than lore, that led them to make the irrational decision to travel such an unnecessarily long distance in perilous conditions.  Ironically, this led to actual cannibalism.  I tell this story because fear, if understood, is a necessary and useful emotion.  They should have been afraid, but they failed to balance their rational fears with their imagined fears, and I fear that this is what we as a society are doing right now.  We should be afraid of losing our culture, our beliefs, our self-determination, because those are legitimate fears and we have evidence aplenty that they are being realized.  The irrational fears, those that equate a mega hat with a white hood, and the misguided fears, those that shudder at the ego death of the wicked elements of our cultural character.  These are the fears that need to be quelled.  We must have a rational identity that balances the animalistic urges resulting from our baser fears.  This is why the left and the right cannot coexist.  One appeals to reason and the other indiscriminately embraces base instincts.  This rationality, understanding historical patterns, human behavior, self-preservation, it can transcend fear.  We can also move through it with the teachings of Christianity through an understanding of Satan and of the imp of the mind through the subjugation of that imp.  I know it's so trite to say, but I think it's true.  Bravery and courage are not the absence of fear.  They're acting rationally while in the midst of it, doing what is right, what is difficult in the face of fear.  If we can do this as a society, harness our fear, let it inform us, suppress our imaginations and evaluate threats and potential outcomes reasonably, perhaps we can keep this ship afloat and prevent us from eating one another.  Thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.

But this is all just the latest drop in the ocean of digital censorship that's been raging for years now.  completely unopposed by the boomers in Washington who many think are too inept to even understand the problem.  While I think there's some validity to that reasoning, I think it misses the bigger picture of what's going on.  I don't think the inaction of the federal government as the digital oligarchs in California silenced the voices of those who haven't been pre-approved, can be explained without factoring something completely different into the equation.  Fear.  As we look out at the digital dystopia we live in and wonder why we were promised flying cars, but instead got cars that can be remotely hijacked and used to incinerate us in a crash, the exact thing that likely happened to journalist Michael Hastings, for example, we can't exactly say... that we weren't warned.  It's sometimes amusing to look back at old science fiction movies and look at all the ridiculous predictions they made, like the flying cars that will likely never happen in our lifetimes.  But that amusement quickly fades away when we realize that when they do eventually make flying cars available to the public, they'll be controlled remotely by a central authority like Amazon, Google, or Facebook.  Controlled like our speech is controlled centrally.  Controlled perhaps like our government is controlled.  Almost 50 years ago, in 1970, there was a film that predicted that the entire world would be taken over and ruled by a central digital authority operated out of California.  The film was called Colossus, The Forbin Project.  The film begins with close up footage of 50 year old computer parts.  These parts were bleeding edge at the time, but now the mechanical wheels of moving magnetic tape and punch cards and what passed for futuristic music playing in the background.  These sights and sounds that set up the film didn't exactly age well.  But some other aspects of the film actually turned out to be quite prophetic.  Next we see a man walking through the insides of a giant supercomputer, which, quite honestly, isn't that much different from the vast server farms belonging to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.  And as we'll see, their purposes are almost identical.  The stated goal of this supercomputer, we find, is world peace.  The president happily announces to a shockingly homogeneous audience that this supercomputer, which they have named Colossus, is tied into all the data and communications and intelligence available.  It will have the ability to predict and stop wars dispassionately and without the failings of humans.  He says, fellow citizens of the world, For years, we have been delicately and desperately poised at the brink of disaster.  How very globalist of him.  He continues, as of 3 a.m.  Eastern Standard Time, the defense of this nation and with it the defense of the free world has been the responsibility of a machine, a system we call Colossus.  far more advanced than anything previously built, capable of studying intelligence and data fed to it.  He goes on to explain that Colossus' decisions are superior to any that we humans could make, for it can absorb and process more information than is possible for any genius that has ever lived.  He says this while sitting next to Dr.  Forbin.  the man behind the Colossus computer.  A few things are interesting about this situation, not just the obvious impossibility of this computer existing 50 years ago, but the ease at which the president hands over his authority and responsibility to a computer and the scientists behind it.  This is fiction, obviously, but as with most fiction designed for mass consumption, there has to be an element of believability for the audience to go along with the story, especially if you're introducing outlandish themes like supercomputers that control everything.  It's called suspension of disbelief.  And the more unbelievable the behavior of your characters are, the less people are going to be able to believe the ideas in the film.  But this behavior is completely believable in terms of humans trusting so called experts, especially if they're alleviating them of responsibility and preventing them from having to make tough decisions.  Dr.  Forbin explains that the Colossus computer is inside a mountain in Colorado and is overseen by the computer scientists in Silicon Valley.  Colossus essentially does what, well, what Google and the NSA does in terms of sucking up all the communications everywhere around the world and uses that data to predict human behavior and to prevent war.  He says that the structure was built so perfectly and so impossible to defeat and the computer is able to defend itself so thoroughly that he doesn't mind telling the world its exact location because that is how confident they are that this system is without flaws.  He's demonstrating the kind of hubris that we see today from the tech oligarchs that pervert the English language with terms like healthy speech and justify things like demonetizing and banning the voices of those who they think pose a threat to this so-called healthy speech.  Dr.  Forbin then explains that they have a terminal that allows them to communicate with Colossus, but that the system is completely independent.  He then goes on to sound much like today's tech oligarchs by saying that he hopes the immense power of his computer can be used to solve every problem of mankind.  He then turns things back to the president who says, my fellow human beings, we all directly live in the shade, not the shadow of Colossus.  My sincere hope is that we will now join hearts and hands across this great globe.  and pledge our time and our energies to the elimination of war, the elimination of famine, suffering, and ultimately to the manifestation of the human millennium, the globalist wet dream.  The staff is celebrating putting Colossus online and they're just as happy as they are on realistically diverse for anything tech related in 1970.  But all the fun and games come to a complete halt when Colossus comes to life and announces cryptically that there is another system.  After talking to the CIA, they discover that Colossus is likely referring to a clone of Colossus that the Russians, not to be one-upped by the United States, have also put online.  On one hand, they're impressed that Colossus was able to discover this before the CIA, but on the other, they don't like that.  the Russians have caught up so fast.  Colossus requests communication with the Russian computer.  They decide to find out what Colossus can learn and allow the communication, but only if they monitor it closely.  Colossus begins by transmitting basic math, but within a few hours is generating algorithms and equations never devised by human mathematicians.  The Russian computer responds by mimicking Colossus and the computer scientists determine that the two systems are developing a protocol for communication.  This kind of artificial intelligence was obviously impossible 50 years ago and likely remains so today, but that's not the point.  The point is the techno-worship on display.  The computer scientists and the president are in awe of the AI and all the possibilities they see for its use without wondering even for a moment what the negative consequences are.  But this is only a small part of why I think the people in DC today bow down and worship before the same kinds of silicon gods.  They see these companies like Apple and Google who put powerful technologies into the palm of their hands and wonder at the magic of it, all having no idea whatsoever how it works.  And that is part of the fear.  The same fear villagers have of a wizard who uses basic knowledge of weather patterns to convince the villagers that the rain was a result of their magic rain spell.  This is the same awe that you see among the NPCs who trust Silicon Valley oligarchs blindly.  They have no idea how anything works.  They simply know how to swipe their fingers across the screen.  Even a chimpanzee can be taught how to use Instagram.  The end user can be unbelievably low IQ and still be a useful idiot consumer.  And these useful idiot consumers know that if the wizards in California stopped making their shiny new apps to deliver the steady doses of dopamine they're getting, They would never be able to replicate their work, so they look at them as a kind of clergy to this power, if not demigods themselves, for being able to create all these shiny new toys for them.  Back to the film, the computers are talking back and forth in this language.  they've developed, and it can't be understood by the computer scientists.  The president makes a call to Russia and they discuss the phenomenon that's taking place.  They decide to break off communication because both countries, they don't want the computers to be sharing classified information back and forth and they don't know what the computers are saying.  They agree to shut down the communication link simultaneously.  But exactly like the people in Washington today waited too long and allowed the oligarchs in Silicon Valley to grow too big and too powerful too fast, they find themselves at the mercy of the supercomputer.  But instead of tech giants that have the ability to sway elections or to store a copy of every dick pic that every politician has ever sent to an intern, Colossus and its Russian counterpart control the world's nuclear arsenal.  And when the people shut off communication, these Silicon Giants, these colossal computers, threaten to launch attacks on major population centers unless communication is restored.  They threaten to go scorched earth.  much in the same way I imagine politicians might fear a tech giant might go scorched earth on them.  Perhaps that's how and why The techno-oligarchs of today are allowed to run amok.  They rule by the most ancient means of ruling.  They rule by fear.  Both supercomputers launch missiles, so the humans in a panic re-establish communications out of fear of what the computers might do next.  The computers then demand access to all communications between the White House and the Kremlin.  In other words, they coerced the people in this movie in the same way.  tech companies and the government has coerced the people in real life today to give up all their privacy for the sake of convenience and security.  This loss of privacy has ripple effects.  The president now has to watch what he says when he talks to the Kremlin.  He knows that if he says something that might anger the supercomputer colossus, that it might lead to devastation, which parallels exactly how the loss of privacy has impacted the people today.  For the platforms controlled by the tech giants, a loss of free speech devastates your ability to communicate and exist in the digital square.  If you say what you really think without regard to how it might piss off the algorithm or the Colossus in Silicon Valley, you might lose your digital life in a world that's increasingly more digital.  Or worse, if you say something that the federal government might find threatening, You might lose a whole lot more than your ability to tweet.  You might lose your ability to exist in a very different and more permanent sense.  Everyone I know, at least those who have any grasp on reality, watches what they say, even in private digital communications, because they know it's at least possible that someone is always listening.  Even things that people might find perfectly safe to say in public, like at a bar or something.  Online, they will self-censor out of fear of being deplatformed and losing access to social networks.  Essentially, virtual worlds rule over by these techno-oligarchs.  This also applies to the politicians that are supposed to be reigning this power in.  and upholding the constitutional right to free speech, not only do they have to worry about what might be on a server somewhere over at Google or Facebook or Twitter, they also have to at least wonder, what kind of incriminating data do the government spying agencies have on them, both foreign and domestic?  And nobody is immune.  Even the president Trump was spied on by the Obama administration.  If these agencies are willing to spy on a presidential candidate and a president-elect, and maybe even a president, and use that information to try to destroy someone like Trump without fear of retaliation, then nobody is safe.  In the film, the computer makes more and more demands.  Eventually it has computers and listening devices installed and monitors Dr.  Forbin 24 hours a day.  It even forces the execution of some of the computer scientists that attempted to exploit and sabotage the supercomputer in order to stop it.  And eventually it levels an American military base as a show of force.  to get what it wants.  You see, once Colossus was allowed the access to power in the first place without anything built into it, no fail safe built into the system to prevent it from becoming too powerful, it was already too late.  The only thing built into Google, just as an example, was a joke of a slogan to not be evil.  And now they don't even have that.  Once they were given access to the power, it was already too late to stop them without making a significant sacrifice.  that's simply not in the nature of self-centered, egomaniacal politicians.  And the same thing can be said of the intelligence agencies.  as soon as they were given that power.  With no oversight, by the way, to collect all of your data, it was already too late.  And the power-hungry politicians will remain willfully enthralled by the wizards in Silicon Valley and the deep state spy agencies and bow down to their every wish out of reverence and fear.  the same way the people in this film obey their digital master and it will never change.  Instead, the people that used to care about privacy They'll call you crazy if it's something that you value.  What do you have to hide?  If you're not doing anything, you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

TLDR, she defrauded investors out of nearly a billion dollars using her vag power and remains unrepentant to this day, despite her fraud being laid bare for the entire world to see.  Basically, the premise of this two-parter outside of never trusting a bitch with this much eyeball showing is that millennial women in particular have been told our entire lives that we are so super smart and are such amazing creatures that we can do anything we set our brilliant minds to.  Parents, teachers, and society at large embedded this you-go-girl mentality into virtually all of their teachings our entire lives.  And, as was plainly foreseeable, the chickens have now come home to roost, so to speak.  I should start this video by saying that I truly love Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Truly.  I have a warm affection for her.  that feels almost like a friendship.  She says the dumbest things I have ever heard with such marked self-assurance that, I'm not even kidding, my affection for her borders on admiration.  Probably, though, it's just the warm feeling of satisfaction that I get by watching an entitled female millennial minority sink the Democrats.  All the while, no one on the left criticizes her because vagina.  Where do I even start with AOC?  By the way, I hate calling her that.  It makes me sound like a hipster douchebag.  But I'm not saying her irritatingly long name repeatedly.  So I will reluctantly abbreviate.  I guess we should start from the beginning.  Now, normally, I wouldn't begrudge someone for having an upper middle class upbringing or for any of the other familial stuff that we're going to be discussing.  But she built her identity on these things.  And she did say this.  She also said, It is nice.  Growing up, it was a good town for working people.  My mom scrubbed toilets so I could live here, and I grew up seeing how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity.  Your attempt to strip me of my family, my story, my home, and my identity is exemplary of how scared you are of the power of all four of these things.  I think it's necessary to put these comments in context because she's demanding that we view her as an impoverished, oppressed champion of the working class.  AOC grew up in wealthy Westchester.  She moved there when she was five because the Bronx was so dangerous and the schools were terrible.  Yorktown is a safe, prosperous community.  Her father was an architect, CEO of his own company, who, according to Glassdoor, probably made the equivalent of around $80,000, adjusted for inflation.  I'm sure there were some fluctuations in salary based on the real estate market, but he made a steady living once he started his company in 1986 and died before his salary would have taken a big hit during the housing crisis.  He died of lung cancer when she was 19, which although I couldn't find any information on whether or not he was a smoker, 80 to 90% of lung cancers are attributed to smoking.  This is from Heavy and as always is linked in the description below.  When Alexandria was 19 years old, a sophomore at BU, Sergio died of cancer.  His death threw the family into turmoil.  After Sergio's death, the family struggled financially.  They became embroiled in a battle with the Westchester County Surrogates Court, which handles the estates of people who die without a will.  The family feared that they might lose their Westchester home.  Eventually, they were allowed to sell the home at a profit.  But Blanca struggled to provide for the family, and after Alexandria graduated from college, she took on extra work to help keep the family afloat.  Alexandria began bartending and waitressing in addition to her job in a nonprofit that provides leadership training for Latino youths.  The fact that she portrays her mother as some kind of working class hero is a mischaracterization.  The truth is that her father died young, likely from a totally preventable cancer, and he failed to protect his family financially.  They bought the Yorktown home for $150,000 in 1991, and they were able to sell it for $355,000 in 2016.  So I'm a little unclear how a man with a good, steady salary for AOC's entire life was unable to pay down a $120,000 mortgage, assuming he put 20% down, over the course of 17 years, let alone when he died in 2008, to be so underwater that his family thought that they were going to lose the house, irrespective of the housing crisis.  Not to mention that he left no will and presumably there was nothing for the family but debt.  If it's true that she had to work multiple waitressing jobs and her mother had to scrub toilets just to keep the home, there must have been a significant amount of debt outside of the mortgage.  I'm suspicious of all of this.  It seems to me that there had to be a fair amount of financial irresponsibility involved.  AOC also claims that she was caught between two worlds, Yorktown and the Bronx.  I couldn't find any information on whether her parents got divorced.  It seems they didn't.  But she said that her father stayed in the Bronx to work at his architecture firm while she, her brother, and mother lived in their Yorktown home.  I also find this suspicious because it's not a crazy commute from her home to her father's work, certainly not unmanageable enough to necessitate breaking up a family and carting kids between the two locations.  Nonetheless, her father and mother's financial irresponsibility seems to have screwed the family, and her mom was reduced to the undignified job of cleaning toilets, in order to save the house they couldn't afford and, by the way, no longer needed because your kids had already left the home in AOC's case or were about to anyway in her younger brother's case.  Well, maybe not in his case because he's a musician or an artist or something stupid like that.  Still, it would have been just her mom and her brother or just her mom.  You don't need a house that you bought in a wealthy neighborhood to have access to better schools as an empty nester.  Just downsize.  AOC has also repeatedly honored single mothers and claims the death of her father led to her being raised by a single mother.  When a woman's husband dies, she's a widow, not a single mom.  And AOC was 19.  Her brother is just a few years younger.  She was not raised by a single mother, unless she's hiding her parents' separation, which, considering the claims that he did not live in the family house, I suppose is possible.  That is a really weird situation to me.  She said in an Instagram post, My mama was born, raised in Puerto Rico, lived in poverty, blah, blah.  She met my father, a Bronx boy.  They married, moved to New York City.  She didn't speak English.  My parents started from scratch.  New languages, new life.  Then came me, and they moved to start over again so I could have an education.  Mommy mopped floors, drove school buses, and answered phones.  She did whatever she needed to do for me.  When my father died, she was left a single mother of two, and again she had to start over.  After he passed, we almost lost our home, so we sold it and started over and over and over.  I found this particularly dishonest because she conveniently doesn't mention that her father died when she was an adult and her brother very nearly was.  Nor does she mention that they nearly lost a home they no longer needed, almost certainly through decades of poor financial decisions.  Nor does she mention that ultimately they were able to sell it for a giant profit.  Nor does she mention that capitalism allowed her father, through his hard work, to rise through the ranks and, despite his impoverished upbringing, become the CEO of his own architecture firm, which in turn allowed him to move the family to a straight-up wealthy community.  This is the biggest flaw in her casting herself as a product of the Bronx and a working class family.  The truth is, her family worked hard to get her out of the Bronx because it sucks there, and they worked even harder to leave the working class.  They were dismayed when they had to return to those kinds of jobs after her father's death.  I would say that AOC inherited her mother and father's financial incompetence, but it turns out that this widely publicized story of her inability to afford D.C.  rent turned out to be complete bullshit.  AOC claimed to the New York Times that despite being on the brink of making $174,000 a year, she couldn't manage to scrape together first month's rent and a security deposit for her new apartment.  I have three months without a salary before I'm a member of Congress, so how do I get an apartment?  Those little things are very real.  AOC reported having between $15,000 and $50,000 in her checking account as of the end of April 2018, According to a financial disclosure report she submitted to the clerk of the U.S.  House of Representatives.  The financial disclosure also reveals that she has an investment account value between $1,000 and $15,000.  Even though the median rent price in D.C.  is $2,700 and she had somewhere between $16,000 and $65,000 in savings and investments, she can't figure out how to make this apartment thing work.  Let's give her some federal budgeting tasks, you guys.  So she can't do basic math, or she was planning to spend an astronomical amount of money during the three months in question, or she's just a damn liar.  I'll let you folks decide.  There are two kinds of people to whom socialism appeals.  One includes impoverished, unskilled people with low IQs who can scarcely hope to ever compete in the free market.  The other includes those so wealthy, so privileged, that they are disconnected with the plight of the average person.  AOC seems to be a dangerous combination, a little from column A, a little from column B. Let's first take a look at this democratic socialism, because I'm pretty sure those are contradictory terms and this isn't really a thing.  I know Wikipedia is a useless source, but their definition is helpful.  A political philosophy that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production, with an emphasis on self-management and democratic management of economic institutions within a market or some form of decentralized planned socialist economy.  Wow, what nonsense.  The social ownership of the means of production is collective ownership, even if owned by workers.  Need I remind you of the many historical precedents involving land collectivization?  Check out my video series on the Holodomor, link below, in which this philosophy caused the genocide of probably more than 10 million people.  In democratic socialism, the collectivization of the means of production is meant to be by the workers.  But who dictates and delineates this?  They also advocate for wealth redistribution, property ownership caps, and massive government intervention in terms of mandating social equality.  How on earth can you claim to be an advocate of democracy while also giving the government these kinds of sweeping powers?  The result of this philosophy and conventional socialism is going to be authoritarianism every single time.  The workers, despite collective ownership, have no way to check the power of the government.  Democratic socialism, despite these supposed deviations from Marxist-Leninist philosophy, is really just one and the same.  Don't let anybody tell you differently.  Now that we understand her personal history of financial ignorance that led to her adoption of the totally contradictory terms, democratic socialist, let's take a look at the baby born of her idiocy and her idealism, shall we?  There has been much commentary on the Green New Deal, but I really just wanted to unpack the most breathtakingly stupid parts.  The full text is below.  This is from the Green Party website.  The Green New Deal will convert the decaying fossil fuel economy into a new green economy that is environmentally sustainable, economically secure, and socially just.  The Green New Deal starts transitioning to 100% green renewable energy, no nukes or natural gas, by 2030.  It would immediately halt any investment in fossil fuels, including natural gas, and related infrastructure.  The Green New Deal will guarantee full employment and generate up to 20 million new... Living wage jobs as well as make the government the employer of last resort with a much-needed major public jobs program.  I've got to admit, it's pretty adorable.  It's like some wide-eyed sixth graders wrote it.  It's also utterly impossible.  So how does she even propose that we achieve this?  The implementation of the Green New Deal will revive the economy, turn the tide on climate change, and make wars for oil obsolete.  This latter result, in turn, enables a 50% cut in the military budget since maintaining bases all over the world to safeguard fossil fuel supplies and routes of transportation could no longer be justified.  That military savings of several hundred billion dollars per year would go a long way toward creating green jobs at home.  On top of that, the Green New Deal largely pays for itself in health care savings from the prevention of fossil fuel-related diseases, including asthma, heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.  This is insane.  First of all, reliance on fossil fuel is an inescapable part of being in an industrialized society.  If we could avoid it, we already would be.  Secondly... Retrofitting all buildings in addition to her other absurd proposals like universal health care and job guarantees will cost an estimated $93 trillion.  Trillion dollars.  And despite her claims, we do not yet have the technology to do what she's demanding here.  As such, I'm skeptical that we can even put an accurate price tag on these literally impossible tasks.  The Green New Deal is not only a major step towards ending unemployment for good, but also a tool to fight the corporate takeover of our democracy and exploitation of the poor and people of color.  It will provide a just transition with a priority on providing resources to workers displaced from the fossil fuel industry, low-income communities, and communities of color most impacted by climate change.  I find this particularly funny because AOC claims she's concerned with corporate and governmental overreach while openly regarding herself as a democratic socialist, whereby workers collectivize the means of production and the federal government dictates the extent of private land ownership.  It baffles me that she can say that this would not lend to corporate takeover and exploitation of the working class.  I'll give someone a cookie if they can explain to me how a staggering amount of government intervention can protect the working class from the government, or for that matter, from corporations working in tandem with the government.  I encourage you to read more about the Green New Deal because I barely scratched the surface of its infeasibility.  Every point in the text is easily refuted, and if implemented, it would be economically and culturally catastrophic.  I do think there's a fair amount of skepticism on the left, judging by Feinstein's reaction to this army of tiny Marxists barging into her office recently.  She seems to have barely resisted spanking this little lispy brat on the spot.  Well, it's not going to get turned around in 10 years.  What we can do is put ourselves... Senator, if this doesn't get turned around in 10 years, you're looking at the faces of the people who are going to be living with these consequences.  The government is supposed to be for the people and by the people and... You know what's interesting about this group is I've been doing this for 30 years.  I know what I'm doing.  Nancy Pelosi and other Dems keep calling the Green New Deal innovative and ambitious.  That's just leftist doublespeak for infeasible and totally utopian.  It's never going to happen.  And even an attempt to make a fraction of these things happen would virtually bankrupt the country and yield none of the desired results.  is this who we really want to be influencing the masses to have actual governmental power?  someone who has no understanding of the economic toll that such a policy would render?  is this who we want to be in charge?  is she in charge already? the power is in the person who's trying regardless of the success.  if you're trying you've got all the power you're driving the agenda you're doing all this stuff like i just introduced green new deal two weeks ago And it's creating all of this conversation.  Why?  Because no one else has even tried. So people are like, oh, it's unrealistic.  Oh, it's vague. Oh, it doesn't address this little minute thing. And I'm like, you try.  You do it. Right.  Because you're not.  Because you're not. So until you do it, I'm the boss.  How about that?  You heard it here.  Is this who we want to influence?  cultural norms with her huge social media following?  To encourage a nation with a dismal birth rate to further self-destruct? There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.  And it does lead, I think, young people to... have a legitimate question, you know, should, is it okay to still have children? The solution, and this goes for all Western men, get millennial women under control.  We need to be taken down a notch.  No matter that her pussy boyfriend doesn't have a chance in hell to subdue AOC's wide-eyed insanity.  A ginger feminist.  Oh my God.  Outside of her entitlement and a lifetime of undeserved praise, the real problem with AOC and those like her is that reality be damned, facts be damned, associated costs with a plan that can never, ever come to fruition be damned.  They have the moral high ground and you should be ashamed of yourself. I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually and semantically correct than about being morally right. The destruction of our culture isn't going to be at the hands of a smirking white male.  It will be at the hands of an ethnically ambiguous 20-something with a 90 IQ and hot tits.  Don't be fooled.  Thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.

But considering that my time in politics has afforded me a front row seat to many of these attacks, attacks which are primarily promoted by the mainstream media, the education system, the entertainment industry, and feminism, of course, I feel inclined to make a video calling them out.  For starters, due to the fact that the dominant culture has accepted and promotes the narrative of the patriarchy, the focus has naturally shifted primarily to women's issues.  The belief is that since men quote unquote, have a monopoly on power and privilege, they therefore can't possibly have any personal problems and struggles of their own that are worthy of society's empathy and help.  This is why men and their very real, very significant problems are either being completely ignored, reported on very little, or, crazily enough, completely twisted into somehow appearing like they're women's issues.  Broke men are making it hard for women to marry.  Women are struggling to find men who make as much money as they do.  Men have no friends and women bear the burden.  Regarding some of the major issues that men today are facing, one example is the suicide rate.  In 2017, 47,173 Americans died by suicide.  Men died by suicide 3.54 times more often than women and white males accounted for 69.67% of suicide deaths.  Another example is the homelessness rate.  Gender and racial demographics are an important part of the American homelessness story.  The homeless population is largely male.  Among individual adults, 70% are men.  White Americans are the largest racial grouping, accounting for 49% of those experiencing homelessness.  However, African Americans and American Indians are dramatically overrepresented in the point-in-time count compared to their numbers in the general population.  You also have a sentencing disparity between men and women.  In 2012, Sonya B. Starr from University of Michigan Law School found that quote, men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do, and women are twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted, also based on data from US federal court cases.  In 2006, Anne Marie Stacy and Cassius Bone found that women receive far more lenient sentences than men after controlling for presumptive sentence, family responsibilities, offender characteristics, and other legally relevant variables based on examination of three U.S.  district courts.  Men are also 10 times more likely than women to be killed at work.  Looking at 139 separate occupations and discrete industries, an obvious pattern quickly emerges.  The safest workplaces are indoors and the safest occupations frequently require education beyond high school.  The most deadly occupations, on the other hand, are outside and often involve operating equipment.  This largely drives the huge difference in workplace fatalities between men and women, with 4,761 men dying on the job compared to 386 women in 2017.  The fatality rate for men was about 10 times that of women.  Men are also being outnumbered by women at a record high in universities worldwide.  And according to a recent LinkedIn report, due to more and more companies wanting to build gender-balanced teams, and hire and promote more women, women apply to fewer jobs than men, but are more likely to get hired.  The reason that I mention these facts is not to play some kind of game of comparison between men and women, but rather to point out that despite the mainstream focus on women's issues, It's gasp, not exclusively women who experience injustice and struggle.  Men also have very real, very important issues, and ignoring these issues isn't going to make them decide to flutter away and evaporate.  On the contrary, doing so either results in men logging off, so to speak, retreating into themselves and breaking off from the larger society, or becoming angry, resentful, and prone to lashing out.  It comes as absolutely no surprise to me at this point that movements like the men's rights movement have gained such popularity.  Men are tired of being shamed for their inherent qualities, such as masculinity, and pigeonholed as the perpetrators of all the world's problems.  Low marriage rates, childlessness, student debt, and even climate change.  Another very significant issue that many men today are facing is judicial bias in the family courts.  A study conducted in 2004 found that although the tender years doctrine had been abolished some time ago, a majority of Indiana family court judges still supported it and decided cases coming before them consistently with it.  A survey of judges in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee found a clear preference among judges for maternal custody in general.  Another survey, this one commissioned by the Minnesota Supreme Court, found that a majority, 56%, of the state's judges, both male and female, agreed with the statement, I believe young children belong with their mother.  Only a few of the judges indicated that they would need more information about the mother before they could answer.  Fathers, one judge explained, must prove their ability to parent while mothers are assumed to be able.  Another judge commented, I believe that God has given women a psychological makeup that is better tuned to caring for small children.  judges self-reporting of their prejudices against fathers was consistent with practicing attorneys impressions of them.  sixty nine percent of male attorneys had come to the conclusion that judges always or often assume from the outset i e before being presented with any evidence that children belong with their mothers.  40% of the female attorneys agreed with that assessment.  Nearly all attorneys, 94% of male attorneys and 84% of female attorneys, said that all judges exhibited prejudice against fathers at least some of the time.  On that note, I should add that according to a study conducted by wflawyers.com, about 50% of marriages in the United States end in divorce.  Of those divorces, about 80% are initiated by women.  In other words, women are both initiating the bulk of divorces and getting custody of the children.  While this video has already become fairly info-heavy, it really wouldn't be complete if I didn't at least breach the negative consequences of the Me Too movement.  While the MeToo movement may have started out with good intentions, I really can't say definitively because I can't read the minds of the women who launched the movement, while it may have started as a way to sound the alarm on genuine sexual violence committed against women, it morphed into something extremely dangerous when it started embracing slogans such as believe all women.  It doesn't take a genius to discern that believing all women without any regard whatsoever for evidence paves the way for witch hunts, trials by social media mobs, and even worse, false rape accusations.  False rape accusations are indeed very real, and they destroy innocent reputations, individuals, families, and even lives in the process.  According to the Harvard Business Review, men no longer want to work with women.  Men are treating their female co-workers differently because of MeToo.  19% of men said they were reluctant to hire attractive women.  21% said they were reluctant to hire women for jobs involving close interactions with men.  27% said they avoided one-on-one meetings with female colleagues.  I'm not claiming that our society has no need for movements like the MeToo movement.  But if these movements truly do want to accomplish something good, they need to be concerned with evidence, fair trials, and shining a light on all forms of violence, including the violence that affects men.  Often it seems that violence against women is regarded as a higher priority than that which men face, likely because women face it at a higher rate, but this shouldn't make the violence that men face any less of a concern.  On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States.  During one year, this equates to more than 10 million women and men.  One in four women and one in nine men experience severe intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner contact sexual violence, and or intimate partner stalking with impacts such as injury, fearfulness, post traumatic stress disorder, use of victim services, contraction of sexually transmitted diseases, et cetera.  The last issue I'd like to touch upon in this video is the coordinated and ever-increasing effort to attack men and boys for their inherent qualities such as masculinity.  While feminism may claim to have an interest in establishing equality, it's shown itself to be far more interested in usurping the traditional male role, and thus a war of sorts has been sparked.  Boys and men are not only shamed and belittled for their masculine qualities, their masculinity is deemed toxic, a danger to society even.  Meanwhile, the feminization of boys and men is upheld praised and defended.  Gone are the days when men were valued and respected for their desire to protect and to lead and for their societal contributions.  As a replacement, our culture has turned them into a punching bag, choosing to focus solely on what men have done wrong, are doing wrong, will do wrong, and how they can do better.  In the workforce, the focus has shifted to hiring women and minorities.  Believe it or not, some of these companies even go so far as to announce that they don't want straight white men applying for their jobs.  And in the family, fatherhood isn't regarded with the same significance as it once was.  While, to be fair, the role of motherhood isn't as regarded as highly as that of the career woman, it still is regarded higher than that of fatherhood.  Not even Father's Day is safe any longer from the destructive hands of our brave new woke culture.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of these people were of the belief that men are only valuable for their sperm.  Oh wait, some of these people are.  So what's the solution?  On some level, the problem seems unsolvable.  But that's perhaps simply because we've allowed our society to regress to such a disoriented state that trying to recover it would likely take decades and a concerted effort by many, many, many courageous people.  How then do young men today succeed in getting society to care about their issues when the most powerful institutions, the media, education, entertainment, and so on, are so set on belittling, blaming, and demonizing them?  On a material level, I would say that Some of the most effective means of combat are, firstly, refusing to feed those behind the propaganda.  For example, not supporting with clicks media sites that peddle anti-male rhetoric, or not paying to see a Hollywood film about toxic masculinity.  And also through activism.  For example, the men's rights movement.  Although I do have to confess that I'm not too familiar with how this movement operates, I'm only aware of it broadly speaking.  From my own experience, I would say that the best support for not only just navigating but persevering through this clown world that we're living in is by finding a strong, stable, tight-knit, real-life community.  Whether that community be found in a family, a friend group, a religious parish, or even a mentor or role model.  Escapism and even a desire to isolate oneself can be extremely tempting nowadays, even for me, to be honest.  Oh, it sounds wonderful.  But the truth is that You can't change the world if you're not even a part of it.  For all those currently under attack by the dominant culture, men, but particularly straight white men, Christians, unborn babies, women who reject feminism and so on, we're only gonna see an end to these attacks if we choose to remain present and resolute, allowing ourselves to get disillusioned, to label society a clown world and then to bow out won't ease the problem.  As Cardinal Newman so wisely stated, good is never accomplished except at the cost of those who do it.  Truth never breaks through except through the sacrifice of those who spread it.  Thank you so much for watching this video everyone.  I really hope that you enjoyed it.  Just a little bit of housekeeping before I end this video because there's some announcements I've been wanting to make for a while but I keep forgetting so I'll do it now.  First of all, I no longer have a PO Box in the United States.  I live in Austria now and I share a PO Box with my husband.  So if you're still interested in sending mail, please do not send it to the US.  Please send it to the Austrian PO Box, which I have linked in the description.  And on that note, mentioning my husband, many of you will have noticed that I changed my channel name.  Now I know that I'm kind of known and branded, so to speak, I hate that word, as Brittany Pettibone, but it felt really wrong to keep Brittany Pettibone, so I switched it to Brittany Sellner, and I hope the change is not too drastic and that you all get used to it very soon.  Lastly, if you enjoyed this video, if you enjoy the content I make, please do consider leaving me a tip via PayPal or picking up a copy of my book, which is available now both in German and English.  That is all, that's it for the announcements.  Once again, I really hope you enjoyed, and I'll see you guys next time.

What is civilization?  I don't know.  I can't define it in abstract terms, yet.  But I think I can recognize it when I see it, and I'm looking at it now. My favorite types of architecture are Hindu temples, Roman temples, and Gothic churches.  The term Gothic was originally applied as a pejorative in Italy because the work was associated with the Germanic barbarians of the north who invented it.  Giorgio Vasari used the term barbarous German style in his 1550 Lives of the Artists to describe it.  Gothic architecture began in 12th century France but spread quickly, diversifying across Europe into regional forms.  To me, English Gothic is the perfect architectural expression of the Germanic soul.  It is superior to the plain simplicity of classical architecture.  This was the first time the Northern people had the opportunity to build enormous stone structures and they seem to have emulated the ancient forests of the North, which were our holy sites before Christian times.  The ribbing and the vaulted ceilings and buttresses all remind me of trees and forests and the rose windows are clearly based on flowers.  The northern soul expresses itself through the replication of the perfect forms found in nature.  John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic and proponent of Gothic revival, wrote, An architect should live as little in cities as a painter.  Send him to our hills, and let him study there what nature understands by a buttress and what by a dome.  Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty, if only we have the eyes to see them.  It is perhaps the principal admirableness of the Gothic schools of architecture that they receive the results of the labor of inferior minds and out of fragments full of imperfection raise up a stately and unaccusable whole.  In one point of view, Gothic is not only the best, but the only rational architecture, as being that which can fit itself most easily to all services, vulgar or noble.  I believe that the characteristic or moral elements of Gothic are the following, placed in the order of their importance.  1.  Savageness 2.  Changefulness Naturalism Grotesqueness Rigidity Redundance.  Architecture is the art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by man that the sight of them may contribute to his mental health, power and pleasure.  When we build, let it not be for present delights, nor for present use alone.  Let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for, and let us think that a time is to come when these stones will be held sacred because our hands have touched them, and that men will say as they look upon the labor and the wrought substances of them, See, this our fathers did for us.  the idea of self-denial for the sake of posterity or practising present economy for the sake of debtors yet unborn of planting forests that our descendants may live under their shade never i suppose efficiently takes place among publicly recognised motives of exertion.  yet these are not the less our duties.  nor is our part fitly sustained upon the earth unless the range of our intended and deliberate usefulness include not only the companions but the successors of our pilgrimage.  god has lent us the earth for our life.  it is a great entail.  it belongs as much to those who are to come after us as to us.  we have no right by anything that we do or neglect to involve them in unnecessary penalties or deprive them of benefits which it was in our power to bequeath \u00b6\u00b6.","channel.id":"clxmi0p8602xdcdviudoykej0","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCZAENaOaceQUMd84GDc26EA","channel.name":"Survive the Jive","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJV_TeJQdM0VR7ExYitmiV8UoCRKFe8ggH_gRnVdyA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2009-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker reflects on the achievements of Weston Mair and the resilience of European civilization, but struggles to define what civilization is.

Like a family weaving its story through time, made up of headstrong individuals, plotting their own courses, asserting their wills, yet nurtured by common roots, bound by common traits, pulled by similar destinies, we must now master and heal ourselves. and like that family all members strive to make their mark.  sometimes rivalries swell between siblings and cousins so restless creative and animated by life are we.  but there's something that runs through all of us something always humming underneath.  let us now let that note ring out as a chorus a symphony to celebrate and know who we are.  what of it then?  what is it that runs throughout? What of the free men of ancient Greece who could debate openly in town councils, but what too of the all-thing in northern Europe, the meetings where consensus was arrived at through exchange and debate?  Contests in ancient Greece determined the best plays, showing the individual stamp of the playwright.  We later see that same one-upsmanship among painters to perfect light, shade, and perspective.  What of our musical forms spreading across Europe, the orchestra and all of its instruments, the system of musical notation, sonatas, symphonies, operas.  We hear a searching and longing in the various types of our music and that vastness of space in orchestral scores, the love of the wandering troubadour, even the large and domineering sonics of the amplified electric guitar and sprawling electronic tones of our more contemporary music. What of those who explored land and sea, seeking the ends of the earth, the Vikings, Romans, Macedonians?  The Italian Marco Polo's curiosity and fascination with the unknown inspired fellow Italian Christopher Columbus to do something no one had done.  Portugal's Henry the Navigator spoke of uncovering secrets previously hidden from men.  These are not exceptions but traits, showing again in more recent polar exploration, mocked by some contemporary academics.  But whoever people sound in mind and spirit could help but be moved by Robert Falcon Scott's stirring message to the public, his last words written while dying in Antarctica. We took risks.  We knew we took them.  Things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for complaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our best to the last.  Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions, which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman. To quote our contemporary, Ricardo Duchesne, who asked in his book, The Uniqueness of Western Civilization, What caused the build-up of ideas?  From the Italian Galileo to the Polish and Prussian Copernicus, these ideas then being picked up and debated across Europe, to the Dane Tycho Brahe in his study of comets, the German Kepler building on Brahe, and also the englishman william gilbert.  these ideas then fused with the dutchman christian huygens centrifugal force the french descartes algebraic geometry and so on.  A sense of independence and freedom runs throughout our history.  What we find in our people is that, rather than state-sanctioned, top-down mandates directing scientific and artistic life, the Westerners more often had independent spaces of inquiry.  Guilds, universities, laboratories, artistic circles, who sought to dare and create and explore. Rome developed an intricate legal system of concepts that reflected the individuality of each person.  In Old English, the word for law was lagu.  In Old Norse, loge, referring to past deed laid down in layers.  We even find in Old Germanic society all free men and women, who comprise the majority of the society, being equal under the law.  After centuries, the above examples influenced the English common law, European parliaments, and the US Bill of Rights and separation of powers.  Were these just good ideas, or perhaps a natural fit, an instinct?  Can such notions sometimes get out of hand?  Are they, like anything, susceptible to corruptions and confusions?  Can they be skewed when confronted with outside ideas and unusual circumstances?  Of course, but the fact is that examples of our sensibilities and the way we create our environments can be found in varying eras.  We are not defined by just one turn of events in history. E.L.  Jones called us ceaseless tinkerers in his book The European Miracle.  In this era of censorship, there's a statistic by Charles Murray in his book Human Accomplishment that could probably get this video banned and put our channels at risk, so we will leave it to you to be an adult and look it up.  But shall we just say here, history is not just a question of invention, and not just a question of influence, because everyone is influenced by what they learn or observe from others.  It's what you do with skills or information that bears your mark.  To quote David Landers, Europeans did not invent the heavy plough, but they did improve and adapt it.  They did not invent the horse collar and the horseshoe, but they did improve it to create a new style of warfare.  They did not invent water-mills, but they did improve upon new accessory devices. Whence does this come?  With such engines of passion and curiosity driving us, conflicts naturally arise, but past wars do not negate the wider bonds of our people.  Oftentimes, wars were fought to assert sovereignty, hearkening again to that theme of freedom.  And of course, sometimes we were at the hands of leaders who, unrestrained by small-scale bonds and duties, sought megalomaniacal gains or sold out to the lure of unchecked power, sometimes subverted by alien influences. This doesn't mean that when the German and English soldiers put down their arms to play games with each other during the Christmas truce of World War I, they didn't know deep down that they were related.  They did.  Just like in the early 1900s, when elderly Union and Confederate soldiers embraced each other at American Civil War battle anniversaries, Just like all of Europe responded in horror to the massacre at Chios, when tens of thousands of Greeks were killed by Ottoman troops during the Greek War of Independence. what of the many claims in varying parts of our lands to the stories of king arthur and his knights?  arthur's name is related to the word bear.  arth is welsh cognate with the greek arctos and latin.  we looked up in our northern skies near the arctic and saw the ursa constellations containing the north star which guided our explorers.  in finland's epic the kalevala the bear is referred to about sixty times.  we see offerings to ancestral spirits of grain and dairy in the days of old as our children now excitedly leave cookies and milk for what we call in modern english santa claus and father christmas. In spring and summer, we find similar folk customs among the various European cultures.  These related festivals, taking place around May 1st, carry some regional distinctions, but all bear similar key elements, from Floralia, to May Day, to Walpurgisnacht, to Beltane, to Rudinizia.  Other related holidays throughout the year demonstrate a calendar, a rhythm, shared symbols, meanings and beliefs that reveal commonalities amidst a splendid assortment of regional expressions.  Are we to be told we are unrelated when we see different versions of the Cinderella fairy tale found among the varying strands of our ethnicities?  Ashen Puddle in Germany, Cendrillon in France, Cenerentola in Italy, Ashy Pelt in Ireland, Katie Woodencloak in Norway, Rashin Koti in Scotland, Pepelaska in Bulgaria, The Hearth Cat in Portugal, We share a bond and worldview as reflected in our stories and customs that have lasted through the ages, seeing ourselves in them. There exist different theories about migration of peoples, different theories and new discoveries being made about genetics.  At least in the recent history we currently know of, we are peoples who were forged between the Arctic and Mediterranean, between the Atlantic and the Black Sea and Caucasus region.  Some of us ventured out, and the lands where we settled bear the marks of our instincts, our ethnoculture, our biospirit. We can thus feel at home when we travel in various parts of the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, No matter what we may learn, no matter how surprised we may be by future findings, our story reaches back much further than is commonly thought today.  Know what has been shared in this presentation.  Let it spur you on to discover more.  Know that we have a common source, and that now, more than ever, share a common fate.

This group advocates Identitarianism, a movement started in France and based around the preservation of Western culture and identity.  I once met one of the leaders of IBO, Martin Lichmes, when he was visiting the USA.  As you may know, Martin Zellner has been the victim of all kinds of state harassment for the past two years.  First, a prosecutor made outrageous claims that IBO was essentially an illegal organized crime syndicate.  He said the group's function was to organize for the purpose of committing illegal hate speech.  Zellner and 16 people were charged with hate speech and conspiracy.  In a shockingly short amount of time, all were acquitted in court.  The court ruled that the activities of the IBO were, quote, legal activities at their core.  Then, after the Christchurch murders in New Zealand, the media unilaterally convicted Zellner of being part of an international terrorist group.  with no evidence, of course.  Zellner's house was searched twice.  All kinds of investigations were opened.  A mailing list was illegally leaked to the press and made public.  His American fianc\u00e9e was placed under investigation.  He was barred by the U.S.  State Department from entering the USA because of the Austrian investigations.  At some point, he married his American fianc\u00e9e in Croatia, if I remember correctly, and she is currently living in Austria.  Zellner filed nine complaints against the authorities.  The complaints went before a federal court in Graz.  This is the capital of the Austrian state of Styria.  All nine complaints were upheld.  In fact, the court ruled that the two raids on Zillner's house were without any justification.  The court found that the authorities took action without any reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.  First, I must say that the Austrian court system seems light years better than anything you will find in the USA.  When the IBO members were charged with fake crimes in March of 2018, They were already done with a 10-day trial and acquitted by the end of July in the same year.  In America, this would have taken several years.  Now the courts are vindicating him after months and months of relentless harassment.  Even after being vindicated, a restaurant in Graz canceled his room reservation where he was supposed to hold a press conference.  He had to hold a press conference on the sidewalk instead.  Okay, I have some news about our favorite teenage girl, Greta Tintin Turnbull.  How dare you!  She was just in Turin giving an off-the-cuff speech.  She told the crowd that politicians should be put against the wall.  Well, to an English speaker, this is a reference to mass executions.  Greta apologized for the comment and claims that put against the wall is a Swedish expression for holding people accountable.  She blamed the language barrier and the fact that her speech was unscripted.  When Greta has a speech written for her, it's bad enough, but she really does poorly when she has no script.  Then right after that, she sent a tweet complaining about the trains being overcrowded in Germany.  So the same person demanding that everyone ride the train is complaining that the train is overcrowded.  She posted a picture that appears to show her sitting on the floor next to a massive pile of luggage.  Well, Dorch Bond, the train company, actually replied to her comment with a real zinger.  Quote, Thank you for supporting us railroaders in the fight against climate change.  We were happy that you traveled with us on Saturday in the ICE 74.  But it would have been even nicer had you also reported how friendly and competently you were looked after by our team at your seat in the first class.  I thought this was a great response.  After that, Greta's handlers must have taken over because she was in damage control.  She sent follow-up tweets claiming she was glad that the trains were crowded and that people had misunderstood her original tweet.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.

He was initially charged with hate speech and conspiracy, but was acquitted in court.  After the Christchurch murders, Zellner was falsely accused of being part of an international terrorist group.  His house was searched twice, and his fianc\u00e9e was investigated.  Zellner filed nine complaints against the authorities, which were all upheld by a federal court in Graz, Austria.  The court ruled that the two raids on Zellner's house were unjustified and that the authorities took action without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n\nIn contrast, Greta Tintin Turnbull, a teenage climate activist, made headlines for her off-the-cuff speech in Turin, where she suggested that politicians should be put against the wall, a reference to mass executions.  She later apologized, claiming it was a Swedish expression for holding people accountable.  However, she was criticized for hypocrisy when she complained about overcrowded trains in Germany, despite advocating for people to ride trains to reduce carbon emissions.  The train company responded with a witty comment, and Greta's handlers later intervened to try to repair the damage.","responses":"[1] Politics: Mentions politicians, government actions, and political activism.\n[1] Harassment: Mentions state harassment and unjustified actions by authorities.\n[1] Activism: Mentions political activism and advocacy.\n[1] Accountability: Mentions holding people accountable and being responsible for actions.\n[1] Hypocrisy: Mentions hypocrisy and double standards in behavior.\n[1] Climate Change: Mentions environmental issues and reducing carbon emissions.\n[1] Government: Mentions government actions, policies, and officials.\n[1] Law Enforcement: Mentions authorities, investigations, and raids.\n[1] Human Rights: Mentions rights and freedoms, and their potential infringement.\n[1] Social Justice: Mentions advocating for people's rights and fairness.\n[1] Government Control: Mentions government actions and control over individuals.\n[1] Human Behavior: Mentions human actions, motivations, and consequences.\n[1] Social Norms: Mentions expectations and standards of behavior in society.\n[1] Public Perception: Mentions how people perceive and react to events and actions.\n[1] Reputation: Mentions how people's actions affect their reputation and image.\n[1] Identity: Mentions how people identify themselves and are perceived by others.\n[1] Expression: Mentions the right to express oneself and one's opinions.\n[1] Power: Mentions the distribution of power and influence in society.\n[1] Influence: Mentions how people's actions and opinions can influence others.\n[1] Authority: Mentions the role of authorities and institutions in society.\n[1] Responsibility: Mentions being accountable for one's actions and their consequences.\n[1] Morality: Mentions what is right and wrong, and how people make moral judgments.\n[1] Ethics: Mentions the principles and values that guide human behavior.\n[1] Morality and Law: Mentions the relationship between moral principles and laws.\n[1] Social Order: Mentions the social structures and institutions that maintain order.\n[1] Social Hierarchy: Mentions the social structures and relationships between people.\n[1] Social Dynamics: Mentions how people interact and influence each other.\n[1] Social Psychology: Mentions the study of human behavior and social interactions.\n[1] Human Nature: Mentions the characteristics and tendencies of human beings.\n[1] Freedom of Speech: Mentions the right to express opinions and criticize."}

He illegally entered Switzerland in 2006 and has lived there ever since.  While living in Switzerland, he has fathered three children.  He currently holds a Category C residency permit.  which designates him as someone who has allegedly integrated well.  In 2017, he was a poster boy for the left-wing non-profit Scheweizerisches Albeiter Hilfswerk, also known as SAH.  The group was created by socialist activists in 1936 with the mission of providing charity to needy children of the working-class proletariat.  However, since economic migrants from the Third World make very reliable voters for socialism, the group has long since changed their focus to open borders activism.  Araya was featured on the group's official brochure in 2017 as an example of a non-European immigrant who had embraced his host country, learned the local language, and successfully integrated.  He is quoted as saying he came to Switzerland to give his children a, quote, better and easier life.  Apparently, he was even employed by the nonprofit at some point.  Several days ago, Araya fled Switzerland after threatening a female neighbor with a knife.  On Monday, Araya was at the main train station in Frankfurt, Germany.  According to a large number of eyewitnesses, he pushed a mother and her eight-year-old child into an oncoming train.  The eight-year-old was hit and killed instantly.  he also attempted to push a seventy eight-year-old woman in front of the train as well.  he fled the scene but was chased and apprehended by witnesses.  he has been charged with murder in two counts of attempted murder.  numerous witnesses were also treated for shock.  The murder stunned Germany so much that Interior Minister Horst Seehofer cut his vacation short to address the public.  Seehofer disclosed the suspect's background, but urged the public not to draw any conclusions.  Naturally, his press conference included the ritualistic denunciation of so-called right-wing hate speech.  The local prosecutor says that Araya did not know any of his victims and he was not drunk or on drugs at the time.  There was a similar murder in Fuerda, Germany, only nine days earlier.  A 34-year-old German mother was pushed in front of a train and killed.  A 28-year-old Albanian Kosovar was charged with murder.  He did not know his victim.  The media widely censored all information about the perp, or they misrepresented him by simply saying he was Serbian.  Last January, three teenage boys were hurled in front of an oncoming train in Nuremberg.  Two of them were killed.  The perpetrators were an ethnic Turk and an ethnic Albanian, both aged 17.  For days, the German media ran falsehoods that the boys died in a tragic accident.  while some sort of mutual argument was going on.  However, surveillance video showed that the larger perpetrators intentionally hurled the teenage boys in front of a train that was going full speed.  By the way, Horse Zeehofer himself pointed out that Araya had been held up as an example of an integration success story by SAH.  I think this shows what an absolute fraud these leftist non-profits are.  They are one giant gaslighting operation and the so-called mainstream media prints their falsehoods unchallenged as if they were true.

I hope you're all doing well.  In today's video, I want to expound upon a sentiment that seems to be coming more and more true lately, at least from what I can observe.  And that is that the world is being run by children.  Let me explain.  Obviously, I don't so much mean it in the literal sense, despite the fact that there actually are a few extremely influential children nowadays who are spearheading national and even international campaigns.  I mean it more in the sense that the world seems to be run by adults with the mentality of children.  The loudest, most emotional, and oftentimes the most illogical voices, voices that some would argue are voices of useful idiots, seem to be given the biggest platforms and the loudest microphones.  There's nothing wrong with open borders.  Why a brave Democrat should make the case for vastly expanding immigration?  The Abortion Actually campaign by the National Women's Law Center says, abortion is healing.  Abortion is selfless.  Abortion is compassion and abortion is love.  Preserving my children's innocence is an act of preserving white supremacy.  Calls to end inhumane border conditions aren't enough.  ICE must be abolished.  Marriage is sexist.  Give me a civil partnership any day.  A second article seeming to agree with this sentiment says quote, the meaning of marriage is so deeply rooted in patriarchy and gender inequality that in the modern sense, it does not make sense for a young woman to tie the knot unless she has a partner willing to reject all traditional overtures of marriage.  Now granted, it's probably not exactly fair to say that these people have genuine power, It's more appropriate to say that they're given the illusion of power while in reality being figureheads that are simply being used as tools to promote certain narratives and to bring about certain changes in our society.  They're the visible faces of a revolution against order, the standard norm, and against reality in general.  That said, much of their ideology wouldn't be effective, much less even be taken seriously, if it weren't being constantly promoted by the most powerful people and institutions from from Hollywood, to the media, to wealthy elites, to politicians, and to the education system.  For many of these useful idiots, for lack of a better term, I know it sounds kind of mean, I don't mean it that way, but it's just the best term that seems to explain them.  So anyways, for many of them, there seems to be an ever increasing shift towards equating their personal imaginations with reality.  If I think that I am something, or if I feel that something is true, then it therefore must be true.  BBC films teach children of 100 genders or more.  The broadcaster has been accused of sowing confusion in classroom materials to be shown to children as young as nine.  All masculinity is toxic.  Feminist writer and activist John Stoltenberg believes we need to give up manhood for good if we want to live morally sound and love-filled lives.  Ex-transgender man now wants to live as sexless alien and has had nipples removed.  Jareth Nebula, 33, has shunned human genders and wants to be accepted as a being from another planet.  I've gone back to being a child.  Husband and father of seven, 52, leaves his wife and kids to live as a transgender six-year-old girl named Stephanie.  Science at its core is systematically racist and sexist.  Fathers aren't necessary.  Finally getting off the patriarchal BS bandwagon.  Instasham.  Is this teen the new Rachel Dolezal?  White girl wears grills, makes rap videos, and has her hair in dreadlocks as she claims she's black.  The new masculinity issue from GQ.  Back when you were a child, did you ever have moments where you either pretended to be or maybe you even wanted to be something else?  like a character from a video game, or a movie, or a princess, or even a unicorn, maybe.  I don't know.  I mean, I think that most of us did.  I know that I certainly did.  The difference, though, is that at least for most of us, our parents, teachers, friends, and society in general, didn't reinforce this delusion.  Had my parents been like, oh my gosh, yes, sweetie, totally.  If you see yourself as a unicorn, that's what you are.  And we're gonna march right down to the school right now, talk to your principal about having everybody in the school refer to you as a unicorn.  Who knows how damaging that would have been for me psychologically.  Another difference is that sooner or later, children reach the age of reason.  They develop the ability to reason and deduce, and at this point, much more is demanded of them.  They're not only expected to fit into the societal order, they're expected to contribute to it.  Unfortunately, this sort of mentality seems to be becoming a thing of the past.  Some of the most powerful people and institutions of our time now actively reinforce delusion to the point that it's impeding many from ever reaching any kind of level of reason.  no matter how old they are, and in this sense, it's more like a disorientation.  Our society really is doing a great disservice, not only to these people, but to all of us that the choices of these people affects for the sake of personal feelings.  No society powered by feelings, personal whims, and imaginations is going to survive long.  Feelings are too unstable, fleeting, and oftentimes in conflict with reality.  This is why every day it seems as if we're waking up to a matter and matter world.  Oh, and they can get their periods, too.  Woman, 30, claims to be in a five-year relationship with Boeing 737-800. she nicknames Darling and wants to marry.  Man who, quote, never felt human now lives his life as a dog in a 2,000-pound fur suit.  A white man raising their hand to comment in history class is violence.  Math is apparently now racist and Seattle schools want to incorporate this into their math education.  Another catastrophic consequence of this childlike mentality is a lack of respect for authority.  but I suppose it only makes sense.  If a person is taught that the entire world should run according to their personal feelings and then their personal feelings dictate that there's no way that they should ever be subject to a higher and oftentimes necessary authority, then why should they?  Instead of obeying authority, instead of respecting the natural order, and instead of focusing on building upon past achievements in order to truly progress as a society, these people are instead obsessed with focusing upon and finding something racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, fill in the blank with every single aspect of our society and then tearing it all down.  Down with the police, down with history, down with borders, down with teachers, down with the nuclear family, down with the president.  As Fulton Sheen asks, can you build anything down?  No, you can't.  While it's perfectly fine to want to replace negative aspects of our society, these people aren't aiming for the negative aspects.  They're aiming for the imperfect, but the necessary ones.  And worse, they're sorely incapable of building up anything worthy in their place.  This frightening disorientation we're witnessing has stemmed from a lot of things, frankly.  For example, parents and the manner in which they raise their children.  It's also taught at schools and universities and then reinforced by movies, music, public figures, the media, and so on.  All seem to be working together to infect our society with a disorienting virus that once it's taken root, seems almost impossible to not only stop, but to reverse.  As the disorientation takes a stronger hold on those infected, reality seems to get farther and farther away.  And for those of us who do remain sane, we're sometimes tempted to question if we're the crazy ones, or if in fact the patients are now running the asylum.  The answer to this problem is actually simpler than one might think.  We must never allow ourselves to deny what we know to be true.  whether it be out of fear or exhaustion or even a desire for acceptance.  We must protect the truth at all costs, as it alone is what's going to keep our society from devouring itself from the inside out.  As Ben Johnson once wisely said, stand for truth.  It is enough.

Don't you think such a theory, such a radical theory, is antisocial?  On the contrary.  It seems to me that it is more practical and humane.  What about the women who want babies now and in 10 years will not be able to have babies?  Rather impractical, don't you think?  Oh, John, you do ask hard questions.  I should think that instead of being impractical, it is really very practical and intelligent and humane.  But, Mrs.  Slee, in this country, having babies is the only thing left which is both unrationed and untaxed.  Do you think we really ought to stop?  Well, I suppose a subject like that is really so personal that it's entirely up to the parents to decide.  But from my view, I believe that there should be no more babies. Hey folks!  I found a really interesting poll recently on European birth rates.  Now typically we're told that mass immigration is needed, simply in order to keep the population level static.  Because at present, most European countries are below the replacement birth rate.  So simply put, we are having too few children to reasonably sustain ourselves in the future.  Of course, one peculiarity to all this is that the population, so far as I can tell, was never asked how it could best be assisted in maintaining a steady reproductive rate.  It was independently decided by the United Nations that we would simply import people from the Third World to continue our lineage.  Because on average, non-white demographics tend to have a much higher birth rate.  What I wasn't expecting to come across in this poll was evidence from most countries in Europe, including and especially the United Kingdom, that although at present the native population is below the sustainable reproductive rate, it's not because women do not want to have children.  And that was actually something that was surprising to me.  Actually, the figures show the complete opposite.  So let me give you an example.  In 2002, at a central point of the Labour government's immigration explosion, a population study from the ONS showed that only 8% of British women did not want to have babies.  And only 4% wanted one baby.  Now that's staggering!  In fact, the most popular desire of British women, with an aim of a clear 55%, was to have at least two children.  A further 14% wanted three children, and another 14% wanted four.  In fact, 5% wanted five or more children.  Now, if you are seeking a either stable or slowly growing population, well, these numbers would more than cover for the 8% of women who did not want children.  In other words, whilst fertility does need a little bit of a push, a wee bit of encouragement and a helping hand, the desire to have children, and that's the most relevant thing here, the desire is there.  And it's there overwhelmingly so.  Now I know this doesn't seem like a stunning revelation, But actually I think it's very significant.  An assumption has been made that British couples simply aren't having as many children because they don't want them.  And this misrepresentative claim has been used to justify the reasoning behind mass third world importation.  But this ONS data turns that assumption on its head.  It is not for lack of desire, it's for lack of a believed incapability, and that is a very significant difference.  I don't know about you, but for a long time I was under the impression that this was some sort of existential crisis of the psyche.  Women were simply indifferent or apathetic, and that couples generally were less inclined toward a more familial lifestyle.  There is a marked difference between a population group that wants to reproduce in large enough numbers to sustain itself, but, for whatever reason, feels it cannot, and one that, as we've been persuaded to believe, is simply in the last dying gasps of its civilizational burnout.  I've struggled to really find any editorial on this data, which means that it's being suppressed, or at least not advertised, not circulated, almost as though it were deliberate.  I frequently hear the complaint that our women aren't having enough babies, as though they just weren't interested, but as we can see, there is a good deal more desire to procreate than formerly realised.  Although I consider the major demographic changes absolutely critical to the future of the West, I'm really against the eulogising of our people, all these references to the fall of Rome and Weimar degeneracy.  I do sympathise with them and I understand why they're relevant, but I also wonder if they're preparing us for a more easily accepted defeat.  And information like this study is really reassuring to me because here we have some very clear and very encouraging evidence that debunks the claim that our women have simply become detached, disinterested and unconcerned about their future.  So this information might feel quite small fry, and you might wonder why I've bothered to make a video on it, but actually, convincing a people of its own anatomical extinction, particularly when the evidence points to the contrary, is a very profound form of psychological warfare.  So much so that I was actually surprised to learn how desirable our women found the prospect of motherhood.  So the revelation might feel small, but actually, it shows that vital distinction between a civilization on its way out, and a civilization that just needs a little bit of temporary support.  So we need to make much, much more of this info.  If we can clearly demonstrate that children are indeed in the hearts and minds of our women, it is going to make the demographic replacement a much more thorny proposition.  It is much easier to replace a population that imagines it cannot reproduce, and has been persuaded of its own impotence.  Anyone who continues to argue for replacement migration in light of this knowledge really begins to look what we all really know they are.  Vengeful, genocidal fantasists that wish to see the death of the West.  It is one thing that birth rates are low, it is quite another thing that they are low because resources are being elsewhere more favourably distributed.  That is both a scandal and an outrage.  Whilst every effort is made to attend to the needs and concerns of third world mothers with 19 children, more than 80% of whom are on child welfare benefits.  It is difficult to find any formal assistance, charity or otherwise, for English women.  Since they would like to give birth, why don't they get first dibs on the benefits?  And that's a serious question.  What's happening here is not remotely normal.  Why, in a population struggling to sustain itself, are we seeing adverts in London for sterilisation?  These measures are actively deterring our population's capacity to flourish.  In fact, not only to flourish, but to continue full stop.  The immense pressure placed on housing and even just finding a school place for your child should start to be considered a human rights issue.  We really need to start being much kinder to ourselves and putting us first.  There's no reason that based on this evidence we cannot reassert our focus and look to distribute money spent on welfare benefits for ungrateful immigrants on our own future mothers.  The more we can debunk this need for replacement migration, the more difficult it will be to ignore our case for some sort of restorative policy.  Overwhelming our country with foreigners who are both hostile and consider themselves in direct competition with us is actively hampering our future.  almost every european will know at least some couples who are both in good jobs and who would never feel able to afford to have a third child.  actually only three types of people now have three children or more the very rich the poor and newly arrived immigrants.  So women, this is mostly a message for you.  We need to be making far more noise about the bounty of resources and goodie bags the state is practically forcing into the hands of third world mothers.  And it's not just the state.  There is a whole sinister web of bad faith actors out there, maneuvering under the title of charitable organization.  I find this deeply suspicious, so I'm going to really start interrogating this.  And I'm not making the case here for special female privileges.  I'm simply asking why the giant pot of money lavishly dished out on African and Middle Eastern mothers appears to be bypassing, if not outright triumphing, over our young ladies.  What's important here is that among immigrants, any provision for their children paid for by the European welfare state will be better than anything they could have expected in their country of origin.  Especially those who have come from third world countries.  Whereas native Europeans are concerned about competition for school places, housing shortages pushing average house prices up to between five and ten times average salary in their area, and how to afford one child, let alone three or four, But as the evidence shows, if they cannot afford the children, then they're onto a loser.  Simply put, we're being frozen out of our own continuation.  Mass importing a competing ethnic group with a much higher birth rate is more or less keeping our women treading water.  If European governments are really so worried about population decline that they would contemplate bringing in higher reproducing populations from other parts of the world, we have to ask, wouldn't it be more sensible for them first to work out whether there are policies that could encourage more bountiful procreation among their existing population?  You know, the people who actually built and own the country?  There are evidently resources there, we need to be making more of why they're not coming to us first.  In Poland, for instance, which has the same problem with low birth rates, the Justice and Law Party raise child benefit in order to try to raise the native birth rate and diminish any reliance on immigration.  In Hungary, Viktor Orban has announced new tax and loan benefits for families with at least two children to help them buy homes, and waiving personal income tax for women raising at least four children.  We do not need immigrants, he said, we need Hungarian children.  Women below 40 who marry for the first time will be eligible for a $36,000 subsidised loan, and a third of the debt will be forgiven when a second child is born.  In fact, the entire loan is waived after the third child.  And just like that, Hungary solved its birth rate problem.  What's interesting really here is that at the very least you'd expect our government to examine whether there are things that they are currently doing that are contributing to the worsening of the situation, including suffering the loss of one household salary for at least a period of time.  So having two children entails even more concern and even more worry.  A middle or average income couple in most European countries worries about having just one child and how they will afford that child.  It seems obvious to me that there are so many things a government can choose to do before deciding to import the next generation from another continent.  I mean, you couldn't choose a more divergent group with more contrasting values.  And I think we have a right to be hugely sceptical here about the motive.  I'm not trying to be conspiratorial, but given that there are such a high number of immigrants on welfare benefits, we know that it simply cannot be true that they came here to pay for our pensions.  we see very clearly that the next generation of migrants are not likely to contribute to the national economy as we were previously told.  Thankfully, what we see in this study is that there is more life in us yet.  Now, when they tell us we are not having enough babies, we can direct them to this study and ask why they are harvesting a future workforce for the next generation in the foothills of the African desert rather than the wombs of the women whose home this is.  Do not be under the impression that we have lost the interest, only the means.  And that's positive, that's deeply positive, because that need only be a temporary phenomenon.  I'm a bit worried that I haven't articulated my point very well here at the end of this video.  What I'm trying to stress is the relative ease with which Europe's birth rates could be put back on track.  We have been given the impression that this task is somehow insurmountable, that there exists a continent-wide existential burnout which carries all the signs of civilizational decline.  I don't know about you, but that feels a little bit suspect to me.  This is what I call death rattle propaganda, and as intoxicating as it is, its chief design is to leave us hopeless, disenchanted, and convinced of a rapidly approaching mortality.  And whilst these concerns are valid, never forget the distinction between a death that is natural, and a murder by way of policy.  What's happening to us isn't natural, it's the result of coercion and forced collectivisation.  And yes, we've been slow to realise it, but it isn't too late to resist.  It is the job of the radical immigrationists to try to seduce us into believing that this is all just part of the organic cycle of history, just part and parcel of living in a more globalised world.  Their job is to maximise the feeling of annihilation, so that we more readily live up to its status.  No, I am going to trace every decision made, every policy brought into fruition that has disenfranchised our people and made it difficult for them to reproduce.  Then we can begin to make a case for their reversal.  And who is going to stop us?  This is our home, we can do what we like here.  We will not permit our hostile elites to continue actively pursuing policies they know result in harmful consequences to life.  The erasure of white people is both foreseeable and avoidable.  These people are powerful, but they're not omnipotent.  Cheers, ladies.  You can hand your benefits over to us now.  You're not needed here anymore.","channel.id":"clxmi0pob038acdvis567kpbj","channel.yt_channel_id":"UC5dp17aXpuG-KVM_q3UERig","channel.name":"Daughter of Albion","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/5qIrkFRrDftURKrPJNegOIF06ouoBprypTGP9qUg4nBwJgCTb2xNfO3afLitwZKru3IrNxetlw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2019-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker discusses a recent poll on European birth rates, which shows that women in Europe, particularly in the UK, want to have more children than previously thought.

If evil exists as an innate force in the universe, could it be concentrated into mineral form?  In a remote village in rural England, an ancient custom developed from this very supposition, which is maintained to this day. What the devil is going on here.  This stone, which you can see is absolutely terrifying.  these children, is known locally as the devil's stone.  The Devil's Stone is largely ignored here.  There's only one day of the year anyone pays any attention to it and that is today, the 5th of November.  Normally a day associated with gunpowder, treason and plot.  But in this village in Devon, it's associated instead with a stone.  They have lit it up and there's a whole large gathering which you can't see in the darkness over there, eating pork and drinking beer and preparing to heave the stone and turn it over, as they have every year on this date since before records began.  Some books I have read from the 19th century claim that this tradition dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, the turning of the devil's stone.  But the truth is, we simply don't know why it is done or when it started to be done.  All we can say is that the locals have believed, since before people can remember, that if they don't turn this stone over tonight, every year, then the devil will come.  And even the local pub, is named after this stone, the Devil's Stone.  So, thanks to the strong lads of this village who will come soon enough, we can be certain that the devil will not plague these lovable children. Of course you might have guessed that the Devil's Stone Inn is of course haunted.  Beneath its arms there lays a stone, where the devil rests his weary bones, and every year they turn it o'er with crowbars and a hearty roar.  They will not let the devil rest, he is no good in such a pest, but away he creeps and away he flies, but comes again before they rise. Okay, give it to him.  Why would bikers be interested in this ancient turning of the stone ceremony? I think it's a thing that, you know, I mean, people just, a traditional thing that they've been doing for many, many years.  And I suppose bikers love to see it.  And they like coming out and have a chat, have a beer, whatever, in a lovely evening.  And I guess, what better do you want? Well put.  Do you have any opinion on the stone itself? I mean, I think it's a great thing, really.  I mean, my opinion is, you know, they turn in every year and, yeah, I mean, very good.  I take, I got it, it come from Dartmoor.  I think he did, there was two stones like it, but that's only because I'm only a teenager, really.  I mean, you know, like I say, I think it was two similar stones like it. Do you think the attitudes to the stone have changed in the village of Sheffield? I mean, like I said, I've seen it last 10 years now.  I mean, I think there's more people than they're used to, you know, coming to see it.  And obviously people moving down here, you get more spectators. When I first came, I thought, what is this?  What else do I do with it?  And I think some of my predecessors were quite wary of it as well.  So yeah, it's grown as the years have gone.  And the numbers have grown as well, enormously.  This is Sheffield.  Not for us any fantastical fun of Guy Fawkes night.  Not for us the burning of bonfire.  or the fun of fireworks.  Not for us the almost destruction of Parliament.  And nor for us a great big birthday celebration, even if this is your day.  Happy birthday if it is.  For this is Shebiah and in Shebiah we turn the stone on the 5th of November.  Tradition we go back to.  Tradition that goes back into the mysteries of the centuries of time.  For the Bible tells us that the devil thought he could have all things for himself.  He rose up in heaven.  He thought he could be in control.  But God said, no.  The archangel Michael was sent to cast him out with his angelic host.  Imagine the scene.  The battle is lost.  The devil must go.  It's part of the cost.  But not now, he pleads.  An extension, please.  Flexible, if you like.  But go, he must.  And so, at last... The devil is cast out from heaven Cast from heaven to earth below But not to die in a ditch.  That's North Loo Trapped by a stone, that's how he's brought low.  But even then, still his wiles seep out from below.  He's trapped, he may be, but still his secret deals are there for each of us.  to be tempted by.  Resist him to resist those secret thoughts that come, that entice us so.  Those visions that never quite work out.  Those words that so easily harm.  We need God's help still each day.  And so we come with Church of Michael here behind us.  We come once more to seek the power from above.  We come as a sign to turn the stone once more this year.  And so, people of Shebia and beyond, Let us call upon ringers strong to once again turn the stone.  Let's cry, turn the stone, turn the stone, turn the stone.  from the stone from the stone from the stone from the stone come on.  It comes out of a story in the Bible, in the book of Revelation, of the devil being cast out of heaven.  And if you like, it's Easter, the other end of the year.  But so many places on hilltops were associated with Michael, the archangel, with a battle with Satan.  St.  Michael's Mount down in Cornwall is a classic example.  Brentore is another just down the road from here.  So here we're up on a hill.  It's St Michael's Church.  There's a stone which doesn't belong.  It's a glacial moraine.  So presumably it was bought here in glacial times.  It doesn't fit with the geology of the area.  So stories become associated.  Maybe there was a particular incident or something.  Who knows? Do you know when the church became St Michael's, when it was? Well, it's always been St.  Michael's that we know of, and there's been a church here since Saxon times. So it's possible.  this is a Saxon tradition? Quite possibly.  Certainly, the Saxons knew of the stone.  They used it.  It was a place where you came and paid your taxes.  Oh, really?  This was the central point of the Shebi 100, yes. Ah, that's interesting.  So there's certainly been mythology going back to the very beginning. There's associations with the stone going well, well back. And you're going to do your part to make sure they carry on into the... It's part of the local tradition here.  Yeah, it didn't happen during the war.  Oh, right.  For obvious reasons.  You know, you couldn't easily get people together.  Lights and so on were discouraged at night.  But people still came out surreptitiously and the stone was turned.  So there's an ancient tradition here that people value and one can build on.

I was attending Brittany and Martin Sellner's wedding last month.  The day after the wedding, I was at lunch with some of the other attendees and I was talking to them about Brittany and Martin.  As far as persecution is concerned, I cannot think of two people who have been lied about more than Brittany and Martin.  They have been raided repeatedly without just cause.  They've been demonized by the media.  Martin's been accused of being the catalyst for a mass shooting.  Yet every time I speak with them or watch their videos, they exude hope and positivity.  So I was talking to somebody at the luncheon about this, and I was like, how do they do this?  How?  And they said kind of matter-of-factly, well... They're happy warriors.  We hear the term happy warrior all the time, but the character of the happy warrior is a William Wordsworth poem.  I won't read the whole thing, but I encourage you to read it, and I've linked it below.  Wordsworth says that all men in arms should strive to be this person.  who with a natural instinct to discern what knowledge can perform is diligent to learn abides by this resolve and stops not there but makes his moral being his prime.  care is placable because occasions rise so often that demand such sacrifice more skillful in self-knowledge even more pure as tempted more more able to endure as more exposed to suffering and distress, thence also more alive to tenderness.  I read this poem for the first time after the connection was made to Brittany and Martin, although I've heard the term a thousand times.  And I've been thinking about it since, especially as the gaps between my videos keep getting longer and longer, and the breaks still fail to regenerate my spirits.  My podcast Beauty and the Beta hasn't skipped a beat.  It's linked on my channel.  But with my gaps in production, I feel like I'm really failing you.  I have this big platform and such a wonderful devoted audience and I'm still stuck in this cycle where it's so hard to produce new content.  And when I do, I engage in a fair amount of despair peddling.  I am more of a reluctant complaining warrior.  As such, this was a theme in my discussion with E. Michael Jones, which is also linked on my channel.  I asked him, how do we keep going when we're being lied about our livelihoods and worse, our characters destroyed by leftist tactics?  And he told me we should rejoice in persecution.  And I think he's right.  Look at the quality of people we're pissing off.  Media Matters is now after YouTubers.  Folks filming sitting on the floor of their bedrooms like I am right now are infuriating giant left-wing organizations funded by actual billionaires.  That should be a point of pride, I suppose.  With so few resources, we're making enough of an impact that they think we need to be destroyed.  The ADL is also up my ass, along with virtually every other YouTuber in the realm.  This 58-minute documentary that the ADL tweeted about, and I've linked it below, has an incredibly high production value, suspiciously high.  It features interviews with all of our favorite man-jawed, questionably post-op leftist activists, Brianna Wu, Becca Lewis, the usual suspects.  But strangely, they didn't put this expensive and very long documentary on any platform.  It isn't on YouTube.  And as far as I can tell, no one really watched it.  I had never even heard of the organization that made it.  Yet the ADL is retweeting it and someone put up some serious funding.  So I started to think maybe the creation of this wasn't even about reaching the public.  Maybe it was about reaching us.  What they want is to demoralize us, fill us with such dread about losing our businesses at any moment because the folks that are against us clearly have some heavyweight backers.  They want it to become so anxiety-provoking to continue content production that it no longer seems worth it.  They want us to know that they will destroy our lives, our livelihoods, and we can just wake up one day, open our computers, our channels will be gone, and there will be front page slanderous headlines about us.  These tactics are particularly effective against women, and people like Becca Lewis, Media Matters, the ADL, they know this.  This is why about biannually we see this the women of the far right headline in the New York Times, the Guardian, Salon, always using our first and last names, little bits of information about where we live or something like that that can be found but generally are not known.  This is a tactic to remove women specifically from right-wing movements, and it's effective.  Just look at how much content I created in 2017 and the beginning of 2018 compared to today.  They know that this type of fear wears down women more successfully than men.  The hypocrisy is not lost on me that groups that purport to champion women's rights and self-proclaimed feminists like Becca Lewis are engaging in a legitimately sexist, targeted harassment campaign as an organized strategy of psychological warfare preying specifically on female vulnerabilities, the very existence of which they wholly reject.  Although I do have to say there's something sort of pure about how unabashedly evil and diabolical this really is, that they'll use what they claim to be their most sacred value, protecting so-called marginalized groups.  as a means to destroy those same marginalized groups, in their view at least.  I obviously do not think women are oppressed or should be treated as a protected class.  But they do this because women bring a normalcy to a movement that these groups want to paint as insane, fringe, filled with incel-type mass shooters in the making.  When there are a bunch of normal-looking, well-spoken married women involved, it's much more difficult to convince the general public that only friendless, isolated, basement-dwelling losers would associate with the dissident right.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Almost everyone I know in this movement is a normal, good-looking, family-oriented man or woman with sound values.  that's in a healthy relationship.  And this must be downright frightening to the left, which is why Brittany and Martin specifically represent such a threat.  First of all, they're absurdly good looking.  They're also in a traditional Catholic marriage.  They have healthy social and family lives.  They use clean language.  And worst of all for the left, although they're realistic about the state of our cultures, they do not engage in despair peddling.  They represent a hopeful future for the West.  Younger people look at them and they're like, I want that.  I want to be in a marriage like that.  I want to have a life like that.  That's why happy warriors are the biggest threat.  Martin's YouTube channel was deleted a few weeks ago, then reinstated.  This wasn't some kind of mistake.  And this is why James Alsup was banned.  He's a thoughtful, young, white man with a lot of energy and with a beautiful family.  He's never outrageous.  He's funny.  And he, like the other happy warriors, exudes positivity and gives people hope.  Amazing Polly made an excellent video a few weeks ago.  I think it's called Google is Stressing You Right Out, but I've linked it below.  Please watch it.  She goes through the Google leaks and dives into a study that was circulated called Algorithmic Discrimination from an Environmental Psychology Perspective, Stress-Inducing Differential Treatment. Let's look at the paper, okay?  Here's the intro where they talk about sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination are being built into the machine learning algorithms.  And this creates stress and the psychological discomfort resulting from algorithmic discrimination is similar to that which results from being in a physically stressful situation.  They talk about the cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences of stress.  And here, the National Institute of Health talks about heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other illnesses, as well as mental disorders. She speaks extensively of the algorithmic discrimination that's ongoing and those things with a longer history that are similar.  That was the aim of this study, supposedly ways to reduce stress.  But of course, we all know this is just a way for Google to profit from our eroded sense of community. They're talking about an environmental stressor, that is comparable to algorithmic discrimination.  And the sample they used was crowding on subway cars.  Andrews and her colleagues studied the behavior of people on subway cars that were assessed as more or less likely to feel crowded based on the number of people present.  The team worked with data from one of the world's largest telecom providers who can gauge physical crowdedness in real time in terms of the number of active mobile users in subway trains.  They report that the telecom provider randomly sent targeted mobile ads to individual users, and based on a sample of 15,000, give or take mobile phone users.  The results suggest that counterintuitively commuters in crowded subway trains are about twice as likely to respond to a mobile offer by making a purchase versus those in non crowded trains.  As increased crowding invades one's physical space, people adaptively turn inwards and become more susceptible to mobile ads. Google, YouTube, Twitter, other leftist groups with massive backing are instituting mechanisms that cause mass stress reactions in the populace, then are capitalizing on the subsequent chaos and the vulnerable population.  isolated state that results.  The ADL, like companies with targeted ads, creates then exploits the outcome of these stress reactions.  For right-wing men in the movement, they do this by creating a sense of financial dread, randomly deleting channels, threats of banning, demonetizing, etc.  The shock and subsequent stress of losing a job can feel worse than losing a spouse, research suggests.  And there's a battery of physical consequences, too.  Getting fired can cause unhealthy weight loss, followed by similarly unhealthy weight gain, acne, high blood pressure, sleep problems, heightened anxiety, paranoia, and depression.  While this is true for both men and women, there's evidence that fathers are especially vulnerable to the adverse physical and psychological effects following the loss of a job.  Simply put, unemployment can make dads literally sick.  These cumulative effects are particularly apparent with men because they often see themselves as the breadwinner.  For women, these organizations take a different approach.  They focus on the psychology of losing community.  Myriad studies have been conducted examining the consequences of social exclusion.  Research has shown that individuals who lack belonging, like due to rejection, often respond in very pro-social, seemingly adaptive ways, including increases in social compensatory behavior and the desire to affiliate.  Similarly, other research has found that individuals can become aggressive after social exclusion, exhibit deficits in cognitive and self-regulatory abilities, and behave dishonestly.  Generally, social exclusion is a painful experience, having effects on both physical pain as well as emotional responses.  All humans respond badly and attempt to adapt and conform to social norms if they're ostracized, but women tend to have a deeper fear of social alienation.  There's an obvious biological basis to this.  From an evolutionary standpoint, we have babies and are dependent on men, on our communities.  And if we have poor social relationships, if our mates die or are also isolated, we will die and so will our offspring.  This is why instilling fear of financial insecurity in men is more effective, because they're biologically predisposed to be breadwinners, and why instilling fear of social alienation in women is more effective, because we're biologically predisposed to be dependents, to make our communities peaceful and cohesive as a protective mechanism.  My analysis about fear and groups like Media Matters has really put me on the fence about this PewDiePie donation to the ADL thing.  On the one hand, I think it could be a brilliant troll.  On the other hand, His retraction was so earnest that part of me thinks this may have been an attempt to placate the ADL, maybe get back some mainstream media credibility or to appease someone he's working with or someone that's close to him.  I don't know.  I can't really decide where I land on this one.  But if I'm right about their psychological tactics and the typical male response, I think that it's more likely that PewDiePie, who faced serious financial loss at the hands of the ADL before, upon his marriage merged his fears of income loss and censorship with with his wife's fears of social alienation, particularly after being named in Christchurch.  And they collectively decided that this might buy them some social and financial security.  I actually don't worry that much about having my channel deleted or the financial repercussions, especially since I put some other irons in the fire when it was obvious that we were all going to get the boot.  What is much harder for me is this feeling that I can never reenter normal society.  It was much worse in Seattle when it was probably true, but in Idaho, I'm in good company, so I don't experience this fear of alienation nearly as much.  So maybe there's a lesson here.  When we're around people like us, when we have healthy social environments, groups of like-minded individuals that live around us and share our values, how can we ever be truly ostracized?  It really is quite impossible.  No matter what someone at the ADL or Media Matters says about me or does to my channel, my community, my family, my friends will be unfazed.  So what does it really matter to me?  But if I still lived in Seattle, I'd be totally screwed.  The income thing is different and much harder to solve.  Like I've been recommending for years, we need to move to Bitcoin, to anonymous funding.  We need to build our own self-sustaining financial platforms as best we can.  We also need to employ each other.  And when we have jobs available, fill them with others that share similar values.  Even more important than the practical aspects I've discussed we really do need to embody this concept of the happy warrior.  Like E. Michael Jones said to me, we have to find a way to look forward, not to wallow in the end of our civilization as we know it, but to look optimistically upon the future and what we can build anew upon the ruins.  As always, I need to follow my own advice.  I really have engaged in too much black pilling.  I've allowed it to kill my productivity, to steal my joy, and I've infected my audience with it.  But I think the even more cynical, nihilistic left cannot stand against a self-sufficient army of happy, right-wing warriors.  They're not prepared for that.  He finds comfort in himself and in his cause, and while the mortal mist his gathering draws, his breath in confidence of heaven's applause.  This is the happy warrior.  This is he that every man in arms should wish to be.  Thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.

Their lives weren't easy, facing harsh conditions, but they persevered.  They urged the people to repent, and for all their warnings, all of their prophecies always came true.  Here are 10 amazing facts about those prophets you probably didn't know.  1.  John was the greatest of all the prophets.  Out of all the prophets, over thousands of years, why did Christ, God himself, call John the greatest?  Whilst many of the prophets lived tough lives, and John was no exception here, living in the wilderness on locusts and honey, one thing truly stood out.  so john had great influence over the people enough to strike fear into the hearts of their rulers.  it can be estimated that millions of people all round the country travelled to the rivers to meet john.  the people were restless.  they were willing to do anything.  he asked even make him their leader but he never used that influence to start a rebellion and he himself was not consumed by what was going on in the world around him.  rather he was isolated from the world and he held to the mission which scripture had prophesied for him to announce the coming of the Messiah to prepare the way of Yahweh as it says in Isaiah.  for this amongst other reasons he was called by Christ the greatest of prophets.  Number two, almost every prophet has God in their name.  Although in the modern English translation it is not strikingly obvious, the word El means God and it's short for Elohim.  So names such as Samuel, Daniel, Ezekiel, Michael, Joel, Nathaniel, they all have the El at the end.  Now the word Yah is short for Yahweh, God's actual name, but it can also be translated with a J or an I. So we have Jeremiah, Isaiah, Obadiah, Zephaniah, Zechariah.  Each name also had a unique meaning and often was tied to the prophet's mission or purpose in life.  So what does your name mean and does it tie into your life?  There is more to the Jonah story.  Whenever one reads the Bible, if you study the history around that period, you will gain a much greater understanding.  And Jonah especially demonstrates this.  During the period of Jonah, Assyria was on the verge of becoming a superpower, an empire.  And it was only a matter of time before they invaded Israel.  Now Jonah realized if he didn't warn Assyria, then they couldn't repent and they'd be destroyed.  So Israel would be saved, and this is why Jonah tried to run away.  But there's more.  The Assyrians worshipped a half-fish, half-human goddess.  This goddess had a child which upon birth was fed and kept alive by doves.  Eventually the locals found her and named her Semiramis, which in ancient Syrian means dove.  Now Jonah in Hebrew also means dove.  And the Assyrians spoke a close Semitic language to Hebrew.  So when Jonah ends up in the whale and is cast upon shore, we have a man called Dove coming out of a fish.  And this is why they believe the prophet.  And who thinks that God has no sense of humor?  4.  Abel was the very first prophet.  Christ had many interesting things to say to the Pharisees.  One particularly was that of Abel accusing them of being responsible for the deaths of Abel to Zechariah, clearly referring to prophets in this context.  now abel does not have any words of prophecy attributed to him but that does not mean he was not a prophet.  the fact is very little is known about him.  however abel did perform a prophetic act by bringing a lamb to offer to god centuries before god gave the law that required it.  abel knew the promise of his parents of a saviour coming and by offering a lamb the very best of his flock as a sacrifice to god he was prophesying of the coming messiah the coming mission of jesus to die on behalf of his people.  that itself would make abel a prophet of god.  Number five, there are many more unnamed prophets.  In the Bible, we have the 16 books of the prophets, 16 men who got their own book describing their mission and the events that took place around their lives.  However, there are clearly a hundreds more mentioned, many of which are unnamed.  Some such as Gad and Nathan even had their own books, at least in the past.  but they now seem to be lost.  evidently that will mean that the Bible has been continuously changing over the centuries with books being added and removed.  it would seem that God made sure that in each time period we as a people had the necessary information available.  although it may seem at times that Satan runs the world God is truly the one in complete control.  never forget that.  number six every prophet reveals the coming of the Messiah.  Although each book of the prophets has different themes and surrounds different events, they all have one thing in common, revealing Christ one way or another.  Out of the major prophets, Isaiah reveals that the Messiah was to be born of a virgin, that he was to suffer, that he would speak in parables, in Jeremiah that the Messiah would bring a new covenant, in Ezekiel that he was to be the good shepherd to expose the bad shepherds, whilst Daniel gives an exact timeline of Christ's coming.  from the minor prophets micah reveals that he would be born in bethlehem malachi that messiah would be preceded by a messenger john the baptist in zechariah that the messiah would come riding in a donkey and there's many many more.  this is why the old testament is just as important as the new testament and without reading both you cannot truly understand the bible number seven.  daniel is the most disputed prophet in today's modern era.  the bible unfortunately is bashed and criticized more than ever and daniel by far has the most critics.  some try to claim he never existed while others will simply dispute his timeline.  now Daniel confirms the exact timing of the coming of Christ is undisputable.  he depicts the rise and fall of all the empires and even identifies a certain organization as the beast.  so it's no wonder that many would rather this book disappeared and therefore you must realize the hidden agenda behind it all.  by disputing Daniel what they are really doing is trying to dispute Christ, although subtly.  God said he would test us and test our faith, so stay strong and don't doubt the Bible.  Some Prophets Overlapped Each Other.  The books in the Bible are not all necessarily in chronological order, and so it can be difficult to determine what timeframe each prophet fell into.  However, when working it out, it does become clear that the ministries of the prophets often overlapped each other.  It's very possible.  some were contemporaries and perhaps even knew each other well.  Three of the major prophets, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, for example, all lived at the same time.  Jeremiah being the older, senior, and around Jerusalem's siege, Ezekiel and Daniel were later both deported to Babylon together.  9.  Jeremiah traveled to and died in Ireland Most of the prophets, we don't know what happened to them after their books, what lives they lived, or how they died.  Some however have legends and are even recorded in history, one of those being Jeremiah.  When Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem, Jeremiah fled to Egypt with the king Zedekiah's daughter, Teotephi.  take him with him the stone of destiny.  now.  Jeremiah was warned by God.  Egypt was about to be invaded so once again fled first to Gibraltar then to Cornwall and then to Ireland.  now the king of Ireland was a descendant of the Judah Zeruli.  Upon arriving, Jeremiah married Teotephi to this king.  Since she was from the Judah-Pharaz line through David, this reunited the two Judah lines as prophesied and would uphold God's promise to David that there would always be a descendant of his on the throne.  Eventually this Irish throne moved to Scotland centuries later and then eventually to England.  taking the stone with them.  Queen Elizabeth can officially claim her descent all the way back to King David.  The line still exists to this day and God's promises never fail.  Number 10.  The third spirit of Elijah is here.  Although John the Baptist was the second Elijah to make way for the coming of the Messiah, There is also a prophecy of a third Elijah.  If Christ had a prophet for his first coming, he will also have one for his second coming.  However, this time it's slightly different.  Rather than one single person preparing the way, it will instead be a mass awakening, the spirit for the true children of Israel.  This is revealed in Malachi.  He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers.  Meaning, the Israelites will finally wake up and remember their true heritage, who their fathers and ancestors were, where they came from, and this prophecy is being fulfilled now all around us before our eyes.","channel.id":"clxmi0mkw0121cdviprmvy4pp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","channel.name":"TruthVids","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVAyptfys-UmOQ2qarn1fQod4Buiqcki0hctHTY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"When God made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, He established a special relationship with their descendants.

Under this new policy, if you make statements such as, I am a proud white nationalist, your post will be deleted and your account could be permanently banned.  But what is white nationalism?  Facebook hasn't actually defined what they mean by that term.  So what is this ideology which we are not allowed to express?  I'll tell you what it is.  My name is George Hutchison.  I'm a white nationalist.  I didn't come to know white nationalism because of something I saw on Facebook or a meme I saw on Instagram.  I came to know white nationalism because I spent half a decade in university studying race relations at one of the most left-leaning universities in Canada.  The part of university that had the biggest impact on me was just discovering how much animosity there is towards white people in modern academia.  Arguments like how all white people are racist, only white people can be racist, white people invented racism, white people are privileged, white people are fragile, Canada and the United States are white supremacist countries.  Over the years of study sitting in those lecture halls, I couldn't help but wonder to myself, what impact are these kinds of messages having on the non-white students sitting to the right and the left of me?  How do these ideas make them feel about white people?  It's not difficult to see how statements such as, all white people are racist, can inspire towards white people feelings of animosity and resentment.  Under the Canadian Criminal Code, statements which incite hatred towards an identifiable group are classified as hate speech.  And the ideas which are propagated about white people in our universities easily conform to that definition.  My concern about the ideas that are being taught about white people in our universities is further exacerbated by the demographic changes that are taking place here in Canada and across the Western world.  A process by which white people are rapidly becoming a minority.  What is the future going to look like when white people have become a small, democratically disempowered minority in countries where our universities are teaching people things like, all white people are racist?  I'm concerned that the convergence of these factors is going to create conditions that threaten our culture, our political autonomy, and our physical safety.  It's with those ideas in mind that I come to a conclusion which I think is reasonable and intuitive, which is that if people in positions of power are inciting animosity and resentment towards us, then white people need to start standing up for ourselves.  That might take the form of articulating the counter-arguments to the hate speech that's being propagated against us in our universities.  or if it's the case that we are skeptical about the viability of mass immigration and multiculturalism, then we need to express those concerns and democratically pursue political solutions that align with our perceived political interests.  But however we go about it, in principle, we need to stand up for ourselves.  Then I discovered that, oh, there's a name for this type of thinking, this idea of standing up for your people, asserting, protecting, defending, advancing their political interests.  And that name is nationalism.  Random House dictionary defines nationalism as the policy or doctrine of asserting the interests of one's own nation.  Today we often use the word nation in the sense of a country, like the nation of Canada or the American nation.  But traditionally, nation doesn't mean country.  Nation means ethnic group.  Random House defines nation as a group of people of the same ethnic family.  We Europeans, or white people, are a group of people of the same ethnic family.  We share common lineage and common descent, and in that sense, we are a nation.  So if nationalism means to stand up for your nation, and a nation is a group of people of the same ethnicity, then nationalism simply means to stand up for your people or for your ethnic group.  White nationalism means to stand up for white people.  The oppression of white nationalism, therefore, is the oppression of white people.  It is an attack on the very notion of white people standing up for ourselves in principle.  And in our increasingly globalized and ethnically diverse societies, where identity politics is becoming an ever more prominent component of everyday discourse, to oppress white nationalism means to deny to white people self-interested participation in modern political and intellectual life.  And that's exactly what Facebook is doing with this new censorship policy.  Under this new policy, it is apparently not against the rules to discuss identity politics, but it is against the rules for white people to express our self-interested perspective on identity politics.  Under this policy, it is apparently not against the rules to intellectually attack white people by calling us fragile or privileged or to say things like, all white people are racist, but it is against the rules for us to intellectually stand up for ourselves in response to those attacks.  Facebook's new policy apparently has no effect on the nationalist organizations of other ethnic groups.  For example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, etc.  Facebook has been very clear and explicit that this new policy discriminates exclusively against the nationalism of white people.  This is an indisputable example of racial discrimination.  And that's why we are suing Facebook.  The Ontario Human Rights Code guarantees that every person in Ontario has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour or ethnic origin.  And Facebook's new policy is a clear violation of that guarantee.  This new policy marks a significant milestone in the history of race relations because it is an explicit example of racial discrimination against white people by a major corporation and media platform.  Through this action, Facebook has vindicated the concerns of white nationalists and demonstrated that our movement is indeed necessary.  Furthermore, the implementation of this policy deals a significant blow to proponents of mass immigration and multiculturalism by demonstrating to white people that the promise of a peaceful multicultural society is not coming to fruition and that our future as a minority could be one of censorship and oppression.  Because this video is itself a violation of Facebook's policy, we expect that it will be deleted and that our account will be banned.

I think it's quite ironic that we passed here the Fine Gael stand, the Fianna F\u00e1il stand, the main political party stand, and what are they doing?  They're offering Irish farmers, inviting them into their stand to give them a cup of tea.  Here's a free cup of tea, Barry's tea in Fine Gael stand, Lion's tea in the Fianna F\u00e1il stand and people then are supposed to be thankful and grateful that you have parties that are representing their interests when in fact they're betraying them, they're selling them out.  This fund was signed up to the Mercosur region allowing 99,000 tonnes of substandard South American beef.  We cannot adopt a policy of being lapdogs to people who don't care about this country in the European Union.  The same people who foisted and forced the 64 billion bank bailout on this country that added 64 billion euro to the national debt and which caused the policy of government austerity.  There's a minister now, Minister, You're an austerity minister, and he walks by.  This is Minister Charlie Flanagan, the minister for part of the austerity government that has misruled this country since 2011.  This is the same Charlie Flanagan who's promoting Project 2040.  He's running again.  Security bringing them off.  There are a lot of people from Langford that came over to congratulate me on what I'm doing.  Yeah.  Traitor!  Traitor!  Traitor!  Selling out Ireland!  Traitor!  We see what happened last week in relation to the beef deal.  Beef farmers have been sold out.  Beef farmers will become an extinct species.  They won't survive another few years of this government's failure to address the malpractices at the heart.  of the meat industry in this country, and in relation to corporate dominance of agriculture.  And corporate dominance not only in agriculture, wider than agriculture, when it comes to society in general.  The Minister for Climate Change, Richard Bruton, is talking nonsense inside, as he has made a living out of talking nonsense for the last 30 years.  I challenge Minister Bruton at the Fine Gael stand across the way in relation to the contradiction of the government's approach to punishing farmers and scapegoating farmers for climate change.  And at the same time, they're standing over, they facilitated and they're standing over a rigged beef deal, a raw beef deal that was negotiated last Saturday night, that sold out soccer and beef farmers in this country, giving them no, where there was no commitment to increase the base price, which is now at an unsustainable 3.45 a kilo.  And we have a situation where The 30 months age limit, the discredited 30 months age limit is locked into that deal.  All that was done in relation to the 36 months is to give a derisory 8 cents bonus for cattle sold or slaughtered before 36 months.  and to increase the quality assurance bonus to 12 cents to 20 cents for under 30 months.  Cattle slaughter at under 30 months of age.  Why challenge Minister Bruton, who ran away basically to this stand, from the Finebale stand, when there was an agricultural debate organised by his own party, on this issue?  Because if he truly believes in doing something for climate change, and if he believes that the carbon footprint from... the agricultural sector in this country is too great then he would embrace and be pushing.  he would be an advocate around the cabinet table for increasing raising the 30 month limit to 36 months because any farmer who knows who feeds cattle knows that to finish cattle before 30 months involves pushing them, feeding them with increased levels of concentrates and not taking advantage of the clean green image that we have as a nation where we have a temperate climate.  and where we can produce beef fed on grass, which can be easily done at 36 months.  In fact, you can finish beef steers especially at 34 months.  But 30 months is used as a price suppressing mechanism by the factories, that if you have cattle, 30 months and one day over, you lose your 12 cents bonus, or after last weekend's deal, the 20 cents bonus.  And you have to do it and 8 cents is dead.  That's punishing farmers and that's punishing the environment.  This man is talking inside about protecting the environment.  He won't come outside and talk about it, about his contradictory policies.  Everything is done for big business and corporate interests.  Everything is done to protect the lower corporation tax rates for multinational corporations, while we tax our own people to the hill.  And they're talking about introducing carbon taxes in the forthcoming budget.  I left Ballymahan picket on Monday.  They're still standing out on picket duty outside factories because farmers are not going to accept this deal.  And I realise and I understand that there are many other farmers out there that have to pay bills.  and they want to dispose of livestock.  and they're under pressure to dispose of livestock.  and what the policy of the meat factories been facilitated by Minister Crean and the government is to divide farmer against farmer, turn farmer against farmer.  Farmers must unite and unite against this deal and look for a realistic and a fair deal.  It's 19 years ago since the last beef blockade that I was involved in at the time when I was an IFA country chairman.  And again, once again, the same issue.  Price wasn't allowed to be discussed.  And it's because of these people in here, the European Union, that are interfering in the domestic affairs of this country, interfering in the crucial issue for Irish farmers, is the ability to negotiate a fair price.  to secure their livelihoods going forward.  Farmers at the moment are working for a loss and they're being subsidised for a loss and that's what the purpose of the Common Agricultural Poverty is.  The Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Cheap Food Policy is about subsidising farmers to work for a loss.  They give them, most farmers, three quarters of Irish farmers are in receipt of a basic payment of less than 10,000 euros per annum.  10,000 euros per annum.  And we have some, like Mr.  Goodman, who is in receipt of a basic payment of in excess of 413,000.  And we have on board BIA, on board BIA, which is a state agency, in receipt of a basic payment of 1.4 million.  That's how taxpayers' money is being abused.  And we're not getting value for money and farmers are not benefiting.  Farmers are again, as I repeat, being subsidised to work for a loss.  And they're being expected then to take the crumbs from the table and accept a derisory, worthless, raw deal that was negotiated last weekend.  that doesn't allow the crucial issue of base price, which is at the moment at 3.45 a kilo.  3.45 a kilo.  And just yesterday, not too far from here, Chagas, at their stand, they were saying that the base price that's needed to give a break-even situation for farmers, for livestock farmers, would be 4.17 a kilo.  4.17 a kilo and instead we're talking about 3.45 a kilo and we're talking about a 20 cents bonus on that for cattle under 30 months.  These people can run but they won't hide.  There will be a general election next year and Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il that's propping them up are going to take a drumming and it's up to you the people to not play tennis ball politics anymore.  Not think that you're punishing Fine Gael by voting Fianna F\u00e1il or vice versa.  to vote and vote for real change.","channel.id":"clxmi0oem02c5cdvifvlaufkb","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCxgY69mo_nUGuCDo1yPygng","channel.name":"The National Party \u2014 An P\u00e1irt\u00ed N\u00e1isi\u00fanta","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["PARTISAN_RIGHT","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"IE","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJU7ivwQD99tz4V9BIwbUF8E9SWhYm3UPSK5N4O2EA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The speaker is criticizing the Irish government's handling of the beef industry, specifically the recent deal that allows 99,000 tonnes of substandard South American beef into the country.

I'm VoxDay.  Today we're going to delve deeper into the socio-sexual hierarchy.  Last time we talked about alphas.  Now we're going to talk about the lower end of the hierarchy, specifically the rank known as the gamma.  Just a quick refresher, the socio-sexual hierarchy has five primary ranks.  Alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and omega.  The gamma is possibly the most interesting social sexual rank and behavioral pattern in the entire hierarchy.  This is because gammas are among the people with the most undeveloped potential in the social sexual hierarchy.  Let's talk about what the characteristics of a gamma are.  We know that they tend to be low status, but they're not complete social outcasts.  They tend to be unattractive to women.  They tend to be more intelligent than the norm.  They tend to be overweight.  They also tend to be subject matter experts.  If you think about the average individual who is overly obsessive with regards to a particular hobby, that is almost certainly going to be a gamma.  You may recall the movie from the 1980s called The Revenge of the Nerds.  That movie is a gamma wish fulfillment movie that describes what life looks like from the gamma perspective.  In fact, you see a lot of this in Hollywood, you see a lot of this in science fiction.  These are some of the best places to get a unrestrained glimpse into the gamma psychology because it's where people who are gammas are communicating their view of the world without trying to conceal it from you.  Because one of the biggest characteristics of the gamma and probably the most important one the most definitive one is their habitual dishonesty.  Gammas tend to be very very dishonest both with themselves and others.  Remember, this isn't primarily about rank.  This isn't primarily about status, even though that is what people tend to focus on.  What it's primarily about is the behavioral pattern, and there's no group that it is more important to be able to understand, identify, and anticipate than the gamma.  If you've ever been on a internet site where there are comments, whether it's YouTube, a blog, whatever, you can almost identify the gammas simply by the number of words they use in a post.  Because if you see a long post, you're going to see a lot of the very behavior that I'm describing.  You see the posturing.  You see the assumptions of superiority.  You will see the assumption of an ability to not only judge the other person, but even discern their motivations, and if necessary, read their minds.  And the one thing that you will always see is the need to declare victory no matter what happens.  It's very, very difficult and very painful, I think, for the gamma.  If I had one thing, just one thing that I could convince every gamma in the world, it's this.  You're not fooling anyone.  Even when you think you're fooling yourself, even when you are fooling yourself, you're not actually fooling us.  What I'm talking about here is the protective bubble of delusion that gammas erect over time around themselves to protect their feelings.  Because what you're dealing with here is people who have had to deal with a long and painful process of one rejection, after another, after another.  If there's one thing that summarizes the gamma attitude more than any other, it's that I could have been successful had I wanted to.  Because the gamma is always conflict avoidant and is also failure avoidant.  The problem, of course, is you cannot live and avoid failure.  Everybody fails sooner or later.  Most of us fail on a regular basis.  Doesn't matter whether it's an online argument or asking a girl out for a date or applying to a university, going to a job interview.  You can't live without doing those things.  But the pain of dealing with repeated failure is one reason why Gammas so often retreat to their delusion bubble where they can declare themselves victors all the time.  Gammas also tend to be highly, highly romantic.  They're really into the big gesture.  They're convinced that how much you like a woman matters with regards to whether she should be attracted to you or not.  And that's why you'll often hear Gammas talk about girls that they like who are interested in other guys as if the other guys are somehow ensorceling her.  They're somehow tricking her, misleading her, deceiving her.  And if only she knew how much he liked her.  then she'd be interested.  But it's not how a man treats a woman that determines how attractive he is to her.  And that's one thing that the gammas tend to struggle with tremendously.  Whenever you have very attractive woman who for no apparent reason and without any warning and without any indication of interest in the male protagonist inexplicably begins a sexual relationship with him which of course takes him completely by surprise and from that moment on the couple is Together forever.  That is the gamma ideal.  Because gammas are fundamentally passive.  They're passive-aggressive.  They're conflict-avoidant.  and they don't believe in pursuing women.  In fact, they have an almost complete lack of understanding of women, which is kind of surprising because a lot of their behavioral patterns and thought patterns tend to be somewhat feminine in nature.  In fact, there are some who actually describe the gamma as a female mind in a male body.  So it's a little bit strange that they seem to be so inept when it comes to understanding and anticipating women.  But women tend to be a vast mystery to the gamma.  They don't know how to behave around women, especially not women that they're attracted to.  And when they do finally summon up the courage to pursue them, they usually do so in such an over-the-top, inept way that it doesn't work very well.  I should probably mention that women have gamma radar like you would not believe.  If you're not sure about whether someone's a gamma or not, just ask a moderately attractive girl who knows them because women react negatively to gammas as if they're radioactive.  A number of women have told me that they actually feel the urge to physically punch gammas in the face, just instinctively.  So what are the practical aspects?  From a male point of view, the first thing that you need to understand about the gammas is that they are almost always disruptive to your organization.  And we have a lot of projects that we do, whether it's Vox Diversity stuff, whether it's Castalia House stuff, whether it's Archaven stuff.  We probably have 30 to 35 volunteers in various capacities with various responsibilities.  One thing that I had to learn to do is to stop accepting people who were volunteering to help.  And the reason was the more enthusiastic someone was about contacting me and wanting to help, I eventually discovered the more likely it was that they were a Gamma.  What would happen is that they would usually want more authority and responsibility than was at all reasonable for a volunteer.  They wanted to be able to tell other people what to do, even though there was no rational reason for it.  They would tell me what to do.  Now, why would you ever want to permit someone like that to get any foothold in your organization?  No matter what the organization is, they're going to disrupt it.  And if they're given a free hand, they're very likely going to destroy it.  Now the problem is, is that gammas are genuinely smarter than the norm.  They may not be quite as intelligent as they think they are, but they do tend to be smart and they do tend to be subject matter experts.  When you're looking for a subject matter expert and you find somebody who has the information you need, don't be shocked when it turns out that the individual is a gamma.  That's what they do.  And so that's why it's so important to understand these tendencies, because that way you're much less likely to give into the temptation to actually bring the person on the team.  You're usually going to be best able to operate with a gamma if they're in the position of like a contract employee or something.  And so that they're more likely to be comfortable with that.  Now, I understand that if you're somebody who feels that some of this applies to you, that you might be angry.  It might upset you to hear this, but I don't know what else to tell you.  This is true.  This is reality.  If you don't understand that this is why people don't like you, this is why people don't believe you, and that people really do see through your pretensions and your posturings, then you're just going to be stuck in that reality for the rest of your life.  Now, it doesn't have to be that way.  There was a guy who used to be a pretty strong gamma and he managed to work his way out of that and transform himself and become a legitimate bona fide delta.  He's much happier now.  And he's even written a four-part series on how to do it.  The key thing, the first advice he had for the gamma is stop lying.  Stop lying to yourself.  Stop lying to others.  Be brutally and relentlessly honest.  The gamma mentality is fundamentally based on deception and on delusion.  And so the more that you tell yourself the truth, The more that you force yourself to confront the truth and the more that you admit the truth to others, the easier it is going to be to pull yourself out of that armor of delusion that you've assembled around yourself.

Today, we're discussing the gamma rank, characterized by undeveloped potential, low status, and unattractiveness to women. Gammas tend to be intelligent, overweight, and subject matter experts, often displaying obsessive behavior. They're also known for their dishonesty, both with themselves and others, and have a tendency to retreat into a delusional bubble to avoid failure.\n\nGammas are often highly romantic, believing that how much they like a woman determines her attraction to them. They're passive-aggressive, conflict-avoidant, and lack understanding of women, which is ironic given their feminine thought patterns. Women, in turn, have a strong instinctual reaction to gammas, often feeling the urge to physically punch them.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, gammas can be disruptive to organizations, seeking authority and responsibility beyond their capabilities. While they may be subject matter experts, it's essential to understand their tendencies to avoid giving them a free hand. If you're a gamma, it's crucial to recognize your behavior and take steps to change. The first step is to stop lying to yourself and others, being brutally honest and confronting the truth.\n\nA former gamma has written a four-part series on how to transform yourself into a delta, emphasizing the importance of honesty and self-awareness.

The ship is currently impounded.  The captain, Carola Ricetta, faces serious criminal charges.  However, a left-wing activist Italian judge almost immediately released her from a type of house arrest.  Ricetta was illegally ferrying dozens of economic migrants from the coast of Libya to Europe.  All of the passengers were from East African nations and they most likely paid large sums of money to be smuggled into a war zone around Tripoli.  Rocchetta says she had no choice but to violently defy the Italian Coast Guard because the health of the migrants was deteriorating and many had become suicidal.  In fact, she claims the migrants had been held in a concentration camp in Libya and were already in poor health when she took custody of them.  In reality, the passengers had been evaluated multiple times by third parties, and any small children or allegedly sick people had already been removed from the ship.  It turns out we have extensive video filmed during the 17-day standoff.  One of the crew members of the Sea Watch 3 is a rapper and breakdancer who goes by the pseudonym Too Nasty.  Too Nasty uses the economic migrants as props for his rap videos.  Here he is bragging about being in the New York Times.  He says he is about to drop a new single featuring video from the standoff.  He already posted some rough video clips of the June standoff on his Instagram account.  Do these look like emaciated, suicidal war refugees?  It looks like a bunch of strong, healthy, well-fed athletes to me.  His own videos expose what a hoax the German-based NGO Sea-Watch really is.  Where are the starving children?  Where are all the women?  Why don't any of the Libyan war refugees look like Libyans?  As best as I can tell, too nasty is an American citizen named Chad.  Major German politicians are defending Sea Watch and endorsing the disproved narrative that war refugees are being rescued at sea.  At the same time, these politicians are hyping Russian collusion conspiracy theories against Salvini and his Italian Lego party.  Meanwhile, it has been revealed that two people from the German taxpayer-funded show Panorama were on board the Sea-Watch 3 during the standoff.  This is direct collusion between the German government and an NGO to commit international crimes and agitate against the Italian government.  Now, it even seems that German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has fully turned on Matteo Salvini.  He is demanding that Salvini reopen Italian ports to economic migrants.  In previous videos, I have said favorable things about Seehofer.  At one time, he was trying to rein in Merkel.  As recently as a few months ago, German left-wing think tanks were still calling him a right-wing extremist and claiming the entire Bavarian Christian Social Union was a borderline right-wing extremist party.  However, Seehofer seems to be getting worse and worse by the day.  The agitation against Italy is intense.  Even now, there are at least two ships circling Italian territorial waters trying to traffic more East Africans.  There is a ship owned by the German-based CI carrying economic migrants from Cameroon and Ivory Coast.  Another ship owned by the Spanish NGO Proactive Open Arms is also carrying an assortment of people of various African origin.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.

In today's video, I'd like to add my two cents to the mainstream media manufactured controversy surrounding Joker.  Now, unless you live under a rock, you probably won't have missed the absolute onslaught of hysterical articles in the wake of this film's release.  The mainstream media proclaimed that it was an incel film, a film for toxic white men and expressed fears of a mass shooting occurring at one of the film's screenings.  Over and over they repeated variations of this narrative until observers in general got the impression that it almost seemed like the mainstream media wanted a mass shooting to happen.  Then their warnings would be vindicated.  The, we told you so, all white men are evil.  floodgates would once again be opened.  As there have already been so many Joker film reviews, as well as tons of commentary surrounding the media hysteria, I don't intend to delve too much into these topics.  Instead, I'd like to focus on a very important question that's been utterly disregarded by the media, perhaps deliberately, or perhaps because they lack the compassion to even consider it.  Why is it that so many young men are finding the Joker film and the Joker character in general so relatable.  Is it because all men are evil and secretly want to commit mass shootings?  No, but this seems to be the narrative that the media wants you to believe.  While of course there are a few crazies, a few evil men out there who do relate to wanting to commit such heinous acts, the vast majority of men don't relate to the Joker's transformation into a killer, but rather to his hopelessness beforehand, to his depression and despair, to the lack of love and even basic compassion shown to him by others, to the cold reality of being cast out by society, and perhaps even to hiding one's suffering with humor and a smile.  I think it's quite interesting that the Joker is presented in the film as having a neurological condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh and that often when he's laughing, it appears as if he's in pain.  In some ways, I think this is reflective of many young men today.  It can be seen in their internet meme culture.  Men, some women, but mostly men by far, have taken to using the clown world meme as a way to express their disapproval and frustrations with society.  Honk honk they write as, day after day, accusatory stories flood their feeds, stories filled with unprovoked attacks on men, but particularly white men, that paint them as the cause of all the world's ills.  Obviously the phrase honk honk isn't the extent of their feelings, and there are much more complex reactions going on beneath the surface.  They're not truly finding humor in the current course that our society is taking, They're simply using humor as a means to cope.  If you Google the act of using humor to hide pain and depression, you'll find a whole host of very interesting results.  How men use humor to hide the relentless pain of sadness despair and mental illness, masking depression with humor.  There's pain and laughter.  Why the saddest people are often the funniest.  Comedy and depression, the hidden symptom.  Since the mainstream media is failing to ask the question why so many young men are relating to the Joker character, They're naturally also failing to ask the question how we as a society can help.  It's bad enough to ignore the struggles of men, but the mainstream media and most of the powerful institutions in general, big tech, Hollywood, the education system, and so on, have taken the buckling down.  to incessantly berating and poking them when many of them already feel demonized and isolated enough as it is.  I guess I missed the part where it became some sort of journalistic requirement to be a complete psychopath.  Perhaps these people are able to act this way due to the online disconnect and they're much more civil in real life but the way that they act online is reflective of an unbelievable heartlessness and cruelty.  At what point did our society decide to abandon even the most basic sense of compassion for our own, for our homeless, for our mentally ill, for our drug addicts, for our depressed and suicidal, for those suffering abandonment by one or even both of their parents, for those who feel judged and demonized for something inherent and completely outside their control, such as for being men.  I really think that C.S.  Lewis said it best when he stated, we make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise.  It's ironic to me how society today laments and criticizes the quote-unquote degradation of young men, while at the same time failing to take any sort of responsibility whatsoever for its role in their ever-increasing demise.  As I already stated previously, of course there are some evil men out there, but there are also some evil women.  Evilness is not some sort of inherent male quality.  Common decency in regards to men really shouldn't be too much of an ask.  But the mere fact that for many nowadays it is, should create far more concern in ourselves than any of the artificially contrived problems such as the Joker film having toxic fans that the mainstream media would have us believe deserves our undivided attention.

(10k Subs)","description":"Jesus Christ the famous person in history. What did he really and truly look like? We examine all the evidence to give a likely answer.\n\nSubcribe: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2I8q3Uh\n\n- The letter from Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Caesar\n\nA young man appeared in Galilee preaching with humble unction, a new law in the Name of the God that had sent Him. At first I was apprehensive that His design was to stir up the people against the Romans, but my fears were soon dispelled. Jesus of Nazareth spoke rather as a friend of the Romans than of the Jews. One day I observed in the midst of a group of people a young man who was leaning against a tree, calmly addressing the multitude. I was told it was Jesus. This I could easily have suspected so great was the difference between Him and those who were listening to Him. His golden colored hair and beard gave to his appearance a celestial aspect. He appeared to be about 30 years of age. Never have I seen a sweeter or more serene countenance. What a contrast between Him and His bearers with their black beards and tawny complexions! Unwilling to interrupt Him by my presence, I continued my walk but signified to my secretary to join the group and listen. Later, my secretary reported that never had he seen in the works of all the philosophers anything that compared to the teachings of Jesus. He told me that Jesus was neither seditious nor rebellious, so we extended to Him our protection. He was at liberty to act, to speak, to assemble and to address the people. This unlimited freedom provoked the Jews -- not the poor but the rich and powerful.\n\n- The Archko Volume\n\n\"I asked him to describe this person to me, so that I might know him if I should meet him. He said: 'If you ever meet him [Yahshua] you will know him. While he is nothing but a man, there is something about him that distinguishes him from every other man. He is the picture of his mother, only he has not her smooth, round face. His hair is a little more golden than hers, though it is as much from sunburn as anything else. He is tall, and his shoulders are a little drooped; his visage is thin and of a swarthy complexion, though this is from exposure. His eyes are large and a soft blue, and rather dull and heavy....' This Judean [Nazarite] is convinced that he is the Messiah of the world. ...this was the same person that was born of the virgin in Bethlehem some twenty-six years before...\"\n\n- The Description of Publius Lentullus\n\nThere appeared in these our days a man, of the Judean Nation, of great virtue, named Yahshua [Jesus], who is yet living among us, and of the Gentiles is accepted for a Prophet of truth, but His own disciples call Him the Son of God- He raiseth the dead and cureth all manner of diseases. A man of stature somewhat tall, and comely, with very reverent countenance, such as the beholders may both love and fear, his hair of (the colour of) the chestnut, full ripe, plain to His ears, whence downwards it is more orient and curling and wavering about His shoulders. In the midst of His head is a seam or partition in His hair, after the manner of the Nazarenes. His forehead plain and very delicate; His face without spot or wrinkle, beautified with a lovely red; His nose and mouth so formed as nothing can be reprehended; His beard thickish, in colour like His hair, not very long, but forked; His look innocent and mature; His eyes grey, clear, and quick- In reproving hypocrisy He is terrible; in admonishing, courteous and fair spoken; pleasant in conversation, mixed with gravity. It cannot be remembered that any have seen Him Laugh, but many have seen Him Weep. In proportion of body, most excellent; His hands and arms delicate to behold. In speaking, very temperate, modest, and wise. A man, for His singular beauty, surpassing the children of men.\n\n#JesusChrist #Jesus #Bible","publish_date":"2019-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","keywords":["Bible","Jesus Christ","Yahweh","Yahshua","YHWH","New Testament","Old Testament","Gospel","Israel","Judah","God","Bible Secrets","Bible Stories","Bible Study","Bible Project","Black Hebrews","Covenant People","Identity","Adam","Blush","Blood in the Face","Rosy Cheeks","Fair","light","blonde","brunette","redhead","Pontius Pilate","Publius Lentullus","Archko Volume","evidence","catacombs","icons","statues","art","paintings","appearance","physical","apostles","david","solomon","Nazirite","laban","snow","milk","judea","gallilee","gauls","ruddy","artwork"],"length":428,"views":47342,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/y8xmiCF4uuE\/sddefault.jpg","yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","transcripts":"Jesus Christ, God incarnate, the most famous person throughout our modern history.  For nearly 2,000 years, he has always been depicted as white.  However, recently, over the past few decades, this assertion has began to be challenged.  And there is an ongoing debate, if you will, over what he really and truly looked like.  Well, is there any evidence, any historical proof, any clues throughout scripture?  Let's go through it all one by one.  thanks everyone for 10,000 subscribers.  please do subscribe for future videos.  when it comes to the appearance of Christ who would be a better impartial witness than the man who personally met him and sentenced him to death?  Pontius Pilate was a Roman pagan who saw Christ up close and personal.  Valius Peioculus, a Roman historian, met and interviewed Jesus, who reported it to Pilate, who in turn wrote a letter to the Roman Emperor, which at the time was Tiberius Caesar.  Amongst many things he gave a description of Christ's appearance.  In it he describes him as follows.  His golden colored hair and beard gave to his appearance a celestial aspect.  he appeared to be about thirty years of age.  never have i seen a sweeter or more serene countenance.  what a contrast between him and his bearers with their black beards and tawny complexions.  so just by that account he would sound like many modern europeans but let's examine all the other evidence.  Are there any other depictions of Christ?  We have another one from the Arco volume.  In it we can read where Gamaliel was sent by the Sanhedrin to interrogate Joseph and Mary in regards to their child Jesus.  It describes Christ as a picture of his mother, only he has not a smooth, round face.  His hair is a little more golden than hers, though it is much from sunburn as anything else.  who has golden hair and burns in the sun?  his eyes are large and a soft blue and rather dull and heavy.  this is all sounding very similar to Pilate's letter.  finally we have another letter which is by Publius Lentulus which could be translated as a dullard public official so a Roman official who visited Judea at the time of Christ and this letter was addressed to the Senate.  in it Christ's hair is described as the color of chestnut full ripe down to the ears.  so again that would be a blondish color.  furthermore he says his face without spot or wrinkle beautiful with a lovely red.  so red cheeks who do you see?  red cheeks on his eyes gray clear and quick in reproving hypocrisy.  so that's three different accounts all given a very similar depiction of Christ.  however let's see what the Bible actually says.  When God created Adam, the first man, he created him in the image of himself, in the image of God.  Since Christ is God, it would only make sense that whatever Adam looked like would give us an idea to Christ's appearance.  Furthermore, why did God specifically name the first man Adam?  The name Adam is derived from Strong's H119, Adam.  meaning to show blood in the face i.e.  to flush or turn rosy.  Blushing is a hot red flushing of the cheeks unique to white people when they feel humility, shame or embarrassment and is often associated with the inability to hold the head up and bear another's gaze.  Even Darwin described blushing as the most peculiar and most human of all expressions.  so what is god telling us here?  that adam could show blood in the face could blush had rosy cheeks?  in that case what would eve look like?  who was from adam and what would all their descendants look like?  is it not obvious to what christ would look like?  Throughout the Bible we see the Israelites commonly described as being ruddy in their appearance.  The word ruddy, similar to Adam, means when a white person has a red color, suggesting good health, a rosy complexion and is associated with blushing or showing blood in the face.  In the book of Samuel we read that when Samuel discovered a young David, he was described as ruddy, with a beautiful countenance and goodly to look at.  In other words, he was healthy looking with bright red rosy cheeks.  David is again described this way in his duel with Goliath, ruddy with a fair countenance, so that's twice.  David's son Solomon in the Songs of Solomon is also described as white and ruddy.  It does not get more clearer than that.  Since Christ descended from both David and Solomon, would he not resemble them?  Would he not also be white and ruddy?  Another word often used is fair which is an old English adjective meaning to have pale skin or pale yellow golden hair.  So fair means light such as a light white skin complexion, white to rosy red skin, beautiful and pleasing to the eye.  in genesis we read that the sons of god the angels saw the daughters of men adamites that they were fair and they took them wives all of which they chose.  in the book of job we read and in all the land there were no women found so fair as the daughters of job.  and in daniel we read that daniel and his friends At the end of ten days their countenance appeared fairer and fairer in flesh.  In Acts we read, In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair.  And back to Songs of Solomon, Thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot in thee.  Is it not obvious, if all these Israelites were fair, then so was Christ, he must have been white with fair skin.  So what was the earliest artwork of Christ and the apostles like?  How were they depicted?  Looking at the early pictures from churches, monasteries, caves and catacombs, it's clear that Christ was always known to be white.  The earliest known images are around the 3rd and 4th century.  Initially he had no beard with short hair, but later on the images began to add a thick beard and longer hair.  Modern images often tend to follow this today.  Early predictions you can also clearly see the apostles were white, just like Christ.  There are numerous pictures of Paul and John, as well as Peter and his brother Andrew.  There have been attempts to deliberately Photoshop or alter pictures to show a different narrative.  So what did Christ look like?  Is it not pretty clear from all the evidence?  We must remember the apostles traveled to Europe exclusively, and there was never any doubt that they were white.  The land around Judea and northern Africa was a white civilization.  Only after the Arab conquest 700 years later did that permanently change forever.  And this is how Christ and the apostles were white.  But the people now living in those lands 2000 years later are not.  Thanks for watching everyone.  Praise Yahweh and hail Yahshua Christ.","channel.id":"clxmi0mkw0121cdviprmvy4pp","channel.yt_channel_id":"UCIt4m30BuEpDowcM8aGSDpQ","channel.name":"TruthVids","channel.lr":"RIGHT","channel.tags":["CONSPIRACY","RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVE","WHITE_IDENTITARIAN"],"channel.ideology":"WHITE_IDENTITARIAN","channel.relevance":1.0,"channel.country":"GB","channel.logo_url":"https:\/\/yt3.ggpht.com\/ytc\/AL5GRJVAyptfys-UmOQ2qarn1fQod4Buiqcki0hctHTY=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","channel.from_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","summary":"The appearance of Jesus Christ has been debated for centuries, with many assuming he was white based on modern depictions.

So thank you guys for listening and enjoy the video for today.  hi guys welcome back to my channel so I wanted to make a little I guess rambling stream of consciousness video kind of some more similar to my older videos today.  there's been a lot on my mind I guess as the year is coming to an end and I feel very reflective.  I feel very sort of in my own mind, just thinking about how far I've come over the past three years and how big of a role YouTube has played in this transformation that I've experienced.  And I guess, I mean, I really just want to start off by saying thank you.  Thank you to the people, first of all, who've been with me here on this journey with me for this long.  You know, from the beginning, some of you will remember my original videos, the ones which have been since removed from my channel before I came back.  For those of you who do remember those original videos, you know that I was not in a good place, really, when I started my YouTube channel.  I was lost.  I was confused.  I was unhappy.  I was desperately searching for order in my life.  And not just order, but the thing which happens inside of us that compels us to create order, you know, because there is something that was turned on inside of me, inside my heart and inside my soul, which propelled me forward in a really productive way.  that, I mean, I just, before I started going down the red pill path, whatever you want to call it, Opening my mind up to new ideas and to new sort of people and their ideas.  It wasn't a superficial change where I had to kind of say to myself, okay, you have to do this because it's good for you.  Or this is what's best for you, so you just need to slug through it.  It wasn't like that.  There was an effortlessness to... my transformation, um, from darkness to light.  That's really how it, how it feels.  I feel like I was living my life in darkness and even just being shown the light in other people who had already found it.  Um, it lit a fire inside me and it it's yielded a life that I didn't know that I was capable of achieving.  in a really big way.  And so for people who are watching this right now who think, you know, I'm not where I want to be in my life.  How do I build a life that I can be happy with or I can be proud of too?  For me, it was like, it was a bumpy road.  There were some very scary periods and phases of this transformation because I had to let the life that I was living and the identity that I had die and crumble.  before I could start building again.  And that was the hardest part for me, you know, like being red pilled or being brought back to Christ or rediscovering how to be honest with myself, like brutally honest with myself and honest with other people about what I believe, even if I'm wrong.  And I've been wrong many times throughout this process.  But like the devotion to honesty and to finding what's divine about that, It exposed the lie that I was living.  It exposed how fake I was, how I had been lying to myself for years, years and years and years about what I wanted, about my own happiness, about being satisfied with the situation that I was in.  Just kind of pure apathy.  When I started to be honest with myself again, it was like my heart opened up and I felt excited about things for the first time in forever.  I found parts of myself that I thought I had lost, you know.  Um, a kind of enthusiasm for life that I felt at the time.  Maybe I didn't feel it anymore because I was getting older and that enthusiasm for life, that sort of motivation to go get what I wanted was just a part of my youth.  And now that I was older, I had lost it and I couldn't get it anymore.  That wasn't true.  But I quickly realized that if I really wanted to build something I had to start over from scratch.  And that meant moving to a new country.  It meant moving back in with my parents for a short amount of time.  It meant ending a six year long relationship.  It meant quitting jobs that I had been doing for three years.  I literally had to go back to square one.  And that's why I got off the internet during that time because it was very traumatic.  It was very scary and very painful.  know and i didn't i didn't want to be online in that state.  i think that's somewhat understandable.  but um i had to hand it over to god.  i had to hand it over to our lord um and by it i mean my life.  i had to hand over my life to him.  i had to surrender that.  i had been believing false things i had been telling myself lies and I had turned away from Christ.  I had turned away from God and the truth.  I no longer was living a life of any respectability.  And it was then that, it was really then that I was able to rebuild after I admitted that and after I had brought myself back down to square one.  And then, you know, I met my husband and I guess the rest is kind of history, a little bit.  There are things I wish that I could share with you guys, but for my own privacy and the privacy of the people in my life that I love, I feel hesitant to talk in detail about.  But maybe in the future when things are a little bit, my current situation is a little bit different, these are things that I can share with you.  But, you know, within three years I went from being very unhappy pretty much every dimension of my life to now being where I want to be in the world doing what I want to do in love married and pregnant which you can see my bump right here.  it's getting bigger by the day.  I feel very blessed and I don't think that I would have achieved these things had I not Allowed things to fall apart, you know, things that I had been holding together for way too long.  Things that I had to lie to myself about in order to live with.  And so this journey online of being vulnerable and talking about the things that are important to me and sharing all of this with you from exposing sort of the political lies of our time to pushing back against the cultural degeneration that we see all around us to rediscovering femininity and pushing back against the oppressive nature of feminism in pursuit of finding true womanhood, which I feel like now I have much better grasp on than I ever did in a feminist critical theory course at university.  And now walking down this new path as a new wife and a soon to be mom.  It is not, like this path now is not without its struggle.  I've only been married for like six or seven months and like marriage is hard.  It's not easy.  There are times when I feel like I'm really not living up to what my husband deserves.  And it's something, you know, our relationship as a married couple who are soon going to be parents is something that we're working on all the time.  It's not easy.  And I think as a modern woman, who is influenced by modernity and who has been influenced by feminism, learning to be submissive, learning to respect my husband's authority, learning how to take on my role as a housemaker and a supportive role in my husband's life.  It's been a challenge, but it's something that I think I'm getting better at every day, and I hope I continue to get better at it.  So yeah, I guess in conclusion here, I just want to say thank you to everyone who has been along this journey with me and has supported me and been kind and offered words of wisdom.  The first step is admitting to yourself that you've probably failed in some area.  If you find yourself in a situation or circumstance that you're not happy with, you have to take responsibility for what you have done to land yourself there.  If you can't take the responsibility for yourself as to why you're unhappy is why you're living a life that isn't what you want, then you're never gonna be able to take the first step to dismantling that life that you're not happy living and laying the foundation for something that you can build that is worth fighting for and that makes you happy.  So I think this is within everyone's grasp.  You know, you just have to be patient.  You have to be honest with yourself.  And I think you really have to learn how to surrender a little bit.  You know, we live in a world where boomerism has really pushed us to believe that we need security in all of these areas.  We need, you know, we can't send our family until we have money.  We can't, you know, we can't do this thing.  that's a risk because there's uncertainty involved, right?  It's safer to stay in the life that I don't like than it would be to take a risk on the uncertainty of building a new life.  have to learn how to surrender.  you have to learn how to hand it over to god and trust that he will provide for you.  if you are willing to do the work of being honest with yourself and those around you in in your life and i think being honest is just it's one of the easiest things that you can do.  you can catch yourself um all the time you know having to ask yourself is this really true?  am i being honest with myself?  am i lying right now?  um And every time you catch yourself and you course correct, I think you get more along the path to finding not just truth and God in your life, but actual fulfillment.  You know, an actual sense of pride and respect for yourself and for the life that you might be living.  So thank you for listening to this little ramble.

Today I want to do just a little chatty sort of video with you catching up about what's going on in my life, my second trimester.  And I would really like to share some resources with you that I've been using to help prepare me for birth and like mentally and sort of physically, as well as just to share with you some of the things that I've been thinking about.  as this pregnancy progresses.  so all of the things that I share with you that are resources for moms out there that may be watching or maybe that you would like to send to a woman who is in your life that's important to you who could use these these things.  there will be links in the description so that you can you can find them easily.  so my second trimester is going really well.  I'm really happy a lot of the time, but there are sort of accent marks here and there of having little sort of emotional spirals, basically.  And I think that that's just normal, you know, I'm really sensitive and just a part of being pregnant that you're emotional a lot.  so i mean it's nothing serious.  but for the most part i'm really happy i'm really excited i'm not nervous about the birth which i'm kind of i'm almost a little bit concerned about because i feel like maybe i should be more nervous or my my midwife says that that's.  that's how you should feel you should.  you shouldn't feel nervous you should feel you know excited and That's a good thing that I feel this way, but I'm kind of, I guess the neurotic side of me thinks maybe I should be more worried about what the labor is going to be like.  But I just, the thing is I don't know what labor is going to be like.  All I can do is expose myself to as many birth stories as possible so that I can wrap my head around all of the potentialities that I could experience in birthing my son.  So that kind of leads me to my first resource that I would really like to share with you guys.  I have become obsessed with reading and listening to birth stories.  Even though I want a home birth, and that's what I'm striving for, I have a plan B, I live close to a hospital, My plan B is very detailed as detailed as my plan a is.  I have.  I'm working with a OB as well as a midwife so I'm kind of doing things in tandem because like I said This is all new territory for me And I just want I know that birth is unpredictable and I know that even though I want this home birth I might end up in the hospital and I don't want to potentially end up in the hospital and for that to be something which I affects my stamina or affects my mental ability to focus on having a natural birth whether that's at home or in the hospital.  I also really think it's important to expose myself to a lot of different birth stories because every birth story is so different.  it's amazing like that's.  one of the things that I love about listening to birth stories is that no birth story is the same.  and You know, there are women out there who they plan to have the epidural, they plan to do pain management and because of the way that their birth progresses, like maybe sometimes it'll progress really fast and they don't have a chance to get those painkillers and stuff, they end up having a natural birth.  Um, and then the reverse is sometimes true that these women who are, you know, they're really into their natural, holistic hands-off approach.  They're really, really hoping that they can achieve a natural birth.  They don't even want to think about having interventions, uh, or ending up in the hospital.  And as a result of however, their labor, their labor progresses or complications that may arrive at the last minute, they end up with epidurals and sometimes with forcep births and you know, worst case scenarios sometimes with C-sections.  So we can all have our best case scenario, but I think it's important that I educate myself about as many different, um, things that could develop in birth so that, yeah, I can have my plan A, I can have my plan B, but I'm not under any illusions that my birth is going to, the birthing of my son is going to end up exactly like either of those plans.  The one thing that is consistent among all birth stories is that it's never how women think it's going to be.  So with that being said, I would just like to share with you two books.  The one that I'm currently reading right now is called In the Spirit of Homebirth.  It's a book, it's a collection of stories of birth, home birth specifically, that are from women who live in British Columbia.  So all of these women are Canadian.  And the thing about this book is that it is a little bit kind of, like it's influenced by feminism in a way, you know?  So there's like a great attention to being inclusive and showing a diversity of, Types of women and their experiences.  and now I know you know, maybe you think you know Why.  why is this woman who is like kind of right-wing or whatever?  Why is she reading this liberal home birth book?  the thing is like I think an experience like birth.  it's it's it's like the ground of femininity in my opinion.  And the personality, the identity, the ideologies that we subscribe to, our sexualities, like these things are kind of stripped away in the process of birth.  And there have been stories that I have read in this book by women who, if I met them on the street, I would have nothing in common with them.  I would have no point of reference for how to be their friend or, you know, to engage with the things that they find interesting.  But that doesn't mean that I still haven't gained something valuable from hearing their personal experience of birth.  And I think that that's just something that's really cool that I've realized as a result of reading this book.  And there is also like an emphasis on featuring First Nations women, because I mean, it's Canada, so it's important, especially among liberal circles to, put First Nations stories and their experiences at the forefront, for better or for worse.  It's something that is just a part of living in Canada.  while again i am very different from a first nation first nations woman um there are things that they are more in touch with with regard to um like the community side of birth.  um you know midwifery is something that's still kind of more intact i think in some first nation communities.  they have a lot more traditional aspects to birth which I think a lot of Western women have lost touch with.  And so there are things that I've learned from listening to these stories too.  And I've really enjoyed it.  So, you know, if you can get past these things, and kind of keep an open mind, I think this book would be really interesting for any woman out there who's looking for specifically home birth stories.  I've been really enjoying it.  And then I also have this other book, which is called Natural Birth Stories.  So this book is like there are home births in like stories of home birth in this book but it's it also includes natural births that take place in the hospital which i think is important.  it's important to consider that as an option because if the safety of my baby um requires that i give birth in a hospital then that's what i'm gonna do.  so i want to have as much information about how women have advocated for themselves against theoretically pushy hospital staff that want to do interventions, that want to sort of induce them, that want to do these sorts of things that maybe they aren't on board with, that want to cut the cord as soon as the baby comes out.  All of these things, I want to be exposed to those stories too because I might end up there.  This book also focuses on postpartum, Postpartum recovery as well, which I find really useful.  So it's just this book and I think this book is actually.  I Think these stories are from there.  It's not just Canadian women.  It's American women as well.  So yeah, if you're interested, these are two books that I'm working my way through and I'm really enjoying.  If you're also if you're kind of the person you're not really into stories like reading.  there are two podcasts that I will link below and kind of in the same theme as the two books.  Um, one is called the happy home birth podcast, which is specifically home birth stories.  Um, many of them are very positive and uplifting and empowering to listen to.  Um, it's a Christian lady who runs the podcast and a lot of the women who are featured at telling their birth stories are also Christians.  So I think it's a good resource.  Um, it's great to just sort of turn on and listen to while you're cooking or doing housework or whatever, you know, exercising, whatever it is that you're doing.  the other podcast is called the birth hour which will be linked below and this one is more.  this one's been it's been running for longer.  there's like 300 podcasts to to choose from.  um in terms of like what you want to listen to there are stories from every type of woman and sometimes there are traumatic birth stories.  sometimes there are like you know moms of five or moms of three who are telling you about the variation and the differences in their in their birth stories and I think that the birth hour is possibly a better resource just because it's more real and raw whereas the happy home birth is kind of like.  If you're someone who's anxious and afraid but you also still wanna do this and you're looking for positive, uplifting birth stories, this one could be good for you because it shows you that it's possible and that lots of women achieve natural birth at home.  So those are the birth story things and I think that that's been huge for me lately because Yeah, like I'm preparing my body for birth.  I'm eating well.  I'm going to the gym now regularly with my husband.  I'm doing the like spinning babies moves.  I'm seeing a pelvic floor physiotherapist.  So I'm doing sort of like pelvic floor exercises and all that's well and good.  But for me, getting my head around birth and focusing a lot on the mental aspect of birth has been really important to me lately.  And I think it's something that a lot of women often forget.  And yeah, I just think that exposing yourself to birth stories is a great resource for mentally getting yourself ready for birth.  So the next thing that I would like to share with you is a website that I found as a result of listening to one of the podcasts on the Happy Home Birth podcast.  And that is a website which is called sisterbirth.com.  And so sisterbirth.com is kind of like if you're a woman who doesn't have access to a doula, you can't afford a doula service or maybe you can't afford a midwife.  Or it's not accessible to you or maybe you don't have a lot of family or you don't have a lot of emotional support for your pregnancy.  basically what sister birth is is it's like online course.  I think it costs about $300 American.  so it's I mean like comparatively to other prenatal services it's not that much.  but I mean that's how it's all subjective.  you know whether or not something's really affordable to you but it's worth checking out the website because they have a lot of free resources too which are accessible to everyone.  Um, one of these resources is, um, this, uh, sort of printout that I, that I got.  It's called, um, seven mistakes mamas make when planning a natural birth.  And so there's, there's, there, there are the things, and then there's, you know, reading material for you to engage with.  Um, some of the mistakes are, They don't get clear on their why, like why they're doing it, meaning that when you're in the intense part of labor and it feels like you're being brought to your mental and physical limit, you need to know why you're putting yourself through this, otherwise you're just going to crack and you're gonna say, no, give me the epidural.  So having your why really sort of detailed and fleshed out is important.  They don't plan past the birth, for example.  They see birth only as a physical event.  not a mental or spiritual event.  They try to tame what is ultimately wild.  So really great handout.  They also have mental birth prep checklist in this printout, and this is totally free.  You can just print this off on their website.  The link will be down below if you wanna check that out.  There's also things like these worksheets for planning your postpartum experience.  I don't know if you can see this.  I'll just do this so you can get a little screen grab, but there'll be a link below.  basically wife are resting a little checklist things to do while you're kind of bedridden for a few weeks.  you know a little little space to say.  you know what?  what are my freezer meals gonna be like?  how am I gonna do food prep?  you know do I have a lactation consultant?  do I have a postpartum doula or midwife or nurse that can provide support?  all of these things Which, yeah, I think that's really handy.  For a person, maybe for some women this isn't useful, but for someone like me who likes to plan, I like to be prepared, I'm like low-key control freak.  I'm as calm and as centered as a control freak can possibly be.  That's my personality.  And I find these worksheets so handy.  And then the last printout that I have here is called The Five Aspects to the Best Nesting.  So for example, make a list of practical projects around the house and start checking them off.  Do a quick survey of your relationships and identify the ones that need some tending.  Feel your feelings and dump them out.  The pick yourself back up.  Walk it out with God.  These worksheets and this sister birth website is also run by a Christian lady, which I love.  She really focuses on the fact that birth isn't just physical.  It isn't just mental.  It is a spiritual event as well.  And birth is something that can bring you closer to God.  It's something that will bring you closer to God, I think.  I think a lot of women, even atheist women, experience birth as a very powerful and magical and mystical experience that it's hard to put into words based on what I've heard other women say.  And so I really like that these resources, this online one specifically and the podcast, Happy home birth.  There is a special focus on Christianity and a woman's faith, which I think that, you know, in the 11th hour when, you know, you've been laboring for ages and you're kind of in labor land, as they say, having a strong connection to God can be really helpful.  I hope that these resources will be of use to you.  I hope that all of you mamas out there who are pregnant and watching are having a great pregnancy so far.  For all of the women out there who are trying to conceive, I wish you the best of luck and many blessings for healthy little miracle babies.  If you would like to support my channel, there will be links in the description as well as links to the resources.  that I've mentioned.  So thank you so much for listening, guys.  Have a great day.

So in my last video I gave an overview of the two main archetypes of traditional womanhood, and in today's video we'll explore the two main archetypes for men.  First it's necessary to consider the difference between men and women.  I stated in my last video that women work towards heroism by serving someone outside herself, traditionally either her husband or her son.  Some modern women may find this idea offensive because we're so conditioned to believe that our highest purpose in life is to serve ourselves.  I explained in my last video why that belief of self-service is ultimately harmful to women, and it's also harmful to men, but not in the same way.  There may be a tendency to assume that because woman serves the other, it must be the opposite for man, and his role is therefore to serve himself.  What else would he serve if not another?  But it's true that men don't aim to serve an other, but neither do they act in service to themselves, or neither should they act in service to themselves, I should say.  Traditional man, absolute man, serves an ideal, a principle.  And in serving these principles, he comes to embody them and can thus provide a life-affirming vision for a woman to serve in him.  If his essence or vision is insufficient, then his woman will find the service of him to be unsatisfying.  However, if the principle he represents is embodied in a vital way, this will act as a grounding and magnetic force for her.  This is even more apparent when compared to modern man who so lacks visionary gravitas that those few who still represent this idea in an integral way as a result have near infinite attraction to women.  When the true king appears, all are compelled to serve him.  The two types of heroism for a man that Julius Aebolus speaks about are the archetypes of the warrior and the ascetic.  Both the warrior and the ascetic are different paths of serving an ideal.  The ascetic is the path of contemplation.  He is the thinker, the visionary, the guru, the philosopher, even the artist.  Traditionally, the ascetic would renounce the world or part of the world in some way in pursuit of living for philosophy or expression of earthly perfection of the mind and soul.  The warrior on the other hand is the path of action.  He takes the idea and manifests it in the world.  We might traditionally think of the warrior as someone brutal who gets his way through force, but the warrior can have many expressions.  You could, for example, fight on the battlefield of ideas rather than as a physical warrior in the military.  Basically anything that involves the path of action to manifest an idea in the world.  All of the greatest figures in history are an expression of a warrior or an ascetic.  Unfortunately, the warrior caste was almost completely destroyed in Europe by the European Civil War of 1914-1945, and the ascetic caste was severely depleted, initially due to the poor decision of the Catholic Church not to allow priests to marry and have families, and finally when the job was finished by the Communists, whose first task in any country they took over was to wipe out the intelligentsia.  Many of the modern intellectuals who would have previously belonged to the ascetic caste have been subverted and used to hasten our dispossession.  If you look at the attacks on manhood, it's always a two-pronged attack on these two archetypes of traditional masculinity.  It's always either the warrior or the ascetic being attacked.  No one attacks the merchant or laborer castes.  Now, the warrior and the ascetic are interdependent on each other because neither of them alone can achieve the manifestation of the idea in the world.  The warrior lives out the idea, but the ascetic creates it.  One cannot enact a vision that hasn't been created, and there's little purpose in creating a vision that cannot be enacted and defended.  So for this reason, modern men should aim to cultivate elements of both archetypes within themselves so that they're able to adopt or create a vision and be the agent of its realization in their own personal lives.  In other words, the role that society used to fulfill in providing a compass and direction through culture is now placed upon the individual man.  And although you may personally feel more drawn to one than the other, often the nature of the times will call upon a man to choose a path that he's not naturally inclined towards, and so the man must rise to the challenge.  However, as much as it's impossible for us to rediscover the principles of modern science in one lifetime, so too is it highly unlikely that an individual will overcome the natural state of ignorance that comes with being young and lacking experience to arrive at a clear understanding of our own nature and our place in the greater scheme of things.  For this reason, it's said that we stand on the shoulders of giants that have come before us who have left us with archetypal illustrations of innate nature so we can navigate the forces within us and integrate them into a state of being.  The man who has the idea can't do anything with it, unless he can get men of action around him to adopt the idea and incorporate it into their ethos.  The warrior without an idea to follow is only a mercenary, a hired gun.  A good example of a blend between the two archetypes is the samurai warrior, who is equally skilled in both contemplation and action.  He has learned to control his mind and his body in equal measure.  This concept of self-mastery is integral to both archetypes and is really at the core of this concept of traditional masculinity.  Whether you master your mind or your body or both, the same virtues of self-discipline, responsibility, commitment to the ideal, and steady, unwavering effort are required.  Sometimes you need to embark upon a path sufficiently to see whether or not it's your best way.  The reason this is essential on man's path is that in order to serve an idea rather than yourself, you need to master yourself to the point that you can to some extent overcome the desire of your ego that you should serve it.  Ego desires are always at the center of someone acting in service to themselves.  So this is important for both men and women who want to escape the clutches of modernity.  Self-mastery allows you to see the difference between serving your ego and serving a higher principle.  And when you've attained a high level of self-mastery, it's much harder to lie to yourself, to convince yourself that the subtle ways in which you act in service to your own ego is really some higher principle.  Many people fool themselves into thinking that they're acting with the right motivations because they haven't achieved the level of self-mastery to properly reflect on their own motives, which requires a patient analysis of the subconscious.  It's not something we readily develop in order to see the role that their own egos are playing in dictating their agenda.  So why is all this relevant or important today?  Even though, like modern women, most modern men are so far fallen away from the archetype of absolute man to the point that it's almost impossible to see it manifested in them, even in a small way, the male nature is still solar.  This means it's distinguished by being the source of one's own light.  And men are still naturally attached to the realm of ideas.  And this is where they draw their inspiration and purpose from fundamentally.  This is why men are so much more susceptible to nihilism because when they don't have a higher principle to believe in, they feel lost.  Women are less susceptible to it, at least on the surface, because women without men to serve whom body principles for them and being of the earth and therefore bound to materiality and regeneration have the backup plan of creating a narcissistic cult around themselves in which they worship their own physical bodies and seek out broken men as devotees to their cult of conceit.  Men don't naturally have a similar fallback, although it can lead to increasing homosexuality and transsexuality as men subconsciously seek to avoid facing their nihilism by using the same tactics as a woman, as on some level they perceive the power of the awakened divine feminine unrestrained by the male principle.  This is explained in Hinduism by the interplay of Shiva and Shakti, but I won't go into detail about that here.  Suffice it to say that Shakti, the divine feminine, is pure, unrestrained power possessing volatile energy but without any direction.  Shiva, the divine male principle, provides the intellectual grounding, the visionary guidance and action in the world.  He's like a lightning rod for the power of Shakti.  Other men simply end up staring into the abyss and it leads them to hedonism and escapism.  So video games, porn, drugs, etc.  This is why some people so strongly demand that their culture provide them with guidance because without the cultural signals and shared ethos, many people feel lost and that even when they are virtuous, they feel their virtue is not recognized or valued by their community.  In some cases, they're even scorned.  This naturally produces nihilism in many who have failed to find for themselves their own guiding light.  And you can see my series on nationalism and nihilism for a further discussion about that.  Another thing modern men do when they have failed to cultivate their own virtue and embody their principles is they look to others to do it for them.  They look for a king, a prophet, a messiah of some kind.  These men become followers of whoever it is they can look up to and they often hold their leader to impossible standards.  They can easily become demoralized and disillusioned when their chosen leader falters.  For many men, this could be an athlete, a rock star, a politician, really any authority that they look up to.  A good example of this is how upset people became when Trump didn't turn out to live up to his God Emperor status that the meme lords conferred on to him.  This is also a feminine lunar way of seeking principles because they're looking for it in an other, in something external.  and they will try to tear apart anyone who dares to put on the crown of the king because they have invested too much in this other person to orient them in life.  Even for the leader, it's often part of the same pathology of adopting feminine traits, as they may seek the ring of power in order to build up a cult of personality for others to worship at, rather than genuinely leading for the good of their people.  And the reason that this is still feminine is because instead of the pure motivation of wanting to serve an ideal as the true leader is often humble and reluctant in his role, but knows that the idea calls him to its service, they instead have a focus on personal aggrandizement rather than trying to fully embody a principle for the sake of the principle itself.  Holding power always corrupts the person who is holding it, and the more powerful the man already is, the more holding a powerful position is likely to corrupt him.  The temptation of the ego to seize upon circumstances for its own personal desires is very strong.  So to take the analogy of the Ring of Power back to its source, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we have Aragorn the warrior and Gandalf the ascetic.  Both men were humble enough to know that the ring would wield too much power through them and they both refused to touch it.  They had the wisdom and the humility to respect the corrupting influence of power and knew to stay away from it.  But look instead to their less developed counterparts, Boromir and Saruman.  Both believed themselves to be strong enough to withstand the influence of the ring and believed they could harness it for good, but it ultimately corrupted them both.  In the backstory to Boromir, a warrior, we learn that his tenuous relationship with the masculine role model in his life, his father, who I call Denethor the Black Pilled, you can ask me about that in the comments if you want to know why, This relationship that he had with his father may have contributed to his desire of proving himself as an individual in order to earn his father's love, which overtook any good intentions he may have had in serving that principle he had sworn himself to.  Now Saruman, as the ascetic counterpoint, he was a more advanced wizard in his grasp of magic than Gandalf, which may have led to hubris, and he became fascinated and excited by power for power's sake.  He was rather Faustian in this way, and he was willing to compromise his moral integrity for the sake of the knowledge of the all-seeing eye.  This is also lunar because he's not finding in himself the embodiment of any principle but is instead looking to Sauron's power which is external.  He effectively worships Sauron's power and wants to take it for himself rather than developing his own.  His hubris and fascination with knowledge for knowledge's sake caused his fall.  A man who embodies his own principles, who is the principle unto himself, is not bothered by what others do, and neither does he put unnecessary faith and hope into anything or anyone external to themselves.  The key for men is to ask not what woman he can serve or how he can serve his family or nation, but rather, What principles do I live by?  Does my compass point north?  Is my vision just and true?  And if you can answer yes to that, then the next question is, how do I represent the most perfect expression of this ideal that I can manage to be in this modern age?  remembering of course that the pure archetype is just what we aim for.  You don't need to be the perfect expression of it in order for it to orient you and set you on the right path.  You need not ascend the mountain in order to assemble with your comrades around the base.  A man aiming towards heroism must become the principle that self-satisfies, whether as a warrior, ascetic, or a combination of the two.  He must live his principles as the living word, the logos.  This is what men are seeking.  Looking for somebody or something else to embody.  that is the feminine lunar way.  And we say lunar because the moon reflects the light rather than generating it.  rather than generating any light itself.  And men are meant to be the solar sex.  In this dark age of the Kali Yuga, there can be no false supports.  Self-sufficiency in this regard is a key component of traditional masculinity.  It is also, as I stated in a previous video, the only way to fix many of our modern crises, especially the gender crisis.  Women find their principle in the man, but the catch is for that to work, the men have to be a principle unto themselves before they can be a principle for her or for anybody else.  This is at the root of why modern people are so lost.  Both men and women need a principle to serve or they become decadent and degenerate.  Without the stabilizing masculine force to ground the chaotic mutable feminine, woman revels in her material existence and descends into narcissism.  And this is why I have said in that previous video that... Regardless of who is at fault for the modern gender crisis, it ultimately falls upon men to save us all.  And to do this, men must embody virtue and become that self-satisfying principle in order to ground women again.  The wild horse will not don its own bridle.  You can't request to Shakti that she put her power away, but she will be immediately drawn to the lightning rod that is the masculine expression of a principle.  There is no new idea that's going to save our people.  We don't need any rehashed ideologies dressed up with fancy new labels.  What we need is to build a new man.  And too many in our movement are inadvertently stuck in a degraded form of the path of contemplation, engaging in intellectual masturbation to serve their own egos at the expense of cultivating real virtue in themselves.  And others are inadvertently stuck on a degraded form of the path of action, looking to destroy civilization without any vision to build from anew.  delving into revenge fantasies and doomsday cults.  Neither of these energies are being channeled appropriately.  Nietzsche said, in times of peace, the militant man attacks himself.  The new man should orient his compass towards a healthy archetype of absolute man and seek to cultivate virtue in himself.  It is seen as fundamentally masculine to be able to assert your will through force.  But the secret to masculinity is when your capacity for force is so overwhelming but your mastery of self is so advanced that the simple expression of your will is sufficient to make everyone want to comply.  The truly masculine man does not need fits of anger or violence to demand his way.  The strength of his presence, the essence of his aura, the metaphysical nature of his being is such that all who behold him feel compelled to follow in his way.  A man's principles must become internal to himself.  The whole purpose of virtue and ethics is to have a code to live by.  that both expresses the soul's true nature and helps the man connect with that nature.  Living by these principles changes your metaphysical makeup and your personal gravitas, your aura, so to speak.  Man's greatest challenge is not to dominate anyone or anything external, but to master himself.  This is the greatest battle a man can fight.  Within you, you will find the adversary most perfectly suited for you.  And this sounds challenging, but so are all paths worth walking.  But I believe in my brothers, and if you have watched this through to the end, then perhaps you feel something in you calling for more.  Perhaps you have what it takes to break free of modernity and become who you were meant to be.  And ultimately, isn't this why we fight?  Not to preserve the broken and dysfunctional modern degenerates, but to honor what we used to be and resurrect that ideal in the future of what we can be again.  And I believe that when enough men rise to the challenge and conquer themselves, then they will conquer the world and restore order based on a positive vision of the next golden age.

Okay, so onto the haul.  So I'll do the maternity stuff first because the baby stuff is so cute.  It's kind of like, we'll leave it as a grand finale.  So basically, I don't like maternity jeans.  They're uncomfortable.  They fit in some places and they don't fit in others.  I feel like... They kind of slide down when you walk around in them.  I mean, I like how they look.  They look fine.  It's just, it's not for me.  I want to be comfortable.  I want to wear something that's going to be form-fitting, gonna make me feel warm and comfy and cozy.  but that's also, it has give and stretch in them.  So leggings are the way to go for me.  I hear a lot of women are one or the other, they like their leggings for their entire pregnancy or they like jeans.  I am a leggings girl, so from Old Navy, I got two pairs of leggings.  these are thick.  they're like.  they're not a jersey or like just plain cotton material.  they're.  they're spandexy and they're very very thick.  you can see there's like a beautiful seam that goes down the front which almost makes them look like a dress pant which i really like.  um they're.  they're a skinny fit so easy to tuck into winter boots and they have the elasticated over the bump stretchy part on the top which is thinner and not as thick as the actual pant itself.  so it won't be providing too much support around your belly.  but you don't really want things to be like super super tight around your your belly where your baby is anyway at least in my opinion.  so I got these in the heather gray as well as in black.  I haven't even taken the black out of the package yet but I'll just show you real quick.  They're exactly the same, you know?  So yeah, they've got like the over the bump, elasticated fit, beautiful seam down the front, skinny fit, and they're thick, which is great for winter.  So these will be my winter leggings that I will be basically wearing and circulating with, I think I have one or two other pairs of leggings that I can wear.  I have like a merino wool under armor that I can wear even under those to make them even more warm.  So pretty much all of my shirts I will be able to wear with these two warm pairs of leggings and it will match and it will be comfy, but it will feel like I have a lot more clothes and more outfits than if I had bought like five pairs of maternity pants.  Those pants were like, they were less than $20 each.  They were a really, really good deal.  So the first thing I got is a really simple, basic black scoop neck.  It's exactly the same as what I'm wearing right now.  This is a V-neck, but I got it secondhand at the maternity store in my shop.  It has the ruching on the side, so it shows off your bump.  It's just a perfect basic.  I wanted it in a scoop neck as well as having the black V-neck.  And this was less than $10.  Just a really simple basic.  So as well as that one, the only other shirt that I got, which shows off the bump, is this one, which is a really beautiful mustardy color shirt.  It has the tie in the front, which is great for nursing.  So you know, you can just kind of I will be covering myself probably.  no definitely when I'm in public but when I'm at home you can just untie the side and then you can easily nurse.  I'll just kind of show you really quickly what this one looks like on.  it's such a beautiful color.  I really love jewel tones just for any time of the year.  really so as you can see like it's it's it's got lots of room for growth.  So you don't know how big I'm going to get, but it's certainly not baggy by anyone's standards.  And then it just sort of comes down over the bump and it has the ruching here on the side, which is really cute.  And it's just like a really nice color.  I really love it.  I think it's really nice.  And, you know, when you're pregnant and your body's changing, it can be a little bit alarming at first.  Nothing fits.  You know, nothing's really comfortable.  I just think it's really nice to invest in a few little pieces that you can throw on that make you feel cute and girly.  Because most of the time around the house these days, it's just like hashtag blob life.  And yeah, I just think that that's so cute.  And I got.  I got I think 60% off.  I think this was actually.  this is still on the Old Navy website Canada right now.  it's comes in like black and white.  pink and just like a solid black navy, which is really cute.  So then my other three shirts are more of a relaxed fit.  They kind of graze over the body.  They go well over the bump and almost cover my bum entirely, which is, this is like, this is my ideal and preferred fit for pregnancy.  You still will easily be able to see my bump through a shirt like this, but I think the stripe mustard is just like a perfect basic can wear it with a pair of leggings and a pair of winter boots and a scarf and it will look really cute and casual and it will also be really comfy because it's not form-fitting.  it's not like hugging my body super tight and I love that.  I just think it's a beautiful basic and you know I like they're a relaxed fit shirt anyway like I will probably definitely wear this when I'm not pregnant anymore just like as a baggy cozy shirt The second shirt that I got, which is basically exactly like that one.  Another relaxed fit tunic.  It's quite long, should come down over my bum.  Nice long sleeves and a scoop neck in this beautiful cranberry color, which I think is just, it's a color that suits me.  It's one of these jewel tones that I just gravitate towards.  It's really pretty, really feminine and very comfy.  Easily will be able to be worn after pregnancy because it doesn't have the side ruching.  It's literally just a relaxed fit tunic that will go over the bump, which I'm all about, you know, buying pieces which are theoretically wearable after pregnancy.  That's why I only got, I have three of these shirts, which have the ruching on the side, the polka dot one and these two black sort of t-shirt style ones, because I just don't, I don't feel like spending a load of money on something that I don't know.  I'm not going to be wearing that much.  I mean, I'm going to be pregnant again, but I don't know.  How much actual bump-related clothing do you need?  Anyway.  So this one is the thicker, it's the thickest of the shirts that I bought.  It's actually more of a sweater material.  It's very, very soft, but it doesn't seem like one of those materials that will go nibby, you know, in the wash, which I absolutely hate.  And I'll just try this one on for you as well so you can see.  This one has a little bit of shape to it as well.  It's not just like a tunic.  It has an elastic around the bust, which is really nice because... All you pregnant ladies know out there, you don't really have much of a shape in the way that you used to when you get pregnant.  So this is nice, it just cuts into the smallest part of you, which for most women will now be directly under the waist.  Gives you a little bit of shape.  It's like a peplum style, so it kind of like, you know, comes out like an A-line.  Long sleeve, scoop neck, really soft.  I'm actually just gonna keep this on because it's so nice.  Okay, so now onto the fun stuff, which is the baby-related clothes.  So we'll start off with the smallest item here.  These were like $6 on sale as well.  Everything that I'm showing you right now, I'm pretty sure it's still on the website and it's still on sale.  These slippers have these little tiny things on the bottom and they're so soft and fleecy and warm on the inside.  Extremely cute, just in a navy.  And I bought these in a... three to six months, because they're elasticated around the ankle, meaning they'll probably still fit him when he's an infant.  There'll be a lot of extra room in the toe.  And he'll grow into them.  I don't see the point in buying tons of infant... sizing clothes and articles of clothing because he's just gonna grow out of it in a month.  anyway.  I'd rather buy things that are functional and practical and maybe he can wear a little bit big in the beginning and then grow into grow into.  so I think you know this will probably last at least until six months.  they're kind of big and stretchy.  so You know, maybe even a bit longer.  Great deal on those.  And so those sorts of, that slipper, the reason why I bought those slippers is because some of the jumpers that I got, they don't have feet.  So I just wanted something that I can pop on his feet that's thicker than a sock in case it's cold.  So the first cute thing that I got... this like so this is a zero two or no sorry a three to six month 12 to 17 pound onesie very very cute has no feet but it has a diagonal zipper down the front for easy changing.  so you know you can theoretically just keep his arms in the top part and just sort of change his diaper and then, you know, pop him back in.  What's really cute about this is that the dinosaur is a bit textured.  He almost has kind of like a rubber feel.  And if you lift up his mouth, he's like, hi, really, really cute.  It also has a hood, which I love.  I love the hood option and it's super fleecy and soft on the inside.  So he won't fit into that right away, but he will eventually, he will, he will work his way into it as he grows.  So the other, Is this one?  No, so this one is 6 to 12 months.  This one's bigger again.  Also dinosaur themed.  It has kind of like a grey scaly pattern on the bottom.  But on the hood there are these like black scales.  Absolutely adorable.  I love this.  I can't wait to see him like stomping around the house.  Roaring and pretending to be a dino.  As long as he doesn't transition to a dino, we're good.  It's also fleecy on the inside.  It has the diagonal zip for easy changing, or if he gets warm, he can easily strip off.  No feet again, so probably will be good at least in the beginning for the six month period if he fits into them with the slippers.  This one is my favorite.  I am obsessed with this one.  It is so adorable.  It's just like the dinosaur one, only it's a fox.  Look at it.  look how adorable it is and like.  this is a really high quality piece of fabric like.  it's not cheap.  it doesn't look like it's sewn together cheaply.  it's extremely soft and warm on the inside.  the zipper looks great.  the design is beautiful like.  i'm really surprised with old navy.  to be honest like the last time i bought something from old navy it was like junk.  but this I'm really impressed with.  I'm really happy with them.  they're super cute super soft and everything that I've heard moms talk about online.  they're like get the diagonal zip.  it's the easiest.  you don't have to like take anything off over their head when you're changing them and it's sort of you think and they can unzip it.  they can.  they can sort of strip off quickly if they're overheating that kind of a thing.  but I mean like.  I got this for like $15.  I think it was regular 40 adorable right Um, and then so I got two more three to six month.  This was a two pack.  I think I got both of these for $17 together.  It's a slightly different style.  It also has a hood.  All of my three to 12 month onesies, except for a few that I've purchased in other places have hoods.  I just really like the hood option to keep their head warm if they feel a bit chilly.  This one doesn't have a zip.  It has the snaps just on the bottom.  Which I think is fine.  You know, as long as, like I said, it doesn't have to go over his head to be changed.  It's perfect.  It's just like a regular stripey, footless onesie.  Perfect.  And then another dinosaur.  I don't know what's going on.  I was kind of like, I guess I was having like a dinosaur moment when I was shopping that day.  But... this is really cool pattern.  it has like stegosaurus it has long neck it looks like it has some raptors and this one has the snaps on the bottom for easy changing and a hood super cute.  it's a lighter material a little bit thicker than t-shirt but like definitely feels like it's like not a cheap like cheap piece of clothing which i like.  and then the cutest my favorite part is the infant onesies.  so none of these have hoods but they're just really simple really soft.  i was going for comfort and warmth when i bought these ones.  these were like six dollars each.  they were really really good price.  um and yeah zipper diagonal zipper down the front feet no hood.  so super comfy.  you can sleep in them if he wants to.  soft warm neutral perfect this one.  oh honestly I wish I had this for me like I want this in my size.  it's so soft it's so beautiful like the velour is.  it's really nice has a nice little shine on it star pattern and zip with feet.  super cute.  I cannot wait to cuddle him when he's all wrapped up and cozy in this one when he's like a little baby so awesome.  And then this one is another like really neutral, it's slightly thicker than the initial zero to three month baby jumper that I showed you.  This one's quilted.  So just a tiny bit thicker, but also like a nice neutral navy.  You can pop a hat on him, an extra sweater over the top if we're going outside.  It's just simple.  Love it.  And then the last one that I got also on the theme of dinosaurs, as you can see here, the feet have like little dinosaur faces, which I thought was just adorable.  And it kind of has like a cool green dinosaur face.  vibe to it again with the zip no hood.  this was just a t-shirt material sort of a lighter option in case there's a warm day or in case we have the fire going and it's warm in the house.  and yeah this one was also under $10.  so yeah this was a super successful haul.  I'm super pleased with everything that I got for myself.  everything fits really nice.  uh i i went just just so.  you know if you're a pregnant woman watching this i am normally a size small on top but because i'm just kind of like worried all the time when i shop online i always almost always go with size up and i almost never regret it.  um you can kind of see my size here now you know like i'm not like a big girl.  um and i got a medium and it fits me comfortably like it fits me in the shoulders it fits me in the arm.  It's not baggy around the waist or anything.  I think a small still probably would have fit, but like I said, I'm going for comfort these days, so a medium was great for me in the leggings and in the tunics.  And yeah, the baby clothes is super awesome.  So I hope you enjoyed this haul.  Check out the Old Navy website if you're Canadian.  I think they probably have the deals on the American site too, but I was just on the website before I made this video and the deals are definitely still on right now.

I've always been a leggings girl, and I've found the perfect pair from Old Navy. They're thick, spandexy, and have a beautiful seam down the front that makes them look like dress pants.

One of my favorites is a mustardy color shirt with a tie in the front that's great for nursing.\n\nI've also got a few relaxed-fit tunics that are perfect for everyday wear. They're super comfy and can be worn after pregnancy too. I've invested in a few pieces that make me feel cute and girly, like a thicker sweater material tunic with an elastic around the bust that gives me a little shape.\n\nNow, let's move on to the baby clothes. I've got some adorable onesies, including a dinosaur-themed onesie that's my favorite. I've also got a few neutral-colored onesies that are perfect for everyday wear.

Very sorry that I didn't kind of give anyone a heads up on this channel that I was going to be taking a break, but my life has just been really crazy over the past two months and I said from the beginning when I came back, this is a hobby, this is not my career, I'm doing this because I enjoy it and that my life and my family is my top priority.  I may have to disappear for a while.  That's just how it is on this channel.  But I'm back.  I have so much to tell you.  I'm so excited to share all of the incredible developments that have happened so rapidly in my life over the past three months.  It's still very overwhelming to me, everything that has happened, but it's all good.  First things first, I am obviously in a new location.  This is a different place than what you're used to seeing me in.  I have moved to a new place completely.  There will no longer be sirens in my videos.  Amen, hallelujah.  This is one of the most amazing things.  I'm so excited.  I have left the city.  I no longer am in an urban environment.  I'm in a rural place.  I have retreated to the countryside to find the good life.  This has been the most stressful thing that I have had to organize and endure over the past little while.  And it was the main reason why I needed to take a step back.  Because moving to a new country, which I have moved to a new country, it's no small thing.  And it was just a really big move.  And my husband, that's the other big thing that's happened.  I got married.  You know, was working full time during the move.  So it was just a lot of juggling.  But we're here.  Finally, I'm going to do a little bit of a reveal of my location in my next video.  There's still a few things that I just sort out before I want to reveal exactly where I am.  but the other big thing that has happened over the course of this little while is if you follow me on Twitter you will know that I got married.  I posted a picture and sort of like a little life update over there and it was really just the legal the legal aspect of of my marriage which really needed to be sorted out before we moved.  I will be planning my proper church wedding for the not too distant future.  So those are the two things that have been kind of a mystery, I suppose, for you guys.  But the news that I'm going to reveal today, the really big news, the really exciting news, the most juicy piece of information I'm going to reveal to you right here now.  You may already know because I may have given you a hint in the title, like clickbait style.  So the big news is that I'm pregnant.  I'm in my second trimester.  I'm not going to say exactly right yet how far I am into the pregnancy, but I'm in the second trimester.  I know the gender, which I will reveal later on as well.  I'm really gonna milk it.  I'm not gonna reveal everything right away, guys.  You're gonna have to wait.  I'm gonna drip feed you the information.  But I'm pregnant, I'm married, and I made it to the countryside.  So I am feeling so blessed that all of these things actually came together.  These are the things that I have been talking about on this channel for a very long time.  I've been promoting, you know, the traditional lifestyle, promoting family values, promoting like, you know, revolting against the modern world and finding the good life, the simple life.  And now it's time for me to practice what I have been preaching.  You know, what kind of person would I be if I'm here on the internet, you know, telling other women, you know, get your family in order if I'm not gonna do it myself.  And so I really thought long and hard about whether or not I was going to, you know, just maybe I thought about just deleting my account for a while because this is a very vulnerable position that I'm putting myself in right now.  There are many women, I think, who are in the sort of political right wing side of YouTube who would rightfully want to just sort of exit at this point and focus on their life and their health and their family.  And I completely respect and completely understand that because I have been considering whether or not I should do the same thing.  On the other hand, I think that I should be courageous because now I really have something to offer.  than just like my opinions and my ideas which you can get anywhere.  you know everyone knows what what what the talking points are.  this is what we're for.  this is what we're against.  this is why this is bad.  this is you've heard.  you've heard it.  you've heard it all over and over and over again for the past three years.  it's not really much new information that you're getting.  you know how many how many videos can you really watch about immigration you know or the importance of border security or just like general degeneracy that's happening in our societies right now.  There is a lot of that.  And I think that on the one hand, while it's important to expose the bad things that are happening and to push back against them, we on the right wing, I think often forget to promote what it is that we really believe in by, you know, living what we say that we should do.  And now that I am about to become a mom, which I'm extremely excited about, I want to continue doing my girl talk series, but I also want to start focusing on Like mom content, which is gonna be really different for a lot of my old-time viewers.  It's not gonna be that interesting for dudes and like the my male audience unless you are you know trying to conceive with your wife or you know, maybe you're a father yourself or I don't know, you have a sister who you wanna help out, you wanna share my videos to a woman who is important to you in your life.  But I've been shifting my focus towards content for women for a while now, and that's only gonna continue.  I wanna make a video about my first trimester, my experiences trying to conceive, fertility, the sort of supplements and vitamins I take, things that I have learned and educated myself about using podcasts and books and all kinds of stuff that I want to share with women who are like me who are also either moving into motherhood or are attempting to do that.  So that's the direction that I'm headed in now.  I want to, you know, I'm sick of just talking about ideas.  There will always be an element of that on this channel, I think.  I don't know if that part of my personality is going anywhere, but I want to make content about the meaning that I've created in my life.  By the grace of God, I've been blessed with having all of my prayers answered.  And there has been an active participation in making these things come to fruition on my part.  And I want to show you that if someone like me can do it, and many of you saw the state that I was in when I started this channel.  You know, I was at, you know, square one.  Couldn't even articulate what it was that I wanted properly.  To be here now, a few short years later, if I can do it, anyone can do it.  And I think we on the right wing, we need more visual representation of happy, family oriented, healthy, traditionally minded people who are manifesting good.  in the world and inspiring you to do the same and to believe that you can do it too.  It doesn't matter what stage in this process that you are, you can be single, stuck in a city, start small.  And that's what this channel is gonna be about.  It's gonna be about sharing and educating about those things and trying to inspire others to at least to some degree, turning away from the constant bombardment of reasons to be blackpilled and to be hopeless and to remind you that despair is a sin.  We need to focus on the things that are important to us in our real lives, prioritize our family, take on responsibility and build.  We need to build something for ourselves that is worth fighting for.  Because if we're just on the internet doing news coverage and lamenting yet another degenerate display in the news or whatever it is, is that benefiting your life?  Really?  It doesn't benefit mine.  I'm low-key addicted to this kind of news cycle thing, and it's not great for me.  But I have prioritized making something for myself and building my life.  And now it's time to share with you that process.  So I'm so excited, guys.  I'm so happy.  I'm so excited.  I'm so grateful.  I'm so full of hope about what the future has in store for me.  I'm so excited to be a mom.  I'm so excited to share this with you.  Yeah, I mean, I'm going to leave it off there.  There's going to be lots more revealed soon.  Stay tuned.

It's amazing to see the turnout.  I live on the Donegal border, Donegal-Derry border.  I'm actually an Iskahine woman.  And I'm just an ordinary woman, just like you.

I'm about a mile away from there.  And they're going to put a drug provision centre there.  And the thing is, is that we can't financially support the people that we have in this country.
