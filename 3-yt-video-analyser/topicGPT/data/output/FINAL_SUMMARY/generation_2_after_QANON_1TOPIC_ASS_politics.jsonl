{"summary":"Document 1\nToday, I want to share with you a prophetic alert update concerning Kim Clement's prophecies about the banking system. Kim Clement was a prophet who made several predictions about the banking system crashing, which aligns with our current economic situation.   In a prophecy from December 3rd, 2005, Kim Clement said that the banking system would crash, but only for a short moment in time. He also mentioned the Damascus Road conversion of three major networks in the country and Paula White, who is now the spiritual advisor to President Trump. This prophecy seems to be fulfilled, and it's interesting to note that Kim Clement mentioned Paula White at the same time as the banking system crash.  In another prophecy from April 18th, 2008, Kim Clement said that two great banking systems would fall, but it would not destroy the nation. He also mentioned that there would be a break in the system, which aligns with his previous prophecy about the dinar.  Kim Clement also spoke about the corruption in the banking system and how it would be exposed. He said that God would bring about change and people would rejoice again as the corruption is removed. This prophecy seems to be relevant to our current situation, where the corruption in the banking system is being exposed.  It's essential to note that when we see prophecy, we often think it's supposed to happen within a short time frame, but God can take us to a different prophetic realm, where he's speaking about the future. This is what happened with Kim Clement's prophecies, where he spoke about events that would happen years in the future.  In conclusion, Kim Clement's prophecies about the banking system are aligning with our current economic situation, and it's essential to do research and connect the dots to understand the full context of these prophecies.\nDocument 2\nThe speaker discusses the current state of the silver market, citing a significant increase in delivery contracts issued for physical silver. The first day of delivery contracts issued saw 11,458 contracts, which is 55 million ounces of physical silver. This is the biggest delivery of the year so far, and the speaker believes it may be a sign that the shorts are losing control of the market.  The speaker highlights several major banks, including Goldman Sachs, Macquarie, HSBC, and JP Morgan, which are taking delivery of large amounts of physical silver. JP Morgan is the largest issuer of delivery contracts, with 30 million ounces of silver delivered on the first day. The speaker suggests that JP Morgan may be leasing this silver from other banks, such as J.P. Morgan, to meet their delivery obligations.  The speaker also discusses the COVID-19 pandemic and the manipulation of case numbers. They cite a recorded conversation of the Collin County Commissioner's Court, where the definition of a COVID case was changed to include individuals who have been in contact with someone who has COVID, even if they have not been diagnosed themselves. The speaker believes this is a clear example of the government manipulating the numbers to create a sense of panic and control.  The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of fighting against the manipulation of the COVID numbers and the control of the silver market. They encourage listeners to join their private road, Road to Ruta, and to stay informed about the latest developments in the silver market and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDocument 3\nThe video discusses the funeral of George H.W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, and the events surrounding it. The speaker claims that the funeral was a ritual, pointing out various inconsistencies and anomalies in the behavior of the attendees, including the Bush family, politicians, and military personnel.   The speaker highlights the unusual behavior of the funeral director, who appears to be incompetent in seating the guests, and the avoidance body language of Dick Cheney, who seems to be hiding behind Dan Quayle. The speaker also notes the subtle duality in the prayer, which may be addressed to a different God, and the fact that some attendees, including Paul Ryan and Columba, appear to be Catholic.  The speaker also criticizes the eulogies delivered by Mitch McConnell and others, which they claim are insincere and lack remorse. The speaker suggests that the attendees are more interested in promoting their own agendas and justifying their actions than in genuinely honoring the memory of George H.W. Bush.  The video also includes a segment where the speaker discusses the life and legacy of George H.W. Bush, highlighting his military service, his dedication to public service, and his commitment to the country. However, the speaker's tone is sarcastic and critical, suggesting that the attendees are more interested in promoting their own interests than in genuinely honoring the memory of the former President.\nDocument 4\nThe UK's Track and Trace app is contracted to and run by private companies, including AI firm Faculty and software data company Palantir. Faculty's involvement raises questions about its selection, given its lack of experience in the NHS and ties to Dominic Cummings. Palantir's contract allows it to negotiate intellectual property with third parties, sparking concerns about data security.  Serco, an outsourcing giant, has been contracted to train, recruit, and manage contract tracers, as well as run test centers. However, it has a history of failure and has been fined for ripping off the public purse. Serco has also been involved in various controversies, including breaching responsibilities of handling nuclear waste and manipulating results to show it met NHS targets.  The company's CEO, Robert Soames, has been accused of hypocrisy after being photographed on a boat during lockdown, despite claiming to show solidarity with frontline workers. The government's handling of the pandemic has been criticized for being secretive and lacking transparency, with billions of public money being handed to private companies without competition or accountability.  The leader of the House has been asked to condemn the private sector companies undermining the test and trace system, but has refused. The whole system \"stinks\" of corruption, with Conservative baroness and business executive Baroness Harding appointed as the head of track and trace, and Serco's CEO having ties to the Tory party.\nDocument 5\nThis video is a short summary of a longer interview with Joe DiGenova about the Barr-Durham investigation and Mike Rogers. The host, Deb, encourages viewers to watch the full 15-minute video, but provides a few clips and commentary. The discussion centers around Adam Schiff's opposition to Rick Grinnell and the potential for Durham to bring charges against Schiff for lying and leaking information.   Deb suggests that Schiff is trying to dirty up jury pools to make Durham's investigation seem politically motivated. She also discusses Mike Rogers, the former head of the National Security Agency, who has been cooperating with Durham and has blown the whistle on the Obama administration's illegal queries into the NSA database.   Deb believes that Rogers' testimony will be crucial in the investigation and that he deserves credit for exposing the wrongdoing. She also hopes that Durham will bring a broad conspiracy charge against Brennan and others for denying the president and his associates their civil rights.   The video ends with Deb encouraging viewers to watch the full interview with Joe DiGenova, which covers the details of the investigation and the potential for Durham to bring charges against those involved.\nDocument 6\nPeter of England is filming in Italy, assessing the situation after the pandemic. He notes that Italians are not as fearful as people in the UK and France, with many not wearing masks and interacting freely. He questions the need for lockdowns and the accuracy of statistics provided by the medical community.   Peter suggests that the UK government's actions are unjustified and that there may be a political motive behind the lockdowns. He also questions the concept of a second wave, suggesting that it was planned.   He references the upcoming US presidential election and the potential for controversy and violence. He believes that the Democratic Party and other groups may try to remove Donald Trump from office, which could lead to further unrest.   Peter also discusses the potential for 5G technology to be activated, which he believes could have negative health consequences. He encourages viewers to be creative in their dissent and to take action against the government's policies.   He invites viewers to contact him to discuss organizing meaningful demonstrations and to subscribe to his channel for future updates.\nDocument 7\nThe President discussed the US-China trade deal, stating that China agreed to spend $250 billion in the US, with a significant portion going to farmers and manufacturers. He expressed hope that China would honor the deal. The President also addressed the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming that the US was prepared but the media was not. He stated that he was the first to call for a ban on people coming from China and that other countries are now following his lead.  The President then took questions from the press, including one about Joe Biden's willingness to have a phone call with him to discuss the pandemic. He agreed to take the call and expressed a desire to speak with Biden. The President also questioned the press about their connections to China, specifically mentioning a reporter from Hong Kong Phoenix TV.  The President then shifted the conversation to his own actions during the pandemic, stating that he was called xenophobic and racist for his early response to the crisis. He claimed that Joe Biden later acknowledged that he was right to take action. The President also discussed his son's joke about advocating for a pardon for Joe Exotic, the star of the Netflix show Tiger King, who is serving a 22-year prison sentence for allegedly hiring someone to murder an animal rights activist.\nDocument 8\nThe video discusses the current state of the crypto market, particularly the rise of silver and the manipulation of the precious metals market by big banks. The host mentions that Warren Buffett is buying up silver assets, which is a silver play, and that the big banks are struggling to deliver physical metal, resulting in huge losses. The host also talks about the Theta Network, a video blockchain project, and its growth plans, including the staking of 30 million tokens and the use of these tokens as growth capital over the next 12 months. The host believes that this is a great time to invest in Theta and encourages viewers to join the project. The video also mentions the importance of decentralization and the potential for Theta to become a self-sustaining and self-governing protocol.\nDocument 9\nFBI agents have made two more arrests in connection with an ongoing corruption probe in Muncie, Indiana. Phil Nichols, a longtime Democrat Party leader, and Jess Neal, a former Muncie Police Department officer, were taken into federal custody. Nichols is the father of Craig Nichols, who was sentenced to two years in federal prison in 2019 for wire fraud and money laundering. The probe, known as Operation Public Trust, has already led to nine arrests, including former Mayor Dennis Tyler, who was replaced by Republican Dan Ridenour. The investigation has also led to the indictment of local businessman Jeffrey Burke and Muncie Sanitary District officials Nikki Grigsby and Tracy Barton. Others facing charges include businessman Tony Franklin and contractor Rodney Barber, whose trial has been reset for September. The probe has been ongoing for several years and has resulted in the arrest of several high-ranking officials in the Democrat Party in Indiana.\nDocument 10\nAs of May 1, 2020, the US has returned to constitutional law, marking significant progress in the restoration of the republic. This development, announced by President Trump, has checked off Event 6 on the Jazara agenda list, which involves returning constitutional law to all courts and legal matters. Several other events, including the cancellation of debt, abolition of income tax and the IRS, and the elimination of the Federal Reserve System, are already in progress. President Trump's proclamation is expected to trigger the occurrence of events 7, 11, and 15, including the reinstatement of the original title of nobility amendment and the retraining of judges and attorneys in constitutional law. The transition to a new financial system continues, with the Earth Alliance working towards a global implementation of these changes.\nDocument 11\nThe speaker believes that the retail market is always one to two steps behind the big money, and that gold stocks will be affected in the near term if the stocks go down. However, the likely policy response to this, such as quantitative easing and artificially low interest rates, will ultimately be good for gold and gold equities.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of maintaining US dollar liquidity and bullion as liquidity, and suggests that buying gold equities is a good investment strategy. They also note that the economy will gradually reopen, but it will be a new world that is very different from what it was before.  The speaker is concerned about the destruction of the currency and the trashing of personal wealth, and believes that the government's actions will lead to a slippery slope to socialism. They also note that the gold-silver ratio is currently high, but that this is not a reason to be hesitant to invest in silver.  The speaker believes that physical gold is the best safety net, and that it will continue to be in high demand as people realize that it is a safe-haven asset. They also note that the big money is showing what they're doing by requesting delivery and taking gold off the exchange, and that this will funnel down to the retail side and lead to massive premiums and shortages.  The speaker suggests that the time to buy gold is now, and that the move is getting started and has some legs. They also note that the level of real interest rates is a key indicator of when to exit the gold market, and that the current low interest rates make it a good time to invest in gold.  The speaker believes that the smart money is in the non-reportable category, and that they are close to record long again, which indicates that the squeeze is about to enter a new phase. They also note that the COMEX market is changing the entire landscape, and that the largest amount of contracts ever stood for delivery\nDocument 12\nIndian in the Machine shares intel from Ivo of Vega via Sharon Stewart, claiming John F. Kennedy Jr. is alive and working with the Alliance to avenge his father's death and take down the deep state. According to Ivo, Trump will have a second term, implement the Nassar standard, and then call an election where JFK Jr. will run and win as the first president of a Nassara-compliant United States. Ivo believes JFK Jr. will be the most level-headed candidate, not out of pity, but due to his qualifications. The two-party system will be abolished, and the country will be reopened to any candidate who wants to run. Ivo's people have been working with Trump, who makes his own decisions, sometimes against the alliance's wishes. The key to change is for people to hold their light and not continue old third-dimensional behaviors, which aid the deep state.\nDocument 13\nMan Yongping, Yang Hui, and Fang Honghui, three high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Security, were directly executed by the CCP.  They were among the 20 people called to a meeting, where they were shot one by one.  The incident is attributed to Biden's failure, with many questioning his motives.  The speaker claims that Biden has been colluding with the CCP for decades, building a relationship with Xi Jinping and forming an alliance to clean up political enemies in both countries.  The CIA's spies in the Chinese Communist Party are said to be aware of this information, which is crucial in understanding the situation.  The speaker suggests that Obama and Biden's anti-corruption efforts are actually a means to protect themselves and their allies, including Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan, by eliminating their political opponents and covering up evidence of corruption.  The incident is seen as a direct result of this alliance, with the speaker questioning Biden's involvement in the sale of business cards and other gifts to Xi Jinping.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Gold Market (Document: 11): Mentions the importance of maintaining US dollar liquidity and bullion as liquidity.\n    [2] Corruption Probe (Document: 9): Mentions the ongoing corruption probe in Muncie, Indiana.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 12): Mentions the alliance to avenge John F.

{"summary":"Document 14\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of May 6, 2020. President Trump was at Camp David with the President of Zimbabwe on May 4. Fleming's military intel contact reported that $1,200 economic impact payments and redemption\/exchange appointments would go out this week.   BOTUS has made all legally unassailable to prevent deep state operatives from unraveling redemptions. Timelines were not off by far, only ours. The World Court in The Hague made modifications to contracts and agreements on May 4, and audits passed the same day.   The 800-hash-S release timing was fluid and subject to a release algorithm. The Admiral would release liquidity from May 5 onwards. Expectations were for full payouts in Hong Kong and other centers on May 5 for historic bonds, including Yellow Dragon bonds.   The banks were finalizing getting enough staff in the redemption centers and overcoming some hiccups from exchange staff reticent to serve due to potential COVID-19 infection. Unless significant problems arose, the 800S hash release for Tier 4B was expected to begin by May 5.   The Department of Defense through the US Treasury told HSBC and Wells Fargo that Wells Fargo was to send out the 500,000 plus 800 hash notification emails by May 5. There would be around 12 days of Tier 4B redemption exchanges for contract rates in appointments at special exchange center locations obtained by calling the 800S hash.   The U.S. returned to constitutional law as of May 1, 2020. Thousands of deep state operatives have been arrested globally behind the scenes over the past two months. Sealed indictments were unsealed and executed in behind-the-scenes arrests for Comey, Stsock, Page, Lynch, Yates, Brennan, Clapper, McCabe, Orr, Rice, Baker, and Charamella.   Attorney General\nDocument 15\nThe speaker discusses the current state of the world, specifically the stock market and the COVID-19 pandemic. They believe the markets will shut down and that the US will lock down for two weeks, potentially longer. The speaker emphasizes the importance of being prepared, having food, water, and medicine, and being in a safe location.  The speaker also discusses the silver market, stating that it's the endgame for silver and that the price will skyrocket when the markets reopen. They believe the government will freeze the markets before they crash to zero and that the Fed's repo operations will be useless.  The speaker mentions various news articles and events, including the IMF preparing a $1 trillion bailout, the S&P Brent price dropping 10%, and European banks hitting all-time lows. They also discuss the potential for a global economic collapse and the role of the \"bad guys\" in rigging the markets.  The speaker concludes by urging listeners to be prepared and to stay informed, and to be aware of the potential for chaos and disruption in the coming days and weeks. They will continue to provide updates as long as YouTube is running.\nDocument 16\nHello, I'm Karen Hudis, and I'm speaking on behalf of the honest military powers of the world. I want to emphasize that we're all in this together, and I'm just one of the people who knows our world has been screwed up for a long time. I've been studying the brain with Dr. Charles Gant, and we've discovered that humans are immortal. This is due to the critical mass, where enough people understand the truth, and reality changes.  The world has been corrupted for 10,000 years, making it difficult for people to understand reality. This corruption has led to controlled opposition, where governments spread false information to keep power. However, there's a collective unconscious, where information is shared among a species when enough individuals understand it.  Unfortunately, humans have developed mind control technology, which can hijack people's thoughts. But there are some who are resistant to this, and I'm one of them. I've learned to recognize when I'm being influenced and can take steps to avoid it.  I want to share a special song, Jerusalem Maya, which is popular in Africa, and it's a prayer that emphasizes human immortality. I'll be singing it with the help of a recorded version. This is just a small part of the story, and I'll continue in the next video.  The black people have been fighting corrupt powers since 10,000 BC, and they're the real heroes. I'll be sharing more about this in the next video. For now, I want to emphasize that we're all in this together, and we have the power to change reality when enough of us understand the truth.\nDocument 17\nBill Gates has been receiving a lot of hate recently, with hundreds of thousands of negative comments on his social media. However, some people believe that he deserves the benefit of the doubt, especially considering his early warnings about pandemics in his 2015 TED talk and the Gates Foundation's pandemic exercise drill in 2019. The foundation has given away billions of dollars to various organizations, including some of the largest businesses in the world, such as Unilever and IBM.   A closer look at the Gates Foundation's funding reveals that it has given significant amounts to organizations involved in the current pandemic, including the World Health Organization, Gavi, and the University of Oxford. The foundation has also given money to media companies, including NBC, ABC, and the BBC, which some see as an attempt to influence the news.   Bill Gates' father, Bill Gates Sr., was involved in the American Eugenics Society, and the Gates Foundation has been accused of promoting eugenicist efforts through its funding. The organization has also been criticized for its focus on GMOs and its continued support for Monsanto, despite the company's bad reputation.   The Gates Foundation's influence on global health policy has been significant, with 70% of the World Health Organization's budget now coming from voluntary contributions, rather than assessed contributions from member states. This has led to concerns about accountability and the potential for undue influence by billionaires like Gates.   Some critics argue that the Gates Foundation's philanthropic efforts are more about promoting the interests of corporations like Coca-Cola and Monsanto than helping the world's poor. The organization's focus on education and agriculture has also been criticized, with some arguing that it is more about promoting the interests of the wealthy than helping those in need.   Ultimately, the question remains whether it is okay for billionaires to hide behind the label of charity and use their wealth to influence public policy.\nDocument 18\nDr. Dave Janda welcomed back his friend Patrick Byrne on the Insider Insight Show. Byrne, a multi-dimensional figure and individual, is known for being the CEO and founder of Overstock.com and for exposing corruption on Wall Street. Byrne recently assembled a team of IT forensic experts to analyze election problems and came forward to speak about their findings.   Byrne, along with General Flynn and Sidney Powell, met with President Trump in the Oval Office on December 18th. However, the New York Times published a lie about the meeting, stating that they discussed using the military to impose martial law or the insurrection act. Byrne confirmed that this was a fabrication.   Byrne described the meeting as surreal, with the president's lawyers being rude and condescending to the women present. He stated that the lawyers were owned by someone, implying that they were being controlled by external forces. Byrne believes that the president's lawyers are not serving him well and are telling him to concede the election.   Byrne expressed his concern that the president's lawyers are not fighting for him and are instead focused on their own interests. He suggested that the president should fire his lawyers and replace them with people like Mike Flynn and Sidney Powell, who are willing to fight for him.   Byrne also stated that the president's lawyers are not being truthful about Sidney Powell's cases, claiming that all 50 of her cases have been thrown out. However, Byrne explained that none of the cases have been thrown out on the merits, but rather on process issues.   Byrne believes that the president's odds of winning the election would increase to 80-90% if he made Mike Flynn the general counsel and Sidney Powell the special counsel. He also stated that the president's staff is not following through on his orders, including giving Sidney Powell a security clearance and an office at the White House.\nDocument 19\nWe the people decide who speaks, who gets elected, and who makes the rules for us.  If you don't like what's going on, you have two options: shut up or rise up.  Write your congressman, talk to your neighbor, and ask everyone to come together.  If everyone is on the same page, we can change things.  They don't want us together, they want us separated by party, color, and wealth.  But if we unite, we stand strong.  The majority should rule, like in Nevada where the majority decided to wear masks and stay home.  If you don't like it, you can move to a different state.  The problem is, we don't exist as a unified people because we're too busy fighting, hating, and arguing.  They pit us against each other with contradictory information, and we don't know what to believe.  The truth is, nobody knows.  We need to calm down, discuss, communicate, seek, learn, and gather knowledge.  We'll never know for sure, but we can try to come together and exist as a unified people.  The Constitution was written for the people, by the people, but the people we elected are in charge as long as we don't exist.  We need to come back together and take control of our lives.  We the people is a powerful thing, but only if it exists.  Let's try to exist and make a change.\nDocument 20\nThe gold cartel has blown up, according to Bill Murphy, a legendary guest on Liberty in Finance and Reluctant Preppers. This means that the U.S. is running out of physical gold to suppress the price, and the gold cartel's tricks are no longer working. The gold price has changed since last May, with all dips being bought, and the physical market is strong. The gold open interest is at an all-time high, and the buyers are taking on the sellers.  Murphy believes that the gold price will go berserk and eventually silver will break out, with the gold-silver ratio going to an all-time high. He thinks that the gold price will take out 2000 and go nuts, with the top potentially being 3000, 4000, or 5000. The government may have to reset the markets, but that's uncertain.  Murphy also discussed the current market action, including the stock market's bonkers activity and the government's involvement in creating false news and upward prices. He believes that this will create chaos when the economic situation takes place and people will be stunned at what it might do. The gold price explosion will be added to by the 0% interest rates in the stock market, which has already gone up 8-10 years to the moon.  Murphy has been a vocal critic of the gold cartel and the bullion bank cartel, and he's been wrong on silver for the past five years. However, he's now more excited and bullish than ever, believing that the end is near for the gold cartel. He's been a guest on Liberty in Finance and Reluctant Preppers for many years, providing educational awareness and commentary on the gold and silver markets.\nDocument 21\nGood morning, I'm Catania Alvin.  Breaking news: former President Barack Obama has been arrested for espionage.  He allegedly conspired with a former CIA officer to share classified information with China.  A criminal complaint was unsealed this morning.  According to reports, Obama pardoned many criminals before leaving office, allowing President Trump to uncover their crimes since taking office.  This may explain the recent surge in criminality.  The 2020 election fraud is also being addressed by Giuliani and Sidney Powell.  Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers and FBI officials announced the arrest.  A media blackout has been imposed, but Canadian outlets like Conservative Beaver are reporting on the development.  This is part of a larger trial involving Chinese espionage and former American intelligence officers.\nDocument 22\nThe video discusses the Deep State Crisis Actors Exposed, questioning the authenticity of mainstream news stories, particularly the George Floyd incident. The speaker shares inconsistencies in the official story, such as the police officers' badges being on crooked and the emergency vehicles not following standard protocols. They suggest that the Black Lives Matter movement may be a hoax created by the Deep State to fuel racial tensions.  The speaker expresses frustration with the lack of critical thinking and the prevalence of lies in society, which they believe is perpetuated by the Deep State. They mention the influence of powerful individuals like Bill Gates, Fauci, and the Rockefeller family, who they claim are playing dark roles to control humanity.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of discernment and the need for people to wake up to the truth. They encourage listeners to think outside the box and question the information they are given. The video concludes with a call to action, urging people to expose the lies and insanity that have been perpetuated for centuries, and to work towards creating a society that works for all.\nDocument 23\nToday's episode of If You Only Knew is titled \"Drip, Drip, Drip, Flood.\" October has been a significant month for declass, with a steady drip of information leading up to the election. The Patriots had planned to declass everything, and we're now seeing it in real-time. The Ratcliffe memo, Biden Senate panel review report, and Clinton email drop are just a few examples of the information that's been released.  The New York Post reported a massive bombshell story this week, and it's not finished yet. More information is expected to be released over the next few weeks. The story involves Hunter Biden's laptop, which was left at a repair shop. The shop owner inspected the laptop and found emails that contradict the Bidens' statements on television.  The emails reveal connections with the Ukraine Energy Company, the CCP, Russian oligarchs, and business dealings in Kazakhstan. Hunter Biden's former business partner, Biva Cooney, has flipped and turned over his Gmail account, detailing Hunter's China influence peddling.  The FBI threatened the shop owner to stay quiet about the laptop, but he went to Giuliani for protection. The contents of the hard drive were verified by multiple sources, including email recipients and dates of certain meetings. Despite this, the mainstream media is pushing the story to claim it was a foreign intelligence operation.  The censorship of the story has backfired, and now there's bipartisan support to end Section 230's protection. Jack Dorsey will appear before the Senate to testify on the manner in which they censor the story, which has become a matter of national election tampering.  Other developments include Bruce Ohr resigning from the DOJ, John Bash stepping down from the unmasking investigation, and P. Diddy starting a political party to endorse Joe Biden. The GOP has needed votes to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as the new Supreme Court Justice.  The\nDocument 24\nDunagan and Melody Kaiser, hosts of Liberty and Finance and Reluctant Preppers, are seeking help from their subscribers to find a new place to live.

{"summary":"Document 25\nThe video shows the pre-State of the Union speech interactions and conversations among politicians. A notable figure, referred to as \"Little Guy,\" is seen jumping out to get the attention of Mitt Romney and later signaling to Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence. The camera captures their reactions, including Pelosi and Pence's confusion about whether they are being recorded.  The video also highlights conversations between other politicians, including Adam Schiff, Ilhan Omar, and Rand Paul. One conversation between Schiff and a lady is particularly interesting, as she expresses her support for Trump and explains why she clapped for him during his previous speech.  The video also shows the reactions of Pelosi and Pence as they try to figure out if they are being recorded. They are seen checking the camera feeds and exchanging awkward glances. The video suggests that they are unaware that they are being recorded by a camera farther back in the room.  The video also touches on the impeachment process and the reactions of various politicians, including Ted Cruz and Sheila Jackson Lee. The video ends with a shot of the Supreme Court justices and a comment from Nancy Pelosi, which is decoded to reveal her saying that she is still replacing half of the justices.\nDocument 26\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 28, 2020.  The elders took over the GCR, RV release, and revalued the Iraqi Dinar on April 22nd.  Iraq was scheduled to formally announce their new Dinar 8 on April 29th, while the U.S.  would start Tier 4 the Internet Group.  The rollout was stopped on April 25th due to a problem with honesty found with a certain Tier 1 bank.  Stimulus check monies were coming out of the same Dubai one, two fund accounts as the RV.  Those on Social Security would receive their monies this week.  President Trump and First Lady Melania, along with the Pentagon Pedophile Task Force, used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the Cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation.  Trump has asked all state governors to call off the lockdown and invited their constituents to come back to work.  Sealed indictments, many of the over 170,000 sealed indictments filed in federal courts across the nation since President Trump took office, were now being served.  Most contained charges of paedophilia.  It was rumored that billionaire George Soros and former US presidents George Bush Jr.  and Barack Obama were arrested and presently in, or headed for Gitmo, where they faced military tribunals for treason and other serious crimes.  The redemption process for currency exchange and ZIM bonds would be done in two parts.  The banks already had one part of your package.  The second part would be delivered to you.

All global monies were now under control of the White Hats.  The start date for Tier 4B, US, could be any time between now and Monday 13 April, dependent on the three days of darkness from 7-9 April.  The military, National Guard, and Special Operation troops were rescuing child victims of trafficking out of tunnels beneath major US cities.  President Trump and his Q-team were stopping eugenics, baby-making, trafficking, sex slaves, body parts, and cannibalism.  Trump had agreed that the RV, GCR funds for all tiers would parallel the stimulus package in one unique system for good.  Stimulus checks and paycheck protection program payments were going out.  A worldwide fast on Good Friday the 10th of April was called for relief from the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Thousands of horrifically abused children were being rescued by military personnel from cabal tunnels across the US and into Canada and Mexico.  The Pentagon pedophile task force has been involved in child rescue operations since 2017, attacking drug and child trafficking in South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.  The elite own homes in the Caribbean, Epstein Island, and were doing slow exposure on child trafficking.

Today, I want to talk about the American Silver Eagle and the current silver shortage. The spot price of silver is around $28, but the premiums on Silver Eagles are through the roof, with some sites selling them for $37-$41 each. I believe this is due to a mining shortage, as many mines have shut down, reducing the amount of silver being mined and minted.  Another reason for the high premiums is the upcoming design change for the Silver Eagle, which will make the 2020 coins more valuable. Additionally, the 2020 date has become a kind of \"survival badge,\" making coins from that year more desirable.  To mitigate the high premiums, I've been focusing on generic silver and 90% silver, such as rounds, bars, and coins like half dollars, quarters, and dimes. These alternatives have lower premiums and can be used to break down a troy ounce of silver into smaller denominations.  For example, three 90% silver half dollars equate to a troy ounce of silver, while six quarters or 14 dimes do the same. This allows you to buy smaller amounts of silver at a lower premium, making it a more affordable option.  I'm not a financial advisor, and this is all for entertainment purposes. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the Silver Eagle and the current market conditions. Do you think the design change and the 2020 date are contributing to the high premiums? Have you found any alternative ways to stack silver at a lower premium? Let me know in the comments below.

In a Senate hearing, he said spying on a political campaign is a big deal.  The FBI sent an investigator posing as an assistant to meet with Trump aide Papadopoulos in 2016.  They used a salacious, unverified dossier to spy on Carter Page, lying to the FISA court 17 times.  The Obama-Biden DOJ opened the investigation without basis, and the Inspector General's report outlined the lies told to the court.  The administration's goal was to stop Trump from winning, as shown in Peter Strzok's notes.  After Trump won, they went after Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to cover up their actions.  They unmasked Flynn's name 49 times between election day and inauguration day.  Flynn resigned on February 13th, and the cover-up was complete.  However, when President Trump fired Jim Comey, the cover-up was threatened.  Comey leaked his memos to get a special counsel appointed, leading to a two-year investigation that found nothing.  Now, the Attorney General is being attacked for having the courage to state the truth about the spying.  He is being thanked for defending law enforcement and standing up for the rule of law.\nDocument 30\nHost: Welcome to the Times of Industry show, I'm joined by Charles U. Smith from twominds.com. We'll discuss the coronavirus, supply chains, markets, bonds, and precious metals.  Charles: The origin of the coronavirus is difficult to trace due to its rapid mutation rate. The Chinese authorities and scientists have sequenced the genome, but it's challenging to identify its exact source.  Host: Why is the global supply chain so fragile? Charles: The supply chain has been optimized for perfection, but this has led to a lack of redundancy and alternative sources. When a disruption occurs, it can have a ripple effect, impacting multiple layers of the supply chain.  Host: Do you think quarantining 400 million people in China was the right decision? Charles: It's hard to judge with partial information, but it's possible that the Chinese authorities made the decision based on facts that weren't known to the rest of the world.  Host: Why did gold and silver rally hard, then sell off hard into the weekend? Charles: The metals are prone to huge sell-offs, possibly due to intervention from authorities who don't want the signal to go out that things are not right with the world.  Host: What does the Fed's rate cut mean for real estate and the stock market? Charles: The 10-year treasury bond now yields 1.06%, the lowest of all time. This could signal a reflation era, and the Fed's rate cut may lead to a permanent flow into precious metals and dollar-denominated bonds.\nDocument 31\nHello everyone, I'm Dr. Dave Chanda, and welcome back to Dave versus the MSM. Today, we're discussing President Trump's State of the Union speech versus Nancy Pelosi's temper tantrum. Before we dive in, I want to invite you to join our radio show every Sunday from 2 to 5 Eastern, where we'll be discussing the Iowa caucus and more. You can stream it live for free at DaveJanda.com.  President Trump's speech was a portrait of what makes America great, highlighting individuals who embody the country's values. He honored a woman who was murdered by al-Baghdadi, a little girl born at 21 weeks, and a young boy who dreams of exploring space. He also highlighted a family reunited, a radio icon, and a man who changed his life around after serving in the military.  In contrast, Nancy Pelosi's reaction was a display of the deep state's true feelings about America and its people. She tore up President Trump's speech, claiming it was the \"courteous thing to do.\" However, this stunt may lead to a backlash that the deep state never anticipated. I predict that President Trump will win a landslide reelection in November, and the House will flip to freedom-loving individuals.  It's time for us to stand up and network the facts to anyone and everyone we know about those who support freedom and those who oppose it. Join us this Sunday on Operation Freedom, and consider subscribing to our channel for exclusive content. Thank you for your time, and remember to dream big and dare to fail.\nDocument 32\nWelcome to the Daily Injection Program, show number seven. Today's topics include an upcoming interview with Ron Paul, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the economy. The host debates whether the current market is a bear market, considering factors such as the potential for mini rallies and liquidity issues. He also discusses the importance of thinking about opportunities in the market, depending on age and risk tolerance.  The host highlights the risks involved in the pandemic, including a resurgence in China and Europe's handling of the situation. However, he also notes the federal government and the Federal Reserve's efforts to address the crisis. He suggests that the market may not be as bad as it seems, with low oil prices and potential for a V-shaped recovery.  The host also discusses restrictions on corporate America, including buybacks, which he believes will be problematic. He suggests that younger investors may benefit from buying shares of great companies when they're not rallying, while older investors may need to look at other ways to create income from their portfolio.  Additionally, the host talks about gold and silver shortages, with banks defaulting on physical deliveries. He suggests that mining stocks look good, especially with mines shutting down around the world. He recommends checking out the gold playbook on wealthresearchgroup.com for more information.  The host also discusses nibbling, or buying stocks in companies that are minimally affected by the coronavirus. He suggests focusing on companies that are well-known and have a good track record, and starting to nibble on them.  Finally, the host talks about the Easter deadline set by Trump, which he believes is a good psychological boost for the economy. He suggests that the country should focus on state-by-state and municipality-by-municipality restrictions, rather than a nationwide lockdown. He also notes that Trump's approval ratings are moving up, which could be beneficial for businesses and the economy.  The host concludes by expressing appreciation for the current state of\nDocument 33\nToday's episode of If You Only Knew is titled \"Think Optics, Think Awakening the People, Justice is Coming.\" The episode starts with updates on the headlines, including Ghislaine Maxwell's court date being postponed and the release of documents related to her sex life.   The host, Richard, discusses the potential running mate for Joe Biden, speculating that it won't be Kamala Harris due to her poor numbers. He also talks about Trader Joe's standing up to the woke mob and not changing their product names.  Richard then discusses the recent violence in Chicago and the discovery that most stolen guns are coming from Illinois. He also mentions the residents of Minneapolis patrolling their own neighborhoods as the city moves to defund the police.  The host talks about the recent Barr hearing, where the Attorney General was questioned about the Durham investigation and the unmasking of Michael Flynn. He also mentions the release of FBI texts from Andrew McCabe and the potential exposure of Peter Strzok.  Richard discusses the censorship of the Frontline Doctors video and how it has been re-uploaded and shared millions of times on social media. He also talks about the big tech hearing on Capitol Hill, where Jack Dorsey was a no-show and Google denied blacklisting or shadow banning.  The host speculates that the president's order to discourage further censorship by preventing the altering of free speech of users and limiting protection from lawsuits under Section 230 is a step in the right direction.  Richard then discusses the topic of the episode, \"Think Optics, Think Awakening the People, Justice is Coming.\" He believes that everything is a movie and that the patriots are in control, directing the events to make sure that the truth comes to light at the right time.  The host talks about the release of more potentially damning information from the Maxwell case and the conclusion of the Durham and multiple other investigations, which will lead to indictments. He also mentions\nDocument 34\nA hospital employee in Florida reported that their hospital system is preparing for a COVID crisis, expecting to convert part of the anesthesia recovery unit into a COVID patient ward. The employee expressed frustration and concern, questioning the sudden announcement and the potential impact on their work.

They mention that Justin Trudeau was recently in the news in Mexico, with reports suggesting he's under arrest. The creator claims to have sensitive information about Trudeau but is getting shadow-banned on YouTube for sharing the truth.   They also discuss Nassera Jassera, suggesting viewers watch the video \"Changes on the Horizon\" by James Rank for more information. The creator is working on a video to break down the backstory of Jassera's situation legally and financially.   The creator shares that they've been getting shadow-banned for sharing information and have to be cautious about what they say locally. They mention that they've received tips from people in their city and are trying to create more research-based content.   The video creator also discusses other topics, including Robert Kennedy's alleged hint about JFK Jr.'s possible survival, President Trump's USMCA Act, and potential big arrests happening soon. They express hope for a big arrest next week and mention the Maxwell and Teresa connection.\nDocument 36\nBeloved brothers and sisters, I'm Adamus Saint Germain, and I'm here to share crucial information about the current state of Earth. President Trump is working to implement NASARA in the US and JASARA globally, with the help of the Galactic Federation, Ascended Masters, and the BRICS Alliance. The US military has rescued over 500,000 children from the satanic elite and restored the Republic in the US, returning to the original Constitution. A new coin will be produced by the US Treasury, and other countries will soon deploy Jisara, leading to a single digital currency backed by real wealth.  The quantum financial system, already working, will prevent the cabal from hacking or stealing from citizens. Everyone will have control over their accounts, and the system will detect and block any fraudulent transactions. The cabal's strength is fading, and their attempts to cause chaos are failing. Every day, there are more arrests, and most of the planetary elite is already behind bars.  A new era is coming, where everyone will have enough to live comfortably, and there will be no poverty, hunger, or sickness. The role of banks will change, and all bank debts will be forgiven. Mortgage and credit card debts will also be cancelled, and water, light, and heating bills will be removed due to free energy patents. Income tax will be eliminated, and a single tax of 14% will be applied to consumer goods.  Replicating machines will be available, allowing people to instantly replicate food, clothing, and other necessities. Earth will become a galactic society, and people will live in harmony, free from fear and low vibrations. The planet is moving into the fifth dimension, and every human will regain their freedom and live a prosperous, happy life.\nDocument 37\nThe video discusses the speaker's struggles with conflicting stories and the chaos in the world. They mention listening to a two-hour conversation with Laura Eisenhower and Cyrus A. Parsons about the Second Wave Extinction, AI, ETs, and the Force, but found no clarity. The speaker also shares a video of Ravi Zacharias speaking at the Mormon Tabernacle, highlighting his struggles with suicidal thoughts and the importance of finding answers within oneself.  The speaker expresses frustration with the current state of the world, citing a criminal running for president, mainstream news lying, and riots breaking out. They mention the concept of \"hopium\" and the idea that people are holding onto the hope that something will make sense in their lifetime.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of separating the \"in here\" and \"out there,\" suggesting that they are interconnected and that people are seeing conflicting realities. They also discuss the idea of med beds that can turn back the clock and rejuvenate the body, as well as the issue of doctors not making people well and lawyers not bringing justice.  The speaker criticizes the elite for protecting their own and mentions reports of crisis actors and clones of public figures. They express concern about the riots and the lack of self-protection in rural areas, particularly in Illinois.

The group then discusses silver, highlighting a beautiful chart showing the manipulation of the silver market. They explain that the COMEX has dumped 13.5 billion ounces of electronic silver contracts on the market, but the price has barely moved. This is unprecedented and a sign that the manipulation is ending.  The host emphasizes the importance of getting physical silver, as it's the only way to break the manipulation. He recommends buying small denominations, pre-65 coinage, and one-ounce rounds, as they'll be easier to sell when the price rises.  The group also discusses Warren Buffett, who has been buying gold and selling banks. They believe he's part of the Silver Army, working to destroy the banking cabal. The host references his research on The Wizard of Oz, which he believes is a metaphor for the silver standard.  The host concludes by emphasizing the importance of getting physical silver and joining the fight against the bankers. He believes that silver will free humanity from the unbacked fiat money system and that the price will rise to a one-to-one ratio with gold.\nDocument 39\nHello, I'm Chris Marcus from Arcadia Economics. Today, I'm excited to share that my book, \"The Big Silver Short,\" is now available in paperback form on Amazon. The book explores how Wall Street banks manipulated the silver market, setting the stage for a massive short squeeze.   The book features interviews with experts like Ted Butler, Andrew McGuire, and Bart Chilton, who confirmed that JP Morgan took over Bear Stearns' silver position, exceeding the allowed limit. This manipulation occurred during the 2008 financial crisis, when silver prices plummeted from $21 to $9, and a physical shortage of silver was reported.  The book also includes insights from Rick Rule and David Morgan, a renowned silver expert. I want to thank everyone for their support, which has allowed us to bring this book to life. I believe it can help prepare investors for the challenges ahead, and I encourage you to get your copy now.\nDocument 40\nHello everyone, I'm Deb with Truthfication Chronicles. Today, I want to discuss the recent Trump rallies and the surprising number of Democrats attending. In Arizona, 67,000 tickets were issued, with 29,000 voters identified, and 87% were from Arizona. 18% of attendees were Democrats, showing a significant shift in party loyalty. Similar numbers were seen in Colorado, with 71,000 tickets and 38,790 voters identified, 94% from Colorado.   However, not everyone is switching parties. Clint Eastwood is supporting Michael Bloomberg, and Dick Van Dyke is backing Bernie Sanders. This has left many fans stunned, especially considering their past associations.   A more concerning topic is the death of Phil Haney, a DHS whistleblower who passed away on February 22nd. There are conflicting reports on the cause of death, with some claiming it was self-inflicted. Haney was a key figure in exposing the Obama administration's actions, and his death has left many questioning the circumstances.   I want to share an article from The Hill, which details Haney's claims of being ordered to scrub records of Muslims with terror ties. This is a must-read, and I encourage you to take the time to understand the implications. Thank you for stopping by, and I'll see you later.\nDocument 41\nThe video discusses potential charges against individuals involved in the alleged coup against President Trump. A California sheriff, Mike Boudreau, has stated that he will not cite people for violating the stay-at-home order, as his focus should be on true criminals. The host, Deb, agrees that the stay-at-home order is unconstitutional and that law enforcement officers should prioritize real crimes.  The video also mentions a list of potential charges against high-ranking officials, including John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Sally Yates, Loretta Lynch, and Bruce Ohr. According to the list, they may face charges such as conspiracy to overthrow the government, lying to Congress, and perjury. The host notes that these charges could result in significant prison time, potentially up to 70 or 80 years.  The video also discusses the possibility of treason charges, which could carry the death penalty. The host suggests that several individuals on the list may deserve treason charges, but only John Brennan has been specifically mentioned as facing this charge.  The host also mentions a comment from William Barr, who stated that he has not seen evidence to charge Obama or Biden with any crimes. The host believes that there was a plan to take out Trump and that Sally Yates' memo was delayed until after Trump's inauguration.  The video concludes by discussing the potential for arrests and trials, with the host suggesting that the first arrest may be a surprise and that the case may be moved to a military court due to the nature of the crimes. The host encourages viewers to stay informed and to be prepared for a potentially significant development in the near future.\nDocument 42\nThe speaker discusses a leaked document allegedly from the World Health Organization (WHO) that outlines a plan to create a pandemic and use it as a pretext for a one-world government. The document, known as Operation Firesign, suggests using a fake alien invasion or a massive floating city to unite the world against an outside threat. The speaker believes that the WHO and other globalist organizations are using the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve this goal.  The speaker points out that the pandemic has been used to distract from other issues, such as the impeachment of President Trump, and to alter the debate structure and public aid in exchange for the Green New Deal. They also suggest that the pandemic is being used to hold hostage public aid and to appease radical leftists.  The speaker also discusses the benefits of keeping the public in mass hysteria, including the ability to alter voting and to produce voter fraud through mail-in votes. They point out that the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths are being inflated, and that the media is being used to panic the public.  The speaker also mentions the Durham report, which was supposed to be released but has been delayed, and suggests that the WHO and other globalist organizations are using the pandemic to distract from this report.  The speaker concludes by saying that the pandemic is a scam and that people are waking up to the truth. They believe that the globalist organizations are overplaying their hand and that people are seeing through their scams. The speaker encourages people to take action and to resist the tyranny of the one-world government.\nDocument 43\nThe speaker expresses frustration with the new normal of social distancing and lockdowns, feeling that it's a form of imprisonment. They question the science behind the measures, pointing out that the numbers of potential deaths from COVID-19 are inconsistent and that the lockdown policies are not supported by evidence. They argue that the lockdowns are illogical, citing Sweden's approach as an example, where life is almost normal despite not having a lockdown.  The speaker criticizes the mainstream media for promoting a narrative that is not supported by data and for not discussing the negative consequences of lockdowns, such as the impact on non-COVID related deaths, child abuse, and loss of revenue. They also question the motives of scientists who are promoting the lockdowns, suggesting that they may be influenced by funding and fame.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence, particularly when it comes to new information. They argue that the definition of science is the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment, and that the current measures do not align with this definition.  The speaker also criticizes the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for their handling of COVID-19 data, pointing out that they count both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 as deaths, which can lead to an overestimation of the real death numbers.  The speaker concludes by emphasizing the need for an open and honest discussion about the lockdowns and the science behind them, and for a platform where scientists can share their findings and discuss the issues in an open dialogue. They also express concern about the potential for a second wave of COVID-19 and the impact it could have on the economy and society.\nDocument 44\nJoe Biden recalled his experience in Ukraine, where he convinced the team to provide a billion-dollar loan guarantee. However, he was met with resistance when he demanded that the state prosecutor be fired. Biden threatened to leave Ukraine in six hours if the prosecutor wasn't fired, and eventually, the prosecutor was removed. The question of whether the prosecutor was fired in exchange for a billion-dollar loan guarantee has been raised, with some suggesting that Joe Biden may have been involved in a quid pro quo.\nDocument 45\nEric Marquez, also known as the kingpin of child porn, ran a hosting service for numerous dark web child pornography and exploitation sites. An FBI investigation revealed that his hosting service had over 8.5 million photographs and videos of child exploitation. Marquez's Freedom Hosting Service was a massive hub for child abuse material, with over 500 servers in Europe and providing anonymity to sites like Pedo Empire and Lolita City.  The FBI investigated Marquez's service after a 2011 operation by Anonymous took down 40 sites trading in child abuse images, including Lolita City. The FBI discovered thousands of images and videos depicting child abuse, including bondage, bestiality, and torture. Marquez attempted to shield his service from liability with a warning on the homepage, but investigators found that he had control over the sites and knew of the child pornography content.  Marquez was apprehended in 2013 and remained in custody in Ireland for six years while fighting extradition to the United States. He was finally extradited in 2019 and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to advertise child abuse images in 2020. He faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum of 30 years possible, with prosecutors seeking a sentence of 15 to 21 years.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Politics and Censorship (Document: 40, 41): Discusses the potential impact of politics on censorship and the importance of resisting it.\n    [2] Tyranny (Document: 42): Criticizes the potential for a one-world government and the importance of resisting tyranny.\n    [2] Election (Document: 40, 44): Discusses the election process and potential candidates.\n    [2] Treason (Document: 41): Discusses the possibility of treason charges against high-ranking officials.\n    [2] Child Exploitation (Document: 45): Discusses the hosting service for numerous dark web child pornography and exploitation sites.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 40, 44): Mentions corruption within the government, including potential quid pro quo.\n    [2] Pandemic (Document: 42, 43): Discusses the COVID-19 pandemic and potential lockdowns.\n    [2] Law Enforcement (Document: 41): Discusses the role of law enforcement and potential charges against high-ranking officials.\n    [2] Media Control (Document: 40, 41): Criticizes the mainstream media for promoting a narrative that is not supported by data and the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence.\n    [2] Crime (Document: 41, 45): Discusses potential charges against high-ranking officials and a hosting service for child exploitation.\n    [2] Social Distancing (Document: 43): Criticizes the new normal of social distancing and lockdowns.\n    [2] Censorship (Document: 40, 41): Discusses the potential for censorship and the importance of resisting it.\n    [2] Politics and Health (Document: 44): Discusses the potential impact of politics on health and the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence.\n    [2] Mainstream News (Document: 40, 41): Criticizes the mainstream media for promoting a narrative that is not supported by data.\n    [2] Globalism (Document: 42): Discusses the potential for a one-world government and the importance of resisting it.\n    [2] Politics and Globalism (Document: 42): Discusses the potential impact of politics on globalism and the importance of resisting it.\n    [2] Freedom (Document: 42): Discusses the importance of freedom and the potential for a one-world government.\n    [2] Economy (Document: 43): Discusses the potential impact of the pandemic on the economy and society.\n    [2] Vaccination (Document: 43): Discusses the potential for a second wave of COVID-19 and the impact it could have on the economy and society.\n    [2] Politics and Media (Document: 40, 41): Discusses the potential impact of politics on the media and the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence.\n    [2] Whistleblowers (Document: 40): Mentions a whistleblower who passed away under suspicious circumstances.\n    [2] Politics and Economy (Document: 44): Discusses the potential impact of politics on the economy and society.\n    [2] Politics and Propaganda (Document: 42): Discusses the potential impact of politics on propaganda and the importance of resisting it.\n    [2] Science (Document: 43): Criticizes the mainstream media for promoting a narrative that is not supported by data and the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence.\n    [2] World Order (Document: 42): Discusses the potential for a one-world government and the importance of resisting it.\n    [2] Propaganda (Document: 42): Criticizes the potential for propaganda and the importance of resisting it.\n    [2] Politics and Propaganda (Document: 42\n    [2] World Health Organization (Document: 42): Criticizes the WHO for their handling of the pandemic and potential one-world government.\n    [2] Health (Document: 43): Discusses the potential impact of the pandemic on health and the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence.\n    [2] Politics and Science (Document: 43): Discusses the potential impact of politics on science and the importance of examining and scrutinizing scientific evidence."}
{"summary":"Document 46\nLinda Forsyth from See Vine, We the People, shares exciting news about potential developments at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She had a conversation with Ron Fleissvig, the media officer for Gitmo, who mentioned that there's been a lot of activity, but couldn't discuss it until the next day. Forsyth then checked the Office of Military Commissions website, which provides information on ongoing cases, press releases, and transcripts.  She found that the calendars for Sheikh Mohammed's hearings were all canceled, but there were some new developments, including a government notice on the qualifications of Lieutenant Colonel Matthew N. McCall to serve as a military commission's judge. This is significant because Judge Cohen, who was set to preside over the 9\/11 tribunals, quit suddenly in January 2020, citing concerns about protecting his family.  Forsyth believes that the recent movement at Gitmo might be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming election. She plans to discuss this further with Ron Fleissvig tomorrow and will share the update with her audience.  Additionally, Forsyth mentions some breaking news on the Bobulinski whistleblower case, including the recovery of lost documents and Hunter Biden email revelations. She encourages her audience to visit the c-vine.com website daily and participate in discussions by posting comments.  Forsyth also shares a personal story about a moderator who was blocked from the website and is seeking help from Ron Osk, a Seavine attorney, who has sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg and other officials regarding freedom of speech violations on Facebook.\nDocument 47\nChris Marcus from Arcadia Economics discusses a significant development in the silver market. JP Morgan has posted 30 million ounces of silver for delivery, which is a substantial amount considering they had zero ounces in their warehouse after the 2011 price crash. This move is seen as a major shift in the market, with some speculating that JP Morgan may be committing to deliver the metal or attempting to fleece customers.  According to the CME Group report, JP Morgan's total silver holdings are now at 160 million ounces, with 6,000 contracts scheduled for delivery. This is a significant increase from previous years, with the average delivery month for COMEX Gold typically seeing between 6,000 to 10,000 deliveries.  David Morgan, a well-known figure in the silver world, expressed skepticism about the delivery, stating that he'll believe it when he sees the metal leave the warehouse. However, Craig Hemke, a prominent analyst, believes that JP Morgan has committed to delivering the metal, citing the significant increase in deliveries.  The development has sparked speculation about the potential impact on the silver market, with some seeing it as a bullish sign for the price of silver.\nDocument 48\nThe video is an update from a person who has been involved in exposing corruption, particularly within the World Bank and the banking system. They mention being poisoned by arsenic and recovering, but also being physically attacked. They claim to be standing in for everyone who is tired of corruption and want to make a change.  The person explains that they have been working with a large group of people, estimated to be around 15 million, and that they are in a different reality due to their understanding of the corruption. They mention that they are in a relationship with everyone and that they are working together to cut off the money supply to the banking cartel, which includes Wall Street and the black nobility.  The person shares their experience working at the World Bank, where they were part of the legal department for over 20 years. They mention that they were reinstated by Eugene Myakov, the then-executive director for Norway, and that they have given documents to show that everyone understood that things were corrupt.  They also discuss the real history of the world, claiming that Christopher Columbus did not discover the United States, but rather ancient traders who were part of a culture that went back thousands of years. They mention that the elites erased this history and that our history books are not accurate.  The person mentions that they have been educated and have come to understand the corruption, and that they have been working with whistleblowers and others to expose the truth. They mention a model developed by a political scientist, Jacek Kugler, which predicts that the chances of ending corruption are over 90%.  They conclude by saying that the dominoes are in place and that it will take time for the corruption to be exposed and ended. They emphasize that they are not alone and that there are many people working together to make a change.\nDocument 49\nA YouTube video discusses the alleged cover-up of child crime by the Clinton administration. The video's creator claims that FBI records show James Comey had five folders labeled \"child crime\" in 2017. Comey's notes from the Whitewater case also mention Anthony Weiner's crime against a 15-year-old and Hillary Clinton's involvement in a crime against children. The video also mentions Ghislaine Maxwell's nephew working for Hillary Clinton at the State Department and a 2013 report that she covered up pedophilia charges while in office.  The video references a 2018 Department of Justice OIG report that mentioned Weiner's crime against a minor and Hillary Clinton's involvement in a crime against children. It also mentions a 2013 NBC News report that Hillary Clinton covered up pedophilia charges while in the State Department.  The video also discusses a 2013 report that Laura Silsby, a friend of the Clintons, was arrested for trying to take 33 Haitian children out of Haiti after the earthquake. Silsby later got a job at a company that makes Amber Alert technology.  The video concludes by mentioning Jeffrey Epstein's donation to the Clinton's White House Oval Office and the disturbing pattern of behavior by the Clintons. The creator thanks their Patreon and PayPal supporters and encourages viewers to check out their backup channel for extra content.\nDocument 50\nChris Marcus from Arcadia Economics is joined by Andy Sheckman from Miles Franklin to discuss the current state of the precious metals market. They agree that the Federal Reserve's actions, including printing unlimited money and considering negative interest rates, will lead to inflation and a strong future for precious metals. Andy notes that the concept of pushing on a string comes to mind, as the Fed is forcing people into speculation and killing savers.  The duo discusses the current market conditions, with Andy stating that the 10-year bond is already negative due to the Fed's inflation mandate. They also talk about the potential for a stock market and bond market crash, coupled with a second wave of COVID-19, which could lead to a lack of safe places to put money.  Andy expresses his concern about the availability of precious metals, citing the fractured supply chain and the potential for delivery delays. He notes that the premiums for Silver Eagles have come down slightly, but are still higher than normal, ranging from $7 to $7.25 over spot. Gold Eagles have also seen a decrease in premiums, from 10-10.5% to 8.75%.  Chris and Andy agree that the current market is a unique time, with a quiet before the storm, and that precious metals are a safe haven in this environment. Andy predicts that gold will be well north of $2000 by the end of the year, and that silver is the most undervalued commodity on the planet.  The conversation concludes with Andy providing information on how to contact Miles Franklin for pricing and information on precious metals products, and Chris thanking Andy for the update.\nDocument 51\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles shares a remarkable moment from the House floor where Rep. Louie Gohmert presented a resolution to address the historical stigma of slavery in the US Capitol. Gohmert's resolution aims to remove items that symbolize or mention any political organization or party that supported slavery or the Confederacy. He lists the Democrat Party's anti-black and pro-slavery platforms, including their support for the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and the 14th Amendment.  Gohmert's resolution also calls for the Democrat Party to change its name or be barred from participation in the House of Representatives due to its history of supporting slavery and racism. He highlights the party's connection to the Ku Klux Klan, citing Senator Robert Byrd as a recruiter and a member of the party.  Deb praises Gohmert's move, calling it \"brilliant\" and \"a real problem\" for the Democrats. She emphasizes that the parties did not switch, and the Democrats want to keep saying that to cover up their history of racism. Deb encourages viewers to share the information and support Gohmert's efforts to expose the truth.  The resolution is unlikely to pass, but it has been recorded in the congressional record, and Deb sees it as a significant move in exposing the Democrat Party's history of racism. She encourages viewers to contact Gohmert and express their support for his efforts to bring truth to the American people.\nDocument 52\nThe Tonight Show host welcomed John F. Kennedy Jr. as a guest, discussing his new book, \"The Book of Political Lists,\" which features humorous and interesting facts about politics. Kennedy Jr. talked about his experience being portrayed on Seinfeld and how it led to people recognizing him on the street. He also discussed his life in politics, stating that he might not run for office due to the challenges and rewards of the profession.  The conversation shifted to the magazine, George, which Kennedy Jr. edits, and how it approaches politics with a humorous angle. He mentioned that the magazine has tried to get him on the cover, and they have a picture of him that they might use. The host brought up a controversy surrounding a picture of Kennedy Jr. in the magazine, which some people thought was him naked, but he clarified that he was wearing pants and shoes.  The discussion then turned to a poem written by Monica Lewinsky in the ninth grade, which was included in the book. The host and Kennedy Jr. shared a sample of the poem, which was a humorous and poignant reflection on her life.  Kennedy Jr. talked about his favorite lists in the book, including the code names of presidents and Jimmy Carter's favorite desserts. He also mentioned Victoria Woodhull, a woman who ran for president in 1872 and was a free love candidate.  The host then shared a personal story about how he was affected by the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. and how it brought back memories of his mother crying when he was a kid. He talked about how it was a full-circle moment and how he felt a connection to Kennedy Jr.  The conversation ended with the host thanking Kennedy Jr. for coming on the show and sharing his stories.\nDocument 53\nThe 1619 Project aims to reframe American history by examining the country's origin story and addressing systemic racism. The project has sparked conversations and inspired events like the 1619 Project Brunch.   In other news, the NFL's Washington team is retiring its controversial nickname, and the Aunt Jemima brand is being erased due to its racist connotations. Uncle Ben's Rice is also getting a new brand identity. The Phoenix City Council has voted to change the names of streets deemed offensive.  Publishers are reimagining classic novels with diverse characters, and Twitter is dropping programming terms like \"master\" and \"slave\" from its code. Merriam-Webster has updated its definition of \"sexual preference\" to be more inclusive.  A 15-year-old girl from Louisiana expresses her frustration with her family's views on racism and police brutality, comparing Trump to Hitler. A Harvard study found no racial bias in police shootings, but another study showed that cops are 18 times more likely to be killed than unarmed black men.  The conversation turns to the gender wage gap, with one person suggesting that businesses should pay women equally to attract more female employees. However, others argue that this approach could lead to gentrification and displacement of low-income communities.  The topic of cancel culture is also discussed, with one person cautioning that social media posts can have long-lasting consequences and affect one's professional image. Cancel culture is defined as a form of boycott or public shaming of individuals who share questionable or unpopular opinions.\nDocument 54\nGood afternoon, I'm Katanya Alvin, and I'm back with a new video after a long break. I've been doing research and have a six-part series in the pipeline, but I wanted to upload a quick video before the elections. As you know, the outcome of the US presidential election is still uncertain due to allegations of fraud. The General Services Administration (GSA) has stated that there will be no transfer of power until a clear constitutional winner is decided.  I'd like to discuss the \"Hammer\" software, which was used in several states to potentially flip votes and steal the election. This software was designed by the NSA and adopted by the CIA under the Obama administration. It's a sophisticated system that can change votes at a certain point in the voting stream, and it was used in the 2012 election in Florida.  The Obama administration used this system to monitor foreign enemies, but it was later adopted for use in the US, which is illegal. The CIA cannot look at US citizens, but the software was used to spy on them. This is a serious issue, and it's essential that we understand the extent of this surveillance.  General McInerney, a highly respected Air Force officer, has spoken out about the Hammer software and its capabilities. He explained that it was initially designed for foreign surveillance but was later adopted for use in the US. The software can switch 3% of votes, which is a significant amount.  The Democratic Party has been accused of using this software to steal the election, and there are allegations of bribery and corruption. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been involved in this scandal, and it's believed that they're using Hunter Biden to gain influence in the US.  The CCP has sent a message to the Democratic Party, stating that they have evidence of their crimes and that they must win the election at all costs. This is a serious\nDocument 55\nToday's episode of \"If You Only Knew\" is titled \"Deep State Checkmate: Rig for Red, Keep Charging Midnight Riders.\" The host, Richard, shares exciting news about his affiliation with \"If You Only Knew CBD,\" a leading USA-made CBD brand. He then dives into the week's headlines, including the rescue of five missing children and 262 suspects in Operation Triple Beam OKC, and the FBI's raid on the home of a Netflix star accused of child abuse.  Richard also discusses the media's failed attempt to attribute wildfires to climate change, instead pointing to 14 individuals arrested for arson. He highlights the bravery of a 1,200-strong volunteer fire brigade and the media's reluctance to cover the story. Additionally, he touches on the topic of space, mentioning China and Russia's energy weapons in space and the potential for clean nuclear fusion driven power.  The host also discusses the panic among the deep state, the mainstream media, and the Democrats as investigations into Durham and other cases progress. He notes the silence of big tech and the MSM on these stories, as well as the public's growing distrust of big tech. Richard also shares a poll showing a 10-point drop in support for BLM and a Fox poll showing more voters consider the unrest as riots rather than protests.  He then discusses the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the potential for chaos after the elections. Richard believes the deep state and the Dems are planning to cause chaos and manipulate the public. He notes the timing of Ginsburg's passing and the subsequent threats of violence and unrest from liberals.  The host concludes by saying that the narrative is running out of moves and the deep state is boxed in. He encourages viewers to support the channel and shares a link to \"If You Only Knew CBD.\" He ends the video with a humorous segment about Nancy Pelosi getting \"set up\" by a beauty salon owner.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Racism (Document: 51, 53): Discusses the history of racism and its impact on society.\n    [2] Politics and COVID-19 Pandemic (Document: 46): Discusses the impact of politics on the COVID-19 pandemic.\n    [2] Politics and Crime (Document: 49): Examines the relationship between politics and crime.\n    [2] Politics and Censorship (Document: 53): Discusses the impact of censorship on politics.\n    [2] Politics and Science (Document: 53): Discuss\n    [2] Politics and Freedom (Document: 46): Examines the relationship between politics and freedom.\n    [2] Election (Document: 54): Discusses the US presidential election and allegations of fraud.\n    [2] Politics and Propaganda (Document: 53): Examines the use of propaganda in politics.\n    [2] Politics and Social Issues (Document: 53): Discusses the impact of politics on social issues.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 55): Mentions the deep state and its alleged involvement in various scandals.\n    [2] Politics and Globalism (Document: 53): Discusses the impact of globalism on politics.\n    [2] Politics and Corruption Probe (Document: 46): Examines the relationship between politics and corruption probe.\n    [2] Politics and Supply Chain (Document: 46): Discusses the impact of politics on the supply chain.\n    [2] Politics and Censorship (Document: 53): Examines the impact of censorship on politics.\n    [2] Politics and Social Distancing (Document: 46): Examines the relationship between politics and social distancing.\n    [2] Politics and Education (Document: 53): Discusses the impact of politics on education.\n    [2] Politics and Human Rights (Document: 53): Discusses the impact of politics on human rights.\n    [2] Politics and Law Enforcement (Document: 48): Discusses the relationship between politics and law enforcement.\n    [2] Politics and Law Enforcement (Document: 48): Examines the relationship between politics and law enforcement.\n    [2] Politics and Science (Document: 53): Discusses the impact of politics on science.\n    [2] Politics and Media (Document: 46, 52): Examines the relationship between politics and media.\n    [2] Politics and Mainstream News (Document: 46): Discusses the impact of politics on mainstream news.\n    [2] Politics and Foreign Policy (Document: 53): Examines the relationship between politics and foreign policy.\n    [2] Politics and Tyranny (Document: 48): Discusses the impact of politics on tyranny.\n    [2] Politics and Media Control (Document: 46): Discusses the impact of politics on media control.\n    [2] Cancel Culture (Document: 53): Discusses the concept of cancel culture and its impact on society.\n    [2] Politics and Culture (Document: 53): Examines the relationship between politics and culture.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 46, 48, 54): Mentions corruption within the government and institutions.\n    [2] Politics and Constitutional Rights (Document: 46): Examines the relationship between politics and constitutional rights.\n    [2] Politics and Economy (Document: 50): Examines the relationship between politics and the economy.\n    [2] Politics and Technology (Document: 54): Discusses the impact of technology on politics.\n    [2] Politics and Science (Document: 53): Examines the relationship between politics and science.\n    [2] Politics and History (Document: 53): Examines the relationship between politics and history.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 46): Discusses the impact of politics on reality.\n    [2] Politics and Immortality (Document: 46): Examines the relationship between politics and immortality.\n    [2] Politics and Crime (Document: 49): Discusses the impact of politics on crime."}
{"summary":"Document 56\nThe YouTuber claims to have exclusive information about the Trump family, specifically referencing the Gunner's Wife channel's lip-read decodes. They point out a coded message from Melania Trump during the Trumps' departure from the White House. The message appears to be a warning, with Melania saying \"I know we can see through the stone. Pretty soon be the Punisher. It's soon.\" The YouTuber believes this message is a sign of impending action, possibly related to the Plundon's urgency. They also mention a thumbs-up gesture from Trump, which they interpret as a sign of approval. The video ends with a call to action, urging viewers to stay tuned and follow the YouTuber on Twitter.\nDocument 57\nThe speaker emphasizes the importance of being prepared for the day of exchange, not just exchanging currency but also multiplying investments. They highlight several obstacles that may arise, including:  *   Internet outages and website downtime *   Bank closures or long lines *   Limited access to foreign currency exchange *   Security breaches and fraud *   Trading platform downtime  To overcome these obstacles, the speaker recommends:  *   Having multiple bank accounts and credit cards *   Researching and identifying reliable banks and trading platforms *   Having a backup plan for internet access and website availability *   Being prepared to call in to work or take time off *   Having a plan for investing in the stock market and other opportunities  The speaker also emphasizes the importance of being prepared to act quickly on the day of exchange, as some people may only have six hours to exchange their currency and make purchases. They encourage listeners to be prepared and have all the necessary information and resources in place to maximize their investments.\nDocument 58\nIn 2012, I alerted the Federal Elections Commission and all 50 state elections commissions about the electoral college vote fraud. I syntaxed the laws and corrected the statement of candidacy, making the candidate a fact. The Federal Elections Commission's guidelines were null and void as of 1999, and the Constitution was the bankruptcy guideline. I rewrote the statement of candidacy, making the candidate a fact, and changed the fabric of the system.  I became the Postmaster General of Washington, D.C. in 2000 and filed a charter vessel Constitution, which the U.S. Post Office joined with. The federal government vacated through the presidential election because of the Florida Chad scam. I authorized the opening of the Benjamin Franklin Postal Court in 2012, which retroactively went back to the original bankruptcy note of 1775.  The Benjamin Franklin Postal Service has its own system for measurement, including longitude, latitude, and range. I have copyrights and patents to these technologies. The service also has a nativity of words for contract, which means flying outside the post office is not a flag. I filed a sea treaty, a sea pass, and a drogue law to authorize the Benjamin Franklin Postal Court.  I mirrored the system to create a factual stance, allowing citizens and public officials to join with the contract using correct communication, parse, syntax, and grammar. The postal shipping lanes are now in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the government system sits there. Washington, D.C. has no flag, no constitution, and all post offices are closed with correct authorization.  I am the Postmaster General of the original 1775 filing, and Philadelphia is open. This is the secret that the Deep State has been hiding from citizens and government employees. When I get in, the negativity and lack of equality will be fixed, and we will change the moral structure to be happy, joyous, and fair. We\nDocument 59\nThe speaker discusses the potential for the IMF, World Bank, or Bank of International Settlements to provide a massive line of credit or direct loan to the US Treasury or central banks, potentially up to $10 trillion. They believe this is unlikely, citing the Fed's recent intervention in the repo market. The speaker also questions whether the stock market has fully priced in the current economic situation, suggesting it may still have room to fall. They note that the S&P 500 is still overvalued, with a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 28 times earnings. The speaker expects a V-shaped recovery but is skeptical, citing the market's negative reaction to the Fed's recent announcements. They point out that the Fed's actions have created a \"black hole\" of trillions of dollars, with unclear destinations. The speaker also mentions President Trump's promise of a large stimulus package for the \"little guy.\"\nDocument 60\nThe speaker discusses the racial breakdown of murder statistics in the US, using data from the FBI. They present the numbers for each year from 2010 to 2018, showing that black people are more likely to kill white people than vice versa. The speaker calculates the odds of a white person being killed by a black person versus a black person being killed by a white person, finding that the former is 11 times more likely.  The speaker then compares the number of black people killed by police to the total number of black arrests, finding that the former is a very small fraction of 1%. They argue that the media is exaggerating the issue and that the public should be mad at the specific cops who committed the crimes, not the entire police force.  The speaker also presents the numbers for black-on-black violence, finding that a black person is 55 times more likely to be shot by another black person than by a white person. They argue that the news only shows the smallest figure on this screen and that the public should be focusing on the real issue of black-on-black violence.  The speaker criticizes organizations like Black Lives Matter and Al Sharpton for refusing to use their energy against black-on-black violence and for getting rich off of donations. They argue that the money could be used to help poor black families, but instead it gets lost in payroll and advertising.  The speaker concludes by saying that numbers don't lie and that the public should be aware of the real statistics behind the issue of racial violence in the US. They hope that their video will help shed some light on the situation and clear up some of the myths that are being pushed.\nDocument 61\nThe speaker claims to have information about a secret cloning station where the Illuminati and other powerful individuals meet to transfer consciousness into clones. They describe two types of cloning: replication cloning, where a baby is created, and duplication cloning, where a person is grown in a tank. The speaker mentions different grades of cloning, including Mark I to IV, with Mark II being REM-driven.  The speaker alleges that the Illuminati use clones for sex slaves, torture, and other purposes. They claim that Britney Spears was involved in a cloning program and that her song \"Break the Ice\" is about breaking into a cloning station. The speaker also mentions that Queen Elizabeth, Vladimir Putin, and other world leaders are involved in the cloning program.  The speaker describes a type of lizard called Vril, which is said to be parasitic and can take over a person's body. They claim that these lizards are used to control people's minds and that they are involved in alien abductions. The speaker also mentions that the Illuminati videotape alien abductions using Hollywood makeup and that they clone people to use in these abductions.  The speaker claims that the Illuminati believe in inbreeding, pedophilia, and other forms of deviant behavior to gain power and good luck. They also mention that rich people can use microchips to body snatch people and that the cloning program is used to control world leaders.  The speaker concludes by stating that they have seen evidence of the cloning program and that they are trying to expose it to the public. They claim that the technology is too advanced for people to believe, but that they have to tell the truth because people are being killed by the lizards.\nDocument 62\nHello beautiful souls, welcome back to my channel. Today, I want to share my knowledge about the coronavirus, but with a different perspective. I'm not here to spread fear or panic, but to share love, knowledge, and wisdom. I believe the news is not there to uplift us, but to control us and create fear. The hype behind the coronavirus is absurd, and I think it's psychotic.  I've studied various subjects, including sociology, psychology, and government, and I believe the coronavirus was released on purpose to control people. Governments use fear to gain power, and when they feel threatened, they create a crisis to regain control. The news is responsible for the chaos, and it's not just about the virus, but about the way it's being presented.  As humans, we become what we consume. If we surround ourselves with negative energy, we'll become negative. I want to encourage you to stay calm, not let the media dictate your life, and do your own research. Look at the statistics, most people who died from the virus were 80 years old. We've had worse diseases and situations, but we don't talk about them.  I want to remind you that you are what you consume. If you consume positive energy, you'll become positive. You can turn off the TV, go outside, and do something uplifting for your mind, body, and soul. My personal suggestion is to stay calm, have integrity, and make a decision to not let the virus dictate you.  This is a beautiful time to reflect within yourself, find truth, and find peace. Without darkness, we don't have light. I hope this video gave you a little bit of light, knowledge, and awareness. Try to avoid negative conversation, surround yourself with positivity, and do what you love.  I wish everybody a healthy, positive day, week, and month ahead. My mission is to inspire\nDocument 63\nThe speaker, Vicks, discusses the current state of silver deliveries and the potential for economic chaos. He mentions that the August contract has ended, and notifications for silver deliveries have been sent out. Vicks notes that many people are asking about the status of silver deliveries, and he provides an update on the Comex first day of delivery.  According to Vicks, there are approximately 14,000 contracts that have stood for delivery, but the numbers may be higher due to discrepancies in notifications. He highlights several entities that have been short on silver, including BMO Capital, Wells Fargo Securities, and Barclays, which may face significant losses.  Vicks also mentions that JP Morgan has paid off its physical silver obligations and will not be delivering any more metal into the market. He notes that the big banks are getting \"pain on both sides\" due to their losses in the silver market.  The speaker encourages viewers to join the Road to Ruta, a platform that provides access to exclusive content, including interviews with experts like Cliff High and Jenny Moonstone. He also offers a promotion, providing 50 Theta and 50 Theta Fuel to new subscribers.  Vicks concludes by discussing the potential for economic chaos and the importance of being prepared. He notes that the physical silver market is out there, and the banks will eventually come up with the metal, either by leasing it or buying it off someone outside of the Comex market.\nDocument 64\nJudicial Watch obtained 180 pages of documents showing communications between anti-Trump FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The documents reveal a gap of almost a month between the discovery of Hillary Clinton's emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop and the obtaining of a search warrant. Strzok's Wiener timeline shows that the FBI knew about the emails on September 28th, 2016, but didn't obtain a search warrant until October 30th, 2016.  The documents also include an email chain where Strzok and Page discuss the review of Clinton's emails on Weiner's laptop. They found no previously unknown potentially classified emails, but only 3,077 out of over 300,000 emails were directly reviewed for classified or incriminating information.  The new records also show that Strzok and Page discussed the alleged destruction of laptops, a lengthy discussion about how to respond to a reporter's inquiry into an alleged quid pro quo related to Hillary Clinton's emails, and Strzok defending Director James Comey after a former FBI official said Comey had thrown all the agents under the bus.  Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says the documents further confirm that Strzok pushed Russia smears of Trump laundered through the media within the FBI. The FBI is slow-rolling the release of these documents, with only 500 pages processed per month.  This is not the first time Judicial Watch has obtained documents related to Strzok and Page. In February, they made public several emails between Strzok and Page that showed their direct involvement in the opening of Crossfire Hurricane, the Bureau's investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nDocument 65\nToday, I'm discussing the global reset, Dinar RV, and gold-backed currency. We've been discussing these topics for 2019, and we're at a crossroads. Iraq's turmoil and the Federal Reserve's actions are contributing to the impending economic crash. The gold buying spree and massive debt are also factors.   I want to remind you to have a plan, be set up, and ready to invest when the time comes. Consider investing in Dinar, Zion Oil, and other opportunities. I recommend using Exchange of America for currency purchases. It's essential to start saving and cutting back on spending to invest in the future.   The global currency reset is near, and it's crucial to be prepared. I suggest signing up with Coinbase and reevaluating your finances, expenses, and goals. Don't wait for the Dinar RV to hit; make a plan now. Remember, once the reset is done, it's too late to get in. Be ready to increase your wealth and take advantage of opportunities like Currency365.\nDocument 66\nHello everyone, I'm Justin Brad from the Unboxing Theory YouTube channel. Today, I'm comparing the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X and the AMD EPYC 7742, both with 64 cores and 128 threads. While some people claim that Intel Optane memory is necessary for these CPUs, I've found that there are alternative options.  The EPYC 7742 has a lower frequency, which means it runs cooler, and it has 256 megabytes of cache. However, it's a multi-thread server CPU, not a desktop CPU, so it may not have the same level of cache as the Threadripper.  Both CPUs support DDR3200 memory, but the Threadripper has overclockability. However, if you use 3200 MHz memory, you can't use the maximum capacity. For video rendering and parallel computing, I recommend at least 64 gigabytes of RAM, and ideally 256 gigabytes.  The EPYC has eight memory channels, which should provide better memory communication and encryption. The Threadripper has four memory channels and two on each side of the CPU, but I'm not sure how that works with eight chiplets.  Both CPUs support PCI Express 4.0, but the EPYC has more bandwidth. The Threadripper has NVMe RAID supported, but I'm not sure if the EPYC does.  I've also found that the EPYC can run at 170 gigabytes per second, which is faster than the Threadripper's 5,000 megabytes per second. However, the Threadripper's 750,000 IOPS is higher than the EPYC's IOPS.  In conclusion, while the EPYC has some advantages, the Threadripper is still a powerful CPU. With the right configuration, including two NVMe 4.0s and 250 gigabytes of RAM, the Threadripper should be able to handle 4K Ultra\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Global Reset (Document: 65):

{"summary":"Document 67\nThe speaker is discussing the actions of Paddy Main, a British soldier who led a patrol behind enemy lines in North Africa during World War II. Main's patrol was tasked with taking out German and Italian air bases, which were crucial to the war effort. The speaker argues that Main's decision to kill the German pilots in the airfield mess, rather than taking them prisoner, was a split-second decision made in the heat of the moment.  The speaker notes that war is not a nice thing and that Main's actions, while brutal, were not unusual for the time. He also points out that the German pilots were dedicated to getting kills, rather than seeing their enemies as human beings. The speaker suggests that it's easy to judge Main's actions 70 years later, but that those who were there at the time understood the harsh realities of war.  The speaker also discusses the trauma that soldiers like Main experienced during the war, including the loss of close friends and the psychological effects of prolonged combat. He notes that Main's story is a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of soldiers who fought behind enemy lines, and that their actions should not be judged by modern standards of etiquette.  The speaker also mentions a quote from Main, who said that he used to think war was a chivalrous thing, but that the age of knights in armor is long gone. This quote highlights the harsh realities of war and the need to understand the context in which soldiers like Main operated.  Overall, the speaker is arguing that Main's actions, while brutal, were a product of the time and the circumstances in which he fought. He is also highlighting the bravery and sacrifice of soldiers like Main, who fought behind enemy lines and experienced the harsh realities of war firsthand.\nDocument 68\nDavid Morgan discusses the current state of the stock market, highlighting the tech sector's leadership and the rotation into utilities and industrials. He notes the strong performance of FedEx and UPS due to increased delivery demand during the pandemic. Morgan also touches on the potential for food prices to double, which would have a significant impact on South Asian economies.  In the energy sector, Morgan discusses Exxon's warning that 20% of global oil and gas reserves may be wiped out due to the pandemic. He emphasizes the importance of watching the oil market and bond market, with bonds being a key area of focus.  Morgan then shifts his attention to the precious metals, addressing the question of whether it's too late to buy gold and silver. He presents inflation-adjusted charts, showing that the current prices of gold and silver are still below their historical highs when adjusted for inflation. Morgan believes that the metals have a long way to go and that it's not too late to buy them.  He recommends allocating 10% to 20% of one's portfolio to precious metals, citing their volatility and the potential for significant gains. Morgan also discusses the symbolic meaning of silver, referencing its association with truth and redemption in various cultures.  Finally, Morgan introduces The Morgan Report, a publication that provides in-depth analysis of the financial markets, metals, and mining. He emphasizes the importance of building and preserving wealth, and offers his services as a leading authority in the field.\nDocument 69\nThe narrator is walking through Washington D.C. near the Capitol, describing the unusual atmosphere due to the inauguration. The streets are blocked off with military vehicles, and soldiers are standing guard, armed and watchful. The area is very quiet, with streets empty of cars and pedestrians. Storefronts and homes have their windows boarded up, giving the city an eerie feel. The narrator notes that people are looking at them strangely for being out on the street. Military trucks and concrete barriers are blocking off Pennsylvania Avenue, and the CVS store is completely boarded up and shut down. The area is heavily guarded, with armed police and National Guard present. The narrator describes the scene as \"eerie\" and unlike any other inauguration in U.S. history.\nDocument 70\nThe stock market experienced a rally in the first part of the week, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 clearing their 50-day moving averages. However, by Friday, Amazon was clobbered, and consumer cyclicals were trending lower. David Morgan believes the rally is over and the stock market will downtrend, while precious metals will uptrend.  In financial news, Italian car sales plummeted 98% in April, and more than one in five Singapore firms are considering cutting their workforce due to the coronavirus. The European Central Bank is stepping up efforts to cushion the economy against a record downturn.  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread financial distress, with 41% of working-age adults experiencing job loss or income decline. Millions of Americans are struggling to pay rent, mortgage, or utility bills.  David Morgan also discussed the potential for a worldwide monetary reset due to the COVID-19 panic, citing a deliberate destruction of the monetary order. He believes a prosperity fund called NESRA will be released, which will buy out oil corporations, banks, and pharmaceutical cartels, and distribute funds to the people.  The plan outlined in the NESRA fund includes forgiving mortgage, bank debt, and credit card debt, eliminating the Federal Reserve, abolishing income taxes, and establishing a flat rate sales tax. David Morgan notes that this plan sounds too good to be true, but it may be the next step in the old problem-reaction solution.\nDocument 71\nLeon Black, CEO and chairman of Apollo Global Management, is stepping down after an investigation revealed he paid convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein $158 million between 2012 and 2017. The review, ordered by the board, found Black also lent Epstein over $30 million, with only $10 million repaid. Black admitted it was a \"terrible mistake\" to associate with Epstein, who pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2008. This controversy comes after former President Bill Clinton was previously linked to Apollo, receiving $250,000 for a speech in 2015. The scandal has led to asset managers freezing new capital allocations to Apollo, prompting an independent review to clear Black's and Apollo's name.\nDocument 72\nUkrainian MP Andrei Derkach released a statement alleging Joe Biden's corruption in Ukraine. He claims U.S. Department of State Representative George Kent was involved in embezzling U.S. taxpayer funds through a shell company, further detailing a scheme allegedly run by Biden.\nDocument 73\nHello everyone, this is the speaker from Hive Minds.

Select Tier 3 groups were paid out, while the bulk of Tier 3 was paid on March 30-31. Tier 4A and 4B were expected to be notified within 48 hours. The Zim currency had a good default rate, and dependent on humanitarian project presentations, rates higher than the default rate were offered.   Redemption centers would have a 90-day NDA, and individuals would be tracked on their phone conversations, email, internet, and social media. Wearing masks or scarves to the redemption center was advised, and individuals may want to wear camouflage to avoid facial recognition machines.  The process of redemption included a 4-minute instruction video, a 5-8 minute presentation of the project, and verification of currency. Individuals would set up accounts, receive a debit card with $1,000,000, and have the option to do wire transfers. They would also receive proof of funds letters and a perk sheet of banking benefits.  The three days of darkness were expected to include internet, phone, and social media outages, but President Trump mentioned that usage would not be interrupted. Nazareth started a week ago, and 23,000 mortgages were forgiven by March 31. The debt forgiveness program would continue and be completed by the end of April.  The IRS and Federal Reserve were being absorbed into the U.S. Treasury, and only U.S. citizens would be eligible for stimulus checks. The stimulus checks began to go out on March 30, and 638,000 checks had been sent out as of April 1.  Celebrities such as Oprah, Tom Hanks, and Ellen DeGeneres were rumored to have been arrested\nDocument 75\nBonnie from Seabine is reporting live from Sturgis, South Dakota, where a large celebration is taking place. She's joined by Cherise Ledford, who traveled 1,540 miles from Atlanta, Georgia, to attend the event. Cherise is excited to see President Trump on the jumbotron and hear his message for the country.  Bonnie also speaks with Michelle Johnson Robinson and her husband, who drove 23.5 hours from Texas to support their president and the country. Michelle expresses her frustration with lockdowns and the government's handling of the pandemic.  The event is centered around the world's largest American flag, which weighs 3,000 pounds and requires 500 people to carry. The flag's creator, John Sensor, explains the \"hourglass concept\" behind the flag, which represents unity and patriotism. The flag will be lit up by 500 people, symbolizing the country's desire to rally around something.  The event will feature the national anthem, Pledge of Allegiance, and patriotic music, followed by a procession led by veterans. A 77-year-old lady from Los Angeles owns the flag, which was transported to the event in two days. The flag's presence is a powerful symbol of patriotism and a pushback against the perceived enemy advancing on the country.\nDocument 76\nJerry Lundergan, the former Kentucky Democrat Party Chair and close friend of Bill Clinton, has been sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for illegally funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into his daughter's 2014 U.S. Senate campaign. Lundergan was convicted of 10 charges related to making over $200,000 in corporate contributions, including conspiracy, making corporate campaign contributions, and causing false statements to the FEC. His co-defendant, Dale Emmons, was sentenced to nine months in a halfway house and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine.  Lundergan's attorney argued that the charges were politically motivated, but prosecutors said the defendant's own unlawful conduct led to his prosecution. Lundergan apologized in court for his actions, acknowledging that he made \"bad choices.\" Bill Clinton wrote a letter of support to the judge, calling Lundergan a \"good man with a big heart,\" but prosecutors argued that the defendant's actions were intentional and caused harm to the integrity of the election.  The case highlights the importance of campaign finance laws and the consequences of breaking them. Lundergan's daughter, Alison Lundergan Grimes, was a potential candidate for governor in 2019 but did not run due to the pending charges against her father and her own controversies.\nDocument 77\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. Today's call will focus on the current situation in Iraq and its potential impact on the Iraqi dinar. We're not advocating the sale or purchase of these currencies, but as substantial holders, we want to share relevant information. The window for the dinar's potential reinstitution is still in the first quarter, possibly early April.  The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has not yet reported their national education program, nor have they completed the project to eliminate zeros. The Parliament is scheduled to pass their budget on or around February 1st, which is based on the current program rate for the dinar. However, this doesn't mean the reinstitution will be postponed until next January.  We're in a precarious situation in the United States, with the impeachment of Donald Trump and concerns about the election's integrity. Whether Trump is reinstalled or Joe Biden remains in office, we still believe the reinstitution and revaluation of the dinar will occur. Historically, reinstitutions and revaluations have occurred in January, April, and September.  I'm optimistic about the revaluation, and I think it's plausible that it will happen in the first quarter, possibly in April. Establishing a self-settled irrevocable trust can protect your assets and provide tax benefits. I recommend referring to our call of December 16th for more information on our program and the importance of establishing a trust.  The situation in Washington is fluid, and there are many moving parts. However, I'm confident that we're in a good position to see the reinstitution and revaluation of the dinar, regardless of the outcome in the United States. Thank you for listening to the call, and I'll try to have a complete call next week with a Q&A session.\nDocument 78\nThe FBI has arrested four Toledo City Council members, including the executive director of the Lucas County Democrat Party, on charges of bribery and extortion. The council members, Tyrone Riley, Yvonne Harper, Larry Sykes, and Gary Johnson, are accused of accepting thousands of dollars in payments from an FBI source in exchange for their support on business matters. The scheme allegedly began in 2018 and continued into 2020.   According to court documents, the council members would often go through a middleman, Keith Mitchell, to receive the bribe payments. Harper is also charged with interstate communications with intent to extort. The FBI source, who owns several commercial properties in the city, reported providing things of value to Riley in exchange for his vote on matters before council.  The mayor of Toledo has released a statement expressing shock and heartbreak over the arrests, stating that this is a terrible day for the city and for public service. The Lucas County Republican Party is calling for the resignation of all four council members and open elections for their seats.\nDocument 79\nThe video discusses the potential closure of the Deep State and the possibility of high-level officials being detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Gitmo. The speaker expresses hope that this could lead to the release of suppressed information and the beginning of a more just and truthful society. They mention rumors of sealed indictments and the detention of VIP members of the Deep State, which could have significant political implications. The speaker also discusses their personal spiritual journey and their desire for a more meaningful life, where they can see the beginning stages of their \"heaven on earth\" vision. They express skepticism about the idea that Obama and Pelosi are double agents working for positive change, and instead believe they should face military trials for treason. The speaker concludes by expressing their hope for arrests and justice to be served, which would give their life meaning and make their prayers answered.\nDocument 80\nNo summary available.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Stock Market (Document: 68): Discusses the current state of the stock market and its performance.\n    [2] GCR (Document: 74): Provides information on the status of Tier 3 and 4 groups and the process of redemption.\n    [2] War (Document: 67): Mentions the actions of a soldier during World War II.\n    [2] Corruption (Document: 72): Alleges Joe Biden's corruption in Ukraine.\n    [2] Economic Downturn (Document: 70): Discusses the potential for a worldwide monetary reset and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.\n    [2] Censorship (Document: 73): Discusses the speaker's experience with YouTube censorship and their efforts to build a presence on alternative platforms.\n    [2] Inauguration (Document: 69): Describes the unusual atmosphere during the inauguration.\n    [2] Corporate Scandal (Document: 71): Reports on the controversy surrounding Leon Black and Apollo Global Management.\n    [2] Currency (Document: 77): Discusses the potential reinstitution and revaluation of the Iraqi dinar.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 79): Discusses the potential closure of the Deep State and the possibility of high-level officials being detained.\n    [2] Patriotism (Document: 75): Reports on a large celebration in Sturgis, South Dakota, and the display of a large American flag.\n    [2] Bribery (Document: 78): Reports on the arrest of four Toledo City Council members on charges of bribery and extortion.\n    [2] Campaign Finance (Document: 76): Discusses the sentencing of Jerry Lundergan for illegally funneling corporate contributions into his daughter's Senate campaign."}
{"summary":"Document 81\nIt's April 1, and the speaker is not joking. They've been blocked from Twitter and can't reach out to Twitter to resolve the issue. The speaker will be focusing on a short video about horseshoe bats, which were being studied at the Wuhan bio labs. The Chinese scientists wanted to understand how these bats, which carry a high viral load, don't get sick. They discovered that horseshoe bats make vitamin C, but not in the same way as humans. Instead, they produce it on demand through a pseudogenetic structure.  This discovery is crucial because it explains why vitamin C is essential in fighting the CCP virus. The speaker believes that the Chinese Communist Party adopted a high vitamin C regimen to combat the virus, and this strategy can be used by individuals to stay healthy. The speaker also mentions that Chaga mushrooms, which are extracted from birch trees, can be used as an augmenting agent for vitamin C.  The speaker wants people to understand that the CCP virus is a bioweapon and that vitamin C is the primary key to fighting it. They encourage people to download and share the video, especially with military personnel, to help them understand the importance of vitamin C in fighting the virus. The speaker also mentions that there are two signaling molecules that turn the virus on and off, which the Chinese are hiding.  The speaker will be focusing on YouTube and encourages people to send them an email if they have something pertinent to share. They believe that by working together, people can defeat the CCP virus and reconcile with the Chinese Communist Party.\nDocument 82\nBrandon Booth and Leonard Bakani attended a peaceful protest in North Bend, Washington, with over 500 attendees from various walks of life, including families with children. The police command, led by Captain Almquist, reported a few minor incidents but overall a peaceful event.   The police presence was significant, with mutual aid from surrounding agencies, and a group of patriots protected storefronts to prevent vandalism. Denny, a local resident, expressed concerns about the protest's impact on the town and the unnecessary destruction of property.  Captain Almquist explained that business owners received a briefing on how to protect their properties, and the police were prepared to respond to any incidents. Clayton Littlejohn, the town mayor, emphasized the importance of peaceful protesting and respecting the community.  Local residents, including Elvis and Doug Hockenberry, expressed support for the protesters and the police, highlighting the community's unity and cooperation. Aaron Rapp, the owner of North End Bakery, handed out free donuts to spread cheer and happiness during the protest.  However, Leonard Bakani reported an incident with Antifa members, who approached him in an aggressive manner, but were restrained by their cohorts. The incident was reported to the police, and they indicated that they saw the incident happen.\nDocument 83\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. I'm here to update you on the current situation in Iraq. Unfortunately, I need to cut this call short due to a personal family emergency in Nashville, where a tornado hit the night before last, affecting my daughter's home.   Regarding Iraq, Prime Minister Alawi has resigned, and the parliament will appoint a new prime minister designate within 15 days. This person will have 30 days to form a new government, which could take up to 45 days in total. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) plans to cease auctions, delete zeros, and release lower-denomination notes, but this requires the final passage of the 2020 budget, which is dependent on the new government being in place.  The UN, IMF, and US are putting pressure on Iraq, threatening to place them back in Chapter 7, keep them in Article 14, or reinstitute sanctions. The government has made intra-governmental payments, but this creates complications for the budget. I'm still hopeful that this is a temporary postponement, and we're looking at 30 to 45 days for the reinstitution of the dinar.  The pressure on Iraq is substantial, and I believe we have a better than 50\/50 chance of getting this done in the next 30 to 45 days. The Iranians are also facing problems with the Corona virus, and there's scuttlebutt that they're being told to cease interference in Iraq's affairs or face consequences for their nuclear sites and oil fields.  We'll be back next Wednesday at noon Eastern, 9 a.m. Pacific, and will keep you updated on the situation. If anything dramatic happens, we'll send an emergency email and schedule a conference call. Thank you for calling, and I wish you a great week.\nDocument 84\nThe Stop It Now helpline in the UK has seen a 119% increase in calls and website visitors, with 94,342 people seeking help to stop sexual feelings towards children. The organization provides anonymous and confidential support to help individuals understand the reasons behind their behavior and how to get support. However, there are differing opinions on whether this helpline is effective in preventing child abuse.  Some argue that providing support to individuals with these thoughts can be beneficial, while others believe it can be detrimental, creating a sense of validation and community among individuals who may go on to commit abuse. The hosts of the podcast discuss the complexity of the issue, citing studies that show a significant portion of individuals who view child pornography go on to become contact offenders.  They also discuss the need for stricter laws and punishments for those who commit these offenses, as well as increased awareness and education about the issue. The hosts believe that by elevating this issue to the top of the mind awareness and pressuring governments to take action, we can start to see results in preventing child abuse.  The conversation also touches on the idea that certain subcultures have normalized and even institutionalized child abuse, citing examples such as the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts. The hosts emphasize the need to expose these subcultures and create stricter laws and punishments to deter child abuse.  Ultimately, the hosts conclude that while we may not be able to fully eradicate child abuse, by working together and increasing awareness and education, we can make a start in preventing it.\nDocument 85\nNo summary available.\nDocument 86\nHello everyone, welcome back to my channel. Today, I want to talk about the spot price of silver reaching $21 an ounce for the first time in six years. The premiums on silver eagles are also going through the roof. I'm concerned that the wrong type of people are finding out about silver right now, who will pay high premiums and drive up the prices even more.  I've been saying for a while that I'm taking a step back from silver, not waiting for the price to drop, but because I have no idea how long this will last. I've been stacking cash for the last three months, and now I'm back to stacking silver. I've received comments saying I'll regret not hoarding more silver, but I don't regret my decision.  I believe that everyone should diversify their investments, not just stack silver. I think it's essential to save a portion of your currency, convert it into silver and gold, and invest in other assets. I'm not a big believer in putting all your eggs in one basket.  The wrong people getting involved in silver right now will drive up the premiums, making it harder for those who want to buy silver for the long term. I think the premiums on silver eagles will soon be above $30 a pop. The spot price of silver is currently at $21.25, and it's exciting to see where it will go from here.  Silver has had an incredibly busy week, and it's only Tuesday. I think anything is possible, and silver is in control. It could go up to $22, $23, $24, or $25 an ounce, or it could stay around the $20-$21 range. There's no way of knowing for sure.  Historically, when currency becomes weaker, real money like silver and gold becomes stronger. The dollar bill is not looking good, and I think silver and gold will\nDocument 87\nThe speaker describes a stark contrast between two events in London: a peaceful anti-lockdown protest being shut down by police, and a large government-encouraged protest against racism. The speaker suggests that the media's narrative has shifted from \"stay home\" to \"protest now\" in just two weeks, and that this is a deliberate attempt to create a new narrative of fear and chaos.  The speaker also highlights the involvement of organisations like Antifa, which they claim is a provocateur group that infiltrates peaceful protests and incites violence. They point to footage of Antifa members being confronted by the public and suggest that the group is being funded by billionaire George Soros.  The speaker also mentions several deaths and injuries during the protests, including the killing of a federal protective service officer, a 22-year-old woman, and a bystander. They warn that the government is using these events to create an excuse for martial law and to enforce contact tracing and facial recognition.  The speaker concludes by urging people to remain vigilant and united, and to remember that the true enemy of the people is not each other, but those who control the media, scientists, and politicians. They suggest that a long-term plan is being implemented to create a technocratic society, and that people must not fall into the same trap again.\nDocument 88\nThe speaker is discussing the recent purge of millions of social media accounts, including those of conservative, liberal, and independent voices. They express frustration and sadness, particularly for everyday citizens who have been silenced. The speaker believes this is a turning point, marking the beginning of a totalitarian regime where tech oligarchies control the narrative and suppress dissenting voices.  The speaker warns that this is not just about Trump, but about the erosion of free speech and the silencing of independent journalists and creators. They predict that this will lead to economic downturn, civil unrest, and the eventual takeover of the state. The speaker emphasizes the importance of building alternative platforms, such as BitChute, Parlay, and Gab, to counter the control of tech giants like Google and Apple.  The speaker also discusses the need for individuals to take action, speak out, and create content to resist the suppression of free speech. They encourage people to build their inner strength, pray, and take action to combat the forces of oppression. The speaker believes that the current situation is a test of individual strength and resilience, and that it's essential to stay together and keep fighting for freedom of speech and expression.  The speaker also touches on the topic of cancel culture, where a simple social media post from years ago can prevent someone from getting a job. They believe that this is a symptom of a larger problem, where people are being silenced and ostracized for holding different opinions or views. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of finding one's strength and power to resist the forces of oppression and to fight for freedom of speech and expression.\nDocument 89\nThe FBI raided the home and business of Tennessee State Senator Katrina Robinson, a Democrat, in connection with an ongoing investigation.  The Health Care Institute, a for-profit college founded by Robinson, received $2.3 million in federal grant money over four years.  The FBI executed search warrants at the institute, Robinson's home, and another business owned by her.  Robinson, 39, has refused to comment on the investigation, despite her attorney confirming he had been retained by her.  Witnesses described seeing FBI agents moving filing cabinets and laptops from the institute into white vans.  The Health Care Institute received the federal grant to train certified nursing assistants, but it's unclear if all the grant obligations were fulfilled.  Robinson has been posting on social media about other topics, but has not addressed the raid.  The Tennessee Senate Democrat Caucus said they've been made aware of the investigation and have received no indication it relates to the legislature or her legislative service.\nDocument 90\nHello, brave awakened ones.  I'm Veronica of Higher Realm Holistics, sharing a video about the final countdown.  We're in a critical time, and I'll show evidence of this.  I'm not sure if you follow me on Twitter, but I'm under SavingGenZ.  I'll share a link in the description.  President Trump recently spoke about the hard days ahead, a very tough two weeks.  He mentioned the pain and death caused by the invisible enemy.  This aligns with Q's message about bringing the pain.  I'm sharing a court case involving high-profile individuals, including Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton.  The charges include AI organization, persecution, rape, torture, concentration camps, and human trafficking in China and Hong Kong.  If this is true, it could be part of the pain and the final countdown.  I'm not sure if this is real or a fake news attempt to mislead us.  However, President Trump's speech and the timing of this information make me believe it's a countdown.  I received a message on my phone with a deadline, and I think this is it.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm sharing this with you.\nDocument 91\nThe current gold and silver market is experiencing a massive put due to a Catch-22 arbitrage trade. This trade is triggered when COMEX market makers avoid large backwardations, which would activate the trade and drive up the price of physical gold and silver. The market is structurally bullish, with strong demand and a backlog of refineries, leading to high premiums for immediate delivery.   The Basel III net stable funding ratio standards, set to be implemented in March, will devalue unallocated gold and treat physical gold as a cash asset. This will lead to a gold price revaluation, with a target of $2500. The implementation of Basel III will impact the hundreds of tons of unallocated gold cleared daily by the LBMA, creating a massive arbitrage opportunity for a physically starved market.  The LBMA's attempt to delay the implementation of Basel III has failed, and the US, Switzerland, and the EU will implement the 85% haircut on unallocated gold by June 28th. This will expose market-making LBMA bullion banks to the standards, making it difficult for them to shuffle paper positions for settlement if they are not backed by physical gold.  The current market conditions, including the thin spec paper gold and silver open interest, will lead to a gold price revaluation. The sanctioned gold price revaluation is expected to be necessary and will be implemented despite lobbying efforts.\nDocument 92\nThe impeachment inquiry has begun, sparked by a complaint from within the intelligence community. This development fuels the president's claims of a \"deep state\" working against him. However, the president's critics see these individuals as patriots doing their duty, including diplomats, intelligence officers, and White House officials testifying on Capitol Hill.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Protests (Document: 81, 82, 87): Mentions peaceful and anti-lockdown protests.\n    [2] Politics and Social Issues (Document: 84): Mentions the Stop It Now helpline and the issue of child abuse.\n    [2] Impeachment (Document: 92): Mentions the impeachment inquiry and the president's claims of a \"deep state\" working against him.\n    [2] Politics and World Order (Document: 83): Mentions\n    [2] Conspiracy Theories (Document: 90): Mentions a court case involving high-profile individuals and a countdown to a final event.\n    [2] Social Media (Document: 88): Mentions the purge of social media accounts and the importance of alternative platforms.\n    [2] Economic Policy (Document: 91): Mentions the implementation of Basel III and its impact on the gold and silver market.\n    [2] Media Control (Document: 87, 88): Mentions the media's narrative and the importance of alternative platforms.\n    [2] Politics and World Order (Document: 83): Mentions the situation in Iraq and the pressure on the government to implement reforms.\n    [2] Politics and Technology (Document: 88): Mentions the importance of alternative platforms and the need for individuals to take action.\n    [2] Politics and Foreign Policy (Document: 83): Mentions the situation in Iraq and the pressure on the government to implement reforms.\n    [2] Politics and Mainstream News (Document: 87, 88): Mentions the media's narrative and the importance of alternative platforms.\n    [2] Politics and Propaganda (Document: 87, 88): Mentions the government's use of propaganda and the importance of critical thinking.\n    [2] Law Enforcement (Document: 81, 82, 89): Mentions the police presence at protests and the FBI raid on a Tennessee State Senator's home and business.\n    [2] Government Transparency (Document: 89): Mentions the FBI raid on a Tennessee State Senator's home and business.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 87, 88): Mentions the government's use of propaganda and the importance of critical thinking.\n    [2] Politics and Corruption (Document: 89): Mentions the FBI raid on a Tennessee State Senator's home and business.\n    [2] Politics and Censorship (Document: 88): Mentions the purge of social media accounts and the importance of alternative platforms."}
{"summary":"Document 93\nThe host, Trish Regan, was fired for her segment criticizing the left's response to the coronavirus, which she believes is being used to demonize and destroy President Trump. She argues that the left is creating mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off and to stop the economy dead in its tracks. Regan believes that a recession is a survivable event, but what Trump is doing to the country is not.  The host also criticizes the liberal media for using the coronavirus to create a narrative that Trump is incompetent and unable to lead. She points out that the media is using fake footage from Italy to make it seem like the situation in New York is worse than it actually is.  Regan also discusses a study conducted by the Department of Defense in 2018, which found that people who had received the flu shot were more prone to getting the coronavirus. She also notes that the FDA approved a high-dose flu shot in November 2019, just weeks after the Event 201 coronavirus pandemic simulation, which took place in New York.  The host also criticizes Governor Cuomo for creating hysteria and panic by saying that New York needs 30,000 ventilators, when in fact, thousands of ventilators were already available but not distributed. Regan believes that Cuomo's actions are calculated to create a narrative that Trump is dropping the ball and that he is incompetent.  Overall, the host argues that the left is using the coronavirus to create a narrative that Trump is incompetent and that he is responsible for the country's problems. She believes that this is a calculated effort to destroy Trump's presidency and that it is not based on facts or reality.\nDocument 94\nThe conversation revolves around Bill Barr's statement that lying to the FBI is not a crime, and the implications of this on the Michael Flynn case. The hosts argue that this sets a precedent and undermines accountability. They also bring up examples of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama lying, but the hosts claim that these instances are different and that Obama's statement on Flynn is particularly hypocritical.   The hosts point out that Obama discussed charging Flynn under the Logan Act, which has never been successfully used to convict anyone, and that this shows Obama was personally invested in the case. They also cite a case from 1977 where a dismissal was made due to misconduct by prosecutors, and another case from 2009 where Eric Holder asked for a dismissal due to similar reasons.   The hosts argue that these instances show that lying to the government is not always a crime and that the Flynn case is being mishandled. They also bring up a headline from 2015 where Michael Flynn stated that the rise of ISIS was a willful decision of the US government, which they claim is true.\nDocument 95\nShirley Temple, a child star born in 1928, began her film career at age three in the Baby Burlesque series. While her films were initially seen as innocent and fun-filled, they often featured disturbing slapstick jokes and sly innuendos. Temple frequently played a prostitute or nightclub performer, and her co-stars would often display an odd talent for meeting untimely ends.  Nabokov, author of Lolita, detected unsavory currents beneath Hollywood's surface and parodied Shirley Temple's films in his novel. He linked Kidd in Africa's subliminal pedophile code to Lolita, using reiterated themes and numerology. Temple's feature films often revolved around children's institutions and custody battles, with some guardians displaying an odd talent for meeting untimely ends.  Shirley Temple's studio portraits also presented her in a distinctly inappropriate manner, and some of her scenes were cut or censored due to their suggestive content. The Telltale Spider code, a theme that emerged in Curly Top, was also parodied in Lolita. Despite her enormous popularity, Temple had some critics, including American film critic Gilbert Seldes and British writer Graham Greene, who argued that her appeal was more secret and more adult.  In his review of Lolita, Greene praised the novel as one of the best books published in 1955, sparking a heated debate over morality in censorship. Temple's legacy lingers on in her movies, books, dolls, figurines, and other collectibles, but questions about the motivations of her Hollywood directors are rarely raised.\nDocument 96\nBix Weir discusses the oil derivative market, which is experiencing a massive collapse. The market is plagued by oversupply, lack of storage space, and plummeting oil prices. As a result, counterparties are facing financial ruin, and the intercontinental exchange (ICE) is at risk of being destroyed. The collapse is attributed to the massive oversupply of oil, which has led to a record contango, where the price of oil for delivery in the near future is lower than the price for delivery in the distant future.  The collapse is also linked to the failure of banks, such as Gusher National Bank, which was mentioned in a 1987 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston document. The document explained how banks can fail due to poor decisions, fraud, or changing economic conditions. The collapse of the oil derivative market is seen as a repeat of the 1987 scenario, where banks failed due to their exposure to the energy sector.  Bix Weir also mentions the role of derivatives in the collapse, highlighting the case of Heng Long, a Singapore-based company that failed to declare $800 million in losses. He also mentions ABN Ambro, a Dutch bank that has filed claims against Heng Long Group due to irrevocable letters of credit.  The collapse of the oil derivative market is seen as a catastrophic event that will have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Bix Weir emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying causes of the collapse and the role of derivatives in the market. He encourages viewers to learn more about the topic and to subscribe to his channel for free emails and updates.\nDocument 97\nThe video \"Freedom's Last Stand\" has been removed from YouTube due to its discussion of free speech and potential controversy.

I've developed a unique discovery related to language and emotion that can be applied to computers and the Internet. However, my emotional logging system was destroyed by censorship, and I can no longer share my reports.  I'm warning people not to be stupid and waste their energy, as the current situation is not normal. The Earth is receiving various energies that are causing humans to become agitated, and it will get worse. I predict that the energy will peak around 11:38 PM on January 20th and then gradually trail off by March 15th.  I'm not talking about a race war, but rather a global war against the CCP's invasion of the United States. The CCP is a clever and ruthless organization that has been working towards this goal for 50 years. I recommend not participating in any violent actions, as it will only contribute to the enemy's propaganda victory and cause harm to yourself and your family.  Instead, I suggest being disciplined and controlling yourself. A warrior does not expend their energy unnecessarily. I've had a military background and have worked with top-level computing companies, and I know that only 10% of people are fighters, while 90% are not. I'm urging people to be smart and not win stupid prizes.  Our enemies are weak and don't know it, and they will soon realize it. The CCP has its own Nazi-style SS troops, but they are not soldiers, they are brutish thugs. The PLA has a serious problem, and they will face a real problem in a modern warfare situation.  I'm not asking you to participate in any violent actions, but rather to be aware of the situation and to think critically. We're facing a global war, and we need to be smart and disciplined to win.\nDocument 99\nThe speech emphasizes the importance of balance and good judgment in navigating complex struggles for liberty and peace. It warns against the temptation to seek quick fixes or spectacular solutions to current difficulties, instead advocating for steady and sustained efforts. The speaker highlights the need to maintain balance in national programs, including the private and public economy, cost and benefits, and individual and national requirements.  The military establishment is a vital element in keeping the peace, but its immense size and influence pose a risk to democracy and liberty. The speaker cautions against the acquisition of unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex and emphasizes the importance of an alert and knowledgeable citizenry in ensuring that defense efforts align with peaceful goals.  Key points include:  * Balance is essential in navigating complex struggles for liberty and peace * Quick fixes or spectacular solutions are often misguided * The military establishment is vital for peace, but its influence must be carefully managed * An alert and knowledgeable citizenry is necessary to ensure that defense efforts align with peaceful goals * The military-industrial complex poses a risk to democracy and liberty if not properly managed.\nDocument 100\nHere's a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  The video discusses the upcoming US presidential election and its potential impact on the economy and the people. The speaker, Peter of England, claims that the democratic process is a sham and that the outcome of the election will determine the fate of the economy. He mentions that the US Department of Defense will be in charge of all payment transactions worldwide and that the vouchers for economic impact payments will be a fundamental part of the program.  The speaker addresses the issue of people having their vouchers returned by banks, citing non-clearing items or unacceptable forms of payment. He introduces a facility through Freeman Legal Services to help people with contract law, specifically the tenets of impossibility and frustration. He explains that these tenets can be used to argue that contracts are no longer valid due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  The speaker claims that the employers and business owners have been complicit in the lockdown measures and have been compensated through quantitative easing payments. He warns that the economy is in a state of collapse and that people should not expect things to get better in the future.  The speaker suggests that people can use the concept of force majeure to argue that contracts are no longer valid. He provides a template for a letter that people can send to creditors alleging that the contract is frustrated and impossible to perform. He also suggests that people can approach their local Catholic priest or pastor and ask them to take responsibility for the act of God, which is the COVID-19 pandemic.  The speaker concludes by saying that amazing things are going to start happening after the election, and that Donald Trump's military personnel will be able to bring the corrupt system to an end. He encourages people to subscribe to his channel and press the notification button to stay updated on future videos.\nDocument 101\nHello everyone, I'm Peter from England. On May 29th, economic impact payment vouchers from Weirbank were made available to people in the UK, US, and soon in Canada, Australia, and Germany. These vouchers aim to provide financial relief to those inconvenienced by lockdowns, furloughs, and government restrictions. The vouchers are tied to the CARES Act in the US and the Coronavirus Act 2020 in the UK.  The idea behind these vouchers was proposed a year ago, recognizing that the lockdowns and restrictions would disproportionately affect the working class, who create the wealth and GDP. The vouchers are designed to help people pay off debts and financial problems incurred due to the lockdowns.  However, the world economy is now facing a potential crash, with banks and financial institutions demanding payment resumption and catch-up on missed payments. The webinar scheduled for July 30th will explain how to handle pushback from payees and the intricacies of the economic impact payment vouchers, which bypass the entire financial system.  The vouchers come with instructions for the recipient and the payee, making it clear and precise. The webinar will cover how to use these vouchers effectively and address any concerns or questions you may have.\nDocument 102\nA citizen journalist, who hosts a radio show on Red State Talk Radio, is being interviewed. They describe themselves as a citizen journalist because they've never been paid by an interest group, which they believe can influence their message. The guest has worked as a contractor for the federal government, specifically for individuals now known to be part of the deep state. They mention having an advantage due to their experience and \"time traveling tactics.\" The host jokingly asks about the time travel machine, but the guest reveals that the person they worked with, John Owen Brennan, is a well-connected but not very smart individual who is intimidating due to his firmness.\nDocument 103\nIf you suddenly become rich, here are 15 things to do to make the most of your fortune:  1.  Play it safe and don't push your luck. Avoid shady businesses and try to double your investment quickly. 2.  Remain faithful to your partner and don't let the newfound wealth lead you into temptation. 3.  Protect your kids from the money by building trust funds for them and keeping the original investment safe. 4.  Follow the 5% rule, which means spending only the returns of invested funds to make your money last forever. 5.  Pay attention to your health and take care of yourself to enjoy your money. 6.  Prepare for changes, such as getting sued, scammed, or emotionally blackmailed, and don't let it hurt you. 7.  Don't begin a business immediately, as nine out of 10 businesses fail, and start small instead. 8.  Don't lend your friends money or invest in their business, as they may have an entitlement mentality and not return the favor. 9.  Don't get rich, get comfortable, and avoid buying liabilities like expensive cars and properties. 10. Don't change your financial advisor, as they have experience and can help you make the most of your money. 11. Learn how to invest and be financially literate to make your money grow. 12. Secure your money and leave it in the bank for a while to get used to your new financial situation. 13. Don't be in a hurry to quit your job, as you may lose your sense of purpose and spend recklessly. 14. Clear all of your debts and avoid acquiring new ones to have a clear financial standing. 15. Maintain your privacy and don't flaunt your money in the faces of your haters until the time is right.\nDocument 104\nColonel Vindman was questioned by Representative Jordan about concerns raised by his former boss, Mr. Morrison, and Dr. Hill about his judgment. Colonel Vindman responded that Dr. Hill had previously praised his judgment in a performance evaluation, calling him a \"top 1% military officer\" with \"excellent judgment.\" He stated that he couldn't say why Mr. Morrison questioned his judgment, as they had only recently started working together.  Representative Jordan also questioned Colonel Vindman about his communication with others after the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Colonel Vindman initially stated that he had only spoken to three individuals, but later revealed that he had spoken to a group of people, including Secretary Kent, and possibly others. He refused to disclose the names of the other individuals, citing security clearance and need-to-know requirements.  Representative Jordan pressed Colonel Vindman to reveal the names of the individuals he had spoken to, but Colonel Vindman maintained that he was not willing to disclose that information. The Chairman intervened, stating that the committee would not be used to out the whistleblower, and Representative Jordan was instructed to rephrase his question to focus on the witness rather than the whistleblower.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Politics and Law Enforcement (Document: 94): Mentions the implications of Bill Barr's statement on the Michael Flynn case.\n    [2] Economic Opportunity (Document: 101): Mentions the economic impact payment vouchers and their potential to provide financial relief.\n    [2] Censorship (Document: 97): Mentions the removal of a video from YouTube due to its discussion of free speech.\n    [2] Prophecy and Censorship (Document: 98): Mentions the destruction of an emotional logging system by censorship and a prediction of a global war.\n    [2] Wealth Management (Document: 103): Mentions 15 things to do to make the most of one's fortune.\n    [2] Economic Chaos (Document: 96): Mentions the collapse of the oil derivative market and its potential consequences.\n    [2] Balance and Liberty (Document: 99): Mentions the importance of balance in navigating complex struggles for liberty and peace.\n    [2] Economic Impact Payments (Document: 100): Mentions the potential impact of the US presidential election on the economy and the people.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 102): Mentions the guest's experience working for the federal government and their advantage due to their experience and \"time traveling tactics.\"\n    [2] Government Accountability (Document: 104): Mentions Colonel Vindman's judgment and his communication with others after the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky.\n    [2] Child Exploitation (Document: 95): Mentions the disturbing content in Shirley Temple's films.\n    [2] Media Manipulation (Document: 93): Mentions the left's response to the coronavirus and the liberal media's narrative."}
{"summary":"Document 105\nWelcome to the Daily Injection Program, show number six. Today, we're discussing QE to infinity, the repo market, and the lender of last resort concept. The Federal Reserve is acting aggressively, with open-ended QE and swap lines to Europe. This is unprecedented, with $12 trillion in money markets and a trillion dollars a day in repo markets. The system is under strain, and QE to infinity is necessary to prevent a collapse.  We're seeing a risk-off event, but people are selling stocks and bonds, which is unusual. The system can't handle the amount of cash in money markets. The repo market is working at a trillion dollars a night, which is unprecedented. Direct deposits to every family of four, $3,000, and small business loans will add to the cash pile.  The primary dealer facility will allow the use of collateral as junk or toxic assets, without ascertaining their value. This is unprecedented in its effect on the economy. Gold is having a historical day, going from under $1,500 to over $1,630 in one day. The main reason is reflation and mine shutdowns, which will reduce the physical gold and silver supply.  Tax exempts and buybacks, dividends, and accountability from companies will be restricted. Companies will have to be accountable for the financial situation and stability of their company if they want taxpayer money. This is a big deal and will make mining more attractive and profitable.  The SLV option chains for January 21st at $13 had a premium of $2, but two days later, it was already at 260, a 30% gain. This is the type of opportunity that will be available. The gold playbook is an A to Z guide to the mining industry, and the book is available for free download.  Trump is making a hard line decision, considering hot spots and quarantining the elderly. He wants to start\nDocument 106\nThe speaker suggests that the information we receive about the coronavirus might be manipulated, and our intuition is suppressed by the media machine. They propose considering an alternative perspective, where the goal is not to return to normal but to adapt to a new normal. The speaker claims to have information about a plan that will shape the next decade, but instead of revealing it, they urge viewers to spread the word and take responsibility for their actions, implying that they have knowledge about a potential future that doesn't align with the current narrative.\nDocument 107\nThe Bush family has arrived at the Capitol building for a ceremony to honor the late President George H.W. Bush. The family, including President Bush 43, his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, emerged from Air Force One, a change from the initial plan. The ceremony is a celebration of life, with the family appearing joyful and close-knit despite the sad occasion of losing their patriarch at 94 years old.  As the family prepares to enter the Capitol, they engage in a conversation, discussing their priorities and the current state of politics. The conversation appears to be a group consensus, with an active listener who may be reporting back to others. The family's discussion includes comments about the Trump impeachment and the perception of Trump as a racist.  The ceremony at the Capitol is a significant event, with the Bush family lining up to pay their respects to President Bush. The event is a beautiful and poignant moment, with the family's love and respect for each other on full display. The ceremony is a celebration of the life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush, a remarkable figure who served as the 41st President of the United States.\nDocument 108\nCatania Alvin explains that the postmaster general, controlled by Great Britain, runs the world's system. This system is based on shipping, postal, and banking wars, with timelines enforced in courts worldwide. The elemental chart, strategic metals contract, and dictionary are key components of this system, which is used to control people and run the planet. Catania claims that all countries are part of this system, with the King of Great Britain as the postmaster general, and that it's an old-school Masonic system.  Catania then discusses human trafficking, stating that it's the essence of the Vatican and that everyone is trafficked in some way. He references a White House Summit on Human Trafficking, where Ivanka Trump mentioned the importance of tackling modern-day slavery. Catania also mentions the Delphin Knowledge System, which helps understand universal laws and achieve more.  He emphasizes the need to focus on victim-centered, trauma-informed, evidence-based support for those affected by human trafficking. Catania also highlights the importance of going after those who buy and sell children for sex, as well as the banking system that enables this. He encourages viewers to challenge the system and move towards freedom.  Catania concludes by stating that many people in high court positions and organizations are involved in pedophilia, and that the swamp needs to be cleaned out. He encourages viewers to be proactive in creating a new, wonderful place on Earth, free from the control of the Vatican.\nDocument 109\nCatania Alwyn is speaking from Canada on April 4th, discussing a worldwide meditation and its effects on global energies. She mentions that the dark forces, with low vibrations, are being pushed back by the light forces. Alwyn shares a report about the dark forces using underground facilities to escape and control their minions, while performing negative occult rituals.  She also talks about the rescue of thousands of children, with some being taken to ships and others being looked after in New York's Central Park. Alwyn notes that there have been increased energetic attacks on lightworkers, but also mentions the benefits of super blue-green algae in protecting against radiation.  Alwyn then discusses the astrological significance of the new moon and Jupiter conjunct Pluto, which can bring expansion and deeper self-awareness. She also talks about the effects of 5G, which may be similar to the supposed effects of COVID-19.  The light forces have been carrying out non-physical operations to smoke out negative occult strongholds, and some underground bases have been cleared out, with thousands of children rescued. Alwyn mentions rumors of physical military operatives against the cabal to rescue children and the growing awareness of adrenochrome.  She emphasizes the importance of keeping one's vibration high to facilitate communication with the light forces and encourages people to take time for themselves, explore their passions, and develop new skills. Alwyn also mentions the rollout of NASARA and GESARA, which include mortgage debt forgiveness and student loan forgiveness.  According to Bruce, NASARA started on March 30th, with 23,000 mortgages forgiven as of March 31st, and many home foreclosures stopped. Alwyn encourages people to look into themselves, explore their passions, and develop new skills, and to be aware of the rollout of NASARA and GESARA.\nDocument 110\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 30, 2020.  The Q team and POTUS are working together to bring down the cabal and free the world from their control.  Thousands of children are being rescued from underground torture chambers, and military troops are risking their lives to save them.  The GCR and RV have been released, and liquidity has been released in the US, China, Vietnam, and Australia.  Tier 4B Internet Group is expected to receive 800 numbers to set redemption appointments by May 1st.   The COVID-19 pandemic is a fraud, and the agenda is to push mandatory vaccination and microchip injection for the New World Order.  Pharmaceutical companies connected to Bill Gates are funding the agenda.  Dr.  Shiva, a partner to Bill Gates, is pushing universal mandatory vaccination and injection of microchips to tag human beings for monitoring vaccine records.   President Trump and the Pentagon Pedophile Task Force have used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation.  The storm is here, and the Illuminati started the world pandemic for a new world order, while white hats used it to rescue children and arrest their perpetrators.   The redemption process for currency and ZIM bondholders will be done in two parts.  The first part will be exchanged at contract rates, and the second part will be delivered to you.  You will then go to the bank to finish your redemption process.  The default ZIM rate of $11,000,000 per 100 T Zim note will be offered at the first appointment, and you can negotiate for higher rates in a second appointment with your wealth manager and private banking team.   President Trump has given US banks a list of 250 humanitarian and job creation projects to invest in.  Your wealth manager\nDocument 111\nJack Kennedy, a 35-year-old bachelor, and Jacqueline Bouvier, a 23-year-old beauty, began dating in 1951 after meeting at a dinner party. They had a whirlwind romance, with Jackie breaking off her engagement to marry Jack. The couple's relationship was highly publicized, with the press invited to share in their joy.   Jackie was drawn to Jack's imagination and wit, while he was captivated by her intelligence and style. Despite warnings from friends about Jack's womanizing past, Jackie saw it as a challenge. The couple married in 1953 and were still looking for a place to live in Washington.  In a 1953 interview, the newlyweds discussed their courtship and marriage. Jackie revealed that she had an intuition that Jack would have a profound effect on her life, but she was willing to take the risk. Jack joked about the challenges of being married to a senator, and the couple showed off their apartment, including a wedding gift from a friend, a Harvard football.\nDocument 112\nThe speaker, second in line for the presidency, discusses the continuity of government and its relation to the military. They claim that the White House has not contacted them about this, but the military is involved in maintaining the illusion of government continuity.   The speaker references a 1999 bankruptcy that led to the United States ceasing to exist as a legitimate government. They argue that the current government is a \"pantomime\" and that the military's role is to maintain this illusion to prevent chaos.   The speaker emphasizes that the military's job is to follow their chain of command and to throw congressmen and women in FEMA camps if they pass laws that go against the people. They also stress that American citizens are not to be sent to concentration camps, but rather those who place false scams against the people.   The speaker maintains that they have maintained the rules of the continuance of evidence, which gives them tactical control over the situation. They encourage citizens to learn about their grammar and to be aware of the fakeness of the current government.   The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of knowing one's role and complying with the continuance of evidence to maintain the continuity of government.\nDocument 113\nHello, brave and awakened ones. I'm addressing you today because we've entered a critical phase, which I call the tunnel. Think of it like Space Mountain at Disney - dark, flashing lights, and uncertainty. It's natural to feel scared, but remember, God's got this. We've done our part, and now it's time to trust in the universe's plan.  Don't let the trolls and naysayers discourage you. They think we're weak, but we're playing 5D chess, just like Trump. We're getting to a higher level of consciousness, and those who don't want to come along can choose to stay behind.  I want to remind you to be still, watch God's work, and believe in yourself. You've done everything you can, and now it's time to trust in the outcome. Don't be afraid to hold the line and stay strong.  Also, be cautious of who you follow. Some people claim to have spoken directly to Q or other high-level sources, but I don't trust those claims. I only trust those who resonate with me and provide accurate information.  Remember, we're in this together, and God's got this. We'll get through this tunnel and emerge stronger on the other side. Keep your faith and stay vigilant.\nDocument 114\nPaladin from the White Hats Media Group is hosting a live stream tonight at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time or 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time. He will be joined by Lady Justice, who recently joined the team and will have her own blog on whitehatsreport.com. They will discuss current events and important topics for the public to know.\nDocument 115\nThe video discusses a claim made by Linda Good McGillis, a self-proclaimed walk-in, that President Donald Trump is actually Saint Germain. McGillis believes that Trump is on a divine mission to help humanity and that the Earth is going to be split in two, with the inner and outer earth becoming more separated. The speaker of the video, who listened to McGillis' video twice, is confused by her claims and finds it hard to hang on to hope for humanity's future. The speaker also discusses the idea of a divine mission and the concept of separation consciousness, suggesting that it's part of the illusion. They also touch on the idea that everything in the physical world is an illusion and that we've been lied to about virtually everything in every aspect of our lives. The speaker expresses their desire for unity and healing, but finds it hard to believe in positive messages when surrounded by negativity.\nDocument 116\nThe speaker discusses a prophecy by Kim Clement about Israel supplying oil to other nations. They believe this prophecy is connected to Zion oil, a company they're invested in. According to the prophecy, Israel will supply oil to other nations, including those in Africa and Asia, despite being a small country. The speaker thinks this prophecy strengthens their commitment to investing in Zion oil, as it suggests Israel will be self-sustaining and able to supply other nations with oil. They also mention the potential impact of a new energy source on Israel's oil industry and the possibility of Saudi Arabia not having as much oil as claimed. The speaker believes that when the RV (revaluation) takes place, it will give the economy a boost, leading to increased oil demand and a change in the oil market. They encourage listeners to be patient and invest in Zion oil for the short and long term.\nDocument 117\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles discusses the ongoing election controversy and potential meddling in the 2020 US presidential election. She references Sidney Powell's claims of election fraud and Dominion Voting Systems' alleged involvement. Deb also shares an interview with Ron, who points out that Dominion machines are capable of manipulating election results, which could delegitimize the entire election.  Deb mentions that if the courts rule Dominion Voting Systems' machines unconstitutional, millions of potentially fraudulent votes could be discarded, affecting the election outcome. She also notes that the House of Representatives could potentially vote on the election outcome, with each state having one vote based on its number of representatives.  Deb shares various threads and articles, including one about Dominion Voting Systems' membership in CISA's Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council, which authored a statement denying election fraud. She also discusses a former Dominion project manager who executed a $25 million contract with the state of Michigan while serving as a Democrat vice chair.  Deb then shares her personal experience with COVID-19 symptoms and her decision to create a video despite feeling unwell. She also discusses the loss of subscribers and the importance of prayer in the face of adversity. Deb concludes by encouraging viewers to stay positive and pray for Sidney Powell, Trump's lawyers, and the outcome of the election.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 115): Discusses a claim made by Linda Good McGillis that President Donald Trump is actually Saint Germain.\n    [2] Radio Show (Document: 105): Discusses current events and politics through a radio show.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 110): Discusses the Q team and POTUS working together to bring down the cabal, the GCR and RV, and the redemption process for currency and ZIM bondholders.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 112): Discusses the continuity of government, the military's role in maintaining the illusion of government continuity, and the importance of knowing one's role and complying with the continuance of evidence.\n    [2] Politics and Corruption (Document: 108): Discusses human trafficking, the Vatican, and the need to focus on victim-centered support.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 114): Discusses a live stream hosted by Paladin from the White Hats Media Group.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 117): Discusses the ongoing election controversy, potential meddling in the 2020 US presidential election, and the potential impact on the election outcome.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 109): Discusses the rescue of thousands of children, the rollout of NASARA and GESARA, and the importance of keeping one's vibration high.\n    [2] Media Manipulation (Document: 106): Suggests that information about the coronavirus might be manipulated by the media.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 116): Discusses a prophecy by Kim Clement about Israel supplying oil to other nations and the potential impact on the oil market.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 107): Discusses the Bush family's visit to the Capitol building and their conversation about politics.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 113): Discusses the critical phase, the tunnel, and the importance of trusting in the universe's plan.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 111): Discusses the courtship and marriage of Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy."}
{"summary":"Document 118\nThe speaker is a multimillionaire who has been investing in gold, silver, and Bitcoin for decades. He believes that these assets are outside the federal system and are not controlled by the central bank, making them a safer investment. He claims that the federal reserve and treasury steal wealth by printing money and that savers are losers because they are holding onto fake money.  The speaker likes silver because it is undervalued and has a higher potential for growth. He believes that when gold takes off, silver will follow, and that silver is more volatile than gold. He recommends buying physical silver coins or bars, rather than investing in mining shares or ETFs.  The speaker also discusses the importance of liquidity and how it can be achieved by holding physical gold and silver. He recommends buying coins or bars by the ounce, rather than collectible coins, and suggests that people start by buying small amounts, such as a silver US Eagle for $25.  The speaker also talks about the manipulation of the silver market by large financial institutions and how this has suppressed the price of silver. He believes that the futures market is controlled by a few large players, such as Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns, and that they sell silver into the futures contracts to knock down the price.  The speaker recommends a book called \"Why Go, Why Now?\" which he believes is a clear and simple guide to investing in gold and silver. He also suggests that people start by educating themselves about the subject and learning about the good and bad aspects of investing in gold and silver.\nDocument 119\nHello, I'm Dr. Dave Janda, and welcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings. Due to recent platform changes, I'll be moving my content to Rumble.com, where free speech is embraced. If you're a subscriber, please join me at Rumble.com\/Operation Freedom. I'll continue to provide information on the events of November 3rd, which the mainstream media won't touch. My goal is to empower you with the truth, and I won't stop now.

If you miss the show, you can listen to the podcast with a subscription.   I'm declaring my independence from this platform's censorship, and I encourage you to do the same. As H.L. Mencken said, \"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed.\" We must fight for our freedom and protect it for future generations.   Censorship is alive and well, but an irate minority can set brush fires of freedom in the minds of men. I'll continue to expose the truth, and I invite you to join me on Rumble.com, where we'll discuss the events of 11.3 and more.\nDocument 120\nThe speaker is calling out to fellow Americans to stand up for their civil liberties, which they believe are being trampled by government mandates. They argue that people should have the freedom to choose whether to wear masks, go to businesses, or live in areas with different policies. The speaker suggests that if a majority of people in a state want to opt out of certain policies, those who disagree should be able to move to a state that aligns with their values.  The speaker criticizes governors for dictating laws instead of giving citizens the choice to decide. They propose that governors should put policies to a vote, allowing people to choose whether to live in areas with mandatory masks, police, or other policies. If a majority of people disagree with a policy, they should be able to move to a state that aligns with their values.  The speaker uses the example of Nevada's mandatory mask policy, saying they would move to a state like Texas or Montana if it were permanent. They believe that people should be able to choose their own freedoms and that the government should manage affairs, not dictate laws.  The speaker also makes humorous comments about the absurdity of certain policies, such as mandatory masks in bathrooms. They conclude by saying that people should take a stand for their freedoms and vote for leaders who align with their values.\nDocument 121\nBix Weir discusses the current state of the global financial system, stating that the Fed has flooded the market with $1 trillion in overnight repos, term repos, and permanent operations. He believes this is the endgame, where the Fed prints as much money as it wants. Weir warns against shorting the dollar, as the prices are rigged by computers invented by Alan Greenspan. He explains that a $12 trillion margin call has been triggered, crushing shorts and causing a massive short squeeze.  Weir also discusses the potential collapse of the global financial system, citing the massive derivatives held in China and the massive leverage of banks. He believes that even if the government prints trillions of dollars, it won't put anything on the shelves. Weir suggests that the game is over and that the U.S. Congress will struggle to bail out banks and corporations.  Weir also touches on the trade war between the U.S. and China, stating that it will lead to a complete halt in trade between the two countries. He believes that this will have devastating effects on the global economy and that the reversal of globalization will be catastrophic.  Weir proposes a solution, suggesting that the old system be destroyed and a new system implemented immediately. He believes that this will require a complete overhaul of the monetary system and that people will need to take control of their own money.  Weir also discusses the importance of keeping the internet up and running, as it is crucial for the survival of humanity. He believes that the bad guys who are trying to take control need to be exposed and that people need to fight for their country.  In conclusion, Weir believes that the endgame is near and that the global financial system is on the brink of collapse. He suggests that people need to take control of their own money and fight for their freedoms.\nDocument 122\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. I'm here to address concerns about the recent devaluation of the Iraqi dinar against the US dollar. This devaluation is not unusual, given the global economic impact of COVID-19, which has affected currencies pegged to the US dollar. The devaluation of the dinar is also similar to the Kuwaiti dinar in the early 90s, bringing the spread between the auction rate and street rate to within 2%. This devaluation helps facilitate the collection of the three-zero provisional currency in-country, as it has temporarily less purchasing power than the US dollar. When the currency reinstitutes, it will be at the reinstituted rate. I want to reassure you that this devaluation is not a bad thing, but rather a helpful step towards the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar in-country. I encourage new callers to listen to our previous call from December 16th for more information on our turnkey program. We wish you a wonderful Christmas and New Year season, and we'll talk to you again next week.\nDocument 123\nKaren Hudus discusses the new reality where humanity has overcome the black nobility, a group that has controlled and manipulated people for centuries. This group, descended from pharaohs, has been trying to divide and conquer, using tactics like the pipeline feud between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the feud between Palestinians and Jews. However, the truth about the Holocaust and World War II has been distorted, and the real story is that the black nobility was trying to kill off 25 million Russians.  Hudus reveals that she was in the World Bank legal department and learned about the trust set up by Jos\u00e9 Rizal and Ferdinand Marcos, which contained the world's wealth. The black nobility couldn't take it back due to the statute of limitations. She also talks about controlled opposition, where people lie and try to confuse her, but she has managed to figure out the truth with the help of others.  Hudus introduces the power transition model, a way to predict how people would want things to be if they were involved in decision-making. This model can be used to create a kinder world, even if governments are still corrupt. She emphasizes the importance of caring for each other and working together to create heaven on earth.  Hudus also talks about the power of music and mentions a song called Jerusalem Maya, which is sung at 8 am and 8 pm to bring people together. She concludes by mentioning Jiru Samaya, a gospel song that reminds us that we are all living in Jerusalem and guarding each other, working together to create a new reality where we love and care for each other.  Key points:  * The black nobility has been controlling and manipulating people for centuries * The truth about the Holocaust and World War II has been distorted * Jos\u00e9 Rizal and Ferdinand Marcos set up a trust containing the world's wealth * The power transition model can be used to create\nDocument 124\nThe speaker, claiming to be the Postmaster General of the world, addresses the Joint Chiefs of Staff, NATO forces, and the Russian and Chinese militaries. They assert their authority as a commander-in-chief and a muster master general, referencing their role in exposing the Universal Postal Union's alleged Ponzi scheme. The speaker criticizes the 2020 US presidential election, labeling it a \"scam\" and a \"make-believe show.\" They demand that the military secure the borders and prevent foreign invasion, citing their authority to command the US military. The speaker emphasizes the importance of communication and correct grammar, suggesting that the US is vulnerable due to its citizens' lack of skill sets. They warn that the US will not surrender and that the military must be prepared to defend the country's borders. The speaker also references their role in the court-martialing of Bush and Cheney and their position as Chief Judge of the US Supreme Court and the World Court.\nDocument 125\nAs we navigate the current global crisis, a global currency reset is not just a financial event, but a world reset in many areas. The economy has come to a standstill, with many businesses closed and people out of work. However, some industries are thriving, and this reset will bring about significant changes.  Hollywood, the anime industry, and the energy sector will undergo a major reset, with new players emerging and old ones disappearing. The banking system will be forced to change, and the restaurant business will see a significant number of closures. The debt crisis will also be addressed, with a possible reset of student loans and back taxes.  This reset will also bring about a change in world leaders, with many stepping down. The prison industry, which has been criticized for its treatment of minorities, may see a significant overhaul. The church will also undergo a reset, with many megachurches collapsing due to financial and other scandals.  The manufacturing industry will see a significant shift, with the US and other countries renegotiating trade deals and bringing manufacturing back home. China, which was supposed to be the next central banking hub, has lost its status, and a hammer will come down on them in the future.  This is not just a global currency reset, but a world reset in many areas, with many industries, people, and things resetting almost like starting over. As we look forward to this event, we should be excited and ready to increase what we have to make our lives better, and to make this world a better place.\nDocument 126\nHello everyone, I'm Richard, and welcome to If You Only Knew. Today, we're discussing several topics, including the reduced police presence in New York City, the US withdrawal from the World Health Organization, and the COVID-19 vaccine.   The US has officially left the World Health Organization, following a strong letter from President Trump requesting major changes. Despite this, the US has awarded Novavaxine $1.4 billion for a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness International, which was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.   The article also touches on the topic of health and vaccines, mentioning that the average person in the UK is aware of Bill Gates and his plan to vaccinate and chip the planet. The article also discusses the inevitable lowering of death counts, which will lead to the deep state needing to stir fear in any way they can.   The article also mentions the new procedure for counting infected and cases, which assumes that one individual can result in a larger number of cases, regardless of precautions taken. This will likely continue until the election.   The article also discusses the recent news of a homemade torture chamber found, which reminds one of the movie Hostel. The article speculates that this could be related to adrenochrome and asks for the viewer's opinion.   The article also discusses the New York Attorney General's call to cease and desist fundraising in New York State for BLM. The article speculates that BLM may be trying to start a civil war and that the mainstream media is focusing on white-on-black crime to fit their narrative.   The article also discusses Kanye West's decision to run for president and how it may benefit or hurt President Trump. The article also discusses Tom Hanks' recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, which some believe may be a glitch or a sign that he's not at home.   The article also\nDocument 127\nThe committee failed to reach a decision on the matter. However, it raises a crucial point: how did the false accusations of the president colluding with Russians and being treasonous arise? The evidence now shows these claims were baseless, dominating the administration for two years. The Mueller report's findings were misrepresented, suggesting the opposite of what was actually concluded.\nDocument 128\nThe speaker discusses the ongoing efforts to expose election fraud and restore the integrity of the US election system. Sidney Powell, a key figure in this effort, has stated that her intent is to expose all the fraud she can find, regardless of party affiliation. Powell believes that the evidence she's compiling is overwhelming, showing that a software tool was used to shift millions of votes from President Trump to Biden.  The speaker compares Powell's efforts to a two-front war, with Giuliani's team working on the paper side and Powell's team working on the electronic side. Both fronts need to be addressed to win the war. The speaker emphasizes the importance of staying focused and avoiding drama, as the public's response will be critical in determining the outcome.  The speaker also references an article by Molly McCann, which describes the election as having two tracks: the regular fraud and the electronic fraud. The speaker encourages viewers to focus on track one, the Pacific Theater, and to explain the fraud to the general public, lobby state legislatures, and put pressure on Governor Kemp to conduct a rigorous audit in Georgia.  The speaker also discusses the importance of avoiding distractions and staying calm, as the biggest problem is how the public will respond. They emphasize that every American has the power to win the election if they want to, and that it's a matter of resolve, discipline, and drive.  Finally, the speaker references Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" and quotes the phrase \"appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak.\" They argue that those who say the situation is hopeless are either working for the deep state or don't understand the art of war. The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to join the fight and to take the information provided on independent channels and network it to others.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Gold and Silver (Document: 118): Mentions investing in gold, silver, and Bitcoin as a safer investment.\n    [2] Election Scam (Document: 124): Mentions the 2020 US presidential election as a \"scam\" and a \"make-believe show.\"\n    [2] Global Reset (Document: 125): Mentions a global currency reset and a world reset in many areas.\n    [2] Lockdown Protests (Document: 120): Mentions protests against government mandates and lockdowns.\n    [2] Black Nobility (Document: 123): Mentions the black nobility and their alleged control and manipulation of people for centuries.\n    [2] Radio Show (Document: 119): Mentions a radio show called Operation Freedom Briefings.\n    [2] Global Financial System (Document: 121): Mentions the collapse of the global financial system and the potential for a global currency reset.\n    [2] Election Fraud (Document: 128): Mentions efforts to expose election fraud and restore the integrity of the US election system.\n    [2] COVID-19 Vaccine (Document: 126): Mentions the COVID-19 vaccine and the US withdrawal from the World Health Organization.\n    [2] Currency Devaluation (Document: 122): Mentions the devaluation of the Iraqi dinar against the US dollar."}
{"summary":"Document 129\nThe speaker discusses the current market situation, stating that some blue-chip companies have dropped by 30-50% in just three weeks. They question whether it's an opportunity to invest or wait for a bottom. The speaker believes we're entering an economic catastrophe, not just a financial one, and compares it to the 1929-1933 depression. They mention that the Dow Jones went down 90% during that time, with a 12% dividend yield at the bottom.  The speaker explains that the stock market and economy are related but not the same, and that we're entering the trailing edge of a giant financial hurricane. They believe cash is not king due to governments creating new money, making it a rapidly depreciating asset. They also mention that most banks are bankrupt, and having cash in banks may lead to being \"bailed in\" by the government.  The speaker is a gold bull, believing it's the only financial asset that's not someone else's liability. They predict that gold will increase in value while common stocks will decrease. They also discuss the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which they believe is \"borderline criminally insane.\"  The speaker warns that the current situation will end badly, with mass layoffs and companies sending employees on leave. They believe we're just at the start of a depression, and that 10% unemployment will look good compared to what's coming. They conclude that in a depression, there are no real winners, and that everyone's standard of living will drop significantly.\nDocument 130\nIt's been two days since the last call, and not much new information has come in. Intel sources have gone quiet, which could be a good thing as less is more. The payouts for tiers 1, 2, and 3 have been made, but the bulk of Tier 3 payments are still pending. It's possible that the majority of those in intermediate groups will be paid out when exchanges start.  The groups, including B, A, cores, and others, have been considered as Tier 4A. However, some people have rolled them into Tier 3 groups. The email that will be sent out under the Wells Fargo servers will have an attachment or a printed version that can be used as proof of authorization for redemption.  The denar rate has been reinstated and is expected to revalue, possibly in the mid-fours, and then escalate to a much higher rate over 10 days. Dinar and dong holders may want to consider setting their appointments slightly later than sooner.  The redemption centers will have a printed version of the email that can be used as proof of authorization. The timing of the exchanges and redemption of Zims is still unclear, but it's believed that they will start on the day of the first day of disclosure.  The three days of darkness are designed for the deep state and their affiliates, and it's believed that we will be in the clear when it comes to that. Immediately after the three days of darkness, there will be days and days of disclosure, which will bring us a lot of truth about our history and current events. This disclosure will be televised or put out on the emergency alert system in eight-hour segments, three times a day, for 12 days.\nDocument 131\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 20, 2020.  POTUS would soon give an order to activate the Presidential Emergency Alert System, informing the public about a highly classified operation.  For four days, people would be asked to stay at home as the National Guard and US Marines removed traitors and federally indicted individuals.  The Tier 4 Internet Group would be notified of 800 numbers to set appointments for currency exchange and Zim redemption.  The global currency reset had to happen by April 30 to comply with the elders' requirement of 8-10 redemption days before going public on May 1.  Demass arrests were ongoing, with thousands of criminals and murderers of the deep state being arrested.  The World Court Police Force Interpol was working with local police entities to make arrests internationally.  Queen Elizabeth and Pope Francis were rumored to have been taken care of.  Mass arrests were expected to begin on Sunday evening, April 19, and extend for four days.  The Cabal's swift global monetary system had been discontinued, with the new CHIPS system in charge.  Members of the Cabal were no longer able to steal monies from the US or global monetary funds.  RVN stimulus monies were already moving on the new CHIPS system, making the RV unable to be stopped.  The Department of Defense would release security codes for the RV after cleanups were completed.  The IMF announced debt forgiveness for different countries, and the World Bank ordered the RV to begin.  The US Treasury was direct depositing 80 million social security stimulus checks, but the release was stopped after depositing 40 million checks due to 1% being deposited in the wrong accounts.  The release of stimulus checks was expected to resume after the cleanups were completed.  The elders allocated Dubai 1 RV funds to be released under the condition that Tier\nDocument 132\nDr. Jim Willey, a renowned expert, joined Silverfest to discuss the potential price of silver at the end of 2020. He mentioned that the Euro Central Bank is hosting a weekly meeting to iron out details for a proposed monetary system and energy technology system. According to Dr. Willey's source, Maxwell, the proposed equilibrium price for silver is $400 per ounce, with a goal of $700 per ounce and a 25:1 gold-to-silver ratio.  Dr. Willey highlighted silver's unique characteristics, including its isotopes, which have a 40% commonality, making it an attractive metal for various applications. He also discussed the increasing demand for silver in missiles, military defense systems, and the potential for a global reset, which could lead to a stable price for silver.  When asked about his forecast for the price of silver at the end of 2020, Dr. Willey stated that it depends on two factors: the presence of a legitimate market and the level of naked shorting. He predicted that if a legitimate market exists, the price of silver could reach $40-$50 per ounce, but if naked shorting continues, the price may be stuck in the mid-to-low $30s.  Dr. Willey also mentioned that he has a feeling that the global reset is happening, and a stable price for silver is required. He believes that once the reset occurs, the doors will break down, and the price of silver will surge.\nDocument 133\nLos Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar was arrested by the FBI this week, marking a significant development in a multi-year federal investigation into corruption and alleged pay-to-play practices at City Hall. The 172-page indictment alleges that Huizar accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from developers, including cash, casino chips, and other benefits.   According to the indictment, Huizar used his position to approve or stall large building projects, working through a web of corrupt city officials, lobbyists, consultants, and developers to line his pockets. The investigation has revealed a pay-to-play scheme in which Huizar solicited and accepted financial benefits from international and domestic developers in exchange for favorable official actions.  Huizar's arrest is the fifth and most high-profile person to be arrested in the ongoing corruption investigation. The Department of Justice and FBI officials stressed that the investigation will not end with Huizar's arrest, and several others are expected to be charged in the coming weeks.  The indictment alleges that Huizar operated a criminal enterprise, known as the Council District 14 enterprise, which had several objectives, including enriching its members and associates, advancing its political goals, and concealing its financial activities. The enterprise was created in 2013 by Huizar and Individual One, a former general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety.  The investigation has revealed several bribery schemes, including one in which a developer agreed to pay a half a million dollar cash bribe to secure Huizar's help in resolving a labor organization's appeal of a major real estate development. Another scheme involved a Chinese real estate firm that wanted to develop a large mixed-use project in Council District 14, which agreed to hire Huizar as a consultant and finance part of a Huizar family trip to China.  Huizar faces a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison if convicted of the RICO conspiracy charge. The investigation is ongoing,\nDocument 134\nThe speaker discusses a disturbing trend of security breaches and suspicious incidents surrounding President Trump over a 10-day period. These incidents include a teenager jumping the wall at Mar-a-Lago with a loaded AK-47, a man attempting to rush the Secret Service with a gun, a mysterious fire at a generator plant at JFK Airport, and shots being fired at an Air Force helicopter near the White House. The speaker believes these incidents are indicative of people having their backs against the wall and trying to intimidate the president.  The speaker also discusses the First Step Act, a bill signed into law by President Trump that aims to reform the US criminal justice system. The bill has helped thousands of people get released from prison, including those who were wrongly sentenced or had their sentences reduced. The speaker highlights the success of the bill, citing the release of over 3,000 people from prison and the enrollment of over 16,000 inmates in drug treatment programs.  The speaker criticizes the media and politicians like Sean King for not giving President Trump credit for his accomplishments, including the First Step Act. They argue that if people were aware of the president's efforts to reform the criminal justice system, they would be more supportive of him.  The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of getting out to vote and bringing awareness to the great things President Trump has done, particularly with the First Step Act. They believe that if people are informed, they will see the president's accomplishments and re-elect him.\nDocument 135\nThe speaker discusses their Muslim faith and how it has not influenced their Christian upbringing. They clarify that the US is not a Christian nation, but rather a diverse country with people from various backgrounds. The speaker also mentions their high approval ratings in their birth country, Kenya, and their visit there as the first sitting American president from Kenya. They then transition to discussing their flexibility after the election, implying a change in approach, and mention a conversation with Vladimir. The speaker concludes by dismissing concerns about election rigging and ends with a mix of blessings and curses for America.\nDocument 136\nHere is a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  As of May 6, 2020, the Restored Republic via GCR update reported significant progress. President Trump was at Camp David with the President of Zimbabwe, and Fleming's military intel contact reported that the rest of the $1,200 economic impact payments would go out this week and redemption\/exchange appointments would happen by the first of the week. The Department of Defense released the 800-hash-S release, and the Admiral would release liquidity from Tuesday, May 5th onwards. The expectation was for full payouts in Hong Kong and other centers by Tuesday evening, May 5th, for historic bonds, including Yellow Dragon bonds, Chinese Railroad Super Petroli bonds, Mexican gold bonds, and high-valued, exotic, treasuries.  The banks were finalizing getting enough staff in the redemption centers and overcoming some hiccups from exchange staff reticent to serve due to potential COVID-19 infection. Demock fear-mongering had enough alternate staff in place to be ready to start any time this week. On Monday, May 4th, Marx's Hong Kong contact reported that he was expecting bond payouts on Tuesday evening, May 5th. The Department of Defense through the U.S. Treasury told HSBC and Wells Fargo that Wells Fargo was to send out the 500,000 plus 800 hash notification emails by Tuesday, May 5th.  The IMF would start general public exchanging foreign currencies at the new international rates at local banks around June 1st. Tier 4A and B would go approximately at the same time, within hours. The Department of Defense security teams determined that Iran and Saudi Arabia should still be in the redemption exchange offering, first basket, because deep state control has been weakened enough in those countries.  The U.S. returned to constitutional law as of May 1, 2020.\nDocument 137\nIndian in the Machine shares a revelation from channelers Ivo and Sharon that an extraterrestrial has acknowledged JFK Jr. is alive and will be the first president of a Nasa-compliant United States. This ties into a secret war, with the light hats declaring victory. The channelers' messages are credible and becoming more commonplace, allowing for confirmation of information. This is part of the spiritual awakening, with energy being channeled through various means. The story involves mystery, intrigue, leadership, corruption, and election meddling, ultimately leading to the restoration of the United States Republic and the planet's entry into a golden age.\nDocument 138\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. I'll be brief today as we have a conference call with the IMF in one minute. We're discussing the negotiations between the IMF and the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) regarding the revaluation of the dinar.   Iraq's primary concern is paying government salaries, particularly for the last quarter. The IMF has agreed to make loans for this purpose, but only if Iraq reinstitutes their currency at a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar. The CBI plans to initiate the National Education Program in December, a prerequisite for deleting the zeros from the currency.  There are two types of currency: the old provisional currency, which will be worth less due to the deletion of zeros, and the new IQD, which will be the new currency without zeros. The release of the new IQD from regional banks and the coinage in January will follow.  The CBI aims to implement Dr. Shabibi's 2011-2012 plan, which involves reinstituting the dinar at a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar, then floating it on the Forex. This could lead to an increased value of the dinar to $3.50-$4 in 10-30 days.  Parliamentary actions, auctions, and negotiations for the 2020 budget are ongoing. The IMF and CBI are finalizing negotiations on the re-institutional rate, which will determine the initial float rate on the Forex. January 2021 still looks promising for the revaluation of the dinar.  For those new to our program, I recommend listening to our call from December 2nd for more information and Q&A. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you next week.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Presidential Election (Document: 135): Discusses the presidential election and the speaker's Muslim faith.\n    [2] Currency Revaluation (Document: 138): Discusses the revaluation of the dinar and the potential for an increased value.\n    [2] Global Reset (Document: 132, 137): Mentions the potential for a global reset and the impact on the price of silver.\n    [2] Currency Exchange (Document: 130, 131, 136): Mentions the redemption of Zims, currency exchange, and the global currency reset.\n    [2] Security Breaches (Document: 134): Discusses the security breaches and suspicious incidents surrounding President Trump.\n    [2] Corruption (Document: 133): Discusses the corruption investigation into Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar.\n    [2] Economic Crisis (Document: 129): Discusses the current market situation and the potential for an economic catastrophe."}
{"summary":"Document 139\nToday's episode is titled \"It's Time to Batten Down the Hatches.\" The host, Richard, discusses various news headlines, including the ongoing protests in Portland and other cities, the removal of national monuments, and the growing solidarity among conservatives. He also touches on the topic of mail-in voting and the president's decision to cancel a large GOP rally in Florida.  Richard highlights the hypocrisy of the mainstream media and the Democrat Party, citing examples such as the New York Times' coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic and their recent lawsuit for making up a COVID story. He also discusses the growing awareness among Americans that China is not an ally and that the CCP is forcing Chinese Christians to renounce their faith.  The host emphasizes the importance of citizen journalists and digital soldiers in exposing the truth and waking up Americans to the agenda of the deep state. He notes that social media was originally a tool developed by the deep state but was overtaken by a movement, and that it is now being used against them.  Richard also discusses the recent arrests and indictments of high-ranking officials, including the Ohio House Speaker and a former Congressman, and the growing awareness among Americans that the masks are not about the virus but about control and power.  The host concludes by emphasizing the need for Americans to be prepared for whatever comes next and to be ready to take back their country. He encourages viewers to like, subscribe, and share the video and to follow him on social media platforms.\nDocument 140\nThe FBI has arrested Rodrigo Santos, a former San Francisco official, for stealing $420,000 from his clients. Santos, a structural engineer and co-owner of a firm, was charged with bank fraud and faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. He was appointed to the Building Inspection Commission by former Mayor Willie Brown in 2000 and reappointed by Gavin Newsom in 2004.  Santos' arrest is the latest in a series of corruption scandals involving San Francisco officials. Mohamed Nourou, the former head of San Francisco Public Works, was arrested in February for corruption, bribery, and kickbacks. Nourou had ties to Gavin Newsom and was praised by a former Democrat Party strategist as \"Mr. Clean\" before his arrest.  Current San Francisco Mayor London Breed has also been linked to Nourou and accepted a $5,600 gift from him before his arrest. The co-defendant in Nourou's case has agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges and cooperate with the ongoing investigation.  The FBI has been investigating corruption in San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection, and the director of the department has been suspended following allegations of wrongdoing. The city's Department of Building Inspection head was also suspended after allegations of wrongdoing were uncovered during a city attorney probe of Mohamed Nuru.  Rodrigo Santos is accused of depositing $478,000 in client money into his personal account and submitting forged invoices to the FBI. He also allegedly participated in scams to allow illegal and possibly dangerous construction work on nine different properties in the city.  The Santos case has no immediately clear links to Mohamed Nourou's case, but both investigations have parallels. The city attorney's office has investigated the Department of Building Inspection in connection to Nourou, and city officials have alleged the department is rife with corruption.\nDocument 141\nThe speaker, who claims to be the Supreme Chief Judge at the United States Supreme Court, is giving closure to the American people on the fake presidential election debate. They explain that the United States government came out of international bankruptcy in 1999, which means they had to follow new guidelines for electing a president and setting a judicial system.   The speaker points out that there was no flag on the stage during the debate, which is a symbol that sets the venue for a president. They claim that the flag is the copyright of the speaker and their ex-business partner, and it's a crucial element in establishing a legitimate presidential election.   The speaker also criticizes the use of italicized words and long dashes on the page, which they claim are used to omit sentences and vacate contracts. They argue that this is a theatrical performance, a scam being perpetrated by the U.S. Postal Service and the fraudulent actors on stage.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of correct grammar and communication, and promises to set the terms of the contracts in their Supreme Court. They urge the American people to maintain the continuity of the government and not break out in civil war.  The speaker also criticizes the behavior of the candidates during the debate, calling it rude, obnoxious, and degrading. They claim that the candidates' families are involved in crime syndicates and that the public needs to know the mechanics of what's going on before they can identify who's moving the money in their black row financial battles.  The speaker concludes by thanking the American people for giving them the space to give closure on the fakeness being perpetrated upon them, and promises to field their questions and help set the terms of the contracts.\nDocument 142\nThe Crypto Warriors are changing the world, and the way of the Crypto Warriors is to not rely on banks. The host discusses the recent silver price drop, which he believes is a result of a massive sell-off of 350,000 contracts, nearly four times the average daily volume. This is a sign of a battle in the silver market, and the host warns to keep an eye on open interest. He estimates that the current open interest is 17,000 contracts, but it needs to drop to 9,000-10,000 to meet delivery demands.  The host also discusses the CFTC's role in regulating the market, suggesting that they are more interested in running cover for manipulations rather than regulating free and honest trading. He believes that the current market is being manipulated, and that the CFTC is aware of it.  The host also touches on the current political climate, suggesting that Trump may be going into hiding due to the potential for widespread arrests. He believes that the signs are there, and that the timing is perfect for a major event.  The host ends the video by encouraging viewers to join his private road, where he shares his predictions for the future of silver, cryptos, and the system. He also gives away 50 Theta tokens and 50 Theta Fuel with every private road subscription.\nDocument 143\nHere is a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  The Restored Republic via GCR update as of April 23, 2020, announced that the Pentagon Pedophile Task Force has rescued thousands of tortured children from underground tunnels across the US. The task force claimed to have more to go, and the reality is that those who worship Satan are raping, torturing, and murdering children. The public is urged to pray and fast for the children and the troops risking their lives to rescue them.  Judy Note, Tier 4B, was expected to receive the 800-S sometime around Thursday, April 23. Nick Fleming's update on Wednesday, April 22, indicated that the start was close, and the state governor coordination with redemption appointments in each state was being resolved.  The gold standard could be announced at any time, and the RV could not be stopped after the elders released global currency reset monies from the Dubai one holding account. The petrodollar officially tanked on Monday, April 20, and the deep state's control over the currency was being dismantled.  The US military and Marines have brought out over 5,000 tortured children from underground tunnels since last October, and many of the over 170,000 sealed indictments filed in federal courts concern pedophilia. Billionaire George Soros and former US Presidents George Bush Jr. and Barack Obama were believed arrested and in or headed for Gitmo.  President Trump and the First Lady Melania wanted the public to know that US troops were saving babies and children from unspeakable atrocities in underground tunnels. The troops were still fighting the bad guys, and the killing was mostly the bad guys who were dying.  The Q Phenomenon, Secret Groups, and Illuminati were discussed in a series of documentaries, including \"Full Special Investigation, Donald Trump vs. the Deep State\" and \"Out of Shadows Official.\" The documentaries covered topics such\nDocument 144\nThe speaker, a former Royal Marines Commando, explains the differences between the British Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS), and the US Navy SEALs. The SAS is a hybrid unit, drawing from all branches of the British military, including Army, Navy, and RAF. They have their own boat troops, which perform Navy SEAL-type operations.   The SBS, on the other hand, is primarily recruited from Marines and focuses on boat-based operations. The US Navy SEALs, particularly SEAL Team 6, are the main counter-terrorism unit within the US Navy. They have a rigorous selection process and are often confused with Delta Force, a separate unit modeled after the SAS.   The speaker notes that the US has a much larger special forces community, with over 100,000 personnel, compared to the UK's 500. He also highlights the diversity within the SAS, which draws from various branches of the British military, making it a strength.\nDocument 145\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. I'll be brief due to a conflicting call with European agencies. Today's focus is on the Iraqi dinar revaluation and the US elections' impact. The Iraqi parliament has completed the second reading of the 2021 budget, which may lead to the dinar's re-institution by January. However, the window for revaluation is closing, and if not reinstated, it may create complications.  The Republican party is divided on whether to impeach Donald Trump due to the information he's threatening to declassify, which could destroy both Democrats and Republicans. The US elections' outcome is uncertain, and a Biden administration may lead to a green light for Iran to reinsert itself in Iraq's affairs.  A Biden administration may also rescind Executive Order 13303, allowing the US to participate in the dinar exchange. However, this is unlikely due to political reasons and the potential backlash from 8 million new American millionaires. The IMF and global agencies want to see a single worldwide digital currency, which could lead to the dinar's revaluation.  The next week is critical, and I suggest reviewing our call from December 16th for information on our turnkey program to assist with the RV. We'll be working with trust applications and will be back on the call next Wednesday.\nDocument 146\nLinda Forsythe discusses the difference between peaceful assembly and violent protesting, questioning the motives behind recent riots. She shares a video analysis by Brian Carone, which presents a different narrative of the George Floyd incident. Forsythe suggests that the riots may be staged to instill fear and control people, rather than addressing legitimate concerns. She emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and encourages viewers to look at different sides of the story.  Forsythe also touches on the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that the riots may be used to keep people locked down and businesses shut. She argues that peaceful protesting is a more effective way to make a voice heard and that the current riots are not a constructive way to address issues. She recommends watching the video analysis on her YouTube channel, Seabine International News Network, to form one's own opinion.  Ultimately, Forsythe calls for people to think logically and recognize that they are being manipulated. She encourages viewers to look at things with their own eyes and to start recognizing what's really going on. She also mentions that she will be continuing her 5-part series on 9-11, which she had put on hold due to the chaos and crisis situations unfolding.\nDocument 147\nThe speaker visited a Sam's Club store and found that the watches and jewelry were sold out, but to their surprise, there were two pallets of toilet paper available. They joked about the situation, referencing the economic struggles and the potential collapse of the US economy. They sarcastically thanked Donald Trump for the toilet paper, implying that the government's bailouts would eventually lead to economic collapse, rendering the dollar useless. The speaker humorously suggested using dollar bills as toilet paper in the summer and burning them in the fireplace in the winter, hinting at a dystopian future.\nDocument 148\nThe speaker claims that cloning techniques have been used since 1938, with eight countries involved in the process. They explain that a clone can be created by taking two cells from a person's body, giving them an electrical charge, and using a pituitary hormone extract to accelerate growth. The original technology was allegedly given to the US government by the Grace family.  The speaker suggests that the government and elite have been using clones to replace public figures, including presidents, to maintain control and extend their lifespan. They claim that many presidents have been replaced, citing George Bush as an example. The speaker also mentions Hitler, Stalin, and Castro, suggesting that they were all replaced with clones.  The speaker claims that the process of creating a clone involves taking a person's memories and consciousness, which are stored on a CD, and downloading them into the clone. They suggest that the clones are used to manipulate and control people, and that extraterrestrials may also be involved in the process.  The speaker provides examples of celebrities who they claim are clones, including David Chappelle, Britney Spears, and Kanye West. They suggest that these clones are used to promote a specific agenda and to control the narrative. The speaker also mentions Princess Diana, claiming that she was cloned and that the original brain was transferred into the clone.  The speaker concludes by stating that clones have no soul or spirit, and that they are used to manipulate and control people. They suggest that many public figures are clones, and that the public is being deceived.\nDocument 149\nDavid Morgan from The Morgan Report discusses a recent article by Jeff Clark of GoldSilver.com titled \"New Silver Supply is Drying Up Faster Than Death Valley.\" The article highlights the decline in silver mine production, with the top 10 largest silver-producing countries seeing a significant drop in production over the last four years.   According to the CPM Group's 2020 silver survey, the annual additions to silver mine capacity from development projects have been declining since 2013. Additionally, the article notes that silver was in a deficit for 15 straight years from 1990 to 2006, but the above-ground silver stockpiles have been building since then.  The article also mentions that 70-80% of silver supply comes from base metal mining, with copper, gold, and zinc being the primary sources. However, base metal mining is expected to decline in the coming years, which could lead to a tightening of silver supply.  David Morgan also discusses the availability of silver for investment, citing a chart from Nick Laird showing that there are approximately 1.3 billion ounces of silver in ETFs, depositories, and COMEX inventories. He also notes that there are 1.8 billion ounces of silver in the form of American Eagle coins and other government-issued coins.  Morgan concludes that the low silver price has caught up to the industry, holding it hostage, and that a rising silver price will be necessary to solve the mine supply dilemma. He also notes that the grade of silver is constantly declining, and that this trend is expected to continue.  Overall, the article suggests that the silver supply is expected to tighten further, and that the price of silver is likely to rise in the coming years.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Election (Document: 141, 145): Mentions the presidential election debate and the US elections' impact on the Iraqi dinar revaluation.\n    [2] World Order (Document: 143): Mentions the idea that the world is being controlled by a small group of people and the need for the public to be aware of this.\n    [2] Alien Abductions (Document: 148): Mentions the idea that extraterrestrials are involved in the cloning process and the manipulation of public figures.\n    [2] Currency Revaluation (Document: 145):\n    [2] Economic Stability (Document: 149): Mentions the need for economic stability and the importance of a strong economy.\n    [2] Gold and Silver (Document: 142, 149): Mentions the price of gold and silver and the expected rise in silver prices due to a tightening of silver supply.\n    [2] COVID-19 Pandemic (Document: 146): Mentions the use of the COVID-19 pandemic to control people and keep them locked down.\n    [2] Iraq (Document: 145): Mentions the Iraqi dinar revaluation and the impact of the US elections on Iraq's affairs.\n    [2] Critical Thinking (Document: 146): Mentions the importance of critical thinking and looking at different sides of the story.\n    [2] Media Manipulation (Document: 139): Mentions the use of social media to manipulate public opinion and the importance of critical thinking.\n    [2] Economic Collapse (Document: 147): Mentions the potential collapse of the US economy and the use of dollar bills as toilet paper.\n    [2] Corruption (Document: 140): Mentions the arrest of a former San Francisco official for bank fraud and corruption scandals involving San Francisco officials.\n    [2] Protests (Document: 139, 146): Mentions public demonstrations and riots.\n    [2] Law Enforcement (Document: 140): Mentions the importance of law enforcement and the need for the public to be aware of their rights.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 143): Mentions the idea that the US government is being controlled by a deep state and the need for the public to be aware of this.\n    [2] Media Censorship (Document: 139): Mentions the idea that the media is being censored and manipulated to control public opinion.\n    [2] Economic Opportunity (Document: 145): Mentions the potential for economic opportunity and the need for the public to be prepared for a changing economy.\n    [2] Public Figures (Document: 148): Mentions the idea that many public figures are clones and that the public is being deceived.\n    [2] Science (Document: 144): Mentions the importance of science and the need for the public to be aware of scientific facts.\n    [2] Currency Revaluation (Document: 145): Mentions the potential revaluation of the Iraqi dinar and the impact of a Biden administration on the US economy.\n    [2] Constitutional Law (Document: 141): Mentions the importance of constitutional law and the need for the public to be aware of their rights.\n    [2] Government Transparency (Document: 140): Mentions the need for government transparency and accountability in the face of corruption scandals.\n    [2] Tyranny (Document: 143): Mentions the idea that the US government is becoming tyrannical and the need for the public to be aware of this.\n    [2] Patriotism (Document: 148): Mentions the importance of patriotism and the need for the public to be aware of their rights and freedoms.\n    [2] Cloning (Document: 148): Mentions the use of cloning techniques to replace public figures and the creation of clones for control and manipulation.\n    [2] Conspiracy Theories (Document: 143): Mentions the Q Phenomenon, Secret Groups, and Illuminati, and the idea that the US government is being controlled by a deep state.\n    [2] Banking System (Document: 148): Mentions the idea that the banking system is being manipulated and controlled by a small group of people.\n    [2] Government Control (Document: 147): Mentions the potential for government control and manipulation of the public through the use of cloning techniques.\n    [2] Silver Supply (Document: 149): Mentions the decline in silver mine production and the expected tightening of silver supply.\n    [2] Special Forces (Document: 144): Mentions the differences between the British Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS), and the US Navy SEALs."}
{"summary":"Document 150\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. Today's call will be a bit different as I'll be listening to an international call from Brussels regarding the situation in Iraq and the upcoming election. This call is relevant to the currencies, particularly the dinar, and I'll be sharing some key information with you.  We're looking at a plausible date for the reinstitution of the dinar in January 2021, but there's also a scenario for October. The two key issues in Iraq are banking reforms and Iranian interference. The new governor of the CBI, Mustafa Galeb Mahef, has announced the release of a white paper addressing the reeducation of Iraqi citizens, the deletion of zeros, and the stopping of auctions.  The auctions have not stopped due to the 90% of revenue generated from them. The government is working to find alternative revenue sources by expanding the private economy and liberalizing banking regulations. They're also eliminating 90% of private banks and initiating 20,000 individual contracting programs to rebuild infrastructure.  The government lacks sufficient US dollar reserves to pay salaries and fund contracts, making the reinstatement and revaluation of the currency the most plausible solution. Regarding the Iranian issue, corrupt officials are being neutralized, and the accountability and justice law will be implemented after the elections in June.  The Trump sanctions have crippled Iran's economy, and they're likely to try to hang in until after the US elections. If Joe Biden wins, Iran may be back in business, but if Donald Trump is reelected, they'll be forced to come to the table and cut a deal, including Iraq's exit from Iran's internal affairs.  After the meeting between al-Khazemi and Donald Trump, Khazemi visited NATO, and it seems that NATO will replace the US as the spearhead of coalition forces to force Iran to exit Iraq. This is good news, and everything\nDocument 151\nThe speaker discusses a timeline of year zero, which is a projection of future events based on data analysis. The timeline starts in January 2021 and spans the year, with various waves of energy and emotional components influencing the events. The speaker notes that the data has an error rate of 19 months, which means that the actual events may occur 19 months earlier or later than predicted.  The speaker identifies several key events, including a cultural revolution, economic issues, and a collapse of the rule of law. The cultural revolution is expected to be a major driver of change, with the economic wave and social disruption wave following closely behind. The speaker also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have an impact throughout the year, with each wave of the disease bringing more deaths and disruptions.  The speaker mentions several specific events that are forecast to occur, including a surprise from officialdom, the release of secret tech, and riots that spill over into secret bases. The release of tech is expected to be a major game-changer, potentially leading to the liberation of information and a shift in the future of social unrest.  The speaker notes that the data sets are accurate in terms of correlation with current events, but the timing is off. They plan to continue examining the data sets and creating videos to share their findings. The speaker also mentions that they are working on other projects, including applying the theory of Boscovich to physics and material design.  The speaker encourages viewers to check their website, halfpasthuman.com, for updates and to support their work by purchasing Pure Sleep products. They also note that they are keeping a low profile due to concerns about Twitter and YouTube's policies.\nDocument 152\nChris Marcus is joined by Bill Murphy of LeMetropole Cafe to discuss the wild action in the metals market, particularly gold and silver. Bill shares his thoughts on the recent Fed actions, including the $1.5 trillion injection and the accelerated treasury purchases. He believes that the gold cartel is running out of physical gold and is trying to manipulate the price through the futures market.  Bill notes that the ratio of gold to silver is absurdly high at 125 to 1, making silver an attractive investment opportunity. He also mentions that the premiums at coin stores and bullion stores are high, making it difficult to buy physical silver. Chris agrees that silver is cheap relative to gold and that investors will want to buy it.  The conversation turns to the recent divergences in the gold and silver markets, with gold rallying while silver is down. Bill attributes this to the gold cartel buying up shares of silver miners, anticipating a big move in the silver market. Chris notes that this is similar to what happened in 2008, where the price of silver dropped sharply while the premiums for physical metal increased.  Bill expresses his disgust with the Justice Department's handling of the case against J.P. Morgan, which he believes is a criminal enterprise. He notes that the Department of Justice is not doing enough to address the manipulation of the gold and silver markets.  The conversation also touches on the idea of a price reset, where the gold and silver prices are adjusted to reflect the physical supply and demand. Bill believes that this is likely to happen soon, and that the gold and silver prices will go \"nuts\" to the upside.  Finally, Chris and Bill discuss the Fed's actions and whether they are making themselves irrelevant. Bill notes that the Fed's actions are not having the desired effect, and that the economy is still struggling. Chris agrees that the Fed's actions are not working, and that the stock market is being propped\nDocument 153\nWelcome to the Day on Injection program, show number three. Today, we're discussing the current state of our way of life and the potential consequences of recent events. I'll share a personal story about my birth, where I was delivered using a vacuum and suffered from deformities, but with the help of my mother, I made a full recovery.  We're now facing a global crisis, with the coronavirus spreading rapidly. The US government is considering sending two $1,000 checks to most American individuals, but this will likely come with restrictions and an expiry date. The Federal Reserve is also considering buying corporate debt, which could lead to a loss of our capitalistic society.  The coronavirus strategy involves restricting people for 14 days to allow the healthcare system to prepare for the influx of patients. However, this won't be enough, and we'll likely see a surge in cases once restrictions are lifted. The government is preparing for this by setting up mobile hospitals and emergency response systems.  We're also facing a dollar short squeeze, with the Fed pumping $500 billion into the market daily. This is a sign of hyper-deflation, where many things change, and we need to re-evaluate our values and priorities. I encourage you to think about your own values and what's most important to you as a family member, friend, or individual.  In Italy, we've seen armies taking bodies due to a lack of preparedness for crisis. I urge you to learn from this and take steps to prepare, such as having a duffel bag of cash, considering a second residency or passport, and thinking about your life insurance and career.  The markets are unlikely to close unless there's a significant escalation, and we're in an in-motion event with no reason to close it now. There are opportunities in forced selling, and I'll cover this in my upcoming newsletter. My new ebook is also available for free this month\nDocument 154\nRestored Republic update as of April 14, 2020.  Over 35,000 caged and tortured children were rescued by the military from Cabal-run underground tunnels.  The Pentagon Pedophile Task Force reported more to go.  The Departments of Defense and Justice green-lighted the RV, GCR for rollout through the US Treasury on Sunday, April 12.  CMKX and Prosperity Package deliveries were expected to begin within 24-36 hours.  Tier 4B Internet Group would receive notification for appointments to exchange, redeem around the same time as stimulus monies were released.  President Trump made a disaster declaration for all 50 states, admitting martial law and legal staging for the RV, GCR funds release.  The global collateral accounts started moving as of 9 p.m. EDT on April 12.  Paymasters were asked to return to their positions in the exchange process.  People were reporting having received their stimulus money by direct deposit, some pending in the bank to be liquid on Wednesday, April 15.  The St. Germain and Rodriguez Trusts, along with other global collateral accounts, opened in preparation for RV-GCR disbursements this week.  The storm is here, with Illuminati starting a pandemic for a new world order, while White Hats using it to rescue over 3,500 tortured children and arrest their perpetrators.  Grand jury subpoenas on FISA abuse were issued to political elites on Friday, April 10.  Trump hinted at a Nazara freedom from debt announcement this week.  The global coronavirus pandemic has been traced to the Wuxi Pharmaceutical Corporation in Wuhan, China owned by the Cabal's Ceres Foundation.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused Bill Gates of using vaccines as a strategic philanthropy to feed his many vaccine-related businesses and give him dictatorial control over global health policy.  Gates'\nDocument 155\nA major corruption investigation in Illinois has led to millions of dollars in legal fees for top Democrats, including House Speaker Michael Madigan and Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough.  Yarbrough, a close ally of Madigan, has been ordered by a federal judge to undergo court oversight for over a year due to allegations of patronage violations and unlawful political discrimination.  Madigan has spent $1.7 million in legal fees since 2019, while Yarbrough has spent over $1.1 million.  The investigation, led by U.S. Attorney John Lausch, has included multiple FBI raids and several arrests.  Lausch has been described as low-key, preferring to let evidence speak for itself rather than holding press conferences.  Madigan's campaign fund has paid nearly $462,000 in legal fees to a law firm that employs former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.  Despite the investigation, Madigan has not been charged with any wrongdoing and claims to be not a target of the probe.  The investigation has also led to the guilty plea of State Senator Martin Sandoval, who has agreed to cooperate in a corruption probe that spans from Chicago City Hall to suburban village halls to the State House.\nDocument 156\nThe Trump regime was punked by a group of TikTok teens who are part of the K-pop army. The teens, known as Zoomers or members of the Z generation, were born in the late 90s or early 2000s. They used TikTok, a social media platform popular among teenagers, to reserve thousands of tickets to a Trump rally in Oklahoma, with the intention of not attending and leaving empty seats. This was a clever move to mock the Trump regime. The term \"TikTok grandma\" refers to a 51-year-old Caucasian progressive liberal female from Iowa who is a teacher and uses TikTok to spread her views. She is well-versed in George Soros' socialist propaganda movement and uses rapper styles to enhance her online presence. Despite her efforts, the Trump regime may not win the war, but the TikTok grandma won this battle, entertaining many with her clever move.\nDocument 157\nDeb from Truthfication Chronicles shares Joe Biden's talking points, a 20-page document, and highlights some of the points she finds interesting or laughable. The document emphasizes that the 2020 election is the most critical of their lifetimes, and Joe Biden is the candidate who can defeat Donald Trump and move the country forward.   Deb agrees with Joe Biden that 2020 is a critical election, but she believes that four more years of Donald Trump would be beneficial for the country. She also notes that numerous fact-checkers have shot down Trump's lie about Joe Biden's actions in Ukraine.   The document discusses impeachment, Bernie and Bloomberg, Iowa expectations, electability, and getting things done. Deb criticizes the Democrats for making the impeachment process political and notes that the Senate's job is to try the president, while their job is to beat him.   Deb also addresses various topics, including Social Security, Medicare, and climate change. She expresses skepticism about Joe Biden's ability to deliver concrete progress and notes that he has a history of corruption, particularly in Ukraine and China.   Deb concludes that the talking points are a pack of lies and that the people who follow Joe Biden believe these things to be true, which is a little scary. She encourages viewers to be prepared to address these talking points with actual facts and to refute them.\nDocument 158\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 27, 2020. Judy Note reported that Sunday, April 26th, would be a day to remember as the final weekend of this journey. The IMF and Iraq situation, along with news from elders and officials, indicated a redemption and exchange start in different countries on Sunday, April 26th. All must be completed prior to Friday, May 1st, meaning the US had to start this week. The elders took over GCR, RV release, re-release Dubai funds, and RV'd the Iraqi dinar on Wednesday, April 22nd, with public announcements scheduled for Monday, April 27th.  Tier 4B Internet Group, ARS, 800 numbers release would be sometime Monday, April 27th to Wednesday, April 28th, with appointments beginning before Trump's big announcement about restoring the economy on Friday, May 1st. The cabal's deceitful misuse of 5G was imitating coronavirus, which they used to lock down the US and global economies. Two California ER doctors nuked Fauci's pandemic fraud as an indictment against.  President Trump and the Pentagon pedophile task force used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the Cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation. Trump was expected to call off the lockdown and ask Americans to come back to work this Friday, May 1st. The top 27 white dragon Chinese elders and the grandfather insisted that the final RV, GCR release be finished, and began completion of the final release last Sunday night, April 19th, into Monday, April 20th.  The US had no choice in the matter because the RV, GCR monies were released and are moving in a way that couldn't be stopped.

{"summary":"Document 159\nDavid Morgan is speaking with you from his backyard on April 9th, 2020. He's discussing the current economic situation and how it's affecting people's lives. He believes that the economic collapse or crisis has already begun and will continue to unfold. Morgan emphasizes that things have changed globally, including the supply chain, businesses, and personal safety.  He explains that the economy is stalled, and no matter how much money governments or the Federal Reserve throw at the problem, it won't solve it. Morgan predicts a contraction that will affect various aspects of life, from food to entertainment. He advises people to be mentally prepared for the new normal, which will be substantially different from what we're used to.  Morgan also discusses the importance of self-reliance and adapting to the changing circumstances. He notes that people can learn new skills using the internet, such as gardening, cooking, and other practical skills. He believes that there will be a movement towards a more agrarian culture, similar to the Great Depression era.  In terms of investments, Morgan discusses the stock market, real estate, and agriculture. He believes that the stock market is in a long-term downtrend, and real estate will be reset. He's concerned about the agriculture sector due to disruptions in the supply chain, water shortages, and climate change.  Morgan also talks about the metals market, specifically gold and silver. He believes that gold has performed well, but silver has underperformed. However, he expects silver to outperform gold in the future. He notes that both metals are highly coveted and held tightly, with little selling and mostly buying.  Morgan concludes by emphasizing the importance of being gentle with oneself, accepting the new reality, and being productive. He encourages people to learn new skills, reach out to old friends, and explore new interests.  Finally, Morgan discusses the Morgan Report, a subscription-based service that provides investment advice and\nDocument 160\nHello everyone, I'm barely getting an hour of sleep due to the current situation. I want to address the recent message from Debra, asking where Edge is. Edge and I still run this channel together, but she's dealing with personal issues. We'll continue our weekly podcast, discussing topics like the red pill and blue pill, which are relevant to the global consciousness.  The reason I made this video is to talk about censorship and big tech's draconian moves to silence dissenting voices. We have to be smart when using these platforms, as they're hunting keywords and certain phrases. We're careful with our content, avoiding certain topics and mantras to avoid being flagged.  I suggest watching the movie \"The Boat That Rocked\" to understand the concept of pirate radio and navigating a digital minefield. Some people are moving to old tech platforms, which is a good thing, as it helps break away from big tech's monopoly. However, having a presence on YouTube is still important, as it allows us to reach a wider audience and break through censorship.  Our goal is to change hearts and minds, not to make content strictly political or one-sided. We want to create a space where people can learn, change their opinions, or find new information. Dissenting voices are not welcome, and we have to be careful on mainstream platforms.  On alt tech, we can be more open and say what we want, but on mainstream platforms, we need to be cautious. The purge is real, and it's a full-scale Gestapo operation. We have to be smart and hold ourselves, as the only thing we control is ourselves and how we react to the situation.  It's essential to focus on ourselves, our inner world, and building our inner kingdom. This fight will be long, and we need to dig in and do everything we can to come out on top. Let's focus on changing hearts and minds\nDocument 161\nTonight, I was supposed to watch the Corey Feldman movie, \"The Truth About the Two Coreys,\" but it didn't go as planned. The movie was a live stream, and I had paid $20 for a ticket. However, when I tried to log in, I encountered technical issues, including a 403 error and a black screen.   It seemed like the stream was hacked, and a message appeared on the screen saying that hackers were trying to prevent the stream from airing. I was able to watch a portion of the movie, but it stopped after 17 minutes.   Many people were upset about the technical issues, and some claimed that the movie was a scam. However, I'm skeptical of these claims, especially since the people making them had very few followers on Twitter.   Corey Feldman has promised to tell the truth about his experiences with abuse in Hollywood, and I believe he's for real. The movie is supposed to have another showing today, and I'll try to watch it and let you know what happens.   In other news, a man in San Francisco was caught on camera leaving a dead raccoon on a table at a McDonald's. The incident is bizarre and raises concerns about cleanliness and safety. That's all for tonight, and I'll see you Wednesday morning with something more interesting.\nDocument 162\nThe speaker discusses a conversation between Mr. Popular, a senator, and a lady in a red coat, where they discuss a plan to harm President Trump. They mention that if Trump passes away, they will have finished him off. The speaker also highlights a conversation between Senator Menendez and Grandpa Munster, where they express concern about being recorded and discuss a plan to harm Trump.  The speaker then discusses a conversation between Swallswell and his friends, where they discuss a video that could be used to gain leverage against Trump. They also mention a conversation between Rumpelstiltskin and the gunner's wife, where Rumpelstiltskin makes a comment that is not as revealing as what the other guys say.  The speaker also discusses a conversation between Lindsey Graham and Swallswell, where they discuss a plan to switch votes in Florida. They also mention a conversation between a Republican source and a friend, where they discuss a plan to harm Trump.  The speaker highlights the behavior of Mike Pence, who has 20-20 peripheral vision and is very keyed in on Nancy Pelosi's voice. They also mention that Pence never quite looks at Pelosi, even though he is focused on her.  The speaker concludes by saying that they will continue to follow the conversation and provide updates. They also mention that they will be waiting for the president's speech and will continue to investigate the conversations.\nDocument 163\nThe speaker, Postmaster General Russell J. Gould, expresses concerns about the current state of society and the use of language. He claims that the \"Babel\" system, a fictitious grammar, has been used to confuse and manipulate people since 1999. This system allegedly erases the past and creates a \"no original contract\" condition, where people are unaware of their true nature and are subject to rules and laws that are not in their best interest.  Gould argues that the use of words like \"aboriginal\" has a negative connotation, as it implies a \"no original contract\" condition. He believes that people are erasing their cultural heritage and the past, which is necessary for learning from mistakes and moving forward.  Gould suggests that the \"quantum system\" he has set up can bypass the current system and provide a fair and just solution for those who have been damaged in the past. However, he also warns that moving to this system will allow those who perpetrated crimes against humanity to go unpunished.  The speaker encourages viewers to watch his film, \"Last Flag Standing,\" to learn more about the \"Babel\" system and the \"quantum banking system.\" He also invites viewers to visit his website, lastflagstanding.com, to learn more about correct communication and the \"quantum grammar\" system.  Key points:  * The \"Babel\" system is a fictitious grammar used to confuse and manipulate people. * The system erases the past and creates a \"no original contract\" condition. * The use of words like \"aboriginal\" has a negative connotation. * The \"quantum system\" can bypass the current system and provide a fair and just solution. * Moving to the \"quantum system\" will allow those who perpetrated crimes against humanity to go unpunished.\nDocument 164\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 30, 2020.  The Q movement supports President Trump and the Trust Plan.  Thousands of children were rescued from underground torture chambers of the cabal, and military troops risked their lives to save them.  An ancient doctrine of fasting and prayer was explained to support the mission.  On April 22nd, the elders released the GCR, RV, and the Iraqi Dinar was reinstated and revalued.  Liquidity was released in the US, China, Vietnam, and Australia on April 29th.  The deadline for Tier 4B Internet Group was April 30th to receive 800 numbers for redemption appointments.  The Pentagon Pedophile Task Force, led by President Trump, rescued over 50,000 traumatized children from the cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation.  The mission was accomplished during the pandemic, and President Trump asked state governors to call off the lockdown and invite constituents to go back to work.  Sealed indictments were filed in federal courts across the nation, containing charges of pedophilia.  Many high-profile individuals, including George Soros, George Bush Jr., and Barack Obama, were rumored to be arrested and facing military tribunals for treason and other serious crimes.  The redemption process for currency and ZIM bondholders would be done in two parts, with the first part being exchanged at contract rates and the second part being delivered to the individual.  The default ZIM rate of $11,000,000 per 100 T ZIM note would be offered at the first appointment, and higher rates could be negotiated in a second appointment with a wealth manager and private banking team.  President Trump has given US banks a list of 250 humanitarian and job creation projects to invest in, and individuals could present their reasons and or humanitarian project to ask for higher rates.

Pfizer aims to apply for emergency use authorization by late November. The vaccine will not be mandatory initially, but the government plans to implement a gradual plan to persuade people to take it, with restrictions and shaming campaigns for those who refuse.  Pfizer has a concerning track record, including:  - Receiving the largest criminal fine in US history for mispromoting medicines and paying kickbacks to doctors. - Pleading guilty to misbranding the painkiller Bextra. - Being involved in defective heart valves that led to over 100 deaths. - Settling a class action suit over a diabetes medication that caused liver failure. - Being fined \u00a390 million in the UK for unfair pricing to the NHS. - Paying millions to doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin. - Committing racketeering fraud in its marketing of the drug. - Bribing overseas doctors to increase foreign sales. - Being sued by Nigerian families for testing a new antibiotic on children without consent.  The speaker questions whether Pfizer is trustworthy enough to develop a safe and effective vaccine, given its history of unethical behavior.\nDocument 168\nThe host discusses various topics related to the current global crisis, including:  The silver and gold shortages, with prices increasing due to supply chain disruptions and mine closures. He recommends investing in silver options and provides a link to a special report on the topic.  The importance of self-discipline and personal development during times of crisis, citing the need to stay focused and adaptable.

The impact of the crisis on corporate America, including bailouts, loan programs, and changes to executive compensation.  The host also discusses the importance of compassion and community during times of crisis, highlighting stories of people helping each other and companies waiving subscription fees.  He concludes by encouraging viewers to stay informed and adapt to the changing economic landscape, and provides links to his previous reports and resources.  Key points:  * Silver and gold shortages are expected due to supply chain disruptions and mine closures. * Self-discipline and personal development are crucial during times of crisis. * A full-on quarantine in the US is possible, with the need for social responsibility. * Government financing of the crisis response may include zero-interest bonds and tax benefits. * Corporate America will undergo significant changes, including bailouts and loan programs. * Compassion and community are essential during times of crisis. * The host encourages viewers to stay informed and adapt to the changing economic landscape.\nDocument 169\nChris Marcus is joined by Jeff Clark from GoldSilver.com at Silverfest 2020 to discuss First Majestic Silver. Jeff Clark is a shareholder of First Majestic Silver and has a deep understanding of the company's operations. He explains that the company's stock has underperformed this year despite silver prices increasing by almost 50%.   Clark attributes this underperformance to the tax issue surrounding the company's San Dimas mine, which is an outstanding legal issue that has hindered the stock's price. He believes that this issue will be resolved in the next few months, either through international arbitration or a settlement.   Clark also highlights several catalysts that could reverse the stock's performance, including exploration success, the restart of the La Gutara mine, M&A activity, and the installation of a high-intensity grinding mill at the San Dimas mine. He notes that the company is actively looking for its next \"chunky producer\" and is open to assets outside of Mexico.  Clark estimates that the stock could return to its normal leverage to silver, which would put the stock in the range of $30 to $40. He believes that the tax issue will be resolved, and institutional investors will return to the stock, causing the price to increase.   Clark concludes that First Majestic Silver has the highest leverage to silver in this bull market and is a long-term hold for him. He encourages investors to track the company's press releases and follow them on Twitter for updates on their operations.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Alternative Media (Document: 160, 165, 166): Discusses the importance of alternative media and citizen journalism.\n    [2] Gold and Silver (Document: 159, 169): Discusses the value and potential of gold and silver investments.\n    [2] Social Responsibility (Document: 168): Discusses the importance of social responsibility and community during times of crisis.\n    [2] Vaccines (Document: 167): Discusses the development and potential risks of COVID-19 vaccines.\n    [2] Conspiracy Theories (Document: 162, 164): Discusses alleged government corruption and cover-ups.\n    [2] Censorship (Document: 160): Discusses the suppression of dissenting voices and the importance of free speech.\n    [2] Corruption (Document: 162, 164): Discusses alleged government and corporate corruption.\n    [2] Media Manipulation (Document: 160): Discusses the potential for media manipulation and the importance of critical thinking.\n    [2] Government Overreach (Document: 167): Discusses the potential for government overreach and the importance of individual rights.\n    [2] Financial System (Document: 163, 164, 169): Discusses the potential for a new financial system and the importance of understanding the current system.\n    [2] Economic Crisis (Document: 159, 168): Discusses the economic impact of the pandemic and potential solutions.\n    [2] Pandemic Response (Document: 164, 165, 168): Discusses government and individual responses to the pandemic.\n    [2] Personal Development (Document: 168): Discusses the importance of self-discipline and personal growth during times of crisis.\n    [2] Government Transparency (Document: 162, 165, 166): Discusses government actions and potential corruption.\n    [2] Health and Wellness (Document: 168): Discusses the importance of health and wellness during times of crisis."}
{"summary":"Document 170\nThe video discusses the idea that demons or fallen angels are trying to stop humanity's awakening to the truth. The speaker believes that the internet has played a significant role in connecting people and making information more accessible, but it was also created to spy on us. They argue that people are waking up to the reality of mind control and the lies that have been fed to them.  The speaker mentions the Georgia Guidestones, which they believe outline a plan to reduce the world's population to 500 million people. They also discuss the lockdowns and the idea that the controllers want to control the information and the people. They suggest that the lockdowns are not just about preventing mass murders, but also about controlling the population.  The speaker expresses their belief that God is an absentee God in the current world, but they are praying for God to take action. They also discuss the idea that Donald Trump may be trying to expose the lies and corruption of the deep state.  The video concludes with the speaker encouraging people to wake up and question the reality around them. They believe that people are starting to see through the contradictions and lies, and that this is a good thing. The speaker also mentions the idea that the 10 commandments cannot be posted in a courthouse because it creates a hostile work environment, as quoted by George Carlin.  The main points of the video are:  * Demons or fallen angels are trying to stop humanity's awakening to the truth * The internet was created to spy on us, but it has also connected people and made information more accessible * People are waking up to the reality of mind control and the lies that have been fed to them * The lockdowns are not just about preventing mass murders, but also about controlling the population * God is an absentee God in the current world, but the speaker is praying for God to take action * Donald Trump may be trying to expose the lies and\nDocument 171\nWelcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings. Today's presentation is \"Turn off the lamestream fear machine.\" Dr. Dave Janda argues that the bought-off lamestream fake media is a tentacle of the deep state, misinforming and disinforming the public to keep them in fear and panic. He calls the coronavirus the \"freedom-stripping virus\" due to its impact on American freedoms.  Dr. Janda compares the flu and the coronavirus, citing CDC data that shows 34 million Americans suffered from the flu between October 2019 and March 2020, resulting in 20,000 to 50,000 deaths. In contrast, less than 5,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, with less than 100 deaths. He questions why the country was shut down in response to the coronavirus, but not during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.  Dr. Janda highlights the importance of addressing the situation with a rational, measured approach based on facts and data. He recommends focusing on the symptoms of the illness, which are similar to those of the flu, and looking at the case fatality rate, which is 0.1% for the flu in the US and 0.9% for the coronavirus in South Korea.  He also criticizes the media for exaggerating the case fatality rate, with some outlets claiming it's 3%, 6%, or 9%. Dr. Janda argues that people over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions are more vulnerable to the virus, but that the overall risk is still relatively low.  Dr. Janda concludes by suggesting that the deep state is using the fear and panic surrounding the coronavirus to further their own agenda, and that the public should be aware of this and take a more rational approach to the situation.\nDocument 172\nThe speaker describes their experience during the Falklands War, specifically the initial anti-mine training and the grueling march to Port San Carlos. They recall the challenging terrain, lack of roads, and reliance on bearing and paces for navigation. The first night was particularly difficult, with the group stopping in a circle and struggling to set up bivvies due to the lack of trees.  The next day, the group approached a place called Douglas, where they received orders to assault an enemy position. They ditched their heavy packs and crossed a river, with the speaker leading the group. The order to move out came the evening before, but the group was unaware that the Atlantic Conveyor had been sunk, leaving them with limited air support.  The speaker reflects on the changing reality of the war, with the loss of several ships and the increasing awareness of the risks involved. They recall a moment where they were informed of a fellow soldier's baby being born, only to be followed by the explosion of HMS Antelope, which had a profound impact on the group's morale.  The speaker notes that morale never reached rock bottom, but they did experience several low points, including the initial march and the loss of HMS Antelope. They describe the experience as a grueling and challenging time, but one that ultimately prepared them for the difficulties of war.\nDocument 173\nThe British Special Boat Service (SBS) and the American Navy SEALs are both elite special forces units, but they have different skill sets and approaches. The SBS is known for its waterborne operations and insertion skills, while the SEALs have a more diverse range of skills due to their larger budget.   The SBS selection process is notoriously challenging, with a 9-mile portage being one of the hardest events. This involves carrying a 2-man canoe, with one person carrying the wooden bones and the other the skin, for an insane amount of weight over a long distance.   In terms of swimming, the SBS selection includes surface swims, where candidates must swim 5K or more in dive gear, which is considered hideous and more challenging than subsurface dives. The SBS uses diving as a means of transport, often swimming at night on a rebreather, following a compass to a target.   The SBS is considered a jack-of-all-trades unit, with a bigger toolbox of skills, but the SEALs have more resources and can focus on specific skills. The SBS is known for its adaptability and ability to operate in a variety of environments, making it a formidable force in its own right.\nDocument 174\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 28, 2020. The elders took over the GCR, RV release, and revalued the Iraqi Dinar on April 22nd. Iraq was scheduled to formally announce their new Dinar 8 on April 29th, while the U.S. would start Tier 4, the Internet Group. The rollout was stopped on April 25th due to a problem with honesty found with a Tier 1 bank.  President Trump and the Pentagon Pedophile Task Force used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the Cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation. The operation was ongoing, with more tunnels discovered.  Sealed indictments, including those for genocide, healthcare fraud, human trafficking, and crimes against humanity, were being served. Billionaires George Soros, George Bush Jr., and Barack Obama were rumored to be arrested and headed for Gitmo.  The COVID-19 pandemic was being used to gain a deliberate lockdown of U.S. and global economies. Inaccurate statistics on COVID-19 deaths were reported, and the CDC was pushing scare tactics to force misdiagnosis of CV-19.  The redemption process for currency exchange and ZIM bonds would be done in two parts. The first appointment would last 20-25 minutes, and a debit credit card with millions would be provided. The second appointment would involve a wealth manager and private banking team to assist with humanitarian and job creation project outlines.  President Trump has given U.S. banks a list of 250 humanitarian and job creation projects to invest in. ZIM holders could negotiate for higher rates in a second appointment with their wealth manager and private banking team.  The default ZIM rate of $11 million per 100-T ZIM note would be offered at the first appointment. If a humanitarian project was presented, higher rates could be obtained. If\nDocument 175\nThe speaker shares a crucial message about human beings having immortal souls and being in a new reality. They claim to have been in the World Bank's legal department and wrote a paper in 1976 about the importance of the World Bank representing the world's people. They believe the World Bank was created to preserve the world's wealth, which was deposited by Jose Rizal in the Philippines at the end of World War II. The speaker is being attacked by the \"black nobility\" but is able to function and communicate due to their ability to resist hypnosis. They believe they are working for the greater good, along with military powers and others who are also resisting hypnosis. The speaker plans to create more content, including a video to be published on DC TV.\nDocument 176\nThe speaker discusses a video they found that highlights the true nature of the world and the agendas being pushed by those in power. The video describes a \"dark winter\" that occurred after the first pandemic, where a massive cyber attack was executed, collapsing the world's internet and cutting off access to information. This led to a loss of confidence in government, civil unrest, and a worldwide economic collapse.  The speaker believes that this event was intentionally orchestrated to bring about the Great Reset, a plan to control people's consciousness and limit their freedom. They argue that people have been conditioned to follow a script created by those in power, and that many have been broken down by the constant abuse of control.  The speaker encourages viewers to wake up and take control of their lives, to question their power and where it's going. They highlight the importance of community and speaking the truth, and encourage viewers to support creators who are sharing their message.  The speaker also mentions a new video premiering on the channel, called \"The Deep State,\" and encourages viewers to subscribe and share the content. They believe that there are many people out there who see the world for what it is and are working to break the illusion.\nDocument 177\nJustin Brightop, a chicken farmer, attempts to catch flies using two different methods. He uses an egg attractant in one trap and a store-bought bait in the other. However, the egg trap doesn't catch many flies, while the store-bought trap catches some but not as many as expected. Justin then reveals a more effective trap, the Y-trap, which uses sugar water to attract flies and other insects. The Y-trap is filled with a variety of bugs, including boxelder bugs and yellow jackets.  Justin then shifts the conversation to politics and government, stating that God should be the top priority, followed by people and their rights. He criticizes the current state of politics, where politicians are often influenced by special interest groups and wealthy donors. Justin believes that the government's primary function is to uphold and defend the Constitution and protect the people's rights.  Justin also discusses his reluctance to run for office, citing his lack of wealth, a bar license, and experience in the judicial system. He believes that running for office would require him to compromise his values and prioritize special interests over the people's rights.  The video ends with Justin promoting his website, ChristianCourts.com, which offers a free PDF book, audio book, and video on God's laws. He also promotes Blazing Hog 4G LTE and How to Win in Court, a resource for individuals who may face legal challenges.\nDocument 178\nA picture of Anthony Quinn Warner, wearing a Donald Trump hat, is going viral. The question is whether this is the real Anthony Quinn Warner. On December 27th, 2020, the real Anthony Quinn Warner was reportedly alarmed about 5G technology and had IT jobs in Nashville, Tennessee. He allegedly wanted to make a statement. Theories abound, including whether he was groomed or pushed to carry out the act, and if there were handlers involved. Many questions remain unanswered.\nDocument 179\nMelania Trump appears to be watching the camera, sparking speculation about whether she knew what her husband, Donald Trump, was about to say. The scene is set against a backdrop of American patriotism, with Trump referencing the country's values and history. He emphasizes the importance of bravery and determination, drawing a connection between Pennsylvania's support for him and his own affection for the state.\nDocument 180\nI became Chief Judge of the U.S. Supreme Court on October 4th, 2004. However, due to the 2020 presidential election, I had to prepare the court for potential settlements. On September 17th, 2020, I filed a contract with the U.S. Supreme Court outlining the terms of my judgeship, including my oath and the rules of the court. This contract was received on September 21st, 2020, and the three-day rescission period ended on September 24th, 2020.  As Chief Judge, I conducted the largest military court-martial in history, shutting down the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. I filed a contract with the government printing office, which included a letter from the U.S. Senate. I'm grandfathered in as the creator of the quantum banking system and have rewritten the guidelines for space cognition and measurement.  I've maintained the rules of the continuance of evidence, allowing me to be the first architect of the quantum banking system. I've filed documentation to maintain national security and keep citizens safe. The current status of the U.S. Supreme Court is that it's a pantomime, and the fake news is just a performance. I'm giving closure to the world, stating that there is no Supreme Court, no presidential election, and that the contract gives you time authority and the fee for freight for postage.  I'm Postmaster Raffin General Colin Russell, J. Colin Gould, and Commander-in-Chief as well as the Chief Judge at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. I'm giving you the power to be your own creators, sovereigns, and generators, and to move forward in your sovereignty, world, and life.\nDocument 181\nBeijing is using its economic leverage and large marketplace to advance its influence over American businesses. The Chinese Communist Party requires American joint ventures in China to establish party organizations, giving the party a voice in hiring and investment decisions. Companies that stray from Chinese policy on Taiwan and Tibet face threats and punishment.   Beijing also demands that Hollywood portray China positively and censors movies that criticize China. The Chinese Communist Party spends billions on propaganda outlets in the US and around the world, including China Radio International and the China Global Television Network. The Department of Justice has ordered the China Global Television Network to register as a foreign agent.  The Chinese Communist Party has also threatened and detained the family members of American journalists who pry too deep, blocked US media websites, and made it harder for journalists to get visas. The party seeks to foster a culture of censorship across academia, including through the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.   China exerts academic pressure by providing funding to universities and scholars with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. Scholars who contradict Beijing's talking points face visa delays or denials. The Chinese Communist Party is trying to undermine academic freedom and the freedom of speech in America.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Politics and Culture (Document: 177): Mentions God as the top priority, followed by people and their rights, and the speaker's criticism of the current state of politics.\n    [2] Politics and Media (Document: 176): Mentions the importance of community and speaking the truth, and the speaker's encouragement to viewers to wake up and take control of their lives.\n    [2] Media Manipulation (Document: 176): Mentions the \"Great Reset\" and the control of people's consciousness and freedom.\n    [2] Politics and Corruption Probe (Document: 174): Mentions the sealed indictments, including those for genocide, healthcare fraud, human trafficking, and crimes against humanity.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 175): Mentions the speaker's claims about the World Bank's true purpose and their experience in the World Bank's legal department.\n    [2] International Relations (Document: 181): Mentions Beijing's influence over American businesses and the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to censor and control information.\n    [2] Politics and Corruption (Document: 174): Mentions the redemption process for currency exchange and ZIM bonds, and the potential for corruption and abuse of power.\n    [2] Government Overreach (Document: 180): Mentions the Chief Judge of the U.S. Supreme Court taking control of the court and government.\n    [2] Politics and Law Enforcement (Document: 178): Mentions the Anthony Quinn Warner case and speculation about his motivations and potential handlers.\n    [2]\n    [2] Politics and Mainstream News (Document: 179): Mentions Melania Trump's appearance and speculation about her knowledge of her husband's actions.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 175): Mentions the speaker's experience in the World Bank's legal department and their claims about the World Bank's true purpose."}
{"summary":"Document 182\nThe speaker shares their personal experiences and insights about the corrupt banking system and the military's involvement in fighting against it. They mention seeing a unique aircraft flying low over their neighborhood, which they believe is a sign of the military's efforts to show that they are not following the instructions of corrupt brass.  The speaker also talks about their involvement in the World Bank, where they discovered that the gold and wealth of the world were deposited, and that the Treaty of Versailles Bonds, worth over $2 quadrillion, were issued to the elites. They explain that they have been filing liens against these bonds to benefit all of humanity.  The speaker discusses the Situation Room and how they have put commercial liens on many of the people involved in deciding whether to start World War III. They also mention the difference between common law and admiralty law, and how the Constitution of the United States went out of effect in 1871.  The speaker shares their personal story of being poisoned by arsenic and how they have been fighting against corruption their whole life. They explain that they are not going to give up and will continue to expose the truth, despite the risks.  The speaker concludes by announcing that they will be making a second video and encouraging viewers to respond in the comment section. They want to have two comment sections to track the progress and engage with their audience.\nDocument 183\nThe speaker acknowledges the audience's concerns and questions about various topics, including life, elections, and financial systems. They promise to provide evidence and links to support their claims, allowing viewers to join related constructs. The speaker expresses gratitude for the documentary's widespread sharing and encourages viewers to continue spreading the information to counteract fake news.\nDocument 184\nThe conversation revolves around the exoneration of Michael Flynn, a former National Security Advisor to President Trump, and the Justice Department's decision to dismiss the case against him for lying to the FBI. The host discusses how Joe Scarborough, a former congressman, thinks it's a shameful day for the Department of Justice, despite his own questionable past, including the death of his aide, Laurie Klasutis, in his office.  The host also delves into the timeline of events surrounding Flynn's case, including the Obama administration's attempt to create discourse with Russia by signing an executive order announcing sanctions, despite having no evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The host argues that this was a setup to target Flynn and that the news media ran cover for the Obama administration's actions.  The host also compares the number of pardons granted by different presidents, including Barack Obama, who granted 1,927 pardons, and Donald Trump, who has granted 35. The host argues that the news media is biased and only reports on certain pardons, such as those granted by Trump, while ignoring the many pardons granted by Obama.  The host also discusses the deceptively edited interview of Bill Barr by Chuck Todd, where Todd cut off Barr's statement to make it sound sinister. The host argues that the mainstream media is a weapon used to spin hatred against President Trump and run cover for Barack Obama.  Finally, the host discusses the threat that Donald Trump poses to the establishment in Washington, D.C., and how his voters gave the \"big middle finger\" to the establishment in the 2016 election.\nDocument 185\nThe speaker is discussing the significance of Mount Rushmore and a speech to be given there. They mention that the president, Trump, will be making a speech and that it's about the Q movement. The Q movement is about uncovering the truth and exposing the deep state. The speaker explains that the deep state is trying to suppress the truth by spreading disinformation and fake news. They emphasize the importance of going directly to the source, the Q board, for accurate information. The speaker also discusses the significance of JFK Jr. and how he is alive and has been communicating through the Q board. They warn against fake accounts and third-party sites that are trying to distract from the truth. The speaker encourages listeners to think for themselves and to join the fight to bring truth to light. The speech ends with a mention of Trump's upcoming speech at Mount Rushmore and the importance of bravery and determination in the face of adversity.\nDocument 186\nDavid Morgan, publisher of The Morgan Report, emphasizes the importance of taking a long-term outlook with major assets and betting on speculative situations to win big. He believes that understanding the honesty in the financial system and the influence of the money system on daily life is crucial. Morgan's mission is to teach and empower people to understand the benefits of an honest monetary and financial system.  Morgan discusses an article by Gary Christensen, which highlights the value of silver as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. He notes that silver is real money, not a fiat currency, and its price has risen significantly since the 1960s. Morgan also discusses the issue of debt, citing that the US debt is over $74 trillion, with each worker owing over half a million dollars.  Morgan believes that the silver price will eventually catch up with the debt creation, and investors will scramble to buy real silver, driving prices higher. He also discusses the importance of understanding the global debt crisis, which exceeds $250 trillion, and the potential for hyperinflation.  Morgan emphasizes the need for balance and sanity in government and financial markets, and expects traumatic changes on the return to the highway. He also discusses the role of central banks, which he believes are part of the problem, not the solution. Morgan concludes by encouraging people to speak the truth and be powerful, as it can help everyone, everywhere, at all times.  The Morgan Report offers a free weekly newsletter with to-the-point webinars, weekly analysis of the financial markets, interviews, and conference schedules. The paid service provides in-depth analysis of the resource sector, energy metals, and base metals, with a focus on precious metals due to ongoing currency devaluations.\nDocument 187\nA nation that chooses disgrace over danger is prepared for a master and deserves one. The choice between peace and war is not a debate, but rather a decision between fighting or surrendering. History shows that appeasement is a greater risk than any other course of action. Our liberal friends' policy of accommodation is appeasement, leaving us with no choice but to fight or surrender. If we continue to back down, we'll eventually face a final ultimatum, and our surrender will be voluntary due to our spiritual, moral, and economic weakness. Nikita Khrushchev believes this because he's heard voices pleading for peace at any price. However, we know that life is not worth living in chains and slavery. The road to peace is not through surrender, but through standing firm against our enemies and drawing a line beyond which they must not advance. We have the courage to say to our enemies that there is a price we will not pay.\nDocument 188\nThe West Point Mint in New York has shut down due to an abundance of caution, joining the Canadian Mint in Ottawa, which is operating at a limited capacity. This has led to concerns about the fragile supply chain of precious metals. The US Mint is the largest supplier of precious metals in North America, and its shutdown, combined with the Canadian Mint's backlog, has created a significant shortage.  The host of Finance and Liberty and Reluctant Preppers notes that this is not an isolated incident, as other major mints around the world are also struggling to keep up with demand. The host believes that this is a new reality that people must adapt to, and that waiting for premiums to come down may be a mistake.  Andy Schechtman, CEO of Miles Franklin, joins the show to discuss the impact of the shutdown on the precious metals market. He notes that the US Mint produced 450% of its April 2019 output in the first two weeks of this month, but still fell short of meeting demand. Schechtman believes that the market is experiencing asset price inflation changing to price inflation, and that people are turning to precious metals as a safe-haven asset.  The host and Schechtman discuss the potential for a second wave of the pandemic, citing the Spanish flu of 1918 as an example. They also note that the Fed's easy money policies have created asset price inflation, which is now manifesting as price inflation in the precious metals market.  The host concludes by encouraging viewers to consider acquiring physical precious metals to protect their financial future. He has become a licensed dealer's representative for Miles Franklin and can provide physical delivery or storage options for viewers who are interested.\nDocument 189\nHello everyone, I'm Julius Twisha Christian. We're in a critical moment, similar to past experiences, especially with the dinar in 2011. However, this time it's different. With the US election just a month away, we're seeing a lot of uncertainty. The president's recent quarantine has caused market fluctuations and raised concerns about the global currency reset.  There are multiple events that need to happen for the Dinar RV to occur, including the banking system, peace agreements, and more. I've shared my concerns about potential incidents before the election, similar to the George Floyd incident. However, racial tensions have calmed down, and I expect October surprises from both sides.  The Epstein files and Maxwell's testimony are expected to be released soon, which could be a game-changer. The virus rates are increasing, and I've advised people to be prepared with at least 30 days' worth of food.  The global currency reset is a complex process, and it's not just about the Dinar. Countries like Vietnam and Iraq will benefit from the reset, and it's essential to understand the implications. The banking system is also under scrutiny, with the FinCEN files revealing money laundering and other illicit activities.  I've discussed the potential for a gold crash and the stock market's volatility. The idea of \"burning it all down\" is a possibility, and it's essential to be grounded and prepared. Don't focus on dates or specific events; instead, focus on being ready for the major event.  I've also discussed the potential attack on Israel, which could happen before the Dinar reset. This is a critical time, and people who want to destroy the nation and Israel must make their move. Be prepared, be prayerful, and get ready for a wild ride over the next 30 days.\nDocument 190\nThe speaker is defending themselves against accusations, stating they've never lied and have a long history of getting things done. They challenge their opponent to a physical test, such as push-ups or running, to prove their fitness. The speaker denies setting up their son to work in an oil company, claiming their opponent misquoted them. They express frustration with the conversation, but ultimately decline to engage in an argument.\nDocument 191\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. I'd like to thank you for joining today's conference call. As we approach 2021, I'll be discussing the current situation in Iraq and its potential impact on currencies. The window for the Iraqi dinar's re-institution has been expanded to the first quarter of 2021 due to delays in the formal education program and the project to complete the zeros. The Central Bank of Iraq and the IMF are working together to devalue the dinar against the US dollar, limit currency auction theft, and bring the auction price and street value within a 2% spread.  The IMF plan involves devaluing the dinar, stopping auction theft, collecting remaining zeros, re-instituting the dinar in-country, and re-pegging it to the IMF basket of currencies. This process may not be completed within the next 30 days, but it's a positive sign that the IMF and Central Bank of Iraq are working together.  I recommend listening to a recent interview by Catherine Austin Fitz, titled \"Planet Lockdown,\" which discusses the current political situation and the potential for a single digital worldwide currency. This currency could be controlled by the global community, and it's essential to protect your wealth by getting your affairs in order.  I suggest acquiring a package of irrevocable trusts to protect your privacy, assets, and transactions. This will help you reposition assets after acquiring new wealth and move away from currencies that will have more control in the global digital currency environment.

The host, Richard, discusses recent events, including Hillary Clinton's court appearance and Rod Rosenstein's testimony, which may implicate someone in lying. He also touches on the FBI's investigation into Antifa's involvement in riots and the potential for the deep state to be exposed.  Richard highlights the mainstream media's deceptive practices, citing an article that fails to mention the ongoing investigation into Clinton. He also discusses the recent protests and riots, suggesting that they may be part of a larger plan to divide the country and distract from the deep state's actions.  The host mentions the engineered COVID crisis and how it backfired, exposing Bill Gates and Big Pharma. He also notes that the engineered race riots are backfiring, exposing George Soros and Antifa. Richard emphasizes the importance of waking up to the truth and suggests that the next five months will be intense.  He references Q's message, stating that people will only change when they are on the precipice of destruction. Richard encourages listeners to be prepared for the coming events and to support those who will be affected. He also mentions the possibility of a new event, such as a war with China or an asteroid impact, but suggests that the deep state may try something new.  The episode concludes with Richard asking listeners to share their thoughts on what the next event may be. He encourages viewers to subscribe, share, and engage with the content.\nDocument 193\nHello Brave Awakened Ones, this is Veronica of Higher Realm Holistics, Lady V. Today, I want to share with you how the dark ones, led by George Soros, have inverted the light worker movement to enslave us further. They take a bit of the truth, twist it on its head, and use it to manipulate and control us. This is a spiritual war, and they're being mind-fucked.  The dark ones are using the youth, especially Gen Z and Gen Y, to ignite a Marxist youth bloody revolution. They're planning a nationwide 100-day siege, targeting American citizens at their homes, and using children on the front lines to force law enforcement to engage with minors. They plan to disrupt the private lives of prominent conservatives and Republicans, shouting, bullhorning, and banging to keep them in a state of anxiety.  The protest at Mitch McConnell's home was a Juneteenth beta test, and they claim they need a president whose strings they can pull, with Biden being their guy. They plan to take civil unrest to voting polls in suburban and Republican areas, targeting Trump's poll watchers, claiming they're agents of intimidation to keep black and brown people from voting.  As we ramp up to the election, we know there's a lot that's going to be stopping black and brown people and young people from voting. Polling places are being shut down, and an army of terrorizers is being used to scare people from voting. They claim they're protesting at the polls to help protect brown and black people, but minorities have had open access to voting booths.  We need to show up like never before and fight like our lives depend on it because it really does. The revolution is here, and it's up to each and every one of us to decide who we are. Are we the vanguards of this revolution? Are we wide awake on this call and ready to\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Corruption (Document: 182, 184, 190): Mentions corruption within the government and institutions.\n    [2] Government (Document: 182, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193): Mentions the government and its institutions.\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 184, 185, 186,\n    [2] Politics and Reality (Document: 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193): Mentions the relationship between politics and reality.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 184, 192, 193): Mentions the government's actions and policies, specifically the deep state's involvement.\n    [2] Media Manipulation (Document: 182, 184, 192): Mentions the manipulation of information by the media.\n    [2] Politics and Culture (Document: 182, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193): Mentions the relationship between politics and culture.\n    [2] Politics and Mainstream News (Document: 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193): Mentions the relationship between politics and mainstream news.\n    [2] Government Overreach (Document: 184, 190): Mentions the government's actions and policies.\n    [2] International Relations (Document: 184, 187, 189, 192): Mentions international relations and global events.\n    [2] Politics and Corruption Probe (Document: 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193): Mentions the relationship between politics and corruption probe.\n    [2] Economic Impact (Document: 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193): Mentions the economic impact of global events.\n    [2] Election (Document: 183, 184, 189, 192): Mentions the election process and its implications."}
{"summary":"Document 194\nHere's a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  Judy Byington's Restored Republic report, compiled by Judy Byington, MSW, LCSW, and therapist, provides an update on the GCR (Global Currency Reset) as of August 30, 2020. The report outlines a rollout schedule for the RV-GCR, with key dates including:  * Sunday, August 2: Quantum financial system implemented, with all banks online without a glitch. * Monday, August 31: Old SWIFT system ceases to exist, replaced by CIPS and the quantum financial system. * September: Final lockdown of society, blamed on CV19, to cover up financial transition and global elite arrests. * Wednesday, September 2: Behind-the-scenes announcement of gold assets backed by the U.S. Treasury note. * Thursday, September 10: Quantum financial system begins instant payments. * Monday, September 14: Deadline for exchange of contract rates. * Tuesday, September 15: Quantum financial system fully operational, with gold asset-backed U.S. Treasury note made public.  The report also mentions the expected implementation of NESARA (New Economic Security Reformation Act) in the US and GESARA (Global Economic Security and Reformation Act) worldwide, which includes a new tax system with a rate of 13-17% on non-essential purchases. The report concludes with a discussion on the transition from the 3D to the 5D state, with the age of Aquarius symbolizing a new era of consciousness and joy.\nDocument 195\nLinda Forsyth from C-Vine is discussing the website's rating process through fact-checkers, specifically NewsGuard. C-Vine was chosen to be rated, and the process involves a multi-part series where Linda shares the steps and interactions with NewsGuard.   The first question from NewsGuard's Annika Schlotzka concerns opinion content on the C-Vine website. Linda agrees that some articles lacked clear labeling of opinion content and has since added the word \"opinion\" to the titles.   NewsGuard requires websites to disclose their political leaning, but Linda argues that this assumes people can't think for themselves and creates division. She points out that many mainstream media outlets, which are left-leaning, don't follow this criteria. C-Vine has added a declaration of its political leaning to its About Us page.  Annika's second question concerns a story about the CDC lowering the COVID-19 death count. Linda clarifies that she was referring to NewsGuard's investors and lobbyists who have a left-leaning agenda. She also mentions that some health experts used as sources by NewsGuard have been vocal about their disagreements with the organization's stance.  Linda offers Annika the opportunity for a taped Zoom discussion debate to address concerns about fact-checking and transparency. She also shares an example of a fact-checker declaring a report false without providing clear evidence, which she believes is a case of censorship.   Linda concludes by emphasizing the importance of fact-checkers bringing unbiased truth to the public and encourages viewers to discuss the topic in the comments.\nDocument 196\nThe speaker claims to have authority over Maritime and Admiralty Contracts, giving them control over the claim of life citizens. They mention Title 42, 1986, and their knowledge of the law, which they believe gives them the right to stop and correct wrongs. The speaker has been working for 22 years to capture and keep administrative mechanics of planet Earth in check, disqualifying grammar, syntax, and fees for vessels to exist as governing factors against mankind.  The speaker claims to have captured 17 million tons of gold on contract, which they want to use to aid the government and citizens. They also claim to have disqualified all stock markets and banking clearing houses on planet Earth. The speaker invites the government and citizens to join their federal serve system to manufacture and give to the people, bringing happiness and joy.  The speaker is in concurrence with stopping terraforming of different cultures within the country's borders, citing Christian principles as the foundation of the nation. They claim to have the Constitution and can help perform and convey maritime and admiralty contracts to keep the citizens and federal postal government afloat.  The speaker mentions General Mattis and General Dunsford, stating that they know who they are and their banking system is true, correct, and complete. They urge the soldiers to get a hold of them for correctness and to stop terraforming elsewhere. The speaker thanks citizens for watching the documentary and apologizes for the banks and judicial system's fraudulent actions, promising closure and wealth for those who are legally in the country.\nDocument 197\nOn February 20, 2003, the Secretary of the Navy's office contracted with the speaker as Commander-in-Chief, Postmaster General, and World Bank banker. This led to the United States Postal Service and Navy joining forces, allowing them to engage in shipping and other activities. The speaker claims to have rewritten the Interpol Constitution, and the Vatican created a Joinder with them, but this disqualifies the Vatican's capacity to function as a control mechanism.  The speaker then became the Key Master, Postmaster General, and Commander-in-Chief, and attended a meeting at the Universal Postal Union in Bern, Switzerland. They gave closure on the grammar and clarified their new status, which was accepted by the attendees.  The speaker then visited Credit Suisse, where they used their Key Master functions to gain access to the bank president. They asked two questions, and when the bank president and his attorneys disqualified themselves, the speaker left the meeting.  The speaker then proceeded to Charles de Gaulle Airport, where they had to go through customs. However, the French customs officer, who was related to the family of Joan of Arc, recognized the speaker and their significance. The speaker was given a special treatment, and they had a conversation with the officer about Key Master and Key Holder mechanics.  The speaker then boarded a plane and was asked questions by a computer programmer from the U.S. Navy about sentence structure. The speaker answered the questions and had a great conversation with the programmer.  Upon arriving in the United States, the speaker was given customs declaration forms, which they syntaxed and found to be 100% fraud. They walked up to the counter, pulled out the flag, and gave the officials closure on their identity. The officials told the speaker that they were the richest man on the planet.  The speaker claims to have made treaties with the World Court of The Hague and the United States Supreme Court, written amnesty\nDocument 198\nThe video discusses a photo released by the Chinese government showing Lady Gaga and Hunter Biden in a compromising position. The speaker believes Lady Gaga is a clone and that the photo is part of a ritualistic act. They compare it to the Frazzled Rip video, which allegedly shows Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin engaging in a similar act. The speaker thinks the clones want to rule the world and are using their influence to control humanity. They also believe that Lady Gaga is campaigning for herself, not for Biden, and that she is connected to the Bidens through their alleged crime family ties. The speaker warns the public to be aware of clones and their influence in society, and to not worship or adore them as role models. They also mention that Biden's face and personality changed after he was allegedly cloned, and that this is a clue to the existence of clones in high positions of power.\nDocument 199\nThe Japanese biological warfare program, led by Unit 731, conducted human experimentation and genocide during World War II, resulting in the deaths of up to 580,000 people. The program was overseen by the Japanese Imperial Army and involved the use of anthrax, bubonic plague, cholera, and other deadly pathogens. Researchers injected diseases into human subjects, often disguised as vaccines, and observed their effects. Victims were also subjected to vivisection procedures, freezing temperatures, and other forms of torture.  After the war, members of Unit 731 received secret immunity from U.S. authorities in exchange for their biological weapons research. The U.S. War Department provided payments to unnamed members of the unit, and the information obtained was used to develop the U.S. biological warfare program.  China's biological warfare program arose from the Japanese program and has continued to this day. China agreed to the Geneva Protocol in 1952 and the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention in 1984, but the U.S. has raised compliance concerns due to China's continued development of biological agents and toxins. The U.S. believes that China has not abandoned its offensive biological warfare program and has expressed concerns over China's burgeoning biological weapons program.  The U.S. has also raised concerns over China's military medical institutions and their potential dual-use applications. The U.S. assesses that China possessed an offensive biological warfare program from the early 1950s to at least the late 1980s and has not taken steps to fulfill its treaty obligations under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.\nDocument 200\nThere is no text to summarize.\nDocument 201\nWelcome to Remember This with Denise Boland.  The video discusses the possibility of JFK Jr. being alive.  Robert Kennedy Jr. was asked in a live-streamed interview to touch his nose if JFK Jr. was alive, but he didn't respond.  The Deitch memo and the Beach memo are discovery documents that were not in the public domain.  The speaker claims their father discovered the Bilderbergs and NASA, and was killed for it.  They staged their own death and allied with Robert Kennedy Jr. to build a plan.  The speaker warns that people need to work together and be humble, as arrogance and self-importance will not be tolerated.  They claim that there are no secrets and that everyone is being watched.  The speaker then shares a story about how JFK Jr. was allegedly killed in a plane crash on July 16, 1999.  They claim that a remote trigger was used to blow up the plane, and that Navy divers recovered the bodies, but the tapes are missing and no proof of the bodies exists.\nDocument 202\nI am Saint Germain, and I'm here to discuss the Jasara-Nasara plan, a financial liberation plan that will bring abundance and freedom to all. This plan is being implemented slowly and with caution, as it's a quantum system that doesn't rely on existing financial structures. The goal is to redistribute wealth, destroying the immense fortunes of those who have exploited others for centuries.  The new currency will be based on a new system, not tied to existing currencies, ensuring that everyone receives a fair share. The amount each person receives will be determined by their individual journey and needs. This process is not fast or easy, but it's necessary to create a fair and equal society.  The implementation is ongoing, but we can't provide specific dates. Many variables are involved, including the attitudes of world leaders. However, rest assured that the project will be implemented, and everyone will receive what they deserve.  The world will undergo significant changes, including the emergence of new industries and the destruction of those that harm the planet. Everyone will have a job, and people will work in areas that bring them joy. The planet will continue to produce, and everyone will have access to food, shelter, and a sense of purpose.  Liberation is near, and we must be patient. The new financial system will not be tampered with, and we have earned our freedom. We have paved the way for a new way of life by shining our light and transmitting the darkness. Stay balanced, stay informed, and trust that the process is underway.\nDocument 203\nVeronica of High Realm Holistics, also known as Lady V, shares a disturbing connection between Queen Elizabeth's recent speech and World War II. The Queen mentioned that many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones, which reminds Lady V of the evacuation of children during World War II. She believes the Queen is hinting at a similar plan to separate children from their families for their safety.  Lady V points out that the Queen's speech was announced at short notice, and she was repeatedly told to watch it. She shares a clip from the Queen's speech, where she mentions the first broadcast in 1940, which helped children who had been evacuated from their homes. Lady V believes this is a warning sign and that the government may be planning to take children away from their families, citing the example of the child welfare system and Child Protective Services (CPS) taking children away from at-risk parents.  Lady V also shares her personal experience of canceling children who went through the foster system and were trafficked. She believes that the government's plan to take children away from their families is a form of child trafficking.  In a surprising twist, Lady V shares a post from Donald Trump, where he wishes Prime Minister Boris Johnson a speedy recovery, which she finds suspicious. She also mentions a Q post with the numbers 1010, which she believes is a message of hope.  Lady V concludes by urging her audience to pray and be vigilant, as she believes that things are coming to light and that the truth will be revealed soon.\nDocument 204\nChild trafficking is a prevalent issue, with hundreds of children being killed, mutilated, or stabbed. The speaker has personally witnessed and worked with many of these children, but the issue seems too big to tackle alone. A child named Andrew was rescued and brought to the United States for medical care. His care was beyond the speaker's scope of orthopedics, so they contacted the Shriners Hospital, which provided the necessary care pro bono. The doctors involved have given their time, hearts, and emotions to help Andrew. Andrew will be non-weight-bearing for several weeks until his bones heal, and then he can start moving his extremities. The speaker emphasizes the importance of organizations like OUR intervening in child trafficking cases, as every step or child helped makes a difference. With collaborations between organizations, businesses, individuals, politicians, and governments, it's possible to stop child trafficking.\nDocument 205\nWelcome to the Miles Franklin Vault, where we're joined by CEO Andy Schechtman. We're here to discuss the benefits of vault storage and answer frequently asked questions. One of the main concerns is insurance, and Andy assures us that the metals stored at Miles Franklin are 100% fully insured for replacement value.  Another key difference between vault storage and bank storage is the Dodd-Frank Act, which makes depositors in banks unsecured creditors. In contrast, vault storage with a private company like Miles Franklin provides a non-banking, non-reportable relationship.  We also discuss the importance of private storage, with Andy stating that clients' property is 100% private and not reported to the government. This is a major advantage of vault storage over online storage.  In terms of security, Andy emphasizes the importance of insurance, as well as the facility's security measures, including cameras and a relationship with the local police department. The facility is also audited and compliant with IRA regulations.  We also discuss the difference between allocated and segregated storage versus pooled and commingled storage. Andy stresses that allocated and segregated storage is essential to ensure that clients' metals are not mixed with others and can be easily retrieved.  Finally, we talk about the ability to ship metals to the vault for storage, even if they were not purchased from Miles Franklin. Andy shares a personal experience of delivering his own metals to the vault and having them inspected and stored in allocated and segregated storage.  In conclusion, Andy highlights the importance of quality insurance, location, and allocated and segregated storage in safeguarding precious metals. The Miles Franklin Vault in the Midwest offers a secure and private storage solution for clients.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Global Currency Reset (Document: 194): Discusses the implementation of a new financial system and the rollout schedule for the RV-GCR.\n    [2] Biological Warfare (Document: 199): Discusses the Japanese biological warfare program, led by Unit 731, and its impact on human subjects during World War II.\n    [2] Child Trafficking (Document: 203, 204): Discusses the issue of child trafficking and the importance of organizations like OUR intervening in child trafficking cases.\n    [2] Maritime and Admiralty Contracts (Document: 196): Discusses the speaker's authority over Maritime and Admiralty Contracts, giving them control over the claim of life citizens, and their knowledge of the law.\n    [2] Financial Liberation (Document: 202): Discusses the Jasara-Nasara plan, a financial liberation plan that will bring abundance and freedom to all, and the redistribution of wealth.\n    [2] Media Censorship (Document: 195): Discusses the rating process of websites through fact-checkers, specifically NewsGuard, and the importance of unbiased truth in fact-checking.\n    [2] Vault Storage (Document: 205): Discusses the benefits of vault storage, including insurance, security, and private storage, and the importance of allocated and segregated storage.\n    [2] Clones and Mind Control (Document: 198): Discusses the possibility of clones in high positions of power and their influence in society.\n    [2] JFK Jr. Conspiracy (Document: 201): Discusses the possibility of JFK Jr. being alive and the speaker's claims of staging their own death and building a plan with Robert Kennedy Jr."}
{"summary":"Document 206\nThe speaker, Peter from England, expresses disappointment with the UK government's recent announcements. Boris Johnson is extending support to key industries by lifting restrictions on certain businesses, but also increasing fines for not wearing masks in public areas to \u00a33,200. The speaker believes this is an overreach of power, especially during a recession. He also notes that the virus is not subsiding as expected, despite being supposedly susceptible to hot temperatures. The speaker suggests that the global New World Order agenda is behind the ongoing pandemic, using fear to control people. He mentions new travel restrictions and quarantine rules for people returning from certain European countries. Additionally, the speaker expresses concern about vaccinations, comparing the medical profession to a \"Gestapo\" and suggesting that people are being coerced into receiving vaccinations.\nDocument 207\nHello, brave awakened ones. I'm Lady V from Higher Realm Holistics, and I'm here to share a remote view I received. I was in the war room of the White House, privy to a meeting and decisions being made by POTUS. I was shown two probable timelines regarding the discovery of treason at the highest levels, involving VP Pence.  The first timeline involves Pence being called out for treason, and Pompeo, the Secretary of State, being put into office as VP. POTUS is then re-elected. The second timeline involves Pence being allowed to be the \"Brutus\" to POTUS, and then being brought down along with other treasonous individuals.  I was told to share this information, and I'm referencing my previous NRV 81, which mentioned the first arrest sending shockwaves. I'm not sure what the outcome will be, but I'm putting this out there for record purposes. I'm just a messenger, and I'm not sure what the future holds.\nDocument 208\nHello everyone, I'm Paladin from White Hats Media Group. We've finally opened our retail store, offering 150 products, including hats, mugs, t-shirts, and more. Shipping is free in the US, and $3 internationally. Our website has also been updated, including a new blog featuring Lady Justice, who will be posting on various subjects.  We've also opened a Patreon account with six membership levels, offering full integration with Discord. This will allow us to interact with members, answer questions, and cover a wide range of topics. Additionally, we've created a Twitter account, WHMG, where we'll post announcements and updates.  Our main focus is on providing content, including the White Hat 48 video series, which will cover significant events, such as the JFK assassination. We're working on Episode 2, which will explore the events leading up to the assassination and the deep state's involvement.  The concept for the White Hats Report was born 25 years ago, when we accumulated a vast amount of information through financial and fraud-related investigations. We realized that we needed a database program to collate and coordinate this information, which eventually led to the creation of the White Hats Report.  Our initial intention was to create a media group that could expose the truth about financial fraud and corruption. However, we needed a cash flow to support this effort, which is why we're monetizing our content on YouTube, Patreon, and our retail store.  We're pleased to have our longtime readers and new contributors join us in this endeavor. Everyone can be a white hat and contribute to this effort, whether it's with time or money. Our financial system is a fraud, and it's time to expose the truth. We're taking the next step in our evolutionary process, and we hope to get everyone involved in this effort to bring about change. Thank you for listening, and we hope you'll participate with us\nDocument 209\nThe speaker compares the government's response to the pandemic to a bad horror movie, where the outcome is predictable due to a poorly written script. They claim that the government will blame individuals for the rise in cases and implement lockdown measures. The speaker argues that the evidence supporting the idea that the pandemic is by design is overwhelming and that the government's narrative is flawed.  The speaker notes that the government is using technology to control the population and that the pandemic is just the beginning of a five-year attack on individual freedoms. They emphasize the importance of waking up the majority of the population to the true nature of the situation.  The speaker also discusses the censorship of conservative views on social media platforms, including Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter. They claim that these platforms are suppressing free speech and that the internet is being used as a tool for psychological warfare.  The speaker encourages viewers to take action and resist the fear campaign being promoted by the government. They emphasize the importance of doing the right thing for one's health, children's future, and society as a whole. The speaker concludes that the power to stop the government's agenda lies with the people and that information is the key to resisting the psychological attack.\nDocument 210\nThe host of BigSquareRoader.com has posted the first of a series of timeline posts on the Road to Ruta private road, featuring Cliff High discussing his predictions from last year. Cliff predicted the current market situation, and the host is excited to share this information with his audience.   The host also discussed the future of spirituality with Christoph Malkizdek and had a conversation with Jenny Moonstone about theta. He plans to post this conversation on the private road soon.   Regarding silver, the host believes that the price suppression is about to turn around, and he's expecting a significant increase in the price of silver. He's also discussing the stock market, which he believes is in a mega bubble, and wonders if cryptos, gold, and silver will go up or down if the stock market crashes.  The host is also promoting Theta, a cryptocurrency that he believes has the potential to revolutionize the internet. He thinks Theta is the new internet and is decentralized, increasing bandwidth massively. He's encouraging his audience to invest in Theta and join the Guardian nodes or delegate to secure the network.  Finally, the host is inviting his audience to join the Road to Ruta private road, where they can access exclusive content, including an interview with Cliff High and the WebBots. He's also offering 100 Theta and 100 Theta fuel to new subscribers.\nDocument 211\nThe video discusses the idea that our reality is a scripted play, with actors and staged events designed to elicit emotional responses from the public. The speaker, who has been creating daily videos for a long time, is questioning the purpose of his work and whether it's time to reinvent himself. He cites examples of crisis actors, such as George Floyd, and suggests that many major events are staged to manipulate public opinion. The speaker also expresses frustration with the lack of response from a higher power, despite his daily prayers for healing and connection. He believes that the world is controlled by liars who profit from our emotional responses and that it's time for people to wake up and speak the truth. The video ends with a call to action, encouraging viewers to question the reality they're presented with and to seek the truth.\nDocument 212\nThe video discusses a mock funeral ceremony for George Bush Sr. where the narrator believes a ritual is taking place. The general earns the trust of the Bush family by mentioning a \"member,\" which sparks a conversation on the stairs. The narrator suggests that the general is trying to earn the trust of the family to reveal a secret.   Laura Bush seems concerned about the general, but she continues to talk to him. The narrator believes that the general is trying to pass a test of trust. The Bush family is shown looking down at the military below them, and Laura's arm goes down when the casket passes, which is unusual.  The narrator then focuses on a woman who looks puzzled and is talking to a man. She seems to be asking if someone else has passed away, and the man is trying to reassure her. The narrator believes that George Bush Sr. has gone missing and that the woman is suspicious.  The video then cuts to a scene where a man is saying \"You're surrounded by the Church of Satan\" and people are reacting to it. The narrator believes that this is a setup and that the people are in on the ritual.   The video also shows Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi talking and the narrator believes that they are in on the ritual as well. The narrator then discusses how the people involved in the ritual are able to keep secrets from the public.  The video ends with the narrator discussing how the people involved in the ritual are filming them and that it's like a produced show. The narrator also mentions that they will be discussing this further in an upcoming episode.\nDocument 213\nHello everyone, I'm Peter of England, and I'm here to announce a massive update on the debt easement eradication program. After over a year of preparation, the voucher payoff system is now available in the United States and the United Kingdom. The vouchers are called economic impact vouchers, and they're available to everyone, but limited to five.   To access the vouchers, go to freemanlegalservices.com and search for the QE Voucher button. The United States Treasury, the Department of Defense, and the UK Treasury will be putting money directly into your pockets, instead of the Federal Reserve. This is a result of the people's quantitative easing, where the government is taking control of the money supply.  In the United States, there's $6 trillion available to stimulate the economy, and in the UK, there's \u00a340 billion. You can use these vouchers to pay off debts, including rent, taxes, fines, mortgages, and more. The payor is the US and UK Treasuries, not your bank.  The reason for this program is to counter the New World Order's plan to retake the US presidency at any cost. The COVID-19 pandemic was a result of this plan, and now the people are taking back control.   To learn more, go to freemanlegalservices.com and look up the QE Voucher. You can also find this video on Vimeo and attend a webinar in the next week or two to learn more about the next phase of the pandemic.\nDocument 214\nPresident Trump tweeted that he won the election by a lot, despite fact-checkers claiming Biden won. The host, Deb, agrees with Trump, stating that the election results are not settled until all legal aspects are covered. She shares updates on Rudy Giuliani's press conference, where he presented evidence of voter fraud, including instances of observers being kept out and ballots being counted without transparency.  Deb mentions that tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 p.m. on Election Day, changing the results in Pennsylvania and other states. She also shares clips from the press conference, where witnesses describe being blocked from observing the counting process.  The host emphasizes that this is a spiritual battle, not just a political one, and encourages viewers to remember that they are fighting against principalities and powers. She reminds viewers that the election results are not final until the recount and legal cases are resolved.  Deb encourages viewers to protest peacefully and respectfully, and to sign a petition to audit the election, which needs 90,000 signatures to move forward. She ends the video with an inspirational clip of President Trump speaking at various events, reminding viewers to never give up.\nDocument 215\nWelcome to the Times of Industry Show. Today, we have David Morgan, the silver guru, joining us to discuss the current state of the silver market. The gold-silver ratio has reached an all-time high of 120 to 1, a level that has only been seen twice in recorded history, both times preceding a major financial crisis. David believes that if silver were treated like gold, its price would be significantly higher, potentially near the classic monetary ratio of 16 to 1.  The current paper market price of silver is around $12 to $14 an ounce, while bullion dealers are selling eagles and maples for $22 to $23 an ounce. David thinks this is an arbitrage opportunity, where the price of silver in the physical market will eventually meet the paper market price. He suggests buying commercial bar silver and selling it in the paper market to take advantage of this spread.  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused mine closures in South America, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, resulting in a 25% reduction in global silver production. This will put pressure on the physical market, potentially driving up the price of silver. David believes that this could be a bullish sign for silver miners, as they will be able to sell their gold at a higher price when the market recovers.  David also thinks that the current economic situation, with unlimited QE and open-ended swap lines, is similar to the 2000 moment for gold and the 30, $35 an ounce moment for silver. He believes that gold and silver will perform well in a deflationary environment, and that silver is the ultimate hedge in a highly inflationary environment.

He also recommends following him on Twitter at SilverGuru22, where he will post ways to buy silver near the spot price without\nDocument 216\nThe Apollo 11 press conference took place at the Manned Spacecraft Center. The crew, consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin, presented a 45-minute presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. They discussed their historic mission, focusing on the events that occurred on and around the moon. The crew praised the Saturn V rocket for its performance, providing a \"magnificent ride\" into Earth orbit and on a trajectory to the moon. They highlighted the Translunar Coast phase, which was crucial for the successful landing. The crew's presentation included films and slides to showcase their observations on the moon.\nDocument 217\nThe speaker, Twisted Christian, discusses the potential impact of a new rule implemented by the US Commerce Department on February 4, 2020, which allows for the imposition of tariffs on countries deemed to be undervaluing their currency relative to the US dollar. This rule change is a result of President Trump's concerns about currency manipulation, particularly by China, and is intended to level the playing field for American businesses and workers.  The speaker notes that the rule change is significant and could potentially lead to a chain reaction of currency revaluations, with some countries being more likely to revalue their currency than others. He suggests that investors should be prepared to invest in currencies that are not expected to revalue, such as the top 20 currencies other than the Iraqi Dinar.  The speaker highlights several countries that are on the list of potential currency manipulators, including South Korea, Japan, Germany, Italy, Iran, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Switzerland. He suggests that investors should look at the exchange rates of these countries and consider adding them to their investment list.  The new rule allows the Commerce Department to consider whether a benefit is conferred to foreign producers from the exchange in US dollars for the currency of a country under review. The rule takes effect on April 6, 2020, and US industries can begin submitting petitions for potential relief to the US International Trade Commission and Commerce International Trade and Mission.  The speaker notes that the rule change could potentially force countries to revalue their currency, and he wonders if this is the kind of rule that will force Iraq to revalue its currency. He also mentions that he has listened to several currency experts, including Currency Through 65, and is considering their opinions on the matter.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Government Overreach (Document: 206, 209, 213, 214): Mentions government control and manipulation of the population.\n    [2] Media Censorship (Document: 206, 209): Mentions suppression of free speech and alternative views on social media.\n    [2] International Relations (Document: 216): Mentions the Apollo 11 press conference and the US's space program.\n    [2] Economic Impact (Document: 210, 215): Mentions the impact of the pandemic on the economy and the potential for a financial crisis.\n    [2] Government and Finance (Document: 213): Mentions the government's control of the money supply and the potential for a debt easement eradication program.\n    [2] Currency Manipulation (Document: 217): Mentions the US Commerce Department's rule change on currency valuation.\n    [2] Trade and Tariffs (Document: 217): Mentions the US Commerce Department's rule change on tariffs and currency valuation.\n    [2] Silver Market (Document: 210, 215): Mentions the potential for a significant increase in the price of silver.\n    [2] Election Fraud (Document: 214): Mentions voter fraud and disputed election results.\n    [2] Reality and Perception (Document: 211, 212): Mentions the idea that reality is scripted and manipulated for control.\n    [2] New World Order (Document: 206, 213): Mentions a global agenda to control the population."}
{"summary":"Document 218\nHello everyone, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. I'm on vacation in Asheville, North Carolina, celebrating my birthday. Due to my location, we won't be having our regular Q&A session today. For those new to our calls, I recommend listening to our August 5th call for information on our program and contact details.  We're following the Iraqi dinar as the base currency for potential reset. There's a lot happening internationally, including the Federal Reserve, central banks, and the rise in gold and silver prices, which could lead to the revaluation of the dinar and other currencies. We're looking at a window of September to January 2020 for the revaluation.  The current Prime Minister of Iraq, al-Khazemi, is planning a visit to the US to develop good relations with the Trump administration and discuss governmental reforms. To achieve this, Iraq needs to complete several tasks, including preparing a comprehensive economic reform plan, stopping currency auctions, and deleting zeros from the currency.  Once the currency is re-instituted, we expect a rate of approximately 85 cents per dinar, which will rise to a slight premium over a dollar. The revaluation globally could happen within a week or 30 days after the dinar's value increases.  We're hoping for a revaluation in September, but it could happen as late as January 2020. We prefer an early revaluation in a given quarter due to tax implications. If the revaluation happens in September, we'd expect it to occur in October, which would be better for us from a tax and exchange standpoint.  We're also looking at the possibility of a moratorium on federal taxes being extended to the end of the year, which could exempt the exchange from taxation. We're living in unusual times, and after years of waiting, we're due for a break.  Thanks for listening to the call, and\nDocument 219\nThe speaker is live on YouTube, sharing what they believe to be life-changing news. They claim to have received an official document from a high-level source about the release of cryptocurrency, specifically Nasera and Jasera, to the entire globe. This news is allegedly confirmed by a Donald Trump live speech, where he mentioned 186 countries. The speaker is emotional, stating that this means the end of money and oppression, and the beginning of a new era of peace, love, and prosperity. They emphasize that this is not about skin color or personal opinions, but about the truth and freedom for all. The speaker encourages viewers to research and verify the information, and to focus on spreading love and kindness. They also mention the importance of forgiveness and letting go of anger, and suggest taking deep breaths, going outside, and hugging neighbors to celebrate the good news. The speaker believes that this is a moment of great change and that people will soon be able to vote on economic relief for their countries.\nDocument 220\nDr. Dave Janda discusses why Obama is panicked, focusing on the topic of illegal surveillance. He explains that the mainstream media is a propaganda arm of the deep state, misinforming and disinforming the public. Janda highlights the case of General Michael Flynn, who has been a target of the deep state's illegal surveillance. He notes that Flynn's family has been held as political prisoners for almost four years and that the deep state is desperate to keep the truth from coming out.  Janda references an interview with investigative journalist Mary Fanning, who presented a timeline of events that is critical to understanding the situation. He also mentions the work of Bill Binney and Kirk Wiebe, two experts in surveillance platforms who have spoken out about the NSA's abuse of power.  The discussion centers around the use of parallel platforms, such as the \"hammer,\" which have been used to harvest information and coerce American citizens. Janda notes that Obama's knowledge of the details of Flynn's calls with the Russian ambassador raises eyebrows, especially given his own history with Flynn.  According to declassified documents, Obama asked Yates and Comey to stay behind after a briefing on Russian election interference, stating that he had learned of the information about Flynn's calls. Yates was surprised by the information and figured out that Obama had obtained it from an illegal surveillance source.  Janda concludes that Obama participated in a plot to frame General Flynn, according to Sidney Powell, and that the deep state is panicked because the truth is finally coming out. He emphasizes the importance of holding the deep state accountable for their actions and notes that every dollar donated to General Flynn's Defense Fund is a hit against the deep state.\nDocument 221\nA new development in the Jeffrey Epstein case has been unsealed, revealing a conversation between Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, and her lawyers in 2011. Virginia recalls Jeffrey Epstein telling her that Bill Clinton owes him favors, which he would laugh off. She also remembers being on Epstein's island with Clinton, where they stayed in separate villas and had regular sexual orgies. Two young girls from New York were also present, and Virginia couldn't identify them. This new information is particularly damning, given Clinton's previous denials. The full story will be explored in a video premiering at 2 o'clock today, which will delve into the connections between Epstein and Clinton.\nDocument 222\nThe host of the awards, in a sarcastic tone, begins by joking about being fired from the Oscars and the Hollywood Foreign Press's lack of understanding of Twitter. He pokes fun at the audience, including celebrities like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Baby Yoda, and notes that the room is filled with important TV and film executives who are all terrified of Ronan Farrow.  The host criticizes the lack of diversity in the film industry, stating that many talented people of color were snubbed in major categories and that the Hollywood Foreign Press is racist. He also jokes about the in memoriam segment, saying it wasn't diverse enough and mostly featured white people.  The host continues to mock the film industry, saying that most films are awful, lazy, and remakes, and that the actors who do Hollywood movies now do fantasy adventure nonsense. He jokes about Martin Scorsese's comments about the Marvel franchise and Leonardo DiCaprio's age.  The host also criticizes companies like Apple, Amazon, and Disney for running sweatshops in China, and tells the audience not to use their awards as a platform to make political speeches. He jokes about the meal being all vegetables and the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press being all very racist.  The host presents several awards, including best actor in a television series, musical or comedy, and notes that there is controversy surrounding the lack of female directors nominated this year. He jokes about the presenters, including Zoe Kravitz and Jason Momoa, and the audience's reaction to the awards.  Finally, the host thanks the audience and tells them to donate to Australia, get drunk, and take their drugs.\nDocument 223\nThe speaker criticizes QAnon followers for their misplaced trust in Donald Trump, who they believe will expose government corruption and bring about justice. However, the speaker argues that Trump has instead sided with wealthy bankers and pardoned their crimes. They claim that Trump's actions are driven by self-interest and a desire to maintain his own power and wealth. The speaker also mocks QAnon's conspiracy theories, including the idea of military tribunals to put Hillary Clinton and other government officials on trial. They suggest that QAnon followers are naive and have been duped by Trump's empty promises. The speaker concludes that life is unfair and that QAnon followers must move on from their pipe dream of a better world.\nDocument 224\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan discusses the market perspective for the week ending May 15, 2020. David Morgan notes that the adage \"sell the first of May and come back after Labor Day\" often applies to the general market and metals, but this year it may not hold true for metals. He believes the stock market may follow this pattern, but the precious metals market will be the primary market to the upside.  Morgan discusses the stock market, stating that the indices are in a decision pattern, oscillating between 23,000 and 25,000 for the Dow and 2,800 and 3,000 for the S&P. He predicts a break to the downside, with the S&P failing to reach 3,000 and continuing down past 2,700.  Morgan then focuses on the silver market, noting that it has outperformed gold on a three-to-one basis, which is a confirmation of the gold move. He believes this is a significant move, especially since silver is trading at a level where most primary silver miners mine silver. Morgan recommends being cautious and waiting for further confirmation before investing in silver.  He also discusses the gold-silver ratio, which has peaked at 125 and is now back down to 105. Morgan notes that this is a historic peak and foretells a significant unraveling of the global economic system.  Morgan concludes by emphasizing the importance of being vigilant and watching the market closely. He recommends learning to live on less and appreciate more, as we enter a new paradigm. He also mentions the World Silver Survey from the Silver Institute and encourages viewers to read it.  Finally, Morgan discusses the power of silver as money and the potential for silver-based cryptocurrencies to revolutionize the monetary system. He believes that once people understand the power of silver and adopt it, we could see interesting times ahead for the silver market.\nDocument 225\nHello, I'm Dr. Dave Janda, and welcome to Operation Freedom Briefings. Today, we're discussing the deep state's information operation, which is melting. They're desperate and will do anything to keep their reign of terror in place. The deep state sees their power ending, and they're panicked. They've escalated information warfare through the bought-off lamestream fake media and puppets like General Milley, who recently spoke out against President Trump's actions in Lafayette Park.  The deep state has been trying to remove President Trump since the Russian collusion hoax, then the fake Ukrainian hoax, and finally, the impeachment hoax. When that didn't work, they caused civil unrest and economic chaos through the COVID-19 virus, directed at the United States. The goal was to create chaos and push President Trump out of office.  However, the deep state needed a spark, which they got from the Chauvin incident in Minneapolis. They tried to light fires in every urban center and outside of urban centers throughout the country. Joe Biden recently said that George Floyd is the biggest civil rights leader in our country's history, but Martin Luther King was the most profound civil rights leader in my lifetime.  Martin Luther King denounced rioting and looting, promoting peaceful protests instead. The deep state doesn't want you to know this. Black Lives Matter was created to direct attention against police brutality, but its co-founder, Patrice Cullors, admitted that their goal is to get Trump out of office. This is from a June 19th, 2020 interview with CNN.  The deep state is desperate, and their information operation is melting. They're trying to suppress the truth and demoralize the public. But it's not working. The truth is coming out, and the deep state is falling apart at the seams. Just look at what's happened to Seattle, where six square blocks were commandeered by anarchists\nDocument 226\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 24, 2020.  The exact RV date was unknown, but the latest intel indicated an hour-to-hour basis.  The House passed a $484 billion stimulus bill, and the Iraqi stock market would reopen with a new dinar rate on Sunday, April 26.  Tier 4 was set to be funded at 2:30 am on Friday, April 24, with intermediates paid out and completed by Monday morning, April 27.  The 800 numbers should go out around lunchtime on Monday, April 27, and Tier 4 could start with appointments on Monday or Tuesday, April 28.  Appointments for contract rates would go until Friday, May 15, and the new money could come out on that Friday.  The fiat dollar would be good for 90 days after that, or by August 15.  The gold standard could be announced on Sunday, April 26, and the central banks were sending out uncirculated US bills stamped from 2009 to 2013.  Q hinted at the upcoming RV date with \"C before D,\" meaning saving the children would come before disclosure.  The Navy hospital ship Comfort returned to its home base in Virginia, where it was used for emergency care for traumatized and abused children found in a deep underground tunnel beneath New York.  Disclosure was made on Wednesday, April 22, with Wikileaks releasing all their files on the internet.  The Clinton Foundation was connected to the tunnel, and the Comfort was docked in New York Harbor.  The oil crash put 23 banks out of business and crashed the petrodollar, leading to the gold standard announcement.  A sealed indictment was issued on Dr. Forsey, and the US government lost a landmark vaccine lawsuit.  The lawsuit demanded government documents proving vaccine quality over the past 32 years,\nDocument 227\nHospitals in the UK are facing increased pressure due to rising admissions, although they are not at peak levels seen in April. NHS staff are struggling to manage competing demands. The video then transitions to a song with lyrics that appear to be a commentary on social issues, including protests and police brutality. The song mentions a protest in Lagos where security forces killed at least 12 people. The video then cuts back to a discussion about protecting one's home and family, with a mention of making children pay for the consequences of one's actions.\nDocument 228\nDr. Dave Janda discusses the deep state's business model of death, destruction, and chaos, targeting the rule of law. He mentions the destruction of the rule of law in the cases of Roger Stone and General Michael Flynn. Janda also talks about an interview with Wayne Simmons, a former intelligence contractor, who was silenced by the deep state.   He then discusses an interview with Barbara Flynn Redgate, General Michael Flynn's sister, about how the deep state framed her brother. Janda highlights how the system has been compromised by the deep state and their puppets, including Obama.   Dershowitz claims that Obama personally asked the FBI to investigate someone on behalf of George Soros. Janda notes that this is mirroring, where the deep state accuses others of doing what they themselves are guilty of.   Andrew Weissman, a Russia probe member, admits to trying to get rid of President Trump by laying a perjury trap. Janda explains that this is a common tactic used by the deep state to catch people in a lie or something they don't remember.   Janda encourages listeners to join his radio show on Sunday to discuss these topics further. He also invites listeners to subscribe to his platform, DaveJanda.com, for exclusive content and to support his work.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Politics and International Relations (Document:

{"summary":"Document 229\nDr. Li Wenliang, a 33-year-old ophthalmologist in Wuhan, China, was a whistleblower who warned his colleagues about a possible outbreak of COVID-19 on December 30, 2019. He shared a patient's report on WeChat, which showed a positive result for SARS Corona test, and asked his classmates to inform their families and friends to take protective measures. However, the Wuhan police summoned and admonished him for making false comments on the internet, warning him that if he continued to violate the law, he would be prosecuted.  Despite the warning, Dr. Li continued to speak out about the outbreak, and his warnings went viral on social media. He was later diagnosed with COVID-19 and died on February 7, 2020, at the age of 33. His death sparked widespread grief and anger on social media, with many calling for freedom of speech in China.  Dr. Li's story highlights the risks faced by whistleblowers in China, where speaking out against the government can be met with severe punishment. His bravery and sacrifice have made him a hero in the eyes of many Chinese people, and his legacy continues to inspire calls for greater freedom of speech and transparency in China.  In the aftermath of Dr. Li's death, a group of Chinese academics published an open letter urging the government to protect free speech and apologize for Dr. Li's death. The letter emphasized the right to free speech, which is ostensibly guaranteed by the Chinese constitution. Dr. Li's wife and child were left behind, and his death has been remembered as a tragic loss of a brave and dedicated doctor who risked everything to speak the truth.\nDocument 230\nLet's start with Iraq. They reinstated the dinar last Saturday and revalued it yesterday, Wednesday. The new rate is now visible on the website, but they took it down themselves to prevent hacking. The Iraqi Stock Exchange, ISX, will open on Sunday, and the IQD rate will be visible and tradable through the ISX on the same day. We will see the new dinar rate on our bank websites on Monday morning.  The gold standard will be introduced globally on Sunday, and we believe the gold-backed dollar, USTN, will be announced at the same time. This is because the oil market crash has made the petrodollar valueless, and we need a gold-backed dollar to replace it. Oil futures have settled at $17.50 per barrel, and we expect it to rise to $20 to $30 per barrel by June or July.  The Heritage Trust Fund has been released, covering the Dubai 1 and 2 funds, which covered Tier 1, 2, and 3 payouts. The second half of the fund, covering Tier 4A and B payouts, is set to release at 2:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time tomorrow. This will allow the Department of Defense contracts for the trustees of the intermediate funds to be paid out, starting at 2:30 a.m. tomorrow and completing by Monday morning.  We are expecting a gold-backed dollar to be announced on Sunday, and our 800 numbers will be good through May 15th. The public will be able to exchange their fiat dollars for gold-backed USTNs after that date. We have 90 days to spend our fiat dollars or trade them in for the new gold-backed currency.  The bond platforms in Monaco, Hong Kong, Zurich, and Bern, Switzerland, are liquid and ready to go.

A recent video by Pimpy's Investment channel highlighted an open letter to General Miley, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, encouraging a coup against Trump if he doesn't leave the White House.   To understand the context, I recommend visiting the website defenseone.com, a military site with postings by current and previous military personnel. You can search for articles like \"Where the System May Break\" by David Frum, which discusses the Transition Integrity Project, a scenario to find the best way for the elite to regain power and remove Trump and the white-hatted military.  Other articles to look at include \"All Enemies Foreign and Domestic\" and \"Six Scenarios for Military Intervention after January 20th.\" These articles outline six scenarios in which the military may intervene to remove Trump, including:  1. Biden is sworn in, but the passage of executive authority is not acknowledged by federal agencies. 2. Biden is incapacitated, and someone else is sworn in over Trump's objections. 3. Trump is sworn in as a stopgap measure, sacrificing the integrity of the democratic process. 4. Trump maintains de facto power and denies a breach of the 20th Amendment. 5. Trump suspends government functions through a manipulation of the War Powers Act or Insurrection Act. 6. Trump uses loyal security agencies to commit acts of violence and intimidation.  These scenarios suggest that the military may be forced to act against Trump and his administration, which is contrary to law and good order. The Transition Integrity Project and these scenarios demonstrate the extent to which the democratic machine is preparing to do things to the Constitution of the United States.  It's essential to understand that Biden is a stalking horse, and Kamala Harris is likely to take over from him if he's incapacitated. The elite will try\nDocument 232\nHello everyone, I'm Ris Flex, and welcome back to my channel. Today, I want to talk about why people didn't like President Trump's experience in DC. They said he wasn't fit for the position because he wasn't a prior politician. However, I want to show you what it's like to live and work in DC as a politician. Let's take a look at the Senate Democrats, specifically Dick Durbin and Chuck Schumer, who live together in a house called Omega House. It's a run-down frat house with peeling paint, broken blinds, and underwear in the living room.  But that's not all - Omega House has a dark history. A former member of the Department of Homeland Security blew the whistle on a conspiracy involving DEA agent Joseph Rosati, Alan Borshak, and Mayor Bowser. They conspired to murder DNC employee Seth Rich, and it was supposed to be a robbery. However, things went bad quickly once the DEA agent died.  It turns out that this was just one part of a larger operation involving the CIA, heads of other departments, and even George Soros. They ran the largest money and drug operation the world has ever seen, and they used the funds to push their desired agenda. But where do these funds reside? Let's hear from Sergeant Robert Horton, a Psychological Operations Specialist from the US Army Special Operations.  According to Sergeant Horton, the funds are collected in a conglomeration of banks set up by the Rothschilds and 13 banking families known as the Five Star Trust, also known as Lucifer's Sustainable Development Fund. This is a massive money laundering system, and it's all connected to the CIA and other departments.  I hope you enjoyed this video and learned something new.

We then found a similar petition already logged with Parliament, frozen at 11,000 signatures, and decided to promote it to reach 100,000 signatures by September 26th. This will increase pressure on the government to review the act, which will be in place for six months. The success of this petition will send a positive message to the government and the population, encouraging more people to take action and question the current situation. We need to awaken the majority of the population, currently estimated to be around 30%, to join the minority who are aware of the true nature of the pandemic. By educating others and promoting the petition, we can create a large enough movement to force the government to back down and allow us to take control of our destiny.\nDocument 235\nGood afternoon, I'm Jim George from Trusts Unlimited. Today, I'll be discussing the situation in Iraq and the potential revaluation of the Iraqi dinar. The window for revaluation is still open from September to January.   In Iraq, the parliament has begun discussing the 2021 budget, focusing on diversifying revenue sources due to the 2020 budget deficit caused by low oil prices. They're exploring revenue from agriculture, technology, and tourism. The finance committee is working to amend the investment law to accommodate economic diversification and privatization.  The Iraqi government has also issued a statement emphasizing the importance of respecting Iraq's sovereignty and prioritizing national interests. This move is seen as a response to potential increased relations and contracts with other countries, which cannot be achieved until their currency revalues.  The dinar needs to revalue for several reasons, including the depletion of the CBI reserves, making it difficult to pay government expenses and employee salaries. The price of oil has not yet risen to cover the existing budget deficit.  In the larger global picture, the US dollar is the largest reserve currency, and the US is in a financially advantageous position due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Trump administration has subordinated the Federal Reserve to the Treasury Department, allowing the government to borrow funds at 0% interest and potentially forgive those loans.  This shift towards sound money and commodity-backed currencies could push Iraq towards revaluation. Considering Iraq's rich natural resources, including oil and mining resources, its strategic location, and the US's desire to recoup its investment in the country, I believe the revaluation of the Iraqi dinar is inevitable.  A viable window for revaluation is between September and January, and Trusts Unlimited has a program in place to assist clients. I recommend that new callers listen to our previous call from July 22nd for more information. You can contact us at TrustsWithAnSUn\nDocument 236\nDavid Morgan discusses the silver market and its potential for growth. He references a chart from Forbes magazine showing the price of silver in 1998 dollars, which he claims is a truth chart that adjusts for inflation. Morgan points out that Warren Buffett bought silver at an all-time inflation-adjusted low in 1999 and that the price has the potential to reach $1,477 or even higher. He argues that it's not too late to buy silver and that it's undervalued on a historical basis.  Morgan also discusses the debt bomb and the importance of understanding the monetary system. He explains that gold and silver are not someone's liability, unlike other assets such as derivatives, private businesses, and government bonds. He notes that the value of silver is at the tip of the pyramid and has a lot of room to move.  Morgan highlights recent changes in the gold and silver markets, including the expansion of the COMEX and LBMA refiner lists. He notes that the number of eligible silver bar brands has increased by 140% and that this is a sign of panic about future physical silver delivery. He also discusses the Comex warehouses and the fact that the total amount of silver vaulted has not changed much, but that some silver has been moved from these warehouses.  Morgan concludes by encouraging viewers to follow him on Twitter and to let him know if they would like to see a silver update once a month in addition to the weekly perspectives. He also mentions that the next premium edition of The Morgan Report will be out on September 7th and will include more information about the markets.\nDocument 237\nThe video discusses the deep state's alleged agenda to control and manipulate the population. The host shares a personal story about a man who was allegedly killed by police in Minneapolis, but claims that the man in the video is not the same person he knew. The host, who was the man's lawyer, states that the man died in Corpus Christi, Texas, three years ago. He also shares his concerns about the deep state's influence on the media, government, and legal system, and how they use lies and propaganda to achieve their goals. The host expresses his frustration with the lack of action from leaders and the continued spread of misinformation. He also mentions the Georgia Guidestones, which he believes contain a message from the deep state to reduce the world's population to half a billion people. The host concludes by expressing his hope for a better future and his desire to see the deep state's agenda exposed and brought down.\nDocument 238\nThe speaker argues that institutions associated with slavery and colonialism should be canceled, including the Ivy League universities, Oxford and Cambridge, and the Nobel Prize. They claim that these institutions were founded on wealth generated by slavery and colonialism, and that their legacy continues to perpetuate systemic racism and corruption.  The speaker targets specific institutions, such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, which they claim were founded on slave owner money. They also criticize the fraternity system, which they argue was designed to shelter the sons of slave owners and provide them with a life of privilege.  The speaker argues that academia is corrupt and produces inaccurate science due to a grant system based on popularity, nepotism, and old boy networks. They claim that this system perpetuates systemic racism and that the only way to create a cultural revolution is to cancel these institutions and their legacy.  The speaker also targets royalty, including the Queen, who they claim has a legacy of colonialism and slavery. They argue that the Queen's empire was built on the backs of slaves and that she continues to benefit from the wealth generated by colonialism.  Overall, the speaker's argument is that institutions associated with slavery and colonialism should be canceled and that a cultural revolution is needed to address the systemic racism and corruption that continues to perpetuate these institutions.\nDocument 239\nThe video discusses a complex web of relationships and connections between influential individuals, including politicians, media moguls, and business leaders. The host, Raven, claims that these individuals are part of a larger establishment that seeks to control various aspects of society, including the media, food, and healthcare.  Raven presents a list of individuals, including Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and George Bush, who are allegedly connected through their relationships and business dealings. The host also discusses the Clinton Foundation, which she claims has been involved in various scandals, including the use of toxic FEMA trailers in Haiti.  The video also touches on the topic of pedophilia and child trafficking, with Raven claiming that some of the individuals on the list have been involved in these activities. She presents evidence, including photos and videos, to support her claims.  Raven also discusses the topic of vaccines and the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming that the pandemic is a manufactured crisis designed to control the population. She presents evidence, including patent information and financial records, to support her claims.  The video concludes with a call to action, urging viewers to pray for the children and to follow Raven's page for more information. However, it's worth noting that the video presents a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked by experts and fact-checkers.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Systemic Racism (Document: 238): Mentions the need to cancel institutions associated with slavery and colonialism.\n    [2] Conspiracy Theories (Document: 239): Mentions a conspiracy theory about the COVID-19 pandemic being a manufactured crisis.\n    [2] Economic Diversification (Document: 235): Mentions Iraq's efforts to diversify revenue sources due to the 2020 budget deficit.\n    [2] Whistleblowers (Document: 229): Mentions Dr. Li Wenliang, a whistleblower who warned about a possible COVID-19 outbreak in China.\n    [2] Deep State (Document: 237): Mentions the alleged agenda of the deep state to control and manipulate the population.\n    [2] Government Overreach (Document: 232): Mentions a conspiracy involving DEA agent Joseph Rosati, Alan Borshak, and Mayor Bowser.\n    [2] Currency Revaluation (Document: 235): Mentions the potential revaluation of the Iraqi dinar.\n    [2] Sound Money (Document: 235): Mentions the shift towards sound money and commodity-backed currencies.\n    [2] Establishment (Document: 239): Mentions a complex web of relationships and connections between influential individuals.\n    [2] Government Transparency (Document: 234): Mentions a petition to stop the Coronavirus Act 2020.\n    [2] Silver Market (Document: 236): Mentions the potential for growth in the silver market.\n    [2] Coup (Document: 231): Mentions a potential hard military coup against Donald Trump."}

As you know, I've been working on setting up my YouTube channel professionally, and I'm happy to say that it's finally coming together. I've also been working on my Facebook page, where I'll be sharing more live videos and updates.  Today, I want to talk about something that I found very interesting. It's called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, a document that outlines a plan for controlling the masses through manipulation of industry, education, and politics. This plan has been used in various ways, including the Black Lives Matter movement and the COVID-19 pandemic.  I also want to talk about Joseph Gregory Hallett, who claims to be the new King of the UK. He has a fascinating history, dating back to the Priory of Zion in 1099. According to his website, he is a direct descendant of Queen Anne Boleyn and has the title of Christ.  Some people have questioned his legitimacy, but I believe that we should focus on the truth and not get caught up in speculation. I've been working closely with Greg Hallett and his team to help bring about a transition to greatness.  In other news, I want to talk about the Black Lives Matter protest that took place in Calgary today. My cameraman and reporter went to the scene and reported that the protesters didn't even know what building they were standing in front of. It was a very interesting observation.  I also want to talk about George Soros, who has been funding the Black Lives Matter movement. I'm not a fan of his, and I believe that he's using his wealth and influence to manipulate people and control the narrative.  I want to assure you that I'm working hard to bring you the truth, and I appreciate your support and feedback. I'll be doing more videos and live streams in\nDocument 241\nHere is a summary of the text in 384 tokens:  The Restored Republic via a GCR update as of April 1, 2020, provided information on the status of Tier 3 and 4 groups. Select Tier 3 groups were paid out, while the bulk of Tier 3 was paid on March 30 and 31. Tier 4A and 4B were expected to be notified within 48 hours. The Zim currency had a good default rate, and dependent on humanitarian project presentations, rates higher than the default rate were offered.   Redemption centers would have a 90-day NDA, and individuals would be tracked on their phone conversations, email, internet, and social media. Wearing masks or scarves to the redemption center was advised, and individuals may want to wear camouflage to avoid facial recognition machines.   The process of redemption included a 4-minute instruction video, a 5-8 minute presentation of the project, and verification of currency. Individuals would set up accounts, receive a debit card with $1,000,000, and have the option to do wire transfers.   The three days of darkness were expected to include internet, phone, and social media outages, but President Trump mentioned that usage would not be interrupted. Nazareth started a week ago, and 23,000 mortgages were forgiven by 10 a.m. EDT on March 31. The debt forgiveness program would continue and be completed by the end of April.   The IRS and Federal Reserve were being absorbed into the U.S. Treasury, and only U.S. citizens would be eligible for stimulus checks. The stimulus checks began to go out on March 30, and as of April 1, 638,000 checks had been sent out. Those on Social Security and others who received government monies by direct deposit would receive their stimulus checks by direct deposit on April \nDocument 242\nRestored Republic via GCR update as of April 27, 2020. Judy Note reported that Sunday, April 26th, would be a day to remember as the final weekend of this journey. The IMF and Iraq situation, along with news from elders and officials, indicated a redemption and exchange start in different countries on Sunday, April 26th. All must be completed prior to Friday, May 1st, meaning the US had to start this week. The elders took over the GCR, RV release, re-release of Dubai funds, and RV'd the Iraqi dinar on Wednesday, April 22nd, with public announcements scheduled for Monday, April 27th.  Tier 4B Internet Group, AS, 800 numbers release would be sometime Monday, April 27th to Wednesday, April 28th, with appointments beginning before Trump's big announcement about restoring the economy on Friday, May 1st. The cabal's deceitful misuse of 5G was imitating coronavirus, which they used to lock down the US and global economies. Two California ER doctors nuked Fauci's pandemic fraud as an indictment against.  President Trump and the Pentagon pedophile task force used the national lockdown to rescue over 50,000 traumatized children from the Cabal's underground tunnel torture chambers across the nation. Trump was expected to call off the lockdown and ask Americans to come back to work this Friday, May 1st. The top 27 white dragon Chinese elders and the grandfather insisted that the final RV, GCR release be finished, and they began completion of the final release last Sunday night, April 19th.  The US had no choice in the matter because the RV, GCR monies were released and are moving in a way that couldn't be stopped. On Monday, April 20th, there began a 10-day paradigm shift, Monday, April\nDocument 243\nWe're live at Freedom Square in Washington, D.C. for the largest patriot rally in U.S. history. The event is taking place despite the rain, and we're excited to bring you live coverage. Tomorrow is a big day at the Senate, and we'll be bringing you all the events live.   We're here to ensure that every legal vote counts and that we have a fair election. We're not trying to overturn the election, but rather to prevent voter fraud and foreign interference. The silent majority is speaking out, and we're calling on patriots to stand up for their rights and fight for freedom.  We've had speakers like Mike Lindell and Ali Alexander, and tomorrow we'll hear from President Trump and General Michael Flynn. There's also a prayer vigil tonight for Vice President Pence and a Freedom Rally hosted by Latinos for Trump. We'll be keeping you updated on all the events and activities.  Patriots have come from all across the nation to be here today, and we're feeling the excitement and energy. We're not just here to protest, but to find out who on Capitol Hill is on our side and who's a traitor. Tomorrow will be a crucial day, and we'll be bringing you all the updates live.\nDocument 244\nAs of April 9th, 2020, the Restored Republic via GCR update indicates that patience is a virtue, and good moral beings have the power to overcome evil and change the world. The decision-makers plan to release full payouts and adjustments to adjudicated accounts from Wednesday, April 8th, forward, and then all other accounts, including Tier 4B redemptions, between April 8th and April 14th.  Q mentioned that it's all about the children, referring to a military operation that rescued thousands of children caged in underground tunnels in New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Many perpetrators have been killed or arrested, and over 150,000 indictments have been issued, mostly for pedophilia.  The Dubai 1 and 2 accounts funded the Tier 1 government's $2 trillion stimulus bill, and the RV in the US and new rates would be fully paid out. However, the release of funds was delayed due to security audits and the removal of Pentagon Inspector General Glenn Fine, who was flagged as an Obama-era bureaucrat interfering with the plan.  The Zurich PM Contact expected D1 holding account funds to be released on Wednesday, April 8th, and Tiers 4A, B may start from D2 holding account funds later this week or on April 14th. The SBA-related contact Daniel D. should hear that the government has released SBA loan funds for issuing funds as early as today or tomorrow.  The Deep State has no other move in their playbook to fight Trump, the Alliance, and the RV, GCR release, except for Pelosi pushing mail-in voting to try to oust Trump through voter fraud in the fall 2020 election. The MSM will continue to push their global coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic fear informational war for the rest of this month and beyond.  Trump and the Alliance have turned the pandemic on its head\nDocument 245\nI'm Jolynn Live, a citizen journalist with Sea Vine News Network, reporting from Spokane, Washington. Today, I'm covering the \"Freedom is the Cure\" rally, where citizens are demanding the right to reopen their businesses.   A local business owner shared her perspective, stating that the economy has disintegrated and it's time to get back to work. She emphasized the importance of common sense, suggesting that people can practice hygiene and wear masks if they're concerned about their safety.   The business owner expressed frustration with Governor Inslee's extension of stay-at-home orders, claiming that Spokane is a safe place and didn't get hit hard by the pandemic. She plans to reopen her coffee shop on Monday, despite potential legal risks, to support her employees and their families.   The rally's message is clear: people want to get back to work and rebuild their lives. The business owner's words of advice to Governor Inslee are to be smart and consider the different needs of various regions in Washington state. The crowd chanted \"Freedom!\" as I concluded my report.\nDocument 246\nThe speaker, a senior leader, emphasizes the importance of situational awareness and maintaining an apolitical military. They mention a potential impeachment and a photograph of them at Lafayette Square, which sparked a national debate about the military's role in civil society. The speaker acknowledges their mistake and the need to uphold the principle of an apolitical military. They also mention Mike Pence and Nancy Pelosi, but the context is unclear. The speaker seems to be discussing a potential coup or impeachment, but the details are vague.\nDocument 247\nGood morning, I'm Karen Hudis, and this video is called \"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning.\" I'm excited to share my thoughts on the current situation, which I believe is a new beginning. However, not everyone understands this, and it's going to become apparent soon. The coronavirus is not making sense, and it's not an epidemic of the proportions that would call for this kind of response. I believe it's a false flag event, designed to unsettle and frighten people.  The mainstream media is owned by the culprits we're fighting, and they're trying to misinform us. The coronavirus was developed with a patent, and it's not an illness that warrants the response we're seeing. Schools are closed, businesses are shutting down, and politicians are telling us to protect ourselves. But I believe this is all part of a larger plan to panic people and get them to accept a vaccine that contains an RFID chip.  This chip would allow the government to keep tabs on us, and it's already being used in various forms of surveillance. The mainstream media is owned by a small group of families, including the black nobility, who are behind the central banks and Wall Street. I've worked at the World Bank for over 20 years and have seen firsthand the corruption that exists.  I'm documenting my experiences and sharing them with you, so you can understand the extent of the corruption. The key is to recognize that things are not normal and to use our critical reasoning capabilities to see that nothing adds up. People are starting to wake up and realize that we're living in a society that's not what it seems. We're being separated from each other, and we're being made suspicious and uncomfortable through the media.  But I believe that we can stand up to this corruption by recognizing the truth and taking action. We need to be aware of the RFID chip and the surveillance that's\nDocument 248\nThe host is discussing the trending topic \"Obamagate\" on Twitter, with over 1.12 million tweets. This was sparked by the release of transcripts, which the host claims are fake and part of a political operation to take out an incoming president, orchestrated by Obama and Hillary. The host believes Obama was an \"usurper president\" who infiltrated the DOJ and other systems, and that President Trump's recent Instagram post is a sign of the investigation into Obamagate beginning. The host notes that Twitter is erasing tweets related to the topic in real-time, suggesting the actual number of tweets may be much higher.\nDocument 249\nDr. Dave Janda discusses the deep state's goal to strip Americans of their freedoms and liberties. He highlights the Obama administration's abuse of the NSA system and the existence of parallel platforms, such as \"The Hammer,\" which were used for illegal surveillance. These platforms allowed the administration to gain information for blackmail and coercion without leaving a digital footprint.  Dr. Janda mentions whistleblowers like Dennis Montgomery, Bill Binney, and Kirk Wiebe, who have been demonized and slandered for exposing the truth about these parallel platforms. He also references an interview with Sidney Powell, who discussed the Obama administration's massive surveillance operation, including the use of \"The Hammer.\"  Dr. Janda notes that the mainstream media is not covering this story due to their ties to the deep state. He encourages viewers to read articles by investigative journalists Mary Fanning and Alan Jones, who have exposed the corruption of the Obama administration and the Department of Justice.  The video also mentions the Inspector General's report and the frantic behavior of Strzok and Page after Dr. Janda's interview with General Tom McInerney in 2017. Dr. Janda believes that the recent revelation about \"The Hammer\" has caused panic in D.C. and that Christopher Wray's sudden interest in investigating General Flynn's case is a result of this.  Dr. Janda concludes by encouraging viewers to read the article by Mary Fanning and Alan Jones and to listen to the interview with Sidney Powell on his website. He emphasizes the importance of exposing the truth about the deep state's corruption and the need for Americans to take action to protect their freedoms.\nDocument 250\nWelcome to this series on the Network of Global Corporate Control. I'm Karen Hudis, your host. Today's segment is about government. We previously discussed Ferdinand Marcos and Ronald Reagan, and how they were involved in a revolution. Marcos was preserving the world's assets, interest in the global debt facility. We put the Federal Reserve Bank into receivership in the Global Debt Facility last year and filed liens against it in 11 states this year.  There's a hidden history in the United States, dating back to the French Revolution. The Crown Prince of France was made manager of the US in 1805, and the Pacer family lost control of the Virginia Company in 1933. This hidden puppeteer has been controlling the US, similar to other countries like France, Britain, Russia, Germany, Hungary, and Spain.  The 1789 Constitution is going back into effect, and martial law is ending. Justice Antonin Scalia may have been ready to disclose the fact that the US is secretly being governed by martial law. I called him out for refusing to tell the American people, and tweeted about the corruption in the Supreme Court. I also told the American Bar Association that lawyers are too corrupt to regulate the legal profession anymore.  The US is being governed by a network of global corporate control, and it's time to learn about and end it. We're working to put the Federal Reserve Bank into receivership and end martial law.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Patriots and Activism (Document: 243, 245, 247, 249): Mentions the importance of patriots and activism in fighting for freedom and liberty.\n    [2] Martial Law and Governance (Document: 250): Mentions the existence of martial law and the potential for a hidden puppeteer controlling the government.\n    [2] QAnon and Conspiracy Theories (Document: 240, 242, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250): Mentions the existence of QAnon and potential conspiracy theories.\n    [2] Deep State and Conspiracy (Document: 240, 242, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250): Mentions the existence of a deep state and potential conspiracy theories.\n    [2] Network of Global Corporate Control (Document: 250): Mentions the existence of a network of global corporate control and the potential for a hidden puppeteer controlling the government.\n    [2] Election and Voting (Document: 240, 243, 248): Mentions the importance of fair elections and the potential for voter fraud.\n    [2] Surveillance and RFID (Document: 247, 249): Mentions the potential for surveillance and the use of RFID chips.\n    [2] Whistleblowers and Leaks (Document: 240, 242, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250): Mentions the importance of whistleblowers and leaks in exposing corruption.\n    [2] COVID-19 and Pandemic (Document: 240, 242, 244, 245, 247, 248): Mentions the response to the pandemic and potential manipulation of information.\n    [2] Obamagate and Investigation (Document: 240, 242, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250): Mentions the potential for an investigation into Obamagate.\n    [2] Government Corruption (Document: 240, 242, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250): Mentions abuse of power, manipulation, and control of the government.\n    [2] Media Censorship (Document: 240, 246, 248): Mentions manipulation of information and control of the narrative.\n    [2] Freedom and Liberty (Document: 243, 245, 247, 249): Mentions the importance of individual rights and freedoms."}

I'm frustrated and angry, feeling like a prisoner, with no choice but to go to an alternative source. The corporate world is insane, and it's been allowed to operate for too long, taking away our freedom. I'm not trying to hurt anyone, but those in charge are trying to hurt me and you. They want us to be voluntary slaves, bowing to the demonic element. I won't submit to their tyranny. I've resisted other platforms like Facebook and Twitter, but they've been the vehicles I've used to communicate with the world. I have friends who won't look at Facebook because it spies on us.

He attributes this to the fact that conservatives don't genuinely care about right-leaning creators, but rather use them for entertainment. The channel is now trying to diversify its content, including React Andy-style videos, but this attempt at baiting leftists has been met with ridicule.  The creator highlights the hypocrisy of Caitlin Bennett, a prominent figure on the channel, who has been accused of neo-Nazism and Holocaust denialism. He mocks her attempts to appear oppressed and ashamed of her white identity, pointing out that she is actually a Trump supporter and a neo-Nazi.  The video in question features Caitlin Bennett repeating the same points multiple times, including her refusal to apologize for being white, conservative, and Christian. The creator finds this attempt at victimhood laughable, especially given her history of promoting hate speech and hypocrisy.  He also criticizes the channel's use of Patreon, which has a relatively small number of patrons, and their attempts to monetize their content through ads. The creator suggests that the channel's desperation is evident in their attempts to bait leftists and promote their own brand of conservatism.  Ultimately, the creator views Caitlin Bennett as a \"lolcow,\" someone who is perpetually embarrassing and entertaining to watch. He believes that her hypocrisy and attempts at victimhood are laughable and that the channel's decline in popularity is well-deserved.\nDocument 253\nThe speaker is shocked by the public's continued adherence to mask-wearing and paranoia despite the apparent inconsistency in the government's response to the pandemic. They argue that the initial lockdown was based on the assumption that the virus would spread rapidly, but this has not been the case. The speaker suggests that the government's approach is to create divisions and implement a new infrastructure, including a cashless society.  They point out that the Bank of England replaced paper notes with plastic ones in 2019, which could be used to spread the virus. The speaker believes that the government is planning a second, more deadly pandemic to silence voices of dissent and take away more freedoms.  The speaker compares the current situation to the post-9\/11 era, where terrorism was used to justify surveillance and take away rights. They argue that the current pandemic is a new upgrade to this plan, using a universal fear of a virus to control the population.  The speaker calls for people to wake up and question the government's actions, pointing out that the number of deaths from non-Covid related illnesses is higher than those from Covid. They suggest that the public should be more critical of the government's version of science and hold them accountable for their actions.\nDocument 254\nHello everyone, I'm Peter from England, and today I'm discussing a webinar about the Weirbank debt easement and eradication program. This program aims to help people pay off their debts incurred due to the global financial Zionist banking cartel's debt slavery. A preliminary aid notice is available for download, which can be printed and displayed outside your property to serve as a defense against debt collectors.  The next webinar is scheduled for February 13th and will focus on educating people about the program and its mechanics. We will cover how to pay off IRS and state taxes using the voucher payment system, which is recognized by the US Department of Defense, Treasury, and White House. This system is particularly beneficial for ex-military personnel and veterans.  The notice you see is a printable PDF that can be displayed outside your property or on your front door. It explains that your property cannot be taken from you unless a case is heard in the Chancery Division of your district or local district court. Most foreclosures occur due to administrative or commercial maritime hearings, which are not official but assume you don't know your rights.  Weirbank aims to educate people on how to use the system for their benefit, move cases from creditor-debtor to trustee-beneficiary, and avoid litigation without proof of jurisdictional competence.

Today, I'll be discussing the concept of war castles, specifically the Vatican, the City of London, and Washington D.C. These three entities form a triangle, and they've been involved in capturing humanity through various means, including money laundering, human trafficking, and the manipulation of birth certificates.  When you're born, you're considered a ward of the state, and your birth certificate is a commercial instrument that makes you a part of the old school Masonic system. This system is based on shipping and postal wars that have morphed into banking wars. The three war castles work together, with the Vatican being the oldest, followed by the City of London, and then Washington D.C.  The birth certificate is used to capture individuals and bring them under the laws of the Masonic system. It's a commercial instrument that makes you a part of the global construct, subject to admiralty and maritime law. This law is based on the principle of \"law of the sea,\" which has been held by the King of Great Britain since ancient times.  The City of London was formed by the banking fraternity, and it's a replica of the Vatican. The Pentagon in Washington D.C. is also considered a vessel, and all the people in it are considered missing, dead, or presumed lost at sea. This is because the birth certificate system is used to make individuals part of the global construct, and they're considered dead until they're brought under the laws of the system.  The postmaster general of the world is a key figure in this system, and it's explained in part two of this discussion. The concept of war castles and the manipulation of birth certificates is a complex topic, but it's essential to understand the truth behind it to free ourselves from the system.\nDocument 256\nThe video discusses updates on Zion Oil and Gas, Kim Clement's prophecy, and the potential revaluation of the dinar. Zion Oil and Gas has been steady, trading between 27 cents and 34 cents over the last month, despite not having any revenue yet. The company is waiting for Israel's borders to open, allowing them to send their crew and rig to extract oil. This is expected to happen on July 1st, and the price may go down before it goes up.  Kim Clement's prophecy mentions a \"giant of debt\" and a \"simple stone\" that will take it down. The prophecy is tied to the dinar revaluation, but it's not the solution to the debt. Instead, it's a new energy source that will wipe out the debt. The prophecy also mentions a 20,000 Dow and a revaluation of the dinar, but it's not a guarantee of wiping out the debt.  The video also discusses trading on Webull, which starts trading at 3 a.m. Central Standard Time, giving traders an early opportunity to buy in a dip. The host encourages viewers to sign up for the Patreon to support the Gregoria Legends project, a biblical project that promotes the truth and God's word through Japanese animation.  The host also discusses the potential market crash, the president's efforts to keep the market strong, and the ongoing battle between the president and social media. The host believes that a blackout is coming, which will change everything, and that the financial system will change when all the events come to a head.\nDocument 257\nThe video discusses the possibility of deep underground military bases (DUMBs) being destroyed by the US military, with some earthquakes attributed to these demolitions. The speaker, a Trump supporter, believes this could be a sign of the \"white hats\" taking down a demonic cabal that has infiltrated human society. The cabal is described as demonic, satanic, and Luciferian elements that have controlled and enslaved humanity through their monetary system, media, and infiltration of religions.  The speaker shares their personal experience of being stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, near Cheyenne Mountain, which is known to have an underground military base. They mention other areas, such as Area 51 and the Denver airport, where there are alleged underground military establishments and cities.  The speaker expresses hope that the destruction of DUMBs is a sign of positive change and the awakening of humanity. They believe that the money created through fiat currency should be used for humanitarian projects, not war and destruction. They also mention the importance of shifting from a Piscean to an Aquarian age, where people become more conscious and aware of their reality.  The speaker concludes that everything is a mix of truth and lies, and that a shift in human perception and belief systems is necessary for a major change. They end by thanking the audience and expressing a desire for a global awakening.\nDocument 258\nChris Marcus from Arcadia Economics discusses Cliff High's web bot and its $600 silver prediction. Cliff had expected the price to manifest earlier, but it's now in year one of his \"year zero\" timeline. The web bot's data has been predicting this price for at least 10 years, with the longer it's in the data set, the closer it is to reality. Cliff believes the data was pushed forward two years, and now it's a matter of whether the timing was delayed or the data was incorrect.\nDocument 259\nHello, I'm Peter of England, and I'm here to update you on the Economic Impact Payment Vouchers. These vouchers were launched two weeks ago, and we've received many questions. The vouchers are a response to the economic impact of the lockdown, and they're available to those who have been financially, emotionally, or socially affected.  The vouchers are part of the Coronavirus Act 2020 in the UK and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act 2020 in the US. The US has allocated $6 trillion, while the UK has allocated \u00a340 billion. These funds are meant to compensate individuals for lost income due to the lockdown.  The vouchers are a claim for reparations, and they're available to those who have been impacted by the lockdown. The government is saying that you're entitled to these funds, and it's a statement that you have the right to retake the treasuries.  We're hosting a webinar on Friday, the 29th, at 6 o'clock Central European Time, to explain everything. If you've purchased a voucher, the webinar is complimentary. If not, there's a notional payment of \u00a310 sterling. We'll be discussing how to access these funds, and we'll also be exploring the geopolitical reasons behind the lockdown.  The vouchers will be sent out on the 25th or 26th of this month, so by the time the webinar comes along, they'll already be on their way. I look forward to seeing you all on Friday.\nDocument 260\nHello everyone, I'm excited to share my latest video with Magenta Pixie and Charlie Freak on Rumble. I've also posted a link in the comments. In my latest video, I discussed the geopolitical arena and received a download from my guides that the UK will become the 51st state of America. This is part of the Golden Age timeline, where the old timeline is collapsing. I believe there will be two timelines, and people will have to choose which one they want to follow.   I also want to talk about the spiritual war that's being enacted, and how it's a war on consciousness. If you're stuck in the third-dimensional consciousness, you're playing into the warlord's hands. I suggest looking with your heart and trusting your intuition. When you receive a message, pay attention to how it makes you feel. If it makes you feel excited and expansive, it's likely from your higher self. If it makes you feel scared or constricted, it's likely from your ego.  Remember, success is encoded in our DNA, and we're God's creations. God doesn't create failures, and we have the power to choose our reality. I want to leave you with a message of love and remind you that love is who we are. We just need to attune to it and choose it.   Before I go, I want to say that I'm grateful for all of you, and I love you all. Namaste.\nDocument 261\nPeople of faith are facing restrictions, with church attendance prohibited, while mass chaos in the streets is tolerated. The upcoming election is shaping up to be a contrast between order and disorder, with Biden and Democrats framing rioting and looting as \"peaceful protesting.\"\nDocument 262\nThe speaker discusses the topic of masks, vaccines, and what they consider \"stupid people\" in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. They argue that masks are not a political issue, but rather a necessary measure to prevent the spread of the virus, which they claim is a bioweapon. The speaker notes that some protesters are not wearing masks, which they believe will lead to illness. They also claim that masks do not affect oxygen intake, citing personal experience in boat building and the use of oxygen measuring devices.\nDocument 263\nI'm on Brighton Beach, but I wanted to let everyone know that I've uploaded a new video with Magenta Pixie and Nina Star Song on Rumble and will be posting it on YouTube soon. The video discusses deep intel about the situation in America, the role of DJT, and the transition to a new earth with America as its capital. It also covers censorship, big tech, and alternative platforms. I highly recommend watching it for insightful information and analysis.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Patreon (Document: 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46,

{"summary":"Document 264\nBrandon Smith, the founder of alt-market.com, joined the Times of Industry show to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic implications. Smith believes the government's response to the virus is an abuse of power, using it as a distraction event to centralize power and remove civil liberties. He thinks the virus is a serious issue but not an excuse for martial law.  Smith discussed the economic collapse, stating that it's a long-lasting disaster that will affect more people than the virus itself. He mentioned the supply chain collapse, with corporations like Walmart unable to order specific items from warehouses, and a possible credit freeze or liquidity crisis leading to a bank holiday.  Regarding the vaccine, Smith believes it will take at least a year to develop, and the mainstream media has given false hope to the public. He thinks the government is hinting at narratives to slow down the economic crash.  Smith's primary concerns are the supply chain collapse and a possible credit freeze or liquidity crisis. He thinks a bank holiday is coming, which will be blamed on the virus, but is actually due to a credit crisis.  When asked about President Trump's crisis management, Smith expressed skepticism about the upcoming election, wondering if it will even happen. He believes Trump is playing a role, being the bumbling conservative who screws everything up, and thinks this is part of a bigger agenda to make conservatives look ridiculous.

The narrator suggests that Jones' ego and lack of military training led to this behavior, as he failed to understand the protocols of interacting with a high-ranking military official. The narrator also implies that Jones' treatment of people is similar to how generals treat civilians, using them for their own purposes without respect.  The narrator then shifts focus to the firing of David Knight, a popular InfoWars host, who was let go by Alex Jones after Knight began questioning Donald Trump's authenticity. The narrator suggests that Jones and Trump are both owned by the same group of people and will go down together. The narrator also mentions that General Flynn has snubbed Jones at a Trump event, further implying that Jones is not on the same level as high-ranking officials.\nDocument 266\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the Wednesday afternoon conference call with Trusts Unlimited. I'm Jim George, the non-attorney spokesman, and I'll be discussing the situation in Iraq and its potential impact on the Iraqi dinar.   The Iraqi dinar is expected to be revalued in the next 45 to 60 days, but due to recent complications in Iraq, we're pushing back the timeline. The CBI operations are complete, and the Project Delete the Zeros is done. The lower denomination coinage is in the possession of the eight regional banks, and auctions have dropped to a trickle.   The 2020 budget is in limbo due to plummeting oil prices, but the Parliament has decided to create a five-month budget, which will take them through May of this year, followed by a month-to-month budget. This will make it easier to insert the reinstitution of the dinar without creating a situation where the finance committee would have to redo the budget.   The United States is stepping up pressure on Iraq and Iran, and U.S. troop strength in Iraq is increasing. The Trump administration has told the Shia blocs to honor the status of forces agreement, and the U.S. has neutralized Iran. The U.S. is also trying to be an intermediary to provide energy, oil, and refined gas to Iraq in order to circumvent the Iranian sale to Iraq.   The U.S. sanctions are scheduled to resume again on May 1st, and the United States has made it clear that they're not going anywhere and will not allow any further interference by Iran.   I'm scheduled to attend a call sponsored by the IMF, which will discuss the nationalization of the Federal Reserve, the repatriation of gold to the United States, and IMF loans to countries suffering from the coronavirus pandemic.   For those calling in for the first time, I suggest checking\nDocument 267\nJeff Nielsen, a commentator on precious metals and hard assets, joins the Titans of Industry show to discuss his views on the current market. He emphasizes that the gold-silver ratio is not as out of whack as people claim, and that the characterization of silver as an industrial metal is a myth. Nielsen points out that in India, jewelry is a form of savings, not an industrial good, and that the majority of silver demand comes from monetary purposes.  Regarding oil prices, Nielsen attributes the current weakness to the global economy's demand picture, particularly in the West. He notes that oil demand peaked in the US and is now below previous peak levels, raising questions about the existence of a US recovery. Nielsen also discusses the Federal Reserve's actions, stating that they are treating crazy interest rates and money printing as normal. He suggests that the Fed may have been preparing for the COVID pandemic before it appeared.  On the COVID pandemic, Nielsen expresses uncertainty about the true nature of the virus and the policy responses. He notes that the virus is particularly contagious, has a long incubation period, and has a significant but unknown percentage of asymptomatic carriers, making containment difficult. Nielsen also questions the assumption of herd immunity, citing mixed reports on whether people automatically develop immunity.  Finally, Nielsen discusses his current work, having left the precious metals space for a few years to work in the market side. He is now retooling his plans to get back into precious metals and will be adding new content to dynamicwealthresearch.com.\nDocument 268\nHello everyone, welcome to Silverfest. I'm joined today by Alistair McLeod from goldmoney.com. Alistair, welcome. You've been analyzing the silver market for a long time, and I know everyone's interested in your research.   Alistair starts by discussing the economic background for silver, which is tied to the demise of paper money. He believes the global economy is extremely bearish for 2020 and beyond, citing a liquidity crisis, trade war, and the end of the bank credit cycle. He draws parallels to the 1929 economic crisis, which led to the Great Depression.  Alistair explains that the Federal Reserve will not permit the total amount of money in the economy to contract, so every move towards bank credit contraction will be made up by the expansion of base money. This has led to a surge in gold and silver prices, with the gold-silver ratio falling from 125 to 72.  Alistair emphasizes that silver is as much money as gold throughout history and has been more the money of people than gold. He believes silver will play a major role as the replacement money for fiat currency in the future. The above-ground stocks of gold are much larger than those of silver, but the mine supply ratio is only eight times, which could lead to a tight situation in the silver market.  Alistair also discusses the concept of the \"silver whale,\" a large entity buying silver in the SLV trust. He believes people don't understand what's going on, which is why silver is only priced where it is. He estimates that the inflows at goldmoney.com are around $3 billion, with more silver than gold in terms of weight but more gold in terms of monetary value.  Alistair concludes by saying that demand will switch towards silver as people realize its importance, but the amount of silver available for investment is strictly limited. He encourages people\nDocument 269\nDr. Dave Janda, host of Operation Freedom Briefings, discusses the deep state's attempt to create a \"dark winter\" in the US, similar to Venezuela and China. He explains that the deep state wants to strip Americans of their freedoms and liberties, and that the 2020 election was a key part of this plan. Janda notes that Joe Biden's statement about a \"dark winter\" was actually a reference to his plan to steal the election, which was facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and mail-in voting.  Janda emphasizes that the election was a multi-level, multi-faceted, coordinated criminal vote fraud operation, and that it's a war on several fronts. He explains that the electronic side of the vote is a critical aspect of this war, and that Sidney Powell's work on this front is crucial to exposing the truth.  Janda addresses the recent announcement that Sidney Powell is no longer working on the election, but notes that she was never hired by Trump or the RNC, and was instead a legal consultant donating her services. He also discusses the importance of chain of custody of the votes, and how it's critical to confirming that votes were not manipulated or changed during the electronic transfer process.  Janda concludes by emphasizing the need for a measured and rational approach to addressing the election fraud, and encourages listeners to stay focused and driven in the fight for truth and justice. He also notes that General Flynn and Lin Wood are continuing to work on exposing the election fraud, and that their efforts are aligned with the goal of proving the massive deliberate election fraud that robbed Americans of their votes.\nDocument 270\nThe speaker had the pleasure of working with the US Navy SEALs and shares his views on their efficiency, capability, training, selection, and structure. He notes that the Navy SEALs underwent significant changes from their early days as the Underwater Demolition Team to their current form. The speaker highlights the differences between the British and American approaches to special forces, with the British focusing on long-term operations and living off the land, while the Americans focused on short-term operations and relying on resupply.  The speaker also discusses the differences in equipment and budget between the two forces. He notes that the Navy SEALs had an unlimited budget and could afford to buy the latest gear, whereas the British Special Boat Service (SBS) had to make do with limited resources and often had to improvise. The speaker recalls an exercise where the SEALs dumped their gear to avoid carrying it, while the British had to pick it up.  The speaker suggests that the Navy SEALs eventually adopted some of the British approach, incorporating elements of long-term operations and self-sufficiency into their training and operations. He notes that this was a result of the close relationship between the SBS and the SEALs, which allowed them to learn from each other and adapt to different environments.  Overall, the speaker's experience working with the Navy SEALs highlights the differences between the British and American approaches to special forces, as well as the benefits of collaboration and knowledge-sharing between different military units.\nDocument 271\nThe Morgan Report with David Morgan discusses the stock market and its potential for volatility. The Dow experienced a significant sell-off on June 11th, and while it has shown some strength in its comeback, it may see more volatility. David Morgan notes that the overall equity markets in the US are overvalued, but this doesn't mean they can't continue to rise. The Nasdaq has hit an all-time high, and the stock market is receiving a boost from the increased money supply.  International trade is expected to shrink by 27% in the second quarter, with developing countries being hit harder than developed ones. China's exports have grown by 3% in April, but Germany's car manufacturers are facing significant challenges as they emerge from the coronavirus crisis.  David Morgan believes that the world is in a contraction, and this contraction is accelerating. He thinks that the stock market will not experience a V-shaped recovery and that it will take longer than expected to recover. He also notes that the US debt has increased by $1 trillion in one month, which is a concerning trend.  The report also discusses the potential for silver to be used as a monetary asset, citing an article by Jeff Clark. David Morgan notes that silver has a long history of being used as money and that it is a store of value in times of crisis. He also mentions that there are efforts underway to rethink the use of silver in Latin America for energy conservation purposes.  David Morgan concludes by emphasizing the importance of speaking the truth, even in difficult times. He encourages listeners to be true to themselves and to stand together in the face of adversity.\nDocument 272\nThe speaker claims to be a Planet Potentiary Judge and Chief Federal Postal Court Judge, stating that all debts and mortgages are forgiven due to a profound statement made. They ask viewers to share the video with others, as the information is crucial for the entire world to know. The speaker explains that the world is transitioning to a gold-backed economy, where gold is the new currency, and that this will lead to the collapse of the current fiat currency system.  The speaker claims that corporations and governments use coded language to manipulate people, but they have cracked the codes and will educate viewers on how to understand them. They explain that the current system is based on a shadow world of fiction, where corporations and governments hold power over people, but this will change with the introduction of the gold-backed economy.  The speaker warns that the pension funds of baby boomers are in danger and that they should take control of their own pensions. They also claim that the use of the word \"virus\" is a form of mind control and that it will be banned.  The speaker explains that people have the power to become beneficiaries of the world's ecosystem, financial system, and bureaucratic system by taking responsibility and performing their social contracts. They encourage viewers to share the video and descriptions with others and to take action to protect their rights.  The speaker also mentions that the British Broadcasting Corporation has been disqualified due to false and misleading statements, and that people can email them for more information. They conclude by thanking their teacher and mentor, David Wayne Miller, and encouraging viewers to take action to spread the good news and perform their social contracts.\nDocument 273\nJohn Perry Barlow's \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" was written in 1996 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Barlow declared that cyberspace is a naturally independent entity, free from the tyrannies imposed by governments. He argued that governments have no moral right to rule cyberspace, as they have not solicited or received the consent of its inhabitants.   Barlow stated that cyberspace is a world where anyone can express their beliefs without fear of coercion, and where identities are not tied to physical bodies. He believed that governance in cyberspace would emerge from ethics, self-interest, and the common good, rather than external impositions.   Barlow criticized governments for trying to impose their laws on cyberspace, citing the Telecommunications Reform Act in the United States as an example. He argued that these laws are attempts to control the global conversation of bits and to own speech itself throughout the world.   Barlow declared that the inhabitants of cyberspace will spread themselves across the planet, making it impossible for governments to arrest their thoughts. He envisioned a civilization of the mind in cyberspace, which would be more humane and fair than the world created by governments.\n","topics":"[1] Politics\n    [2] Alternative Media (Document: 264, 265): Mentions radio shows and alternative news sources.\n    [2] Special Forces (Document: 270): Discusses the differences between the British and American approaches to special forces.\n    [2] Election Fraud (Document: 269): Discusses the 2020 US presidential election and allegations of vote fraud.\n    [2] Global Economy (Document: 266, 267, 271): Discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the potential for a liquidity crisis.\n    [2] Cyber Governance (Document: 273): Discusses the governance of cyberspace and the potential for a self-regulating online community.\n    [2] Gold-Backed Economy (Document: 272): Discusses the potential for a gold-backed economy and the collapse of the current fiat currency system."}
