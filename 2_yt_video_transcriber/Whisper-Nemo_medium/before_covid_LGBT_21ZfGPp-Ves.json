            "text": "Hey.  Hey everyone, it's Z from TransVoiceLessons.com and in this video, I want to demonstrate the differences between resonance and pitch.  One of the most difficult aspects of altering the voice is learning to separate your resonance from your pitch.  When you finally manage to detangle these two crucial elements, a vast world of sound will be rewarded to you.  Alright, the way I like to think about this is with a simple X and Y graph, okay?  So on this graph, the Y axis represents pitch from high to low.  And the X axis will represent resonance from dark to bright, okay?  So sit back, get comfortable, and I'm going to show your ear the difference between resonance and pitch once and for all.  Wherever I drag the indicator, that's the sound I'll do my best to make.  Alright, yeah, so I'm gonna start kind of in the middle of the female average here, and I'm just gonna slowly start to bring the pitch down a little ",

If you start to change your voice and you feel like you sound boyish or sort of boyish and kind of fake, well that would probably mean you need your resonance to go brighter and your pitch is fine.  If you sound too brassy and buzzy, that might indicate that your pitch needs to go up.  you Okay, so I hope you enjoyed that.  The big takeaway is from this.  You should start viewing your voice as a two-dimensional thing.  In reality, though, it's like an eight-dimensional thing or maybe even more.  I don't know.  I'm still trying to figure out how many dimensions we can map it to.  But you want to learn how to separate your resonance from your pitch, okay?  They are entirely different elements, and I hope you can use these recordings to help you hear that and further develop that capability.
