            "text": "So you saw how she just put herself all in front of their vehicle. They're trying to leave the Mercedes Benz dealership. She's saying they're trespassing. How do you know on all of you to say they trespass? And you have to be either some management employee or the owner. And I'll say Karen wasn't that, but she just wanted this to be lined and harass black men. So we we have to deal with them. Ladies and gentlemen, throughout the world who could be watching. This is the life of black people in America. As we, you have seen several times or watching this channel, some of you may think that this can't be real life. These people can't really be this way. Yes. This is real life you're seeing. You're not seeing reality TV or anything like that. This is who they are in this country. This is why I tell some of you when you say, Oh, I want to go to America and I'll tell you why, why do you want to come here? You really want to deal with Karen. You want that problem. You want to deal with police pudding. They knees on your neck and choking you out and killing you. You want to deal with that because that's what you could deal with coming to America. You do better where you ask, fix your own countries, where you at I'm telling you, you don't want to come into this problem. But I I read it said the Mercedes Benz or Scottsdale. So maybe Scottsdale, Arizona could be whatever was at or maybe another Scottsdale. I'm just taking a wild stab in the dark. But even though when the men came up, blocking her crazy behind and I guess whatever guy that she's with or whatever, he's trying to pull her away. And she still like that. See a woman like that. I couldn't be with her. I said, 'cause a woman, like they go get to positive, hurt or kill because you're trying to clean up her mess and What she's doing out here. And then it could 'cause you to be in some sort of fight with a man and you wouldn't even cross two words with, well, she crazy a woman like that. no she would have to go with me. I cannot deal no woman center for challenging a man. You don't challenge no man like that. And for what the men wasn't doing, you anything, they they were leaving. And even if they wasn't leaving, what is it to her? I mean, these people are crazy. I mean the last time we covered what this woman was some Russian and and she got money. Her and her husband got money and wanna, she wanna cry and complain and she's not racist or how many videos that we've seen you run up on white people and call the police on them. No, she didn't call the police, but she was trying to yell. You seen the background, you've seen cop lights. It was in the distance. She was yelling to hopefully get their attention short and yelling for their attention. Those guys that came up here yelling for the police because they knew exactly the police gonna do to black people. But who is she? I mean, you guys probably could find out you probably guys probably even know who she is, but who was, does she work? Do they approve of the way she act in this video? Let us know the epidemic. Call Karen. We continue to be Chronicle every chance we get, because we got to definitely put out the message that Karen is a part of the problem too. Not just the police. Karen tries to get the police to come out to harm jail or possibly killed black people. So yes, Karen has to be focused on in this time period. For those of you who are protesting throughout the world, make sure you keep Karen out of your country. 'Cause that Karen will be trying to go to the different African nations. Karen, be trying to go to the different Asian countries wherever she likes to go keep her out. If you don't want that problem. But a lot of you don't have now on the call, right? So that is a lot of it at least, because like I said before, when I was in the continent last time I said, listen in up and say something crazy to me, the Mzungu, we we will handle 911 here. So who are you going to call?",
