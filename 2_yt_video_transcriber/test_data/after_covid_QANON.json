            "text": "well there's a number there's a number of differences one would be so isn't it I'll describe what we are and then I'll describe what I think Navy SEALs are to to to make that distinction but certainly for for the SAS we we traditionally recruit from RAF Army Navy territorials and the low command and then there's plenty troops in that set and we have our own boat troops and boat troops one quarter of our squadrons that do that and they'll do traditional Navy SEAL type operations generally what happens normally for the SBS the special boat service is that they are primarily recruited from Marines and that Marines will then join the SBS and the SBS will then do their boat course whichever boat trips guide going to do with them now that SBS boat course and sort of parts of the marine course will be similar to what the Navy SEALs go through when they do their training and the Navy SEALs and my understanding is the SEAL team sects of the shorter meaning counter terrorist unit within the Navy SEALs they all go through quite a rigorous sort of marine based selection process which will have different modules attached to it but then Navy SEALs and this is where some people get em mixed up Navy SEALs are probably as particularly SEAL Teams 6 are predominantly the mean sort of door kickers can a terrorism unit within the US people think it's Delta Force Delta force are completely separate and delta force were modeled on the SAS so there was a major I'm trying to remember his name he came across and he saw selection he saw how the SAS were sorta structured and what they were meant for and he went back and he disdained almost the sort of replica in terms of a six-month selection process what they were looking for and that made delta forced who are traditionally from also scream various Rangers and all that sort of stuff and need they have a counterterrorism element to them as well and but the operates slightly differently and how they go about doing the business and all the reason I say that is because I was fortunate enough to do an exchange with both of them so when we went out to the Middle East I ended up in a team with SEAL Team 6 and one of the Delta Force teams as well so yeah they're slightly different in how they are people get mixed up between the SAS and SBS and the SBS are probably closer to SEAL Team 6 at the SAS are sort of hybrid of SEAL team 6 and Delta Force and you know just like their rangers are like our pirates but to put into perspective the US Marines have more soldiers than our army more ships than our Navy and more aircraft than our RAF and that's just they're Marines so they're a big unit is the the US so in the US talk about Special Forces you know they've they've got over 100,000 Special Forces you know there we have maybe 500 you know",
