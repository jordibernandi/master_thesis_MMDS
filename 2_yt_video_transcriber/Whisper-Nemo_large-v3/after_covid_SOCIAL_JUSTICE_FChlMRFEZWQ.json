They grab him, push him to the ground and handcuff him.  Serrano remains on the ground handcuffed in invisible pain for the rest of the traffic stop until an ambulance arrives to take him to the hospital.

Officer Erickson begins searching the car.  He searches the passenger side area first.  When he finds nothing, he can be heard murmuring an expletive.  Erickson returns to Pastran to ask.  He returns to the passenger side and searches through Serrano's jacket, the cup holder and the central console.  As he continues searching the rest of the car, the driver approaches.  Erickson looks back at Pastran, visibly agitated. ",

He spends the next five days handcuffed in a hospital room, waiting for his abdominal wound to close.  Serrano took a plea deal to avoid jail time and didn't learn of this body cam's footage existence until after he pleaded guilty.  The video, which didn't emerge for nearly two years, underscores the limited information available not just to the public, but also defendants, and validates criticism by police accountability advocates that body cameras are of little use if the evidence they capture remains inaccessible.  The NYPD declined to comment on this incident.  Erickson and Pastran remain on patrol. ",
