First of all, I was told who's Jeffrey Epstein, no one knows who that is.  This is the stupid story.  Then the palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways.  We were so afraid we wouldn't be able to interview Kate.  We thought we'd think that also watched the story.  And then and then Alan Dershoitz was also implicated in because of the planes.  She told me everything.  she had pictures.  She had everything.  She was in hiding for 12 years.  We convinced her to come out.  We convinced her to talk to us.  It was unbelievable what we had Clinton with everything.  I tried for three years to get it on to know a veil and now it's all coming out and it's like these new relevant revelations and I freaking had all of it.  I'm so pissed right now.  like every day I get more and more pissed because I'm just like oh my god, it was what we had was unreal.  other women backing it up.  Hey, yep right-edwards the attorney three years ago saying like on like we there will come a day but we will realize Jeffrey Epstein was the most prolific pedophile this country has ever known and I had it all three years ago.  Yes.  Do you sound like what it has so many about to give away the truth and what you have ended with the truth.  Yes I do.  First of all I was told who's Jeffrey Epstein.  no one knows who that is.  It was unbelievable what we had to plant and get everything.  Then the palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us in a million different ways.
