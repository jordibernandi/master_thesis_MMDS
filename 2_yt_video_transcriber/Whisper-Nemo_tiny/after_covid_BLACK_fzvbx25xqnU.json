            "text": "So you saw how she just put herself all their front of their vehicle.  They're trying to leave the Mercedes-Benz dealership.  She's saying they trust passing.  How do you know on all of you to say they trust passing, you have to be either some management employee or the owner.  And I was saying Karen wasn't that But she just wanted to be lying to her ass black men.  So we have to deal with them, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the world who could be watching, this is the life of black people in America.  As you have seen, several times are watching this channel.  Some of you may think that this can't be real life.  These people can't really beat this way.  Yes, this is real life you're seeing.  You're not seeing reality TV or anything like that.  This is who they are in this country.  This is why I tell some of you when you say, oh, I want to go to America and I say, why?  Why do you want to come here?  You really want to deal with Karen?  You want that problem?  You want to deal with police, putting their knees on your neck and choking you out and killing you?  You want to deal with that?  Because that's what you could deal with coming to America.  You do better where you is.  Take your own countries where you are.  I'm telling you, you don't want to come into this problem.  But I read it said the Mercedes-Benz of Scottsdale, so maybe Scottsdale, Arizona could be whatever it was at.  Or maybe another Scottsdale, I'm just taking a watch to have in the dark.  But even though when the men came up, blocking her crazy behind, and I guess whatever guy that she's with or whatever, he's trying to pull her away.  And she's still like that.  See, a woman like that, I couldn't be with her.  I was thinking, the woman like that, they go get two pounds of her to kill.  Because you're trying to clean up hummus, and what she's doing out here.  And then, it could cause you to be in some sort of fight with a man who wouldn't even cross two words with.  Well, she crazy.  A woman like that, I know she would have to go with me.  I cannot deal with.  no woman sent up a challenge in a man.  You don't challenge no man like that.  And for what?  That mean wasn't doing you anything.  They were leaving.  And even if it wasn't leaving, what is it to her?  I mean, people are crazy.  I mean, the last time we covered what?  This woman was some Russian, and she got money, her inner hoods got money, and wanted she want to crack a plane and she not racist.  Well, how many videos are we seeing?  you run upon white people and call the police on them?  No, she didn't call the police.  But she was trying to yell, you're seeing the background, you're seeing cop lights, it was in the distance.  She was yelling the whole thing at their attention.  She was yelling for their attention.  Those guys came up and she was yelling for the police.  because they know exactly what the police are going to do to black people.  But who is she?  I mean, you guys probably can find out.  You probably guys probably even know she is.  But who was?  does she work?  Do they approve of the way she acts?  In this video?  Let us know.  The epidemic call Karen with continued to be chronical ever chance we get because we've got to definitely put out the message.  that Karen is a part of the problem too, not just the police.  Karen tries to get the police to come out to harm jail or possibly kill black people.  So yes, Karen has to be focused on in this time period.  But those who protest throughout the world, make sure you keep Karen out of your country, because that Karen will be trying to go to the different African nations.  Can be trying to go to the different Asian countries or ever she likes to go?  Keep her out if you don't want that problem.  But a lot of you don't have now on one call, right?  So that is a lot of it at least because like I said before when I was in the continent last time, I said listen, and I'm saying something crazy to me, the musungus, we'll handle now on one here.  So who you're going to call? ",
