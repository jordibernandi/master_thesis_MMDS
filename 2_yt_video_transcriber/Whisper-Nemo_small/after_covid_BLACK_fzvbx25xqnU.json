            "text": "Fuck you.  So you saw how she just put herself all in front of their vehicle.  They're trying to leave the Mercedes Benz dealership.  She's saying they trust passing.  How do you know?  on order for you to say they trust passing, you have to be either some management employee or the owner.  And obviously Karen wasn't that.  but you just want to just be lining her ass black men.  So we have to deal with them.  Ladies and gentlemen throughout the world who could be watching.  This is the life of black people in America.  As we, you have seen several times are watching this channel.  Some of you may think that this can't be real life.  These people can't really be this way.  Yes.  This is real life you're seeing.  You're not seeing reality TV or anything like that.  This is who they are in this country.  That's why I tell some of you when you say, oh, I want to go to America.  And I say, why?  Why do you want to come here?  You really want to deal with Karen?  You want that problem?  You want to deal with police putting their knees on your neck and choking you out and killing you?  You want to deal with that?  Because that's what you could deal with coming to America.  You do better where you at.  Fix your own countries where you at.  I'm telling you, you don't want to come into this problem.  But I read it said the Mercedes Benz or Scottsdale.  So maybe Scottsdale, Arizona could be, whatever it was that, or maybe another Scottsdale.  I'm just taking a wild stab in the dark.  But even though when the men came up blocking her crazy behind, and I guess whatever guy that she's with or whatever, he's trying to pull her away.  And she's still like that.  See a woman like that, I couldn't be with her.  I was like, cause a woman like that going to get too positive, her to kill, because you're trying to clean up her mess.  And what she's doing out here, And then it could cause you to be in some sort of fight with a man that you would cross two words with.  Was she crazy?  A woman like that.  Uh-uh.  No, she would have to go with me.  I cannot deal with no woman sent up here challenging a man.  You don't challenge no man like that.  And for what?  I mean, it wasn't doing you anything.  They, they were leaving.  And even if they wasn't leaving, what is it to her?  I mean, these people are crazy.  I mean, the last time we covered what this woman was some Russian and she got money.  Her inner husband got money and wanted, she wanted to cry and complain and she's not racist.  Well, how many videos that we've seen.  you run up on white people and call the police on them.  No, she didn't call the police, but she was trying to yell.  You seen the background.  You seen cop lights.  It was in the distance.  She was yelling to hopefully get their attention.  She wasn't yelling for their, their attention.  Those guys that came up, she was yelling for the police.  because they know exactly what the police going to do to black people.  But who is she?  I mean, you guys probably can find out.  You probably guys probably even know who she is, but who was it?  She worked.  Do they approve of the way she act in this video?  Let us know.  The epidemic call Karen, we continue to be chronicle every chance we get because we've got to definitely put out the message that Karen is a part of the problem too.  Not just the police.  Karen tries to get the police to come out to harm jail or possibly kill black people.  So yes, Karen has to be focused on in this time period, but those of you who are protesting throughout the world, make sure you keep Karen out of your country.  Cause that Karen will be trying to go to the different African nations.  Karen be trying to go to the different Asian countries, wherever she liked to go, keep her out.  If you don't want that problem, but a lot of you don't even have now on one to call, right?  So that is a lot of it at least because like I said before, when I was in the continent last time, I said, listen, end up and say something crazy to me.  The mizungus, we will handle 911 here.  So who you going to call? ",
