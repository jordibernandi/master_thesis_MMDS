            "text": "So last Halloween we had a lot of fun killing evil spirits, but this year we wanted to up the amis.  So we may or may have not rented the most haunted house in Texas.  I didn't know, bring them away.  I'm gonna get you like a fish.  Now that is the spirit.  Where are ya?  I'm already in the house.  You're in the house?  Guys, he's in the house?  Guys, guys, guys, first ones already in the way you are super prepared this year.  Wow.  Jared, no crossbow this year?  When it's shoddy.  Nice, is it loaded?  Again.  Yeah, okay, here.  Airport spread mode.  There you go.  Richard, double wheel 50, huh?  Yeah, two is one and one is none.  Am I right, Logan?  How's the demon girlfriend from last year?  Jacob was a little rough, but I am single ass.  Yup, good luck!  Eli, glad you can make it this year.  Remember, I'm my fancy ones.  You like that.  You like that.  Oh, God, why would you?  Oh, oh.  Thank you.  You're welcome, boys.  Shall we?  It's what happened.  Not my friend.  I'm going to go to the neatest action.  Anybody got a suspect here?  That's 15 years MREs.  Does anyone know CLS?  I am not putting my mouth on that.  Nope, nope.  Do we give him military honors?  I don't think so for choking a hot guy.  Hope it works.  Let's put up.  Looking for ghosts in our own places.  Looking for ghosts.  I want to play.  Come out, come out wherever you are.  Be ashamed.  Do you want to complain?  I've loved to play.  You'll fall out.  Nope.  You'll burn.  I am.  June goes.  Little nowhere.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  I'm good.  I have a 50 caliber, you have a chainsaw.  Knife to a gun fight.  Not a reliable chainsaw.  Push the choke.  The other button, it should be under it.  Good?  There you go big guy.  So I'm not gonna lie, I'm having a decent amount of fun, the group is having a blast, but I've been frustrated in the fact that someone said they'd got me like a fish and I can't find them, but I have a solution.  I am a classy lady.  Such a good flight.  Singles, why?  I'm just trying to have a good time with my friends.  What's not here?  You are single-ass.  What's going on?  And once again, you won't let me do anything.  Single-ass, what?  I said, I said, I said, I said, oh, I said, how hard it is to come back in the afterlife?  I don't even know how this is possible.  Listen, I love you.  Who are you?  Back to us.  Kiss me.  Yeah.  That was an amazing time.  Fantastic.  Great.  Great fun.  I got to kill with my gold desert eagle.  I got to flame throw it.  And a double decker kill.  I am back in a relationship.  Your hoodie is so comfortable, by the way.  We're looking at rings.  Save the day.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  What's up, man?  U.S.MC.  Nice.  Super fun.  Yeah, I poisoned the water well for you.  If you're coming.  Guys, the night's not over.  I found a friend who poisoned the water well.  And there's a horde of zombies on the way, so let's have some more fun.  Good thing I'm already dead, you jerk.  Oh, that was a bad spin, Chair.  Let me try that again.  The last zombie horde is gone, and it is amazing to see that reading the world of evil brings such a diverse group of people together.  But I guess that's America.  Cheers and happy Halloween!  Yeah.
