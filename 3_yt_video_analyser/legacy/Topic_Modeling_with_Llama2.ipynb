      "This is one part of a two-part video on the existence of the soul.  At the end of this video, make sure to check out the other bit.  If the soul is purely supernatural, how does it influence the natural world?  If it does exist, one would expect the soul to leave traces of its existence.  In 1901, a physician in Haverhill, Massachusetts attempted to prove just that.  His name was Dr.  Duncan McDougal.  Say that ten times fast.  He performed an experiment to check for the existence of the soul by testing to see if it had weight.  He placed the beds of terminally ill patients on industrial scales, attempting to account for air in the lungs, bodily fluids, and sweat evaporation.  Dr.  McDougall determined that at the time of death, the soul loses 21 grams of weight.  The weight of the soul.  Or so he thought.  But there were a few problems with the experiment.  Dr.  McDougall's sample size was tiny.  Unlike modern-day clinical trials that examine hundreds or thousands of cases, McDougall studied only six patients.  The 21 grams result occurred in one of the six patients, who he reported as losing three-fourths of an ounce, on a scale that was only sensitive to within 0.2 ounces.  That means that 83% of the patients he studied yielded a different result.  Now, two others did lose weight at the time of death, and then more weight shortly after.  Patient 2 lost 28 grams at the time of death, and then another 18 after they determined that the heart stopped, for a total of 46 grams, while patient 3 lost 14 grams at the time of death and then 28 grams several minutes later.  Did their soul packets evaporate in chunks or something?  Lastly, patient 5 lost 11 grams of weight and promptly gained it back.  A yo-yo soul.  They stayed dead though.  With results like that, if this was a high school science project, it would have gotten a failing grade.  Wait, though, didn't I say that he studied six patients?  Yeah, well, according to McDougal, patients four and six died before he could properly adjust slash calibrate the scales, so he disregarded these results entirely.  And the other three.  And selectively reported his findings based on the one data point that confirmed his bias.  Which brings out another flaw in the experiment.  Dr.  McDougal set out to prove a belief that he held, rather than to see if he could disprove his hypothesis, which is how science works.  And it wasn't a blind trial, meaning he could easily influence the results or selectively report on whichever data points matched his bias, which is exactly what he did.  Not only that, but McDougal didn't even have an accurate way of determining the exact time of death.  Does the soul leave when the patient breathes their last breath?  when the heart stops, or when the brain activity ceases.  But even if his scales were precise and accurate, and his methodology was sound, the body losing weight at the time of death is in no way confirmation of the existence of a soul.  If it's ethereal, why would a soul even have weight?  Why would half the soul evaporate, delay, and then the other half flitter on down to hell?  Why the weight discrepancies?  If some souls are fatter than others, will you be chunky in heaven?  Why are some souls slower and others faster?  If a soul has weight at all and isn't lighter than air, how can it float to heaven?  And speaking of heaven and hell, What if someone suffers a personality-altering brain injury and also develops severe retrograde amnesia, forgetting everything that they know about religion up to that point?  Previously, they were a bit of an obstinate and self-righteous twatwaffle, but are now pleasant, selfless, and kind.  When presented with religious teachings, though, the beliefs they were raised with and once held dearly now seem preposterous to them.  They reject them entirely.  Is their soul judged as pre- or post-amnesia them?  Do they go to heaven, hell, both or neither?  Or a severe brain injury leads a patient to develop anterograde amnesia.  And all of their 50 years of memories as a godless heathen are now preserved, but they're no longer able to form new memories.  Their procedural working memory is intact, allowing them to live in the moment and have brief, coherent conversations with someone, conversations that they promptly forget.  In several different conversations, they enthusiastically accept several different religions presented to them, and then immediately forget their newfound faith.  If the soul is separate from the brain, does their soul forget its religion?  By this point, you may be questioning traditional concepts of the soul, but perhaps you or someone that you know had a spiritual experience.  Are these not a glaring example of the existence of something beyond this natural world?  Or are spiritual experiences simply a concoction of our brains?  If spiritual experiences are a fluke of the brain, we would expect to be able to recreate them by physically tampering with our cranial baloney.  And we've done just that.  Creating spiritual experiences, and even out-of-body experiences, using magnets, electrodes, centrifuges, and drugs.  I cover all of that more in depth in my video on near-death experiences.  There are so many other neurological oddities and clinical cases, or even viruses, which I could cover that affect the mind.  Strokes, temporal lobe seizures, brain injuries, or disease can alter people's personalities and impair any and every neurological capability we possess.  If the soul exists outside the physical world, why is it so prone to physical damage?  Where does the soul even reside?  And if the brain accounts for all functions previously attributed to the soul – functions that can and are impaired by brain damage – then what's even left for the soul to do?  Some people argue that our internal monologue, that inner voice in our head that we hear when we think, is the communication of our soul.  Except that some people don't have an internal voice at all, and others have more than one.  Still, others attribute our conscience to the soul.  But do psychopaths who lack a conscience lack a soul?  Psychopaths often have either smaller-than-average amygdalas or amygdalas that don't function properly.  If you were to damage this region of a non-psychopath's brain and it resulted in them losing their conscience, Did you just slaughter their soul but leave their physical body intact, operating as a living soulless meat sack, demonstrating the superfluous nature of the soul?  And do animals have souls that live on after death?  If so, where do they go, heaven or hell?  If they go to hell, what a cruel god, and if they go to heaven, does god love animals more than humans to give them a blanket pass?  And if they don't have souls and are purely controlled by their physical brains, then why do humans need souls to do largely the same things?  And if we are controlled by a soul, a man in the machine, a supernatural puppeteer pulling the strings, what allows that little homunculus of a soul to think?  Does it have a mechanical chemical brain?  Or does it have a soul doing the thinking for it, which has a soul doing the thinking for it, which has a soul doing the thinking for it, and it's an infinite regress of soul turtles all the way down?  Now, some people will argue that we've mapped the brain, and a few functions of the mind have not been pinpointed to a specific brain region, therefore souls.  But that's about as ignorant as claiming that because we've mapped the human genome and haven't found the height gene, that height isn't influenced by our genes.  Just as with genetics, where multiple genes can affect one trait, in neuroscience, multiple regions of the brain work together to give us each brain function.  Our knowledge of the brain is far from complete.  But that doesn't mean that you can fill those gaps with whatever the fluff you want.  Neuroscience itself is a very new field, and we've really only had the technology to look under the hood for a few decades.  Filling the few remaining holes in our understanding of the brain with, we don't know for sure, therefore the soul does it, is a soul of the gaps argument that becomes vanishingly arguable as we fill the pieces of the puzzle.  Now I'm not here to tell you what you should or shouldn't believe about the soul.  just to urge you to think about the hard questions.  Dare to be curious, but don't drink the Kool-Aid.  Now don't forget to check out the other part of this two-part series on the soul, where I explore the arithmetic of souls.  There's some pretty soul-blowing interesting clinical cases you don't want to miss.

      "Let's first go to the Fox News Bernie Town Hall, play a couple of clips from there.  This is clip number three, where we had mentioned earlier that Bret Baier had to sort of maintain some semblance of being the straight news guy.  And so I am not going to feel quite as humiliated when I take a survey of the audience and find that everything I've been promoting on Fox News for over a decade is not popular with the people who are here for some reason.  Now, this was done.  This town hall was in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  I don't I mean.  If you had told me that this was done at the auditorium at the University of Vermont and that I would have been like, oh, that makes sense.  But this audience.  I don't know if Fox News doesn't have a lot of attention, but this audience seemed to be incredibly amenable to Bernie Sanders and his policies, which theoretically have been maligned on Fox News for ages.  And here, Martha McCallum, and I think this is getting towards the end of the of the thing where.  There's I think these two hosts are got to feel like we have in some way failed because we're not getting that moment or the series of moments where we have exposed Bernie Sanders or.  For either having policies that don't make sense or having policies that are not popular with this broad section of people.  And and so I think there's a lot of frustration involved in this.  And you can see Martha McCallum and just play this exchange. Vermont, because Vermont tried to have a single-payer program, and in 2014, the Democratic governor abandoned it because he had to raise income taxes, had to raise payroll taxes, and the people of Vermont didn't want their taxes to go up.  No, it's not quite true.  And they abandoned the program. Well, you're getting into internal Vermont politics, of which I know a little bit. Well, I'm sure you do. I don't want to be here. The governor did a rather poor job.  But I think if you look at polling, especially among Democrats, as I'm sure you have, you tell me, strong majority of Democrats and more than a few Republicans want to see a Medicare for all program.  What the opponents, let's be clear about this, Martha.  When you are dealing with health care, which is, what's it, 18 percent of our GDP?  I mean, we're talking about three and a half trillion dollars a year.  and you have insurance companies that make billions and billions of dollars in profit.  Let me give you an example, if I might, of the dysfunctionality of the current healthcare system.  Recently, Aetna merged with CVS, you may recall that, big merger, which in my view will drive healthcare costs up.  The gentleman who was head of Aetna, a name Mr.  Bertolini, you know what he got from putting together that merger?  He got a $500 million bonus.  Do you think that's how we should spend health care dollars? I think everybody is in agreement that health care needs to be fixed in this country. The question is how. And my question to you was, it will drive up taxes to pay for health care. And not just the wealthy will pay for that. The middle class will also pay for it.  So how do you justify it? Martha, what are you not... including in your discussion. You tell me. I will tell you.  You're not going to pay any health insurance premiums. You're going to pay one way or the other.  But look, Martha.  I'm going to pay one way or the other.  Martha.  Whether it's in your income tax or your payroll tax, you're going to pay.  Right. Look, health care is not free.  Of course not.  You never heard me suggest that we're going to march.  You just said it was going to be free for everyone.  It's going to be free at the point of when you use it.  Okay?  And you go to, why are you so shocked by this?  Because someone's going to pay.  Somebody is going to pay.  Who are they?  Okay.  Okay.  One second.  Relax.  We'll be talking.  Please.  We'll get through this together. It's a common question.  Okay.  We had so many email questions. Ask Senator Sanders how his dream will pay.  Fair enough.  I got it. But the first thing, let's just say hypothetically.  You are self-employed, and you've got a husband and two kids.  Family of four.  Do you know how much that family is paying today for health care?  $28,000 a year.  We're spending $11,000 per person.  We are saying to that family of four, you ain't going to pay that $28,000.  You're not paying any more premiums.  You're not paying any more copayments.  You're not paying any more deductibles.  How's that?  $28,000 you're not paying.  But does that mean you're not going to pay something?  Of course it does.  You're going to pay more in taxes. And do members of Congress who now have gold-plated health insurance... Pause it for one second now.  This is really sort of fascinating, right?  Because, like, that is... that you can almost see martha like looking like a little bit flush there right like she's like she doesn't have anything else to say.  he's just conceded what she thinks is the sort of like the the the.  you know the the stake through the heart of this program where he says yeah no of course you're gonna pay more in taxes you're gonna pay less for premiums.  that is the easy calculation here.  and there has been a. And the thing is, is that there is no.  there has been no one who has been able to produce a report.  There's been no research.  There's been no estimates.  Even the Mercatus study from the right wing think tank.  There has been nothing released by anyone who can who can.  refute that central dynamic and the thing that bernie is doing.  that is different from when they talked about where in vermont it failed was a governor showman.  i think it was his name.  the.  the thing that bernie is doing and and we used to get calls from john from san antonio will call in all the time about this very point is that you must lead with the idea that taxes are going to be raised because taxes are going to be raised.  And Bernie makes the point it is free at the point of service and it is free when you pay for it.  But you're but it's not free.  You're going to have to pay for it.  It's going to be in taxes.  And middle class people, as well as wealthy people, are going to pay more in taxes.  But the net expenditures are going to be less because you're not going to be paying for premiums and for basically the profits.  and the inefficiencies in the private insurance market.  and then the you know it is even bring up the fact that like.  and then the other good thing is is you have to deal the tremendous hassle like a like.  i have like spreadsheets.  i have uh... google drives.  with that i take pictures of like.  you know souls i therapy and i take the pictures and i upload them and i see if they you know my insurance gonna pay form and i got decent insurance. But does that mean you're not going to pay something?  Of course it does.  You're going to pay more in taxes. And do members of Congress, who now have gold-plated health insurance... No, we don't. Well, they have a special plan that's outside Obamacare.  A different plan.  Do members of Congress... Pause it for one second.  You know who has a plan that's outside of Obamacare? Most people. Almost everybody.  The only people is 10 million people in this country who have a plan inside of Obamacare.  And you have something like 270, 280 million people covered by insurance in this country. By the way, unless you want to define Obamacare as Patient Protection Act, in which case everybody's covered by it and everybody loves it. Well, Congress has a different health care thing, just like Brett Baer has. I understand that.  I'm just saying if he's using it.  Of course, we know that in terms of actual plans, but the patient protection component of it is national and protects a lot of people. Yeah, like he's talking about the exchanges here. Yeah, I think this is what he's trying to talk about. But Obamacare has more than just the exchanges. Right, well, it's Medicaid, too.  But the real question is, like, why is Brett Baier bringing this up now?  Because, like, Bernie has now destroyed McCallum's one critique.  And so he's pivoting to... We can't really trust Congress people because you guys get you're you're you're out of this whole you're going to try and be out of this whole system.  That's where he's going with this.  Go back a little bit and you'll see this is this is the.  they have now gone from the Alamo to like the next readout.  Right.  Like where it's like, OK, we're going to go to the farthest reaches of the Alamo because we're we need we need to figure out some way of undercutting this.  And it's the classic, well, we can't trust government and because politicians all lie. You're going to pay more in taxes. And do members of Congress, who now have gold-plated health insurance... No, we don't. Well, they have a special plan that's outside Obamacare.  A different plan.  Do members of Congress, are they going to do that transition as well? Damn right.  Of course.  Of course.  Whoops.  Whoops.  glomer i want to go back positive.  this is where brett bearer if he's really on his game or mccallan if she was really on a game she's gonna go.  well because this is the last.  the last refuge is how many pages is it?  because that was it.  that was the way that it went with the with obamacare.  right there was a problem with the program and then it was like well but congressmen aren't going to put themselves in it.  and then it was and it was over a hundred pages like literally this was a talking point at the time In that Glenn Beck rally I went to, one of the common complaints about Obamacare was nobody knows what's in it.  And they passed it.  It's over 100 pages.  There shouldn't be anything.  Everybody's the same.  Four pages.  That should be the top. This will probably be a shorter bill.  Yeah, exactly. Come at me, bro. Of course.  Of course.  Why would you suggest otherwise?  But I want to make the point.  I want to get back to the point that Martha raised.  Look, health care costs money.  Every other country, or virtually every country, does it in the same way.  we do education for our kids.  When a kid walks into school, kid doesn't have to take out a credit card, right?  It's paid for out of public funds.  That's what most countries do.  So if you're asking me, if your question is a fair question, are people going to pay more in taxes?  Yes.  But at the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people are going to end up paying less for health care because they're not paying premiums, copayments, and deductibles. Yeah, there we go. We're going to take a break. Look at that.  Look at the face.  Look at that.  Look at that. I think I handled that pretty well. There you go. Smooth Bernard.  Combat V. You know, that's the great, what I love about Bernie is like some people contrasted spin with complexity, right?  Like, oh, well, if you're speaking in spin and sound bites, then you're not acknowledging how complicated these issues are.  He's great because it actually is super simple and he has great message discipline, but it's also clear and honest and direct. But the key is what John from San Antonio would call in years ago to complain about was that he's leading with the taxes.  And that was there was an attempt by, I think, Democrats for a long time.  And part of it was, you know, back in the day, like Walter Mondale and whatnot, was if you say you're going to raise taxes, the American public is necessarily going to have a problem with it.  As if there is no argument, as if the American public cannot understand the concept that right now you're paying ten dollars for something.  and if you we're gonna eliminate that ten dollar expense but it will cost you six dollars. and didn't also mondale if i Didn't?  he like sort of basically say like we're going to just taxes as austerity to pay off the deficit or something?  If I know if I've heard that correctly, it was not presented as it was something like we need to pay for things. Yeah. It wasn't like presented as part of an ambitious agenda. There was no way for people.  There was no agenda as far as I can tell. And for what it's worth, you think of Obama, they soft peddled Obamacare costing something.  And I'm be much more pissed about having a having my premiums jacked up than having my taxes. Oh, yeah.  Or, you know, getting a kind of not that good silver plan and finding out it still costs a hundred dollars if I need to go to the doctor for a sick visit, which is the thing that happened to me. Yes.  And so this was by leading with that taxes.  It makes it also makes his job, frankly, easier because other people have to try and hide the ball.  And he's not trying to hide the ball.  He's trying to say, like, look at the ball.  ball.\n",

      "I see that Tony Blair has released a New Year message, so I thought that I would release one too.  It's particularly galling for many of us when he takes to the airwaves and gets massive coverage for it, because we think he should be speaking from The Hague at the International Criminal Court.  It was particularly unfortunate for Mr Blair that he released his video on the day the American embassy in Baghdad was being destroyed by thousands of demonstrators causing the ambassador and other senior diplomats to be airlifted from the roof.  The blood is still running in the streets of Iraq since the crime committed.  by Tony Blair and George W. Bush, the best part of 20 years ago, but the reverberations, the consequences of their unhinged, insane attack, the worst foreign policy blunder since the First World War in 1914. took place.  But Tony Blair is emblematic of Britain's problems.  You see, Blairism is a cancer in British politics and it has not been cut out and it continues to grow.  Blair almost killed the Labour Party.  It showed some signs of coming back to life under Jeremy Corbyn, but it turns out that was an attempt to put someone else at the head of a party that remained fundamentally the same.  Blairite.  Tony Blair has a great deal to answer for, not just internationally but here in Britain.  His light-touch regulation, you could well say deregulation of the banks and the finance houses in the City of London, made a major contribution to the crash of of 2008 and the subsequent now 12 years of austerity that the British people have been suffering ever since.  So many people have died, many millions of people have suffered, shivered, suffered in the long winter of austerity caused by the crash of the financial institutions which Mr Blair and his sidekick Gordon Brown once trumpeted as one of their greatest achievements.  Tony Blair has a lot to answer for in British politics but he will always be remembered for his international crimes, beginning with Yugoslavia and his double harness with the cowboy Bill Clinton.  He will always be remembered for his theorising of the principle of intervention in other people's internal affairs, usually with blood and iron.  But he will never be forgotten by Iraq.  the erstwhile Trotskyite John MacDonald, the outgoing shadow chancellor in the Jeremy Corbyn administration, as was, he says that all is forgiven.  And when asked by Mr Blair's spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, if Tony Blair was a war criminal, he answered most definitively, absolutely not.  Well, Mr.  Macdonald, the majority of people in Britain consider Tony Blair a war criminal, all right, and the vast majority of people around the world think so too.  Some of us will never give up, as long as God gives us breath, the fight to bring him to justice.  And as I always say, after me, my sons.  I'd like to wish you all a happy new year, but I'm sorry to say that for many people in the world, there won't be much happiness around.  But we'll all continue to do our best to make a better Brexit Britain and a better world.\n",

      "A deity is a being of divine nature, a supernatural being, a god, a goddess.  Their arrival would change our world forever.  There was one who was attributed great wisdom, the inventor of written language, interpreter, advisor, the god of the moon, and magic.  Powered at the side of Ra, he is that of the Ibis.  I, Thoth, the Atlantean, give of my wisdom, give of my knowledge, give of my power.  Freely I give to the children of men.  Give that they too might have wisdom to shine to the world from the veil of the night.  In the beginning, there was the creator, the father of all, and then the created.  Of the created, there were those who took themselves as deities, universally entitled.  Long ago, some of those beings took dwelling on a planet bound to a star system not far from the solar system.  But their civilization was threatened by the instability of their planet and its atmosphere.  As the desolation of their planet became imminent, as desperation for a resolution became prominent, they set a course for Earth.  They were not like us, but we were like them.  And as they anointed themselves as the kings of our world, they would set out to rule us as our gods.  There was a great cataclysmic event, a deluge that would wipe life off the face of the earth.  So Thoth had helped his father save mankind and then assisted in salvaging any form of biological life on the planet that he could.  It was after the Great Deluge that these men of renown would rebuild the structures that would once again serve as beacons and ports from Earth to the stars.  And Thoth would design them.  a masterpiece on a scale to which no other man could ever accomplish even today.  There were two main overlords of our planet, and one of their sons brought the people a religion and kingship like no other, and the people would worship him as Ra.  Ra, god of the sun, would sit at the head as the god of wisdom would stand at his side, Thoth.  Thoth was a master architect and also designed many of the world's ziggurats, monuments, the astronomical clock.  Thoth's power was not limited or restricted to Egypt, no.  At this time, these beings ruled the world.  Thoth would go out to put a hand in developing other civilizations, such as the Olmecs and the Mayans.  To them he is known as the Snake God, who brings together giant snakes and dragons.  Thoth was also credited to having had a hand in the fashioning of modern man.  And there is another place, another civilization that Thoth may have helped establish during his reign.  And that was the kingdom of Atlantis.  It is here that Thoth would be known as the great alchemist, Hermes Trismegistus.  who is believed to be the author of The Secret of Hermes, The Secrets of the Universe, The Secrets of Transmutation, inscribed onto a tablet of emerald green.  I, Thor, the Atlantean, master of mysteries, keeper of records, mighty king, magician, living from generation to generation, being about to pass into the halls of Amenti, set down for the guidance of those that are to come after.  These records are the mighty wisdom of great Atlantis.  A hundred times, ten, have I descended the dark way that led into light.  And as many times have I ascended from the darkness into the light, my strength and power renewed.  Now for a time I descend, and the men of Keth shall know me no more.  But in a time yet unborn will I rise again, mighty and potent, requiring an accounting of those left behind.  Chosen was I from the sons of men, taught by the dweller, so that his purposes might be fulfilled.  Purposes yet unborn in the womb of time.  Long ages I dwelt in the temple, learning ever and yet ever more wisdom.  Until I, too, approached the light emitted from the great fire.  Builded I the great pyramid, patterned after the pyramid of earth force, burning eternally so that it, too, might remain through the ages.  In it I builded my knowledge of magic science so that I might have here when I again return from Amenti.  I, while I sleep in the halls of Amenti, my soul roaming free will incarnate.  Dwell among men in this form or another emissary on earth.  I am of the dweller, fulfilling his commands.  so many might be lifted.  Now return I to the halls of Amenti, leaving behind me some of my wisdom.  Preserve ye and keep ye the command of the dweller.  Lift ever upwards your eyes toward the light.  Surely in time, ye are one with the master.  Surely by right, ye are one with the master.  Surely by right, yet are one with the all.  Now I depart from you.  Know my commandments.  Keep them and be them.  And I will be with you, helping and guiding you into the light.  In his writings, he speaks of the children of light who had looked down upon the world and saw mankind in bondage.  The children of light knew that the only freedom from that bondage would give mankind the ability to ascend to the sun.  Thirty and two were the number of them who had come among men.  In hopes to see man thrive, Hermes instilled his greatest wisdom in the tablets.  Man is a star bound to a body until in the end he is freed through his strife.  Only by struggle and toiling, thy utmost shall the star within thee bloom out into new life.  He who knows the commencement of all things, free his star from the realm of night.  Remember, O man, that all which exists is only another form of that which exists not.  Everything that is being is passing into yet other being, and thou thyself are not an exception.  Consider the law, for all is law.  Seek not that which is not of the law, for such exist only in the illusions of the senses.  Wisdom cometh to all her children, even as they cometh unto wisdom.  All through the ages the light has been hidden.  Awake, O man, and be wise.  Deep in the mysteries of life have I traveled, seeking and searching for that which is hidden.  It is in these texts in which Thoth revealed one of his greatest secrets for mankind, intended for those who live in a time where their survival is threatened by an outside force.  Deep beneath the rocks, I buried my spaceship, waiting the time when man might be free.  Over the spaceship erected a marker in the form of a lion, yet like unto man.  There, neath the image, rests yet my spaceship, forth to be brought when need shall arise.  Know ye, O man, that far in the future invaders shall come from out of the deep.  Then awake, yea, who have wisdom, bring forth my ship and conquer with ease.  Deep, neath the image, lies my secret.  Search and find the pyramid I built.  Each to the other is the keystone.  Each the gateway that leads into life.  Follow the key I leave behind me.  Seek and the doorway to life shall be thine.  Seek thou in my pyramid, deep in the passage that ends in a wall.  Use thou the key of the seven, and open to thee the pathway will fall.  Now unto thee I have given my wisdom, now unto thee I have given my way.  Follow the pathway, solve thou my secrets, until thee I have shown the way.  Thoth reveals the formula for revealing darkness from one's spirit, the incantation, naming the gods of certain forces.  Thoth then reveals the nature of evil spirits, the serpents behind the veil.  Far in the past, before Atlantis existed, men there were who delved into darkness, using dark magic, calling up beasts from the great deep below us.  Forth came they unto this cycle.  Forth came they into this cycle.  Formless were they of another vibration, existing unseen by the children of Earthmen.  Only through blood could they have born being.  Only through man could they live in the world.  In ages past were they conquered by masters, driven below to the place whence they came.  But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces and plains unknown to man.  Lived they in Atlantis as shadows, but at times they appeared among men.  Eyed when the blood was offered, for they came they to dwell among men.  In the form of man they amongst us, but only to sight were they as our men.  Serpent headed when the glamour was lifted but appearing to man as men.  among men Crept they to the councils taking forms that were like unto men Slain by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms taking their form and ruin man.  only by magic could they be discovered.  only by sound could their faces be seen.  sought they from the kingdom of shadows to destroy man and rule in his place.  but know ye the masters were mighty in magic.  able to lift the veil from the face of the serpent able to send him back to his place came they to man and taught him the secret the word that only a man can pronounce.  Swift.  then they lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from the place among men.  Yet beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open at times to the world.  Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have been said.  Again, as time passes onward, shall they take the semblance of men.  called may they be by the master.  who knows the white or the black.  But only the white master may control and bind them while in the flesh.  Seek not the kingdom of shadows for evil will surely appear.  For only the master of brightness shall conquer the shadow of fear.  It seems as though Thoth was a master of one other skill that is less known.  the power of transformation the ability to shape shift and take an ultimate form.  who truly is this ancient deity of wisdom so willing to teach mankind the secrets of the universe?  and what else do these ancient texts the emerald tablets reveal?  Thank you.\n",

      "You don't have to be a preacher to use a pulpit.  You can be a, you can be a rapper.  How about Kanye West?  Huh?  Now Kanye West has been out doing a lot of interviews.  He's just released a brand new album with the title, Jesus is King.  That's pretty overt.  Kanye has been doing these pop-up services around the country and thousands of people have been attending.  And he's saying he's a follower of Jesus Christ now.  I read in an interview, quote, he said, my job, this is Kanye speaking, is to spread the gospel and let people know what Jesus has done for me.  He says, I've spread a lot of things.  There was a time when I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me.  I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me.  I was letting you know all these things, but now I'm letting you know what Jesus has done for me.  And in that, I'm no longer a slave.  I'm a son now.  I'm a son of God.  I'm free, end quote.  That's nice.  Connie was being interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel And Jimmy said, so Kanye, do you consider yourself a Christian artist now?  Kanye said, hey, I'm just a Christian everything.  That's right.  That's right.  Now some would say, well, I don't know.  Is he really a Christian?  You know, just shut up for a minute, okay?  How about this?  Pray for him.  Pray that he gets grounded in his faith.  Pray that he's the seed sown on good ground that brings forth much fruit.  Listen, I applaud any person that makes any movement toward God.  And I want to encourage them in that, not critique them about that.  And I think it's fantastic because he's taking his considerable platform, and he has quite a platform, doesn't he?  To talk about faith.  It has people talking about Jesus.  I'm happy for that conversation.  People that wouldn't normally be talking about about the Lord we all have a pulpit to preach from no matter who we are no matter what we do.\n"

    "In order to load our 13 billion parameter model, we will need to perform some optimization tricks. Since we have limited VRAM and not an A100 GPU, we will need to \"condense\" the model a bit so that we can run it.\n",

    "This process reduces the 64-bit representation to only 4-bits which reduces the GPU memory that we will need. It is a recent technique and quite an elegant at that for efficient LLM loading and usage. You can find more about that method [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14314.pdf) in the QLoRA paper and on the amazing HuggingFace blog [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes)."
