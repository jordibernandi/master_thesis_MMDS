And if I remember, the document is from 2001.  I'm telling everybody right now it's real, and we'll see.  My history is pretty good with, like, saying if something's real or not, right?  So here we go.  The document comes out.  They meet at EG&G special projects.  In 1989, they stumble into a problem.  This happens, they put the technology away, and then they bring it back out and see if material science has caught up and if they can make any progress.  So this document kind of talks about this process.  The big thing I get from it, and a lot of it's vindicating to Bob, and one of the things it's vindicating besides the EG&G thing, is that private industry, so this guy's an admiral.  And he says, I found out about your SAP, your special access program.  I need to know about it.  And he's going to a private part of industry.  And he is denied access.  And he says, I should be running this program.  And they were able to deny him access.  So I think the takeaway here is, check it out.  I'm telling you that that is an actual, correct, that is a leak.  Now, everything said in that document, I don't know. ",

They tuck it away.  And then they bring it back out, you know, 10 years later and start working on it.  What is the limiting factor?  I think Bob should speak on this, but it's the material science.

He didn't.  leak this out to anybody.  this is i can tell you how i recorded this this conversation.  so this was an employee of at the time robert bigelow and this is in 2002 right?  do you remember when he had that government contract called osap the world all knows about now and he had nids that studied the ranch.  that 22 million everybody is saying it was for atip um advanced aerospace threat identification program.  The $22 million was for OSAP.  that was pushed through through Congress, three congressmen, right, an astronaut.  It was pushed through.  And that's what that $22 million, by the way, they spend more money on Viagra every year than they do studying UFOs, if it was just this program, which I think is funny. ",

Because the scientists, they're seeing vehicles come through like a space in the sky. ",

I'm saying there were scientists hired by the government, right, through Bigelow to study the ranch because they thought it was important.  And, you know, whatever, whatever.  The point is that $22 million was to study that.  Then we have AATIP, which is like an auxiliary kind of program of military settings, like Commander Fravers and that sort of thing.  This document is just one of those things that has now come forward that through the Bigelow studies, it was government-funded, and then it was personally funded and then government-funded.  It's just one of those things that kind of shakes you because you got this military guy who can't get access because of the private industry that's holding these non-terrestrial materials.  They can't study it.  So that's the claim right now.  Give it some time.  Let people dig more into this.  It's fascinating, man. ",
