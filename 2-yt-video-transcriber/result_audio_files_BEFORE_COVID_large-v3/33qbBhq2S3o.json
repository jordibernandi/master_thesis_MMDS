            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with the weekly perspective for the week ending 22 March 2019, the famous 322, if you know what I mean.  So I think the most important thing on the overall financial markets this week is that there was a plunge in bond yields and we have an inverted yield curve, which of course pushed bond prices higher and stocks lower.  And the falling bond yields reward, of course, to utility sector and is hurting the banking sector.  And the last part of the bigger picture is that both the small cap sector and the transportations are showing relative weakness.  So with the Fed backing off their stance and basically being pretty passive at this point in time, The inverted yield curve is inverted even more.  We'll be writing more about that in the next issue of the Morgan Report.  And moving on, we see a growing list of companies from FedEx to BMW, a warning about the world economy.  So it's just not yours truly.  I'm trying to be a bit humorous here.  But key points, executives at FedEx, BMW, UBS, and others are describing bleak macroeconomic conditions, which they say are waiting on business.  The head of UBS, it was, quote, one of the worst first quarter environments in recent history, end quote.  Well, FedEx cites slowing international conditions and weaker global trade growth trends.  So if we examine this a little further, FedEx, is similar in a way to the baltic dry index.  well dave what are you talking about?  you're talking about you know basically pushing letters back and forth.  of course fedex does more than that but primarily it's information in written form that fedex does.  and the baltic dry index of course is hard good being shipped across the planet.  but my analogy is that fedex is sort of like the the pace of business, or you can almost think of it as the velocity of business.  You know, the more robust the economy is, the faster the turnover of money, the faster the exchange of ideas, the faster things move.  And if things are slowing down, it's as I've been saying now for months that we see basically here at the Morgan Report, So stagflation is slowing the economy and increasing prices.  And that's being not only borne out by yours truly, but again, it's by some of the best in the business.  FedEx, one of the best.  BMW, one of the best.  And UBS.  So interesting times ahead.  Nothing to be overly concerned about, but do be prepared for it.  I'll just go a little bit further here.  Part of this write-up, global jitters.  Fitch ratings are also quote-unquote.  quite aggressively cut.  It's 2019 global forecast this week, but the firm's economics team stopped short of calling for a global recession.  Well, we are saying there is a global recession.  Regardless, we think it'll begin this year, although the official financial community may not recognize it until 2021.  Regardless, there's basically no way out.  The inverted yield curve and everything is slowing down and the uncertainty in the markets.  Drilling down on BMW a little more.  This is from Zero Hedge.  Of course, BMW tumbles as earnings expected, quote unquote, well below last year.  In keeping with the misery of the slowing global automotive industry that we have widely covered over the past year, BMW stunned auto bowls this morning.  when it warned that its earnings will fall well below last year's level.  And you can see what happened to the stock.  And again, just reiterating slightly what I brought up on that first article.  And again, drilling down a little further on that first article, this is from Wolf Richter, Wolf Street.  Title, what FedEx just said about Europe and China.  Quote, Asia volume weakness, which we experienced during peak season, deepened post-Chinese New Year.  End quote.  When FedEx, a corporate barometer for a global goods-based economy, reported earnings this evening, it missed lowered earnings and a revenue expectation, and it cut its guidance for the rest of the year.  below already lowered expectations and its shares tanked 5.7 percent in after hours trading.  so very similar setup to bmw.  um what can i say?  it speaks for itself.  the truth of the matter is you know trump train or no trump train?  the truth of the matter is that things are slowing down things are contracting.  it's time to be as debt free as you possibly can Probably good to keep some cash and obviously be, let's say, prepared for a changing market climate.  And moving into gold.  This is some small gold.  And he does some really good work.  And I did a debate with him, or I should really say a discussion with Lewis.  And anyway, this is on his site, Russia Central Bank Gold Reserves Rose.  2,152.36 tons in February.  Russia added basically 1 million ounces of gold to reserves in February.  Excuse me.  Russian gold reserves are the fifth largest central bank holdings in the world.  Russia added a record 271 tons of gold reserves in 2018.  So you can read the whole article.  Obviously, China and Russia continue to accumulate the asset that everyone really knows doesn't fail, especially in economic conditions when they are failing.  This is from DW.com, their business write-up.  Is the world running out of gold?  As the yellow metal hits peak production, experts feel we may have discovered all the world's major gold deposits.  So what does it mean for precious metals aficionados and investors?  And I've gone through this before.  I'm not going to read the whole article, but I'm convinced, unless there's a huge technological breakthrough, which I'm not going to rule out, like getting gold out of seawater, which is possible, but you're talking about parts per billion.  or nanotech or something, but barring any of that, we're basically hit peak gold some time ago as several of my geologist friends have told me when they started their careers, you know, 30 years ago or so, they would walk over ground that we're now mining.  It was like basically worthless because one gram of gold per ton or two grams of gold per ton, you know, just ridiculously small amounts.  Well, with the improvement in technology, it's worth it, barely, to do it.  So the article you can read for yourself, basically what we're all asking is, is the same thing.  Gold discoveries are minimal.  What is discovered are usually not very high end deposits.  Now, some that we have in the Morgan report, in fact, one of our favorites in the mid-tier section is hit the 99.99 on ibd.  i'm digressing a bit.  but investors business daily has it as the number one stock right now and we've been into that stock for quite some time had it on a rating scale very top kept telling people bye bye bye bye bye.  most of our subscribers did not all of them even though we say look this is the highest rated.  you should be in the stock regardless of whether they follow it or not, the company speaks for itself.  So we're happy about that.  And that's one of the more, let's say, unusual type of gold situations in the current day.  Most of them are producing at cost or somewhere around this level.  In other words, the $1,400, $1,300 per ounce, all in sustaining costs, where there are some, as I just outlined, that are doing much, much better than that.  But peak gold, I think, is a reality.  Next article up from Bloomberg.  Buy gold, sell stocks is, quote, trade of the century, end quote, says one hedge fund.  Interesting article.  This is a true hedge fund in my view.  Hedge fund hedges you against the general economic situation, meaning, which is basically basis of stock market, not the Dow, although many people use that as basically this S&P 500 for the United States, FTSE and the UK and, you know, different... parameters around the globe.  But hedge is just that.  And that's, of course, how I look at it.  So enough about that.  One of last year's best performing hedge funds says, quote, trade of the century, end quote, is to buy gold, sell stocks as risk assets are due for another meltdown.  It's only a matter of time until the bearish bet pays off big, according to Crescat Capital LLC.  While the Denver-based firm only has $50 million under management, It has a history of outperforming the S&P 500 index with its global macro fund returning 41% last year alone.  Now the investment company says it's time to capitalize on the end of an economic cycle as indicators warn that a recession is imminent in the coming quarters.  Pretty much what I've been saying throughout this whole video.  And the last thing I'll speak about this week will be the Basel III in gold, big picture.  Basel III basically says that gold will be a tier one asset.  It is as good as gold.  Isn't that amazing?  Mike did a good review of it.  I agree with Mike.  Many of the members of the Morgan Report, of course, they're allowed to write in two questions every month directly and guaranteed to get an answer.  Ask the same question.  Is it going to skyrocket once this takes place?  And the answer is I don't know.  But my thoughts are similar to Mike's that it will have an effect, but it won't be immediate.  I think it's going to take some time.  This is well-known.  Of course, the BIS is the Bank of International Settlements, which is the banker's bank, basically the control mechanism for the whole entire structure, really above the Federal Reserve.  So this is just putting gold back into the situation where it's really always been whether or not it's been acknowledged by the powers that be or not.  They all know it.  And this is basically a tip of the hat saying, yeah, we're acknowledging that gold is basically the best asset you can have.  And they put cash in the same category.  And the cash means physical cash.  So I'm going to end it this week.  With that, I wish everyone well.  And remember, there is nothing more powerful than the truth.  And final plug here.
