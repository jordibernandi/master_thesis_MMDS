            "text": "Hey there, Hope all is well.  Back at you today with some more of what's hot in the news.  And so we're one day removed from the FOMC meeting and it looks like Jerome Powell made no changes, but yet he said something that I guess spooked the markets or whatnot.  So as I currently make this video here, it looks like all the indexes are down slightly, but yet the biggest question is, if a single word that's being used by the Fed chairman caused a spook in the markets, imagine what's gonna happen when people really find out that these people ultimately don't know what they're doing and that this whole central banking model and debt-based system we're under.  it's one big experiment and i believe we're starting to see the tremors before the big quake.  so as always i got three or four articles i want to share with you but more importantly talk about the whole measurement of inflation where they use the pce as opposed to cpi explain a little bit of what the difference is but more importantly share my thoughts at the very end.  let's dive to the very first article.  So here's an article from CNBC that came out yesterday but was just recently updated.  But it says, here's the one word from Jerome Powell that has people raising their eyebrows.  And so usually when people raise their eyebrows, it's usually out of suspense or just out of curiosity as to what is actually going on here.  And I take it as probably the latter one, which people are realizing that more and more the words monetary policy are becoming more of an experiment-based term.  uh procedure as opposed to them actually knowing what they're doing.  so i'll thumb through this article here but more importantly you can find more details for yourself.  but to give an idea what's going on here it says it only took one word from the fed chairman jerome powell on inflation to send the markets really and that was the word transitory or not permanent says traders have been speculating that recent weaker inflation readings would concern the Federal Reserve to so much that it will cut interest rates later this year.  Powell knocked the idea by expanding that the central bank still sees the weakness as a result of transitory factors.  And then he's going to give you some examples of what that means, such as portfolio management services, lower apparel prices, and airfares.  So that leads me to wonder what exactly is he referring to when they look at CPI, or Consumer Price Index, over to PCE, which is Personal Consumption Expenditures.  So to give you an idea of the difference, I'll actually go to this page here from Investopedia, and it talks about PCE.  So I'll give you an idea of what's going on here.  But it says, Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE Index, measures price changes in consumer goods and services.  So one of the biggest differences, it lumps in services.  And so it looks like portfolio manager, as well as apparel pricing, has more to do with the service side than actual cost of goods.  It says expenditures included in the index are actual U.S.  household expenditures.  It says inflation, when engaging inflation and the overall economic stability of the United States, the Federal Reserve prefers to use the PCE index.  And then here's a big difference here.  The PCE is preferred because it is composed of a broad range of expenditures.  While the CPI helps to depict shifts or changes in economic expenditures, it only reveals changes in those expenditures that fall within the pre-established fixed basket.  Here we have PCE, which covers services as well as a certain amount of goods, but yet the CPI covers certain things that we actually use on a daily basis in a certain basket of goods and services.  which unfortunately don't include food and energy.  But yet using the PCE, in my opinion, is a way of them always be able to manipulate numbers to play in their favor when they're using PCE.  And as I mentioned here, CPI is how it's been traditionally done.  And most people don't even know that the CPI has been changed several times to withdraw certain things out of that basket, which are major things that we use on a daily basis.  So the overall measurement of how they get CPI or calculate inflation is real sketchy.  So back to the first article, it says the Fed's target on inflation is 2% and the core PCE rate watched by the Fed failed to a surprising 1.6% in the first quarter.  So we all know the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of low unemployment as well as inflation.  And so 2% is the ideal target, but as of right now, They're hitting out 1.6%, which is very concerning.  And so in this actual video here, a news analyst asked him a question in reference to what type of policy would they be willing to implement in the days ahead if this 2% inflation was not met and if it continues to stay well below the 2%.  And then he goes into the idea that they could possibly see themselves coming together as a committee again and then looking at what type of policies that can be implemented.  And based upon the explanation that the federal chairman gave, I wasn't too convinced that he actually knows exactly what they're doing.  And that plays into the idea that this is one big experiment where I believe that they're well beyond their limits of being able to reach their target of inflation, even though inflation unfortunately boils down to being a tax on the people and the evaluation of a currency.  Here's the next article I want to touch on.  And it says Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have just killed the stock market melt up.  And this is as of today from Yahoo Finance.  So if you look above here, we got the S&P down, we got the Dow 30 down, NASDAQ down, crude oil go.  We got all these indicators here that are cruising downward at a time when the world is depending upon monetary policy to save it in the midst of this economic expansion.  Give you an idea what's going on here.  It says Federal Reserve Chair Powell, forever a market mover, may have just put a dagger right through the heart of the bulls that are blindly buying stocks right now at a dangerously higher valuation.  So here we have buying stocks right now at a dangerously high valuation.  What's unfortunate is that they don't include these high valuations in the stock market as a part of the inflation indicators.  It says Powell comments on Fed Day may set a short-term top in markets, explained Miller.  It says, quote, the market could see a breather here.  It says while the Fed lived up to expectations on Wednesday by leaving rates unchanged, it was Powell's somewhat hawkish comments on inflation that could upset the bull thesis that has enveloped the market in recent weeks.  so here we are day after the fomc meeting and it looks like inflation is not meeting the target of two percent.  and it seems like jerome powell is willing to blame all types of services and cell phones and portfolio manager accounts and all types of things of that nature.  but i'd be willing to bet they use the cpi that was used to calculate inflation several decades ago that they would well surpass that two percent inflation because ultimately they don't know what they're doing and it exceeds two percent and it goes well beyond.  at what point would they then implement more experimental monetary policy to try to bring it back down?  all in the midst of the president calling for rate cuts and the need for more quantitative easing and more of these experimental policies that ultimately boils down to hurt you and I as savers and investors.  But I thought it would shine a little light on this whole FMC meeting as well.  The word transitory that's used, it caused a spook in the markets and whatnot.  But other than that, I would love to hear your thoughts on this whole FMC, PCE, CPI measurements.  Leave a comment down below.  Let me know what you think.  Other than that, hope you enjoyed this news update.  See you later. ",
