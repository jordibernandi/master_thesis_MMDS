            "text": "Now, see if this sounds like a big story to you.  A current member of Congress may have married her brother for immigration purposes and tax purposes and then lied about it.  The same member of Congress also clearly violated federal and state tax law.  Now, this sounds like a supermarket headline, but it is.  It's not.  It's not coming from a conspiracy theorist website.  No, no, no.  It's coming from the oh-so-credible Minneapolis Star Tribune.  Now, Omar and her representatives, the immunity here is apparently off the charts because the mainstream media will not go near this story.  It's not that they don't care because they would care if it was anybody else.  They are making a conscious choice to stay away from this story because perhaps they're part of the squad.  But let me give you the headline from the Minneapolis Star Tribune.  New documents revisit questions about Representative Ilhan Omar's marriage history.  Now, when the story first surfaced in 2016 that she may have married her own brother to get around immigration laws, Omar called it baseless rumors.  It's just crazy Internet stuff.  But last month, as the state of Minnesota invested campaign finance violations by Omar, it found that she had filed federal taxes in 2014 and 2015 with her current husband, Ahmed Hersey, even though she was still legally married to a different Ahmed with the last name of Elmi.  So the two Ahmads, and you're going to have to pay close attention here because there's two Ahmads.  Remember, there's Ahmed Hirsi, her current husband, and Ahmed Elmi.  Now, let me walk you through this.  From this point, I'm just going to go with the last names of her two husbands, Hirsi and Elmi.  Now, this is how Omar's campaign orders her marriage timeline.  Listen to this.  In 2002, when she was 19, Omar marries Hersey.  That's her current husband.  She marries Hersey.  According to the Star Tribune, they married in their faith tradition.  Those are in quotes in Minnesota, which means because it's the married in the faith tradition, they didn't file any paperwork.  So she wasn't officially married to him.  Omar and Hersey proceed to have two children together over the next six years, but then they decide to divorce.  But remember, they were never officially married.  They just got a divorce in their faith tradition, not a legal divorce because they weren't legally married.  The following year, Omar now is 26, and she legally gets married to a different Ahmed, Ahmed Elmi.  He's 23.  So it was a quick rebound.  And this one, she doesn't want to marry in her faith tradition.  She marries in the legal tradition.  He's 23.  She identifies him as a British citizen.  Now, according to the Star Tribune, Elmy's school records show he went to high school in St.  Paul and attended North Dakota State University.  Two years later, in 2011, Omar and Elmy divorce in their faith tradition.  But I thought they were married not in their faith tradition.  They were married in the legal tradition.  Well, whatever that is, they decide not to legally divorce.  So in 2012, Omar gets back together with her first sort of husband, Hersey.  You know, the father of her two children.  That year, they have a third child together.  So she just went off and married somebody else.  but got a divorce in the faith tradition, but not really a divorce.  goes back to her husband who she had a faith divorce following year.  she gets elected to Minnesota State House of Representatives.  Now remember, in 2014 and 2015, Omar and Hersey, the faith tradition husband, file joint tax returns, but they're still not legally married.  She was still legally married to Ahmed Elmi.  So I guess it was just a clerical error.  The following year, she gets elected to the Minnesota State House of Representatives, and her campaign is plagued with allegations that Elmi is not just her lover and her husband, but instead her brother that she married for immigration purposes.  According to the Star Tribune, new documents reveal efforts by Omar's campaign in 2016 and again in 2018, when she was elected to the U.S.  House, to keep her marriage to Elmi out of the media.  In 2016, Omar's campaign releases the names of six of Omar's siblings, but only their first names, and Ahmed Elmi is not on the list.  In 2017, while serving in the Minnesota House, Omar legally divorces Elmi.  But I think she's still married to Ahmed, the first one, right?  Then there's a small matter of possible perjury.  Because in her divorce proceedings, Omar claims that she hasn't seen or made contact with Elmi since 2011.  That's under oath.  Unfortunately, there are social media posts with photos of Omar and Elmi together in London in 2014. ",
