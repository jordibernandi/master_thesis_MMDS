            "text": "Hey family, what's up?  Happy Saturday afternoon.  I almost said morning, but I'm looking at my clock and it's officially afternoon here on the West Coast.  So that means it's afternoon everywhere.  So listen, you guys, this is like the case from hell.  The story from hell.  I just... I saw a post a little bit earlier from one of my colleagues, Dominique Alexander, who's there on the ground in Dallas, Texas, about the possibility of the young man who testified at the Botham Jean trial, his neighbor, Joshua Brown, was shot and killed last night.  Very new, a lot of details are not readily available.  his name is not even mentioned in the article that speaks to his shooting.  just yet because i guess it's so new and obviously you know the police want to notify family and all of that before they um you know name someone.  journalists want to be mindful and respectful of the family.  and so um it's been reported and kind of confirmed that um joshua brown was in fact the young man who was shot and killed last night.  and so um you know i'm just Breaks my heart.  Breaks my heart.  And I hope that we're not getting into a situation kind of like we saw over in Ferguson where a lot of young folks on the peripheral, if you will, of that whole unrest.  in Ferguson behind the shooting of Mike Brown, folks started coming up missing, hanging from trees, Shot in the head and cars on the side of the road.  You know, there was a lot of conversation and people were asking me about this young lady who goes by the name of Bunny, B-U-N-N-Y, and Bunny is not her real name.  Hey, Mac, but... There's video out there of her on YouTube.  You can Google it and find it.  And she talked extensively about what was ultimately done to her as a result of being the one who videotaped the aftermath of the shooting over there in Dallas.  And there's been so many questionable, crazy things we've never seen before in the history of ever surrounding this case.  And so I don't know exactly what Bunny's title was, but I... know that she worked in the pharmaceutical industry and she was licensed to do so.  So I'm thinking maybe she might have been a pharmacy technician.  because you've got to have a license to do that.  And she has since lost her license.  There was a gag order placed on her.  And I think that's probably why you haven't heard anything from her during the whole trial situation.  She was not called as a witness.  Whatever video she obtained was not used.  And, you know, they pretty much effectively silenced her because she's young and she's fearful for her safety.  They've prevented her from being able to take care of herself in terms of earning income.  And, you know, this is the kind of stuff that happens when you speak out.  Hey, Ron, this is the kind of stuff that happens when you speak out.  And, you know, I know I can tell you firsthand because I am subjected to all manner of foolishness but I'm just too honorary to go away.  Um, I know that people will try to intimidate you and scare you.  And, um, I'm in a little different situation.  Thankfully.  Thank you Jesus.  Because you know, I have a pension, not one, but two lifetime.  And so, uh, you know, they can't stop me from earning an income.  Um, they can silence me with the old, uh, you know, tree into a pole.  into a brick wall thing, right?  Which is, you know, why.  sometimes you guys hear me say, and it's not that I'm paranoid, but you guys hear me say sometimes that, you know, if I, I wrap my car around a tree, please investigate that.  Um, cause my driving record, I've been driving since I was 16.  I'm not going to tell you how many years that's been, but it's been a few.  And guess what?  I've yet to run into a wall, a tree, a pole, None of that.  None of that.  My driving record is impeccable.  But I do have people that come after me on social media and they call me names.  They compare me because of my amazing natural hairstyle to the predator.  And they compare me to a mop.  And they talk about my hair color looks stupid and I need to change it because it doesn't really work.  even though this is my natural hair color.  So listen, I know that, you know, folks can be stupid and they can be vicious and they can be mean.  And, um, you know, luckily I've got enough revolutions around the sun to not GAF.  So I'm not moved by what people say and I can't be threatened and I can't be, um, intimidated.  I don't know that any of that's going on.  This might be just a case of this young man being involved in something that may not have been in his best interest or it could be that somebody had beef with him in the neighborhood.  It's not a lot being said just yet other than there was a shooting on Friday night and that a young man who has been identified to me by several different people there on the ground in Dallas as Joshua Brown the young man who testified during the trial of Botham Jean.  How sad is that?  We just saw him, you know, vibrant, living, breathing, speaking about that whole experience and even becoming tearful on the stand because he had had a conversation with Botham earlier in the day.  And then later that night to learn that his neighbor right across the hall had been shot.  And now he's gone.  So another family is grieving.  A mother has lost a son.  Relatives have lost a loved one.  And I hope and pray that this is it and that this is not gonna be something similar to what happened over in Ferguson, Missouri when folks tried to speak out.  So that's all that I have and I probably will speak more about this on next Thursday.  Sergeant Dorsey speaks live at 5 p.m.  Pacific, 8 p.m.  on the East Coast.  By then there will probably be much more made public.  And, uh, I'll have an opportunity to talk to my family there on the ground in Dallas, but, um, I just wanted to come to you guys this morning, this afternoon, and just share this breaking news with you.  Um, Joshua Brown, Botham Jean's neighbor was shot and killed Friday night.  So, um, Let's keep this family in prayer and let's hope and pray that no one else is affected because of involvement or because of something that they may have said or something that they know that they didn't get to say that someone may be worried.  they might say later on.  There's another trial that's going to happen.  There's a civil trial.  And I don't know who the witnesses are going to be for that, but we know who it won't be.  It won't be Joshua Brown.  So just wanted to share that with you guys.  Have a great rest of your weekend and we'll talk again soon.  Be good.  Be safe. ",
