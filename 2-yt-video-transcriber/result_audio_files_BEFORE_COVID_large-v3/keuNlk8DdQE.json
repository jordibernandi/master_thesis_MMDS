            "text": "OK, I've got some clips to play for you today from a recent interview that right winger Ben Shapiro did on Joe Rogan's podcast.  We could do 30 minutes on all of the caveats about Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro.  We can talk about Joe Rogan effectively, according to some, serving as a gateway to the alt right.  We can talk about the ways in which Ben Shapiro appears to be very informed and convincing, but often says things that don't make sense.  I've said before, if you listen really closely to Ben Shapiro, uh, you will often realize that even though he's speaking confidently and he's speaking quickly, that what he's saying is actually not making that much sense.  And I have a couple of really funny examples of that.  And Joe Rogan, I don't even know that Joe Rogan realized.  how much he exposed Ben Shapiro in the clips that I'm going to play for you today.  So to set it up, this gets to a portion of the interview between Ben Shapiro and Joe Rogan where I guess I would say it's about Ben Shapiro's religious beliefs and Joe Rogan's asking questions about Ben Shapiro's, um, Orthodox Judaism and mostly they're talking about homosexuality, which I'm going to get to a little bit later in the clip.  But Joe and Ben sort of agree that there are some historical reasons why things became commandments in the Old Testament, for example.  They agree that there are some historical realities at the time which explain to us like, for example, the Bible mentions man shall not lie with another man or whatever the phrase is.  I don't even care.  But the line that's pointed to that people point to is saying homosexuality is bad.  That wasn't in the Bible because the people who wrote the Bible thought homosexuality.  In a thousand years, maybe there will be gay people.  It was there because they saw gay people at the time and they decided we're going to put something in the Bible about it.  OK, the example doesn't really matter.  But the idea is the Bible reflects things that were happening at the time.  So Joe Rogan brings up.  a sort of naturalistic explanation for why eating pork is not okay in Judaism.  It's also not okay in Islam.  The same analysis would sort of apply related to the cooking temperature of pork and bacteria and whatever.  You'll hear it in a second.  And Ben Shapiro says very clearly he doesn't like naturalistic explanations for this stuff.  Check it out and pay really close attention here to what Ben Shapiro says. ",

And he naturalistically explains it wind in the Red Sea area, which is a very common naturalistic explanation for the parting of the Red Sea in the Old Testament, which he just said he's not in favor of.  He's not in favor of those types of explanations, except all of a sudden when he is.  And this reminds me of naturalistic explanations for Noah's Ark.  If you talk to some religious people about Noah's Ark, they'll say, no, you know, we've sort of identified where there were floods at the time based on geological records and here is how it all could have worked, so on and so forth.  Never explains how some of the species need salt water and some need fresh water.  and how did they get all of that onto the ark for the time it had to be there.  It doesn't explain how There are carnivorous animals and if you only had two of each species, didn't any of them get eaten?  Did you start with more than two and they were eaten down to two?  or did carnivorous animals get fed some kind of soylent or vegan diet during \u2013?  None of that stuff is explained, but at least the specifics of the flood are sometimes explained.  naturalistically with Noah's Ark.  This is the same thing here.  Naturalistically explaining the parting of the red sea after saying he doesn't like naturalistic explanations.  Now I know some people will say, David, hold on.  Ben Shapiro says Maimonides gives that explanation.  It doesn't matter.  Ben Shapiro said he's not for naturalistic explanations of religious stories or miracle miracles or phenomena.  And then 90 seconds later, he insta flips on himself.  And it was a missed opportunity actually for Joe to call him out on that.  So then they get back to homosexuality, uh, and to Dave Rubin's marriage to his husband.  Dave Rubin is a cultural critic and political commentator who engages in, uh, the battle of ideas where the free market allows the best ideas to float to the top, sort of like a fat on, on milk or butter or whatever.  Uh, anyway, they get to Dave Rubin's marriage, which Ben Shapiro has been saying for a while how he would not go to Dave's room, Dave Rubin's wedding, or I guess wouldn't have gone if they had been friends at the time.  I don't, I don't know that they knew each other at the time.  Um, but he'd still have Dave and his husband over for dinner because going to the wedding goes against his religious beliefs.  But I guess having them to dinner doesn't.  And Joe Rogan just exposes the idiocy idiocy of it so easily. ",

            "text": "So Joe Rogan's being sort of funny about it.  He's very presciently exposing the absurdity of what Ben Shapiro is saying.  Going out to dinner with a gay couple who you recognize as a gay couple is recognizing the idea that they are a couple, which his religion considers a sin.  It's a very sort of mealy mouthed.  weird gray area to say, well, I wouldn't go to the wedding ceremony because then I would be endorsing something my religion believes is a sin.  And I wouldn't go to the wedding reception and just have dinner because I would be recognizing the sin.  But like a couple of days later, I'd go to dinner with them as a couple, which of course is recognizing them as a couple, which his religion believes is a sin, but that would sort of be okay in Ben Shapiro's mind.  And it You know, he says he wouldn't go to anything that celebrates same sex marriage.  I hate to break it to you, but when you go out with a couple who is married and it's a gay couple, you're effectively celebrating or at minimum recognizing something that your religion teaches you is a sin.  It is the fence sitting.  that is so mealy mouthed that I found just laughable here and here.  Joe Rogan actually does a really good job when he says, what about the reception?  What about a barbecue the day after?  Like at what point is going to hang out with Dave Rubin and his husband?  disconnected enough from the fact that it's a gay couple that's married under the law that you can sort of rationalize it post facto in a way that feels okay for what your religion teaches.  This is why it's all nonsense and really nice job by Joe Rogan in exposing it.  And by the way, Ben Shapiro is welcome on the show anytime he's been on before.  I think at this point he probably, I think he's too big for the David Pakman show at this point.  He's got bigger fish to fry, but open invitation for him anytime.  Follow me on Twitter at D Pacman.
