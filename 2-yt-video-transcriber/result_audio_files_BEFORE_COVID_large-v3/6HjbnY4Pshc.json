Anyone who picks on pronunciation, unless it's just simply not even possible in either one of those two systems... is probably just trying to show off.

Whoops.  You know, you didn't get to do that during the conversation, but it's good to put that up there.  But once again, for people who are always tuning in that might be new Christians and stuff like that, there is a teaching.  It is a grossly anti-biblical teaching.  It is a teaching that has wrought tremendous destruction.  that faith alone means faith without repentance.  One of the things this conversation illustrates, and any... When we get into... It's either chapter 4 or 5 of the responses, because I've listened through, I think, 6 now.  And I'm getting them edited, queued up, so we can listen to them here on the program.  He doesn't really deal a lot with the book at those points.  Instead, he really focuses on... false gospel stuff from his perspective, and that is repentance and living a holy life, and the text in John 3, he who does not believe, but he who obeys, and John uses two different words.  It's really illustrative of what happens when you do not have a balanced, reformed understanding of the gospel.  Because from their perspective... They're trying to take a reformed concept, faith alone, and they're trying to fit it into a... man-centered system where you are the one who has faith rather than seeing faith as a gift of god.  it's part of the work of the spirit of god.  god raises your spiritual life.  the gifts of faith and repentance are given by god.  they are a part of the work of the spirit in life and so we can maintain a meaningful doctrine of of sola fide without divorcing the fide from the work of the Spirit in our lives and everything else.  the Bible says about holiness.  Since they have a man-centered system, they can't do that.  And so you end up with this massively imbalanced Position where you just tip your hat toward God.  Boom, you get your your your your ticket stamped.  And it's a good thing if you repent and it's a good thing if and given how legalistic a lot of these guys are about dress and everything else, it's really ironic.  But it's it's good to be a super Christian.  It's good to be a disciple, but you don't have to.  You know, as long as you believe got punched.  And, you know, the writer of the Hebrews says, you know, without holiness, no one's going to see God.  And and but that's where salvation.  No, it's not.  That's a recognition that when God saves someone, he has a purpose in saving them and he's going to accomplish certain things.  But you can't with a man centered salvation system.  You can't you can't balance this stuff.  You end up having to throw stuff in the Bible out.  And that's what you see with Stephen Anderson.  is he just throws so much.  of the Bible out to make his system work. ",
