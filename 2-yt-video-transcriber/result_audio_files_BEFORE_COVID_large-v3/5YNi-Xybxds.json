I first heard of Bad Bunny a while back, briefly, when again, she poorly reviewed and covered one of my videos.  But that response wasn't even worth me responding to myself at the time.  And it's still not specifically either because, well, I can just sum up her comments like this.  She thinks Republicans are bad, Trump is racist, and no bullshit is a 1940s German, if you know what I mean. ",

People are asking, is No BS a race realist?  I don't know what you define someone who seems to think that the fact that black people disproportionately have lower incomes as well as a lot more societal problems, such as being, you know, very overrepresented in jail, has a lot to do with the fact that, you know, black people apparently, they're just not as good as whites.  That's the No BS take.  Yeah, he seems to think that it has everything to do with the fact that, you know, there's an innate difference between the races.  So, I mean, I don't know what you call that.  I think it's 1945 Sherman something.  Something like that. ",

I mean, there's a lot of violence associated with it.  But one of the problems with incels is that they kind of think of women as dolls, as basically sex holes for them to use.  That's basically it, right?  If I can't put my penis inside of it, what use of it is to me?  Like, I'm not going to have a conversation with it.  I'm not going to talk about it.  It doesn't have feelings, emotions, or anything else.  It's just basically a vessel for my penis.  That's it.  And so because No BS is suddenly saying, well, because I can't fuck it, you know, what use of it is to me?  Particularly, you know, chef's kiss about this, okay?  He's opened MS Paint.  He's got in there.  He's added a couple little things, found a nice cute photo.  He's added Homer Simpson in the corner here.  Couldn't be bothered.  Couldn't be bothered to not cut the foot off.  And you know what?  Why I say that No BS is a particular kind of lazy?  You could have just moved Homer a centimeter to the left.  Like, just one second.  And this... This illusion would have been gone.  I don't know.  I didn't know we were listening to the Ayatollah Khomeini.  Like, are we really going to be shaming women for how they dress?  Is that, like... Like, the right is so bizarre right now.  It's so bizarre.  If it's not shaming women for how they dress or saying, like, oh, they have no discernible talent, all they have is breasts, they're also talking about impregnating them.  Like, that's the new thing.  Stefan Molyneux... Uh, Sargon of Akkad, talking about how women's eggs, uh, basically determine whether or not they're, like, viable candidates for their semen.  Super fucked up.  Why are we talking about women's eggs?  You can have sex and, uh, not impregnate a woman.  You can do it.  It's for pleasure. ",
