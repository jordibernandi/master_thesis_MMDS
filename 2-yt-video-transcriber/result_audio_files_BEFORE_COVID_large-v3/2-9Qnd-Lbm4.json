Well, BBC host Andrew Neil had Tom Baldwin, the comms director of the People's Vote campaign, or former comms director of the People's Vote campaign, because he was sacked during one of the purges that I actually reported on.  And of course, now that the People's Vote has got absolutely zero chance of happening.  Not that it had much chance of happening anyway.  But with the Tory majority, we now know no chance of a second referendum ever going to recur.  And rightly so.  It would be undemocratic.  But anyway, this complete idiot sits there claiming that Boris Johnson doesn't have a majority to leave the EU, which is absolutely amazing and forces Andrew Neil to mock him.  So, let's check it out. ",

I would have been in absolute hysterics listening to first what Andrew O'Neill read out about the Lib Dems absolutely tanking.  And of course, Joe Swinson getting kicked out of Parliament like the Ramonin shitbag that shit.  It's actually the one time when you actually want the SNP to win something is when Swinson's seat is up there, considering she campaigned on a policy to outright revoke Article 50.  In other words, ignore the decision made by 17.4 million people, which is what makes me so happy that she has been booted out of Parliament.  It was almost as sweet as Boris Johnson getting a majority.  But you heard this absolute idiot say that he's got a majority in Parliament but I don't believe he has a majority in the country.  Which is incredible considering when the Remainers had the majority in Parliament they said that they spoke for the majority of the people and therefore there should have been a second Brexit referendum.  The hypocrisy of this clown is unbelievable.  Which of course brings Andrew Neil into saying what does he have to do?  Meaning what does he have to do to stop these people remoning?  And let me tell you something.  Clearly nothing.  There is nothing he can do to stop these people, as we've seen by the riots, the Antifa dickheads and of course the Ramonas on Twitter.  Sargon of Akkad made a good video about the Ramonas Twitter outrage earlier on on the Sargon Daily channel.  So if you haven't seen that, go and check it out.  But it relates to this.  He obviously just preempted most of what Sargon's talking about because this is election night.  But like Andrew O'Neill said, the people had voted in the 2016 referendum to leave.  More people than had ever voted for anything in the history of this country.  And then in 2019, Boris Johnson got an overwhelming majority, campaigning solely on the idea of leaving the European Union and enacting what the British people asked for.  This complete shit weasel sits there saying that he doesn't have a majority for that.  It's absolutely incredible.  I don't know how you could have the gall to sit there and do it.  But Ramona's, it seems, always managed to go that one extra, don't they?  But anyway, let's move on to the next clip because he's not finished there, obviously.  This is a Ramona we're talking about here. ",

And yet he still doesn't have a majority to do it in their opinion.  Before he completely ignores what this Ramonin tit says and goes straight on to the fact that you've lost and you've lost and you've lost yet again.  Because, of course, that's what Ramonas are only good at doing, it seems.  Losing.  When was the last time a Ramona won anything?  With of course the exception of the Supreme Court, which happens to be a Ramona court by the sounds of it, especially considering they went against all legal precedent at the time.  But now the Supreme Court is completely wasted because Boris has a majority, so Parliament is sovereign, they can't do a single thing.  He can now do what he wants, as long as his MPs don't stab him in the back, which hopefully they won't this time.  I say hopefully because you never know, do you?  And I do love the way that Andrew O'Neill absolutely destroyed these claims that it's not a good night for campaigners.  In other words, remain campaigners and the second Brexit referendum that they were all desperate to get.  Because like Andrew O'Neill says, and of course this Ramonian idiot has to admit, it's not going to happen.  You've got more chance of Jeremy Corbyn being elected than there being a second Brexit referendum.  And to finish it all off, in true Ramona style, he blames everyone else but himself or the fact what they wanted was anti-democratic.  This geezer is a complete shit weasel at the end of the day.  But once again, Andrew O'Neill has provided us with a little bit of gold in the way that he mocked this absolute idiot.  I only wish that he'd spoke some more rather than these couple of minutes that we got here.  But on that note guys, I will end the video there.  It was only a short one just to bring you this quick clip.  I want to thank our PayPal, Patreon, Subscribestar and YouTube members for supporting the channel along with everyone who watches my videos.  Remember to let me know what you guys think down in the comment section below.  Leave a like, subscribe with the notification bell and share this video as it helps the channel a lot.  And I'll see you all in the next one.  This Parliament is a dead Parliament.  It should no longer sit.  It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.  They don't like the truth.  Twice they have been asked to let the electorate decide upon whether they should continue to sit in their seats while they block 17.4 million people's votes.  This Parliament is a disgrace.  But they're too cowardly to give it away.  But the time is coming, the time is coming, Mr Speaker, when even these turkeys won't be able to prevent Christmas. ",
