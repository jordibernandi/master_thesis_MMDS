So Facebook has what's called the fake account index, where they assign a score which helps them to determine whether the account is a real person or just a dummy spam account.  And so rightfully so, they want to delete those accounts.  That's OK.  They created the troll score so they could help identify using parameters such as words that they would post, pictures, if they were friends with other trolls, and then using that, determine whether this person should be on the platform or not.
