I'm asking you to stop recording me.  Hey, you touch me, I'm going to... I'm telling you.  You touch me, I'm going to violate my principles and beat your ass if you touch me.  And I'm telling you that now.  On video.  What's your name and your badge number?  First Amendment, you ever heard of it?  How are you?  All right, I'm working right now.  I can't talk right now.  Who's building?  This building here.  Did you say our building?  Yes.  As in the public's building?  It's not public, so it doesn't belong to the county.  I'm sorry?  The building does not belong to the county.  Who does the land belong to?  Who does the land belong to?  I'm asking a question.  Who does the land belong to?  Is this open to the public?  Is there visitors parking here?  So is the Urban League of Broward County open to the public?  Okay, who are you?  You don't want to tell me who you are, but you want to come out and ask me what I'm doing.  This is the Urban League.  It's open to the public on public property.  No camera, no camera.  What do you mean?  No camera.  Why?  You got cameras?  You got a camera right there.  Look, buddy.  My friend.  Look, I'm going to show you.  Camera, look.  Look, buddy.  Security.  Security.  Security, camera here.  Camera.  No camera?  You see camera there?  You say no camera?  Camera there.  No, you don't.  You don't have a right to find out why I'm recording.  I'm asking you to stop recording me right now.  What are you going to do, assault me?  I'm asking you to stop recording me.  Hey, you touch me, I'm going to... I'm telling you.  You touch me, I'm going to violate my principles and beat your ass if you touch me.  And I'm telling you that now.  On video.  All right, being.  Now you're lying.  But it's all on video, so I hope you can answer to a false police report.  6-2, buddy.  6-2.  2-15.  Community Empowerment Center.  Look at this cam back.  He just told me no cameras, but he's doing it.  This is called a cam back, folks.  This is called hypocrisy.  This man just told me no cameras, but he went and got his camera, and he's doing it.  That's hypocrisy.  Let's call a cam back.  Hello.  Yeah, cop on the scene.  I'm recording a public building, which is my absolute right, to come out and see where my tax dollars go.  Even if it is a non-profit, this is still public land, and it still has visitor access here, which means I'm welcome.  I know, but I'm just letting you know.  From all personal views.  Part of our company branch.  Okay.  Although the building may not be, but logo placement, use of that nature.  I'm trying to, I don't want to get you on camera because you're really nice, but I will get these tyrants.  But let me tell you something.  If you don't want anyone to see your logos, you got to put them in a secure area.  Because the use of those things are not permissible.  If they're in public.  If they're displayed to the public, they are.  I'm telling you, they have to have approval.  Absolutely not.  Not if they're displayed to the public.  They do.  It's displayed to the public.  It's in plain view, which means I can see it, I can report it.  It's in plain view.  My own personal use.  My own personal use.  No, that's his car.  Yeah, that's the guy that just tried to grab my camera, which would have been an assault.  And I've had every reason to crawl up in him.  We can ask them to vacate.  So it's not open to the public?  Well, no, we're telling you that to use, to have footage, first of all, you need permission to record here.  That's not, I'm the marketing manager here.  But who told you I need, is this your policy or is that the law?  Yes, that's our policy.  Okay, so law does not trump, I'm sorry, policy does not trump law.  Sorry.  I have the freedom of press, I have freedom of press, and this is up.  I'm just curious in terms of what are you using the footage for?  I told you, my own personal use.  In terms of what?  It'll be publicized somewhere, right?  My own personal use.  It may be, it may not be.  Depends on what I want to do to it.  I'm the owner of this footage.  And you say you're the manager here?  Hey, do not circle behind me, man.  Do not walk behind me like that again.  Do not walk behind me.  You already threatened me.  He already threatened me once.  Don't walk behind me.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Big Nick.  Big Nick.  Please let them know that as a journalist, I have every right to come out here and record matters of public interest, especially on public property.  I'm not disturbing anyone.  I haven't gone in any restricted area.  I'm going to go talk to them, find out what the story is.  The story is they don't want me recording on public property.  Okay.  Okay.  And let that guy know that if he hits my camera, that's assault in the blue shirt.  I've got a little moment for you.  Did he just say this is private property?  I believe the city of Fort Lauderdale owns this property.  May not own the building or maybe leasing it to you, but this is public property that you're leasing.  All of this is public property.  Yes.  Is it Nicholas Freeman?  It's Big Nick.  Yeah, but for my report, I need your full name.  Big Nick is fine.  All right.  Listen, you're being verbally trespassed right now from this property.  Okay.  You're going to have to leave.  Is that a lawful order?  Okay, I will take it up with.  I'm going to leave because you're giving me a lawful order.  But however, I do have freedom of the press to come out and record public property.  I'm a member of the press.  It's not going to look too good for the Urban League.  It's not going to look too good for the Community Empowerment Center.  Okay, sir.  Thank you.  Have a good day.  It will be on YouTube.  He'll tell you where to find it at too late.  I tried.  I tried.  Urban League of Brown County will be on YouTube and everybody's gonna see how you treat the public who just wanna come out and enjoy a building that's on public property.  No, you just told me I'm trespassed for nothing.  So you gotta deal, you know, this is the reflection of Urban League that you guys are giving Urban League.  I got all my pictures on YouTube.  Just go to YouTube, you can get a better one.  Go to YouTube, you'll get a better picture.  So Dell, where does that property extend to?  I can go over there, right?  On the library, right?  Okay, so their property doesn't extend there.  So I can stand over there and record their logo all day until the cows come home, right?  Thank you.  Urban League of Brown County.  Check out Big Nick South Florida on YouTube.  See how many subscribers I got local.  This is the look you're going to give them.  I'm going to leave because he gave me a lawful order, and I don't want to go to jail.  I don't want to push the envelope.  But this is on a park's property.  This is public property that's being leased out to the Urban League of Broward County.  And you're going to tell me I can't come out to see where my tax dollars are going to?  So now I'm going to record every license plate goes in and out of this place.  Every license plate is getting recorded.  Oh, they was ready to talk to me once I told them.  This is the look that they're presenting for the Urban League of Broward County.  So now people know they're not going to be welcome or open arms at the Urban League of Broward County.  Now people are going to know they're not going to be welcome at the Urban League of Broward County.  Thank you for displaying that.  Big Nick, South Florida.  accountability.  Major fail.  Major slap in the face to the First Amendment.  Major misuse of public property.  Denying access to public property to a taxpaying citizen.  Urban League of Broward County, you fail.  Big Nick out.
