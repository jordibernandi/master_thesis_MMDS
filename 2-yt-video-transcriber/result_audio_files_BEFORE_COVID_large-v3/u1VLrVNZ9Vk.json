I think it's basically a misunderstanding of that phrase.  Observer determines reality is a technical phrase that doesn't quite mean what it sounds like out of context.  First of all, it's important to notice that what physicists mean by an observer can be done by a piece of equipment that has no consciousness. ",

The more we know about how fast it's moving, the less we know about where it is.  This is a hard and fast principle, okay?  And it goes back, really, to the wave nature of the particle.  And... Turns out that it's not just quantum mechanical waves that do that.  You can actually, I think a great place to read about this is in the Feynman lectures.  He has some chapters on quantum mechanics and Feynman points out that this is actually just a property of waves in general.  It goes back to the fact that the velocity of a particle is related to the wavelength of the wave.  And so the more certain you are about where a particle is, then the sharper the wave has to be and the fewer opportunities you have to measure the wavelength. ",

And yet, when you go to measure where the electron lands at the end of your experiment, you always find a whole electron.  It acts like a particle.

And then, you know, this idea that observer determines reality, when you have something like that, that has a wave nature to it, waves are not completely localized objects, right?  So you can have a wave that kind of wiggles in a lot of different places.  And... there are certain properties that you can go and measure that may not be well-defined until you take the measurement.  And that's frustrating, it's kind of annoying to us, but I think a great analogy would be, for example, think of a spinning coin.  If I take a coin and I flip it, I can ask the question, is it heads or is it tails?  But if I take a coin and I spin it, so just let it be in that spin, and then I ask it the question, is it heads or tails?  Well, it's not well-defined while it's spinning, but if I ask the question and say, hey, are you heads or tails, and smack it, it will become one.  So that's an analogy for what happens in a lot of quantum measurements.  There could be a property that wasn't well-defined until we took the measurement.  And it goes back to the wave watcher thing.
