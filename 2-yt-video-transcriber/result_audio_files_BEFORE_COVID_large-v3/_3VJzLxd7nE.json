            "text": "I had been leading an army of young people for about six years in the 90s, fasting and praying for America.  And then a vision came into my heart concerning a massive gathering of fasting and prayer on the Mall in DC.  And a YWAM leader came to me in 1999 and said, Lou, would you help me call the whole world to 40 days of fasting to release the harvest in the new millennium?  And I'm thinking, nobody knows me.  How can I call the whole world to a 40-day fast for the harvest of the new millennium?  And I said, Lord, I've seen you do some pretty amazing stuff, but God, I need confirmation.  So I prayed, and it seems weird, but I prayed, God, if you want me to release this fast, have someone call me tonight.  with a dream that I'm flying a plane and dropping an atomic bomb.  You see, I had been actually reading a book called Atomic Power Through Prayer and Fasting.  That book was released in 1946.  And thousands across the world through that book, pre-social media, were fasting, long fast, 21 days fast, 40 day fast, without food, juice, and water.  And then following that fast, the great evangelists begin to arise, healing revivalists like Oral Roberts, T.L.  Osborne, Billy Graham, and Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ.  It was like the fast released a massive movement of Jesus the evangelist.  Evangelists were rising everywhere. ",
