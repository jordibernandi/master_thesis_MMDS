As I have you here, Natasha, and I have a theologian like Miroslav, I'm interested to see what, according to the two of you, is the difference between the man-god.  sorry, the God-man, Jesus Christ, and the man-God, which apparently, according to her and a few others, we can create through our technological things, and which is one of the reasons why, and maybe you can start with that, Natascha, you are also literally in the business of suspending life and with the idea that at a certain moment technology will be on that level that people can live much longer or even forever.  And the question then related to this, what's the connection between our mortality and our morality? ",

And it's also, you know, think about sattra, no exit, you can't get out.  You're stuck there forever.  So I think of immortality as not only a pipe dream, but in... It's an impossibility.  Our solar system has a lifespan.  Our sun has a lifespan.  So alternatively, I think about a limited lifespan for a person to live as long as he or she desires or is capable.  And if not, then cryonics is an alternative.  until later medicine can catch up with the disease.  But looking at this post... human era, I don't think we're there yet.  I think that that has been subscribed to us by the academics and post-modernism.  And I think they reached out for the post-humanist era because they had no sensibility within academics and in the mainstream about technology and the advances in artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence, nanomedicine, nanotechnology, CRISPR, like with genetic engineering or gene therapy, etc.  at all.  So I think there was this leap.  I think we're in the transhuman era, where the transhumanist era is about a human in transition to becoming something other.  Now, what is that other that could be an evolved human?  It could be a human merging with artificial intelligence.  It could be a human that, in my view, would become more humane.  So that's how I look at it in that regard.  So immortality, no limited lifespan, yes.  Redefining death, we've been doing that for eons.  Determining when someone dies and then we find out, oh, we could have cured that.  We used to hold a mirror up to someone's nose, listen to their heart.  We can bring people back to life that 100, 200 years ago, even 50 years ago, were considered dead.  So that transition to becoming... a post-human, but not non-biological, not some avatar, some automata out there, but a human that's in the stage of post-biological meaning, not having a shelf life, not limited by our genetic makeup.

It's vitrification because you don't want crystallization of the cells, which will crack and... So vitrification is the methodology that's used now in cryonics for suspension.  My scientific research, the scientist part of me, proved that long-term memory does exist in simple animals after cryopreservation or vitrification.  It's a growing business.  People will opt for it.  Doctors are more interested in it now than ever.  We just suspended our beloved animal companion who is like my son.  He died of old age.  The thing about Kryon is it's... It picks up where today's medicine leaves off.  It's not some science fiction dream.  It's based on evidence-based science.  It works.  We brought back C. elegans, and that is a fact.

But it's, we are explorers as a species, as homo sapiens sapiens, and we have the ability now, through the use of ethical technology and evidence-based science to carve what I consider a more apt, a more intelligent, a more ethical, a more humane society, and that's the whole reason behind transhumanism.

There was a 17th century Jewish philosopher who lived in Prague.  And he once wrote in an essay, he began his observation, he said that the human being is a being that aspires to perfection.  It's a very standard medieval formulation.  But then he did something so wicked and smart, he turned the screw in again and he said, and in a being that is defined by the aspiration to perfection, perfection itself would have to be regarded as a flaw and a shortcoming.

So whatever we want to do in terms of extension of life, whatever we want to do in terms of curing the ills, that before humanity and God knows much suffering is inflicted upon human beings by illness, by all sorts of other, in all sorts of other ways.

And I think you mentioned, and I think that was in your question as well, that somehow science should help us answer this question.  And I have difficulty with that.  I think science is an incredibly important, marvelous tool.  I think technology is absolutely marvelous technology.  Well, science, not just tool, but also explaining reality to us, technology enhancing various aspects of our lives, it's absolutely fantastic.  But one thing it cannot do, it cannot tell me what ought to be.  It cannot tell me what I ought to want.  I want something, I desire something, but what is worth desiring?
