            "text": "Guys, welcome back to another episode of Atlas Survival Shelters.  Today we're going to talk about how to hide food and hide yourself if you need to.  I got in a pallet of food today with about 20 pails of this freeze-dried food.  This is about $4,000 of food that you're going to see in this video.  So I'm sitting there thinking, I have a bunker loaded with food right now and I don't need to put more food in that same bunker.  But what I need to do is I need to start hiding this food within walking distance of that bunker.  So my idea is to get these polyethylene septic tanks and start burying them as cachets.  Another thing about these things is if you have to, you can crawl inside these things and you can hide yourself.  Now, because you're underground, your body will not release that thermal image, so if there's eyes in the sky, they're not going to see you because you're down in the septic tank.  So, everybody who's watching this video, and if you can't afford in one of my bunkers, that's fine, but if you got a thousand dollars, my friends, you can go buy one of these septic tanks and you can bury yourself the places where you're hiking or camping or going hunting.  Find a place where you can hide the food even if it's only in your backyard.  Having some food hidden in the backyard is better than nothing, okay?  You always want to have a place where you can leave the house, go get some food and come back to the house.  So what we're going to do is we're going to go check out these polyethylene septic tanks.  We're going to see the sizes, the prices and I'm hoping that I give you guys some good tips and ideas here.  So come along with me.  Let's go do this. ",

            "text": "We are now at... Best Alamo Lumber here in Cuero, Texas.  And they actually stock septic tanks.  So I was talking about you can buy a 300 gallon septic like this black one right here.  And the thing about these, they have a 20 inch manhole.  So what you do is when you bury them, you buy these extensions.  You can buy an extension 12 inches or 18 inches so they can be buried further underground and then you move this cap up to it.  so you can get more dirt on top of this.  But this is a 300 gallon septic tank.  It's about 350 bucks.  And it makes a good cache if you want a small one. ",
