Thank you, and God bless the United States.  Thank you very much.  I also want to make one point very clear.  We're saying Merry Christmas again.  I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again, right?  If I become president, we're all going to be saying Merry Christmas again.  That I can tell you.  That I can tell you.  Did you read about Starbucks?  No more Merry Christmas on Starbucks.  No more.  Maybe we should boycott Starbucks.  I don't know.  Seriously.  I don't care.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I brought my Bible.  I believe in God.  I believe in the Bible.  I'm a Christian.  You know, I have a lot of reasons.  I love people.  I love Christmas.  I love Christmas.  You go to stores and you don't see the word Christmas.  It says happy holidays all over.  I say, where's Christmas?  Merry Christmas.  Remember the expression Merry Christmas?  You don't see it anymore.  You're going to see it if I get elected.  I can tell you right now.  Hello. ",
