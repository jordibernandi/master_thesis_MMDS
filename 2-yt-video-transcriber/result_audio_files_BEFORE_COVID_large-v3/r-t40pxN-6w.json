            "text": "They realize that's not going to keep working.  And there's another form of currency which is actually more important.  That's local currency.  that's in a border system which a village is going to set up on its own.  And the rules for that local currency are going to be managed by the people in that local community.  And what's going to happen is all the local communities are then going to work together in clearing the corruption out.  this is this is people's money and they will.  they will reconstitute the governments because the governments are all corrupt and the brass at the top of the military they're corrupt.  but if you if you've ever served in the military you know that the people who are not the brass understand very well that they're the heart and soul of the military.  And so the military likes to be paid real money, not paper money.  They don't like to be corrupt.  They don't like traitors.  And I can give you a very good example of a traitor.  That's Donald Trump.  He's not the real president of the United States.  And the reason why is that the Constitution of the United States ended in 1871.  And what happened after that was the bankers put a second secret constitution in place, in effect.  And then they proceeded to bribe everybody.  And some of the ones that have been bribed, they're the judges.  You don't have a real court.  The only real courts in the United States are in the District of Columbia.  Why is that?  Because there are three, they're called city-states.  One is the Vatican, one is a very small area in London, and the other place is in the District of Columbia.  And there's something called the black nobility.  They're the ones that are profiting, that have created these city-states, and that are continuing to profit from their corruption.  And enough of us know that they're corrupt.  And we happen to be much stronger than the banking cartel and the black nobility.  and we've actually because there are enough of us.  we're now living in a different reality and at some point the black nobility is going to realize that um they have no choice.  the reality has shifted and we're in that different reality and i said we should.  we should learn who we are.  um One of the people that I've gotten to know is a scientist.  He's a medical doctor, and he's analyzed what the brain is.  And the way he's analyzed it, it's not made up.  He's looked at CAT scans and other analyses of the brain, and he can see which part of the brain is functioning.  And there's a very special part called the prefrontal cortex.  And that is where people have a different capability.  They have transcended themselves.  One of the ways to know whether a person is using their prefrontal cortex is whether they're empathetic.  whether they sympathize with others, whether they will put the welfare of other people on the same plane as themselves.  And all of our prophets and the people who we've admired through the years, they were the ones who obviously were using their prefrontal cortex.  And there are a lot of us who are now learning how to use our prefrontal cortex.  And the other thing is that by using brain scans, you can find out which ones of us are using the most rudimentary part of the brain.  That's the lizard brain.  That's survival.  And there are a number of characteristics of people who are stuck using their brain.  rudimentary brain.  They're the ones that are very interested in hierarchies.  They're the ones that march like Nazis.  And we know them.  They're recognizable and they're not going to play a very big role in our world.  We're going to have a world where most of us are going to learn from the ones who have mastered the art of using their prefrontal cortex.  So that's pretty much what I have to say.  There were other things.  You can see them in the teleprompter.  Let me just make sure.  Oh, I want to talk about the Department of Defense power transition model because that came to me in the World Bank.  You know I was a lawyer in the World Bank for over 20 years.  And in 2004, a member of the political science, well, profession, but he was a real professional, and he developed a model for the National War College, and this model is very, very accurate.  It's over 90% accurate, and it predicts where coalitions will form, and this is not artificial intelligence.  The way you get the data points for this model, is you find an expert who understands a problem very well, and then when you get the things that he has, and the things that the experts are gonna talk about, is they're gonna talk about who the stakeholders are, that is, who influences a problem, and how powerful they are, and where they stand on the problem, and how important they think the problem is.  Now, these are things that the experts themselves are going to come up with the data points.  It's not something that's generated by a computer.  It's generated by experts.  And when you take those data points of the experts, the stakeholders, and you crunch the numbers, it's 90% to 95% accurate where the coalitions will form.  I've been in the legal department of the World Bank for many years, but some of these numbers were just out there, very obvious.  You can tell how powerful the stakeholders were by the number of votes that they cast in the World Bank.  And the United States casts 17% of the votes.  Now, I've been given the job of voting the shares of the US.  Why was I given the job?  A number of reasons.  It's because I'm very stubborn and I was going to do my best to carry on the work of Jose Rizal and Ferdinand Marcos.  And one of the other things about me, if people were to understand what it is that I'm telling them, they could get really turned off if I was somebody who told them I knew better than them.  And that's not what I do at all.  What I do is I work together with other people and I take their positions into account.  And when I'm wrong, I admit it.  So I'm not here to lord it over people.  I'm here to work together with people and to carry out the things that Well, to carry out the way that we're going to transition to a kinder reality.  Now, that's basically all I have to say.  It's probably 10 minutes shorter than my usual videos, but I've managed to say it.  And once again, I'm very grateful for your taking my what?  my report, my update.  And again, I'm working together with other people who are helping me and If we get it wrong, don't worry.  We're just going to sit back and wait for everyone working together to correct us.  So we're not jumping the gun at all.  We're just trying to find the best possible way of transitioning peacefully to a world where the wealth is shared.  It's not controlled by the black nobility.  And actually, what I call this segment, it's In Transition to a Kinder World.  So once again, I'm going to bid you adieu.  And I'm going to make other videos later.  I'm not sure exactly when, but stay tuned.  Thank you. ",
