            "text": "What if I was to tell you you have an angel.  An angel which has been instructed to minister to you and protect you.  For a lot of Christians this is hard to believe.  Because they have never seen an angel.  So they don't believe it.  But some people have.  I personally have never seen one.  But I believe the words of Jesus Christ.  In Matthew 18 verse 10.  It says.  Take heed that you despise not these little ones.  For I say unto you.  That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven.  There is nowhere in the Bible that says when you grow up you lose your angel.  So I believe that whatever stage you are in your life at this moment.  Your angel is watching over you to some capacity.  Psalms 91 verse 11.  For he shall give his angels charge over you.  To keep you in all your ways.  In their hands they shall bear you up.  Lest you dash your foot against the stone.  What a wonderful fact that it is to know that you have an angel.  That God found it fit not only to send his only begotten son to die for your sins and transgressions.  He then sent the Holy Spirit to be your helper and comforter.  But you are so valuable to him that he assigned an angel to attend your birth.  And that not only were the doctors waiting for you when you were born.  But an angel was also in the room.  And that angel has been with you every step of the way throughout your whole life.  I stumbled across the story of a young woman called Danielle.  She was a young Christian college student and she had returned home for summer.  She had gone to visit her friends one evening and the time passed quickly as each of them shared their experience of the last year.  Before she knew it she had stayed longer than she had planned and had to walk home alone.  but she wasn't afraid because she lived in a small town and she only lived a few blocks away.  As she began her walk home, she asked God to keep her safe and to protect her as she traveled.  She reached an alleyway, which was a shortcut to her house.  She decided to take it.  However, halfway down the alleyway, she noticed a man standing at the end of the alleyway as if he was waiting for her.  She became increasingly uneasy and began to pray, asking the Lord to protect her.  Suddenly, a comforting feeling of quietness and security came upon her.  She felt as though someone was walking with her.  When she reached the end of the alleyway, she walked right past the man and arrived home safely.  The following day, she read in the paper that someone had been attacked in that alleyway just 20 minutes after she had walked by there.  She was instantly overwhelmed by the tragedy and the fact that it could have been her.  She began to weep and cry uncontrollably.  thanking God for her safety.  And to help the person who was attacked, she decided to go to the police station, as she knew she could recognize the man who she saw in that alleyway.  So she told them the story and the police asked her if she would be willing to look at a lineup to see if she could identify him.  She agreed and immediately pointed out the man she had seen in the alleyway the night before.  When the man was told he had been identified, he immediately broke down and confessed.  The officers thanked Danielle.  for her bravery and asked if there was anything they could do for her.  She simply asked if they could ask the man one question.  Danielle was curious as to why the man did not attack her.  When the policeman asked her, he answered, because she wasn't alone.  She had two tall men walking either side of her.  Throughout the Bible from Genesis to Revelations we are told of situations where angels intervened in the lives of people.  And the same God of the scriptures is the same God who still operates in our lives today.  Just imagine that.  She didn't see the two men walking with her, but the man who had negative intentions did.  This is why the Bible says in Psalms 91, for he shall give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways.  From the moment you were born, you have been guarded by angelic protection.  Your angel has been watching over you, constantly watching you.  Watching over every detail of your life.  Protecting you in times of crisis.  Keeping you in all your ways.  Now there is a difference between how angels operate in the lives of children of God and sinners.  From the moment you were born, your angel has been watching over you.  All the way up until the age of accountability.  Now once you're at the age of accountability and you reject God, you push your angel away from your life.  But he does not completely leave you.  He's just watching you from a distance away, waiting for you, yearning for you to repent of your sins and accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior.  However, if you're a child of God, your angel has first class access over your life, constantly watching over you, ministering to you.  That's why the Bible in speaking of the angel says in Hebrews 1 verse 14, Are they not ministering?  spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?  You are an heir of salvation.  In whatever situation you are in right now, you are not alone.  That should give you another level of security and comfort.  That your heavenly father saw it fit.  That you are constantly protected by beings that operate both in the spirit world and in our world.  They are constantly at your side, fighting your battles, battles that you know of, battles that you cannot see, and battles that you don't even know are occurring in your life.  They are busy away warring for your victory.  All glory and worship deserves to go to the Lord God Almighty for the value he has placed on your life, on your life.  You may have felt like you have no purpose on this world, but God created you in his image.  for his glory in your own life you don't protect things that are not valuable to you.  you protect things that are.  you are so valuable to god not because of anything you have done not because of anything that you will do but simply because he loves you.  when you think nobody loves you Remember, God loves you so much that he gave his only begotten son that you would not perish, no matter how small, irrelevant or unimportant you may feel.  No matter how insignificant you may feel, you are valuable to God.  And in all honesty, I would much rather be valuable in the eyes of the Lord than in the eyes of any human.  You are so valuable to God the Father.  You may think, but how is this possibly true?  After all, I'm just a human.  But Psalms 8 verse 4 says, What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you visit him?  For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and you have crowned him with glory and honor.  You have made him to have dominion over the works of your hands.  You have put all things under his feet.  Understand this.  No, really take time to think this through.  This was King David speaking.  And he could not understand what made humans so special to God.  It said he made us just a little lower than the angels.  Yet they're the ones that have been sent by God to watch over us, to protect us.  I don't know about you, but I know that most things that are watched over and protected have to be of some importance.  They have to be valuable to someone.  The Bible says He knows every hair on your head.  Now honestly ask yourself, would you be willing to count every hair on someone's head if that person didn't mean anything to you?  Who could sacrifice their own son For someone who means nothing to them.  God knew who you were.  Even when you were in your mother's womb.  Psalms 139.  Says your eye saw my substance.  Being yet unformed.  He knew you then.  It doesn't matter to him where you were born.  What job you have.  What car you drive.  He loves you.  He cares for you.  And you are important to him. ",

He said, I prayed for him, stayed a few minutes.  He said he was in very bad shape.  His eyes were closed.  He said, I left.  He said, a couple of weeks later, I was walking down the street in Minden, and he said, the man was on the street.  God had healed him, and I didn't know it.  He didn't call me.  He said, I walked up to him and he said, the man said, oh, Brother Barnes, thank you so much for coming and praying for me in the hospital.  Brother Barnes said, well, you're welcome.  I'm so glad that God has healed you.  And the man said, but I also want to thank you for staying all night with me in the room.  Brother Barnes said, but I didn't stay all night with you.  In that hospital room.  The man said, oh yes you did.  He said, Brother Barnes, every time I opened my eyes and looked in the corner of that chair, he said, you were seated in that chair in the corner.  It wasn't Brother Barnes.  It was his angel. ",

You are divinely protected.  Look around the room you are in right now.  You may not be able to see it.  To see what's around you.  But believe me when I tell you.  There are angels around you to protect you.  To guard you.  To guide you.  To lead you.  To comfort you.  From the moment you were born God assigned angels to protect you.  You are precious to God.  He loves you.  And this is what the Lord is saying to you in this moment.  I love you so much.  I chose you.  I chose you specifically.  Not Billy, not Holly, but I chose you specifically.  I love you more than you can ever understand or know.  Even in the days where you walked as a child right through to an adult.  I was there.  So many things I have kept from harming you.  I have kept you.  And you wouldn't even know it.  I have guided you in moments and you didn't even know it.  I have stopped so many things to come into your life that you didn't have any idea what was about to happen, but you'd never know it.  I love you. ",
