I mean, most of those ideas have been around since Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the very earliest, or at the very latest, rather.  Some of them go all the way back to Woodrow Wilson.  But the idea that new ideas are absent in the Republican Party is obviously untrue.  We have a very strong debate that goes on inside sort of the conservative halls of intelligentsia about what is the appropriate action to take with regard to the medical system.  Should global warming be considered a real threat or should global warming be considered something that technology will solve?  And if so, what are the best aspects of solving that?  Now, there's a rich intellectual debate on the right about nationalism versus patriotism, for example, or populism versus free marketeerism.  That debate is happening on the right to sort of suggest that the right in America is bereft of ideas, but the left is full of ideas.  Number one, not all ideas are good ideas.  I mean, AOC is pretty good evidence of that.  I'm a big fan of some old ideas myself that I think are pretty good.  But beyond that, I think that it is intellectual... uh intellectual sneering of the highest order to suggest that only the left has has new and decent ideas. ",

So he first says, oh, what is the appropriate action to take in regard to the medical system?  Doesn't present any ideas.  He just says, what are the appropriate actions?  What are the appropriate actions that we should take in regards to the medical system?  That's what he led with.  He led with a question in terms of what are the appropriate actions?  No idea.  He just led with a question on what are the actions, but he didn't actually offer anything.  The next one.  Should global warming be considered a real threat or something that technology will solve?  Okay, so let me actually slow it down for you.  Should global warming be considered a real threat or something that technology will solve?  This is a false dichotomy.  The fact is, it is a threat.  And the idea that it's a threat is actually a new idea for the conservative movement.  So he could have said that.  He could have said, well... Conservatives now actually, at least some of them, recognize that climate change is in fact real.  So that's new.  But because he would completely expose how unscientific and stupid the Republican Party is, he's not going to say it that way.  But yeah, so in terms of the technology... Okay, so global warming, yes, is a real threat.  And let's also look at technology.  It's not an either-or.  So the technology is renewable energy.  But are conservatives having the discussion about this at all?  Are they offering any ideas?  Are there any bills on the table about climate change from Republicans?  No, they're not offering anything to deal with this.  Now... Ben, though, you should look this up after you watch this video.  Ben has presented an idea to address climate change.  He has said in the past, well, all you got to do is sell your home.  If you're on one of these coastal cities where you're going to get flooded, sell your home.  Sell your home.  When climate change becomes a real threat and in fact the sea levels are rising and your house is about to be flooded out, sell your home.  Just sell your home because people are going to want to buy a home that is about to be underwater.  This is Ben Shapiro.  Ben Shapiro logic.  He also says here, oh, how about the idea of free markets versus populism?  First of all, that doesn't really make sense.  It should be actually free trade versus protectionism.  But he says there in that same breath, nationalism versus patriotism.  Yes, the new discussion of nationalism versus patriotism, where in 1945, George Orwell distinguished between nationalism and patriotism.  Oh, so many new ideas from the Republican Party.  Ben Shapiro offered nothing.  He didn't even really give any old ideas.  He gave no ideas at all.  He just discussed conversations.  Oh, well, we have to have the nationalism versus patriotism and the discussion of the medical system and climate change.  But he didn't offer any ideas.  But for a lot of people, Ben Shapiro speaks so fast that you don't even realize that he's not actually saying anything.  Now, let's get to the next clip here, where Ben gets owned.

But Andrew Neal.  Oh, my God.  Andrew Neal on the left.  Let's read a little bit about Andrew Neal.  Neal was appointed editor of the Sunday Times by Rupert Murdoch, the creator of Fox News, as well as many conservative outlets across the globe.  And Neal served in this position from 1983 to 1994.  After this, he became a contributor to the Daily Mail.  He was formerly chief executive and editor-in-chief of the Press Holdings Group.  In 1988, he became the founding chairman of Sky TV, also part of Murdoch's News Corporation.  He is the current chairman of Press Holdings Media Group, whose titles include The Spectator, which is one of Britain's leading conservative magazines, and the ITP Media Group.  As of 2019, Neil presents live political programs This Week on BBC One and Politics Live on BBC Two.  Yes, Andrew Neil, the massive leftist.  Let me just also share this opinion here from what people have said about Andrew Neil in the past.  So this is from Owen Jones.  If the BBC is politically neutral, how does it explain Andrew Neil?  He symbolizes the right-wing domination of our media, yet a politics presenter as aligned to the left would not be tolerated.  Neil's Twitter account, which has hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to his BBC gig, is routinely used to promote right-wing causes.  He uses this platform to denounce the scientific consensus on climate change, reviling what he calls the climate mafia, and claiming that deviation from the consensus meant the witch finders want to burn you.  It is not the first time he has deviated from scientific consensus.  Now, I will link to that Guardian article below my video so you can read the full context and understand who Andrew Neil is.  Andrew Neil is not on the left.  Now, this last clip here is just beautiful because Ben Shapiro throws a tantrum and runs from the interview because he cannot answer the questions. ",

He's not used to actually being questioned on the things that he has said.  I mean, Shapiro was simply owned by facts and logic.  And by the way, the Andrew Neal mentioned there, or Ben Shapiro claimed that Andrew Neal called Shapiro's pro-life, which is anti-abortion position, that Neal called it barbaric.  Neal was actually referring to, if you watch the full interview, Neal called throwing women in jail for miscarriages barbaric, which I guess Shapiro agrees with.  Because at no point in the interview did he push back against the idea that a woman who miscarries should be thrown in jail.  So if you agree with that position, yeah, that's barbaric.  Now, let me share some reactions to this fantastic interview.  So, this is from Tom Gara.  Ben Shapiro takes a brief departure from facts, not caring about feelings, by telling one of the most prominent conservatives in the UK media that he's a leftist shill.  James Felton.  Here's regular user of the term snowflake, Ben Shapiro, shortly before he ran away from an interview because he found Andrew Neil to be too left-wing.  This from a classical liberal with a three.  Ben Shapiro going on BBC and demanding conservative Andrew Neil admit he's a leftist, then crying about how unfair it is to be asked critical questions about his book before running away from the interview shows how these American conservatives are accustomed to their safe spaces.  Exactly.  Ben Shapiro, owned by Facts and Logic.  Apparently, his feelings really do matter.  They appear to be what matters most to Ben Shapiro.  He couldn't take the heat, even though I wouldn't have really called any of this heat.  You can watch the full interview on the BBC.  I'll link to it below the video.  The questions were fair.  He was asking him about his previous comments, about Shapiro's previous comments.  Shapiro did not want to face the fact that he has said a lot of dumb crap and could not justify any of it.  So good on Andrew Neal, even though I agree with him on likely nothing.  Good job by Andrew Neal by just being a journalist and asking normal questions. ",
