Nation of Islam Obama.  Like, literally.  I said that in character, and I was like, you know what?  That works.  Gotcha.  Fucking mayo brain.  I didn't know if we wanted to shout out Forrest, but gotcha.  No, I think that was literally Nation of Islam Obama, which is basically my deep subconscious.

And, you know, but this debate on Ilhan Omar, I was up against.  Well, let me just put it this way.  I was up against the guy with an accent, which is, as I point out in the clip, a huge disadvantage.  But let's play a couple of minutes of it.  We'll stop and everybody can stop with their feet.

But let's be real here.  I mean, there was one group that wasn't included in that resolution, and that was the Palestinians as a people.  where regular racism and dehumanization towards them is entirely accepted.  The reality is, is that Ilhan Omar is correct on the merits.  She's correct on the policy.  Saying that she said this comment about dual allegiance is a great leap to begin with.  And I have to say, I find it extraordinary that people on the right who sometimes accurately, by the way, not always, but sometimes accurately, say people on the left, you know, jump to accusations too quickly of various bigotries and read into things.  They've been reading into every single thing that the congresswoman has said from the beginning, most of which are substantive critiques of a sovereign state.  nation state that happens to administer a horrific regime that violates people's rights on a daily basis in Gaza, the West Bank, and even inside Israel in some respects.  The new indictment about Netanyahu isn't just garden variety corruption.  It involves actually undermining democracy.  So I support Ilhan Omar.  I don't buy... And I also, in fact, support Corbyn, in fact.  And the reality is, is that these things are going to become debated on the merits.  And we're not going to have a false equivalency... and actually drag down the profoundly serious issue of anti-Semitism by equating it with all criticism of a sovereign nation-state that administers apartheid in reality.

First of all, everybody does, and the Saudis at least don't have any pretensions that they're anything other than a brutal theocracy and monarchy.  The Israelis have maintained a position of being the only democracy in the Middle East, while they have maintained an occupation of another group of people for over 40 years, and regularly killed and bombed civilians.  And the second standard is, is that look, again, in terms of reality, Israel has not only serious and profound and systemic problems which even poses a threat in some respects to our security but like Egypt we happen to fund them greatly and so therefore it is a different relationship but you will find that those who criticize Israel in good faith as many Jewish activists do, of course, are going to be actually the same people, as you see with Omar, who are questioning the relationship with the Gulf monarchies and other areas of dysfunction in Middle East policy.

But like the main takeaway in that is like, no, I'm not leaving my boy hanging.  So I've got to also say, well, I'm not going to get distracted by that.  I still back him.  Well, it also makes him make a decision, like, is he going to follow up on the Corbyn comment?  Well, you notice what he did is he said only 23% of Britons think he's not an anti-Semite.  And I said, right, because you did a great job smearing him, and we're not going to allow that to happen again.
