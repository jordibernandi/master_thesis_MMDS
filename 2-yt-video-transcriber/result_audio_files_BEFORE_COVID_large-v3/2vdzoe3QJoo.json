            "text": "In Jeremy Corbyn, I see a man who's not perfect.  He's got all sorts of flaws, as we all do.  But he does have that ability to connect.  He genuinely seems to care about people.  And when I see him going around the country, meeting people, he'll hug them, he'll crack a joke with them, he'll connect in a way that I don't see Boris Johnson connecting at all.  But Corbyn, he's got that absolutely crucial element in politics, which is empathy.  He cares about other people.  And that is really radical.  It shouldn't be.  It should be absolutely commonplace.  I mean, how extraordinary it is that that is an extraordinary thing in politics.  That we're amazed when we see a prominent politician who's able to empathise.  That shows us what a mess we've got ourselves into.  But it also shows us that it's quite exciting to be faced with the prospect of someone like that becoming Prime Minister.  Because things could really change then.  The people we need in government are people who are governing on our behalf, who are in it for us.  Unfortunately, the systems we have, the political systems almost everywhere, reward people who are in it for themselves.  They reward the egotists, they reward the psychopaths even.  the people who couldn't give a shit about anyone else because they just want to take power and hold that power for themselves.  We need to see governments giving power back to the people where it belongs rather than seizing power and aggrandizing themselves by taking the power which belongs to us.  What we have seen for years and years is a system of political theft where people claim to be Democrats, they claim to be acting on behalf of the people but they are taking the power that belongs to ",

            "text": "and holding it in their own hands and bigging themselves up as a result.  Making themselves powerful when they should be.  making the people powerful.  Then using that power once they're out of office to monetize it and to make themselves exceedingly rich with the notorious revolving door in this country between politics and money-making.  You do favours for big companies when you're in office and when you're out of office, they make you a director and pay you hundreds of thousands of pounds for doing virtually nothing.  That's the reward you get for selling your soul, for selling your country down the river when you're in office.  It's impossible to picture Corbyn doing what Blair has done in his post-political career, flying around the world on private jets, meeting tyrants.  meeting oil companies, taking millions of pounds from them in order to tell them how to make themselves look good in their dictatorship.  There's a huge amount of psychological work showing that as people acquire wealth and power, their empathy progressively gets shut down.  They become much less connected to the concerns of other people, much less interested in the lives of other people.  This is why it's so disastrous to have politicians drawn from a small group who have a sort of hereditary wealth and power.  And this psychological tendency is compounded by the fact that if you are very rich you're much less likely to use public services.  There are lots of very rich people whose only public service they use is the roads.  They don't use public health, they don't use public education.  They are pretty well detached from the society that most of the rest of us live in.  because their wealth enables them to buy their way out.  We do not want people who operate like that exercising power over us because they're not connected to our lives.  I mean, this might seem odd to say because Corbyn's had a very long political career.  He's been in the Palace of Westminster for a long time.  But the great thing about him is he's also been outside the Palace of Westminster for a long time.  all those marginal obscure meetings traipsing along to on Saturday afternoons when other people are enjoying themselves and he was really sort of on the fag end of politics you know.  he was just sort of cast into the outer darkness.  I think that's a good thing because it means that He had no opportunity ever to get puffed up.  That's what we want.  We want people in politics who have not become these great towering egos because everything has gone their way.  Time and again, when I see people like Dominic Raab or Priti Patel, I see people who, in my view, just don't appear to empathize with other people.  They don't seem to care about the impacts that they have on other people.  They don't seem to feel guilt about the harm that they might do.  They look like psychopaths.  We can't allow people like that to have power over us.  That's an incredibly dangerous situation.  You know, I often think that what counts most in politics is the ability to care, the ability to care about other people.  And what I see in the current government is a government which just doesn't care.  It does not seem to care about people who it should be looking out for. ",

We find ourselves in a very dangerous situation now.  where we could see those people re-elected.  And I just dread to think what power they could then exercise over us.  If Boris Johnson wins this election, the hedge funds win.  The big banks win.  The offshore capital wins.  the power that has been exercised over us for many centuries, for long before the democratic era, that wins because it's all still vested in his party and he's the champion of those extra-political powers.  If Corbyn wins, we as a nation win.  So we're faced with one of the starkest choices that people have ever been faced with at an election in the UK.  It is critically important that we vote in the interests of all rather than in the interests of some.  Whoever wins the general election, we desperately need an active, independent media which is not owned by billionaires.  And Double Down News, I can assure you, is not owned by billionaires.  So please support them and please help out a bit, if you can, by giving them some funding through Patreon. ",
