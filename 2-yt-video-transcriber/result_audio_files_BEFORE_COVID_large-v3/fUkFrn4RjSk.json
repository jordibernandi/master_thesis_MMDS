            "text": "In 2012, I made a video called Mormonism is Racism, explaining why Mormonism will never be able to exorcise its racist demons.  Racism is at the heart of the Book of Mormon narrative, as a central and essential part of the story.  If you remove it, the entire Book of Mormon story collapses, along with any claim that Joseph Smith was connected to some all-knowing, all-powerful super-being.  To quickly recap, the Book of Mormon tells the story of a small group of Hebrews who supposedly came to the Americas from the Holy Land.  The leader, Lehi, had four sons who ultimately divided up into two groups, one wicked and one righteous.  And just so no one would get confused, God cursed the wicked group with a skin of blackness so they would not be enticing to the righteous group.  Whitey.  Of course, God is just, so when the dark-skinned folks returned to the fold, the Book of Mormon made it clear that they would once again become a white and delightsome people.  It's gross.  It's racist.  If we're talking about white supremacy, this idea takes the cake.  Mormonism is, in essence, a reverse tanning bed.  You go in black, repent of your sins, get baptized, start living a better life, pay that 10% on your gross income, and soon the curse is lifted and white privilege is finally yours.  When you go into the Mormon temple, you wear nothing but white clothing, aside from the green apron you put on later.  The celestial rooms in Mormon temples the world over are You guessed it, white.  As a teen, I was even cautioned against getting blackheads.  These people don't around.  In addition to the Book of Mormon idea that black skin is a curse, some equally creepy verses in other books of Mormon scripture led to a policy of denying black men the right to hold the Mormon priesthood.  Or should I say black men of African origin?  Theologies were constructed to justify the racism, suggesting that black people were born black because they were less valiant in the war in heaven, where Jesus fought Satan over the plan of salvation.  This supposedly took place before we came to earth.  Yeah, I know, right?  My friend, author David Fitzgerald, calls Mormonism steampunk Scientology.  I think that's a pretty good fit.  In 1978, the church finally allowed African blacks to hold the priesthood.  Apparently, God felt a bit of heat coming his way and changed his racist mind.  Good to know.  that's a tactic we can use on God moving forward.  35 years later, the church published an essay saying that the policy was basically nothing more than good old-fashioned racism and without any theological justification whatsoever.  Really?  Well... That's a shocker, right?  I mean, it's almost like their prophets are just old white guys whose bigotry has nothing to do with God.  Who knew?  And while the policy change, along with the church's confession, was clearly a positive move, nearly 40 years later, polling revealed that the majority of Mormons still believe that racist policy denying African blacks the priesthood was God's will.  Nearly two-thirds say they either know or believe that's what God wanted.  And here's the most depressing part.  70% of non-white Mormons claim to know or believe the policy was God's will and idea.  Hashtag Stockholm Syndrome.  What this polling data clearly shows is that Mormons are smart enough to know that the church's admission of the original policy's racism is... Well, nothing more than public relations bullshit.  They didn't change the Book of Mormon to reflect this admission.  God still curses the wicked with a skin of blackness in Mormon scripture.  As I said, that can never change without the entire house of cards collapsing.  Mormons are also smart enough to know that an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God wouldn't have waited around nearly 200 years to set things right.  He either would have gotten things right from the beginning or traveled back in time to fix his mistake, and we would never have known otherwise.  The majority of Mormons still think this horrible racism was God's will, because in Mormonism, white supremacy still reigns supreme.  It's gross.  It's racist.  It really is. ",
