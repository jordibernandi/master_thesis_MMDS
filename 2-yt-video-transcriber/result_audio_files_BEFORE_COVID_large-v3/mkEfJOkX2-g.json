            "text": "One summer day, Matilda found something in the grass across the street.  She ran and got her daddy.  Oh dear, you'd better run and get your mummy.  It was a baby bird.  He can't fly.  Maybe he fell out of his nest.  Maybe.  What should we do, Daddy?  Well, right now we have to finish getting dressed and go to that wedding.  We'll check on him after we get back.  Lovely wedding.  Matilda was the flower girl.  When we got home, the baby bird was still there.  What should we do?  Well, we can't leave him here.  Evening's coming.  Cats will be coming out soon.  Matilda and I will take him to the vet.  Now?  Before he closes, yeah.  It's too hot.  I'll drive you.  No, we'll walk.  It's not far.  Well, okay.  I scooped up the bird and Matilda and I walked to the vet.  It felt farther than it was.  It was hot.  Walking with my arms straight out, holding a hot little baby bird.  Also, I needed a restroom.  There was a bit of a wait at the vet's.  Finally he saw us and informed us that he didn't see birds.  He saw dogs and cats exclusively.  Yes, I can respect that, but we found this baby bird, and it's an emergency.  Dogs and cats, no birds.  But no birds.  He hinted that I should leave, but I did not.  I had a few questions about the validity and sincerity of his calling.  His patience listened.  Wait, he said.  All right, I've made a call.  This other doctor sees birds.  He's open now, and he'll stay open until you get there.  But that's half a mile away.  My daughter and I are walking.  He's waiting for you now.  If you don't want to go, I'll call him back and cancel.  We'll go.  Thank you, doctor.  Thank you for nothing.  Come on, Matilda.  I still needed a restroom, but it was impossible to ask now.  It was a long, angry, hot march.  Matilda couldn't understand why a veterinarian would refuse any animal in need.  Well, honey, sometimes the people with the most responsibility exercise at the least, and sometimes people's motivations and priorities get mixed up.  But please walk faster, sweetie, or Daddy's going to have an accident.  Mr.  Mountebank, baby bird?  Yes, give him to me.  No, it's no trouble at all.  Restroom?  Yes, of course, down the hall.  Thank you.  Well, this doctor was good.  He was very kind and very knowledgeable.  He taught us about baby sparrows, how it's actually a normal part of their life cycle to spend a few days on the ground, learning to fly, learning to forage, learning to make friends.  The mummy and daddy birds.  keep watch, keep them safe.  doctor do you mean to say yes i'm afraid that you with the very best of intentions have kidnapped this bird right in front of his terrified parents.  oh dear it's too late to put him back now.  just take care of him to-night and put him back in the morning.  the doctor gave us a box and a bottle of baby bird food.  mummy and florentina came to pick us up and drive us home.  baby bird was our guest that night and early next morning we put him back in the grass across the street.  he came back a few times.  honey your friend is here.  we kept putting him back.  at last he stopped returning to us and got on with his business of being a bird.  we watched him for a few days.  It was easy to tell him apart because he had a distinctive club foot.  He didn't let it hold him back.  He was a great bird. ",
