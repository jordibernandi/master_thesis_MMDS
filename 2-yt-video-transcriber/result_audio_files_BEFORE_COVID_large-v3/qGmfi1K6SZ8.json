Where are the feminists standing up for this girl who was assaulted by a grown man because she dared to think for herself?  Oh, the radical leftist feminist will fight for a 16-year-old illegal alien to be allowed to kill her unborn baby.  But when a 16-year-old high school girl is physically assaulted by a man, the left is silent because this young woman is conservative.  What happened to my body, my choice?  What happened to give space to women's opinions at the table?  What happened to defeating the controlling patriarchy?  What happened to respecting women?  Here's the thing.  The radical left claims to stand up for women, but they don't.  Because unless you shout your abortion, unless you hate men, glorify promiscuity, whine about your salary, and march angrily in a pink hat and parrot the radical feminist ideology, the radical left will not stand up for you.  And if you dare to be a woman who is pro-life, pro-gun, pro-border security, if you're an unborn woman, a Christian, conservative, Republican woman, or if you're a woman who voted for President Trump, Then the radical left claims you aren't even a real woman.  And so when a grown man bullies and assaults a 16-year-old girl because she dares to support President Trump, well, the left couldn't care less about standing up for your rights, especially if you're a woman because you're conservative.
