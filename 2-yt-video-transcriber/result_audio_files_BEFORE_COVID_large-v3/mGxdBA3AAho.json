            "text": "Well, excellent question.  I think that what you need to do, because people sometimes say, have you investigated every other worldview out there?  And the honest answer is no.  I've investigated the theisms out there.  Why?  Because I think there is very good evidence for theism.  And if there's very good evidence for theism, all non-theisms can't be true.  Doesn't mean everything a non-theistic worldview teaches is false, but when it comes to the existence and nature of God, they appear to have it wrong.  So if theism is true, that would mean Hinduism isn't true, Buddhism isn't true, New Age isn't true.  Just the big religions would be Christianity, Islam, or Judaism could be true.  And then what you do is you look at those and you see the evidence for those, Which one of those, if any of them, appears to be the true theistic religion?  And I think when you look at the three, first of all, Judaism is just incomplete Christianity in my view, because I believe everything the Jews believe.  I just believe the Messiah has come.  Jews who are conservative.  And with Islam, I think when you look at the situation with Islam, remember, Muhammad comes along in 570 A.D He gets what he believes is a revelation in 610 A.D He dies in 632  A.D.,  and the Quran is compiled after him.  Muhammad in the Quran says, I don't do miracles.  I'm just a plain warner, meaning I just warn people.  there's one God.  There are no miracles attributed to Muhammad until about 150 years later in what's known as the Hadith, the written traditions of what Muhammad said and did.  Even many Muslim scholars admit many of the miracles that are in there are not true.  They're legendary.  So the eyewitnesses of Jesus, however, I think have given us very good evidence that he really rose from the dead.  There's no confirming miracle for Islam.  There is a confirming miracle for Jesus.  And it's interesting, if you read the Quran in Surah 5, I think it's verse 68, the Quran says, O ye people of the book, meaning... The Christians and the Jews.  Oh, you people of the book, you have no ground to stand on unless you stand on the law and the gospels.  In other words, the Koran is telling the Jews and the Christians to believe the Old Testament and the New Testament.  Well, the problem is the Old Testament and the New Testament.  leave no room for Muhammad in the Koran.  The Koran is actually telling Christians and Jews you ought to trust the Old and the New Testaments.  Now, Muslims will come along and say, wait a minute, that was the original Old and New Testaments and they've been corrupted.  Yeah, the problem with that is when the Koran was written in the 600s  A.D.,  We have full Bibles 300 years prior to that.  So we know it hasn't been corrupted.  So the reason I'm a Christian is because I think the evidence shows that Jesus is God, that Jesus literally rose from the dead.  And I just have a personal policy.  If somebody rises from the dead, I just trust whatever the guy says.  Thank you. ",
