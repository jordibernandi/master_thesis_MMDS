            "text": "Boy, those crazy Keynesians at the World Central Banks are up to it again.  And if this wasn't so tragic, it would be hilarious.  This is like a bad dream that you can't wake up from.  This article says the Fed is dusting off a QE replacement last used during World War II.  Well, it's not really a quantitative easing replacement.  It's just another variation of quantitative easing.  And it's actually QE on steroids because now they're thinking about targeting longer term rates.  So these are the interest rates on like the two year and the 10 year treasury.  The Fed vice chairman, Richard Clarida, floated the idea in a speech earlier this year and has done research on its use in Japan.  Well, Japan's economy is terrible.  It's been terrible for 30 years since their market crashed in 1989.  They've been trying every Keynesian trick in the book to get the stock markets to go up and get their economy going again.  And their stock markets, the Nikkei, is still way down from its 1989 peak.  And no matter what they do, it seems like there's a very short-term boost in the economy.  And then it's like they've got these huge weights chained around their legs and they just can't make any forward momentum.  And so I just can't believe that they're still trying all of this stuff.  And it really says something that, you know, it's been many years since the market crash now, since the bailouts of 08 and 09 and all of the QE.  And then they shut QE off at the end of 2015.  And the Fed was talking about normalizing their balance sheet.  We're still doing stuff that manipulates the economy and they never got back to normal.  and already here they're talking about even more drastic measures because manipulating longer-term rates is a much more drastic measure than just manipulating short-term rates.  It requires, I'll show you in a minute, it requires manipulating short-term rates also.  So, what you're doing is whatever currency they create to buy all of the short-term bonds and bring that interest rate down, they also have to create some more to bring down the longer-term interest rates and try and fool people into thinking that this is a real recovery.  Now, I'm expecting that the stock markets will probably continue on up through this election cycle.  It seems like that's what's going to happen.  But this is interesting.  Finally, economists are starting to give credit to business people, to businesses and entrepreneurs for actually creating prosperity, for lifting us out.  They're saying that Ken Rogoff, a leading monetary policy expert at Harvard University, said academics have largely concluded that QE was not even a very effective tool to spur growth.  Well, it isn't and all it did was warp the economy and it set us up for the bursting of the next bubble because when it warps the economy, it lifts part of the economy up quicker than the rest of the economy.  That's a bubble.  Everybody says there hasn't been any inflation even though they created $3.2 trillion of new base currency on top of the 0.8 that was there before.  So only $830 billion, roughly.  And they created $3.2 trillion on top of that.  And everybody thought there was going to be hyperinflation.  Well, there was hyperinflation.  There was hyperinflation of the stock markets.  There was hyperinflation of real estate.  They've pushed these things back into bubbles at the expense of the rest of the economy.  When they do this, it's a reverse Robin Hood.  They steal from Main Street to give to Wall Street.  They create currency that doesn't have purchasing power until it gets into circulation and steals purchasing power from all the other units of currency in circulation.  Whatever sector that goes into is the sector that ends up going into a bubble.  They create currency two ways.  The Fed does it by creating base currency, and then to get it into circulation, they buy something, and that's a bond from a brokerage house.  So it goes into a brokerage house, so the stock market goes up.  Or they lower interest rates and they let the banks create the currency.  And when you lower interest rates, real estate goes up.  So we're back into bond and we're back into stock market and real estate bubbles.  But it's interesting that academics are now concluding that QE doesn't work.  And most of these academics, they're Keynesians and they're saying, well, that didn't work.  So the Fed is saying, well, let's double down on it.  Instead of just doing short-term rates, let's do long-term rates as well.  Now, this is David Beckwith, and he says that, my question, any evidence?  yield curve control is working in Japan or elsewhere?  The fact is, no, there is no evidence.  It doesn't work.  Now, who is David Beckwith?  He's a fellow at the Mercatus Center, and he's former economist at the U.S.  Treasury Department.  So I believe that he's probably a credible guy when it comes to his opinion on this.  But this is the yield curve.  I've gone over this before.  And one of the reasons that the Fed can't go up to 2.5 is if, you know, that's what they'd like to continue raising this because they need about five percentage points.  Each one of these recessions that happened, they had to drop the short-term rate by five percentage points.  So the three-month here.  They dropped that and they do that.  by just buying up as many of them that there are, because on Treasury auctions, it sort of works the opposite of a regular auction.  The lowest bid wins, but it's the lowest bid on interest rates.  The Treasury doesn't want to pay more than they have to to borrow currency.  And so you've got the primary dealers there, the big brokerage houses, and they're all bidding against each other.  And the ones that bid the lowest interest rate win that treasury bond.  And so if they can resell it to the Fed for a tiny little profit, there's more and more competition to bid the lowest price possible.  And the Fed just targets a very low yield here, as you'll see in a minute.  But they need to have this headroom of like 5% or so in their opinion.  They're wrong, but this is what they think.  And so they're scared right now.  This is the problem.  The Federal Reserve is scared.  And an inversion of the yield curve, when you hear about that, that's typically considered the two-year going above the 10-year.  And right now, they're very close to each other.  So there's not much headway.  And what you'll see here is you'll notice when I move all of this that the short-term bonds that the Fed manipulates drag down the yield of the two-year or up.  Depending on what this is doing, this follows it pretty much, even when these are trying to do something completely different.  So I'm going to sweep this.  This is the S&P 500 index.  So it's the points on the S&P from 1999 until today.  And as we move this, you can see that I'm going backwards in time and that yield curve is going, this is called a positive yield curve.  where longer-term rates are way above short-term rates.  And this is the area where Bernanke and Janet Yellen had the short-term interest rate, that three-month.  That's pegged there because of the Federal Reserve pulling it down and just sticking it down there at like between a tenth of a percent and a quarter of a percent.  That's where they were trying to hold it.  And so all during this time it's held there, and it's holding that two-year down.  As I move this, you can see that the longer-term rates are trying to go up, but because that three-month is pegged, it holds that two-year down.  Now we're getting back into the free market controlling the price of bonds, and here's what's interesting.  We had a positive yield curve in the late 90s and then just before the crash.  So actually the NASDAQ has already started crashing.  The S&P and the Dow were still doing okay.  But the 10 is about, it's a little bit above the two-year here.  Then as we go a little bit further, that's a complete inversion.  But the S&P and the Dow kept on going for several more months.  So you've got like a year where there's a blow-off top going on in the markets after that yield curve inversion.  And then you see interest rates coming down.  And every once in a while, you can see the Fed jumping in there.  And this is during the Alan Greenspan era.  But you'll see that he manipulates them right there.  The three-month is sort of pegged, and then it jumps down to a lower rate.  And it's sticky.  It's not moving with the rest of them.  So there's some manipulation going on, but not much.  And then we get into this big real estate boom.  And here we've got the two-year and the 10-year inverted a whole two years before the end of that boom.  So they were predicting a recession and they predict it early.  And there it's inverted again.  And then the crash.  And then we've got the three-month completely stuck there.  And it holds the two-year down.  And so the two-year can't invert with the 10.  Now, what they are talking about doing is if they pull the three-month down to zero, because this sticks like this, they can then manipulate the two and the five and the seven and the 10 and pull these down as well.  If they pull the 10 down, I think this is the bond that has the most amount.  It's got the biggest market cap.  It's got the most amount of currency that goes towards it.  So it's the most amount of our national debt.  Remember, we have to pay all of this back through taxation.  So if they pull these down, they think they're going to stimulate the economy.  And the dumb thing is... In this article, this is Ben Bernanke in a blog post.  He says that the Fed might be able to achieve its objective without acquiring many securities at all.  And so what he's saying is it'll be cheap to do this.  They won't have to.  I find this totally absurd.  that they're going to manipulate, you know, they manipulated one bond then, now they're talking about manipulating many and having to go into the market and buy these.  No matter what the free market is trying to do, they're going to try to counteract the free market and try and overwhelm it.  And it's going to warp the economy severely.  So get ready for something big just because people are thinking this way.  It's not, I believe, that.  it's not clarity of thinking.  You know, they pat themselves on the back.  If they had let the markets crash further in first, back after the crash in 2000 to 2003, if Alan Greenspan hadn't lowered rates, we would have had a healthy recovery with no out-of-control bubbles coming out of it.  The real estate bubble was caused by his reaction, the Federal Reserve's reaction to this crash.  And then we had the global financial crisis, and this manipulation of the three-month and the creation of $3.2 trillion worth of currency, and when they lowered this interest rate, that lowers the interest rates at the banks.  And so the $3.2 trillion they created created this stock market bubble.  And the low interest rates that they did here created the bubble that is currently happening in real estate.  And so they've warped the economy even further.  And the thing is, right now, they're patting themselves on the back saying, good job, this worked.  They're not questioning themselves saying, Why can't we end our manipulation?  How do we stop this?  No, they're having meetings every month trying to figure out what's next, the best path to the next crisis.  So they're getting prepared for some crisis.  I have a feeling now that it's not going to come until after the elections.  Maybe I'm wrong, though.  I have no idea.  I just know that what they have done, this thing where they can't continue raising rates to a comfortable level for them, this proves that they don't have the ultimate power.  If they raise rates any more than they are, they'll pull the two-year up above the 10-year.  The markets will panic and we'll have a crash that the Federal Reserve will have caused.  They haven't caused anything yet, but the results, whatever happens, you can definitely blame the Fed for the results.  Thank you very much for listening.
