So Joe Rogan comes on and he starts talking about Alex Jones because Alex Jones has taken a lot of little pot shots at Joe Rogan over the course of a little while.  And I've seen them because it's something that people are interested in and people are obviously always trying to foment discord between the different parties and everyone understands that.  So Joe Rogan finally got pressured into doing some kind of response, and it was a very, like, you know, I still love Alex as a friend.  We've been friends for 20 years, and, you know, but, I mean, the Sandy Hook stuff was fucked up, and I feel like he did misrepresent that to me when I had him on the show.  And, you know, I feel like he is in a bad place right now, and that, you know, he's acting weird even for him.  Yeah.  Joe kind of talks about Alex Jones in a way that I don't perceive Alex Jones because the narrative Joe's kind of presenting is.  Alex Jones used to be so much more reasonable and sensible and all this stuff.  And he was this real like cool guy.  And he actually defended him to me in person when I was on his show.  And I was kind of even rolling my eyes at it then.  But Alex has turned lately, and now he's become twisted, and he's become way too dishonest and all this stuff, and he needs to stop lying. ",
