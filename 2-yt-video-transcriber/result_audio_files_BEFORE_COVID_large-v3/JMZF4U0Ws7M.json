            "text": "Good Rising Brethren, this is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, give all praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehawah Shai, I pray that the Most High blesses this lesson today, gives more knowledge and understanding of the events of the past, in order to understand the events that are currently happening on the Earth, so that we may get a much better understanding of the things that are assumed, to come on the earth.  One of the sisters on the channel shared this video and I wanted to bring it to you guys because there's a lot of great information in this video.  I'll put it into the link in the description box.  I'm only going to talk about a couple of minutes of it.  I might do a couple of other videos on it because he really breaks down the fact that the Bible The King James Version has been tainted and skewed, and many of the books have been hidden.  He actually goes into 2 Esdras and chapter 14, talking about the 94 books that were produced and how the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church have worked together to pretty much continue the lie.  And we're just going to listen to about three minutes.  We're going to start around the two-minute mark because many of the things that he's saying is just confirming the things that the Holy Spirit has given me to show you.  And this is like one of their \u2013 he seems like a very learned individual.  And it shows you how in Joel 2, how the Most High said that he would release the spirits to make people tell the truth.  He'll be releasing his spirit on all men.  And he's releasing his spirit on these people also to tell the truth.  They're letting people know how they've been lied to, how the Bible has been skewed to give their doctrine, how the Pharisees have added rules that were never intended for our people to have to follow in order to try to get them to earn their way into paradise.  I said the whole video was actually really very eyeopening and I definitely wanted to share this with you.  So what I'll probably do is hold on real fast.  Um, what I'll probably end up doing, I'm trying to get this on again, is playing a little bit of the video, stopping and kind of talk about a couple of parts of it.  But like I said, we're looking at this about a two to three minute version of a part of this here.  Hold on.  I'm trying to see who, was a young lady who shared this with us.  I was in the last video and she shared this.  I'm looking for her.  I can't seem to find her right now.  But the information here was so powerful that I definitely wanted to share.  I think everyone here should definitely take a look at it because it pretty much goes right in hand with all these other books being released here at the end.  Oh, okay.  I want to say this was Anne-Marie Nissen-Strange.  It was actually from an older video.  It was one about the Vatican secret archives.  She actually put this, this was actually a comment she put on the video I made called the Vatican just released secret documents from their secret archives.  So it's actually an older video, but she just put this up about an hour ago.  So if you look for that video, the Vatican just released documents from their secret archives.  She just put the comment up maybe an hour ago.  And you'll see her.  It says the title of this is Major Errors Found in King James Version in Every English Bible.  Second Ezra's Rejection of Inspiration.  And you're going to see how they actually just got rid of parts of Second Ezra's.  when they were doing the translation, because they didn't agree with it.  So they just got rid of it.  Like I said, this is the time of 2020 vision.  The Most High is just, like I said, showing everything that they've been doing.  And you see you got all these people.  I've had plenty of conversations with people saying, you know, well, I only listen to the King James Version Bible.  That's all that I'm going to look at, and that's all I'm going to, you know, accept.  And this guy's showing you how even the King James Version Bible has been corrupted.  So you can't just rely on one book, especially one where they have an agenda and they ended up just skewing the book to fit their agenda.  He even talks about the Messiah and how the Messiah was actually mentioned in the Old Testament.  And they just took a lot of those books and skewed the way that they translated them in order to make it seem like the Messiah was never talked about in the Old Testament.  So we still have a lot of people talking about how I don't believe in Messiah and Messiah and this and that.  Well, the Bible has been written in a way to make you think that way.  And he talks about that in this book as well.  But let's continue.  Let's go ahead and listen to a little bit of what he has to say here. ",

The sixth vision is of a man representing the Messiah who breathes fire on a crowd that is attacking him.  This man then turns to another peaceful multitude which accepts him.  Finally, there is a vision of the restoration of Scripture.  God appears to Ezra in a bush and commands him to restore the law.  Ezra gathers five scribes and begins to dictate.  After 40 days he has produced 94 books.  The 24 books of the Hebrew Bible and 70 secret works which he is not to reveal to the masses.  This vision is omitted in the Latin translation of the text. ",

If they're omitting things like this, what other things do you think they've been omitting?  Them omitting information, hiding information is nothing new.  As soon as they got here to the Americas, what did they do?  Supposedly they burned all of our records.  And I'm sure they kept many of them for themselves and they hide them and lock them up in the Vatican archives.  So they've been complicit with just hiding information, hiding the truth, hiding who we are, hiding everything.  So that now at the end, the vast majority of the world has no idea where we are in biblical prophecy.  They have no idea who we are.  They have no idea who they are.  Let's continue. ",

Again, remember, there's only two churches, the Church of the Most High and the Church of Cain, the Church of Satan.  Satan's church is hell-bent on hiding information because that was all part of the covenant that Cain made with Satan.

Well, actually, that's the Protestant view of how to look at the Old Testament.  If you look at the Old Testament from the Jewish standpoint, there's 24 books.  Okay, right here, the Hebrew Tanakh, 24 books.  And it says the wicked and the righteous will accept these 24 books, but the other 70 won't be accepted by the wicked, but only the righteous will be able to accept the 70 other books. ",

See, I mean, it's all coming out and it's all becoming very, very plain.  The understanding that the Most High is bringing out is absolutely amazing at this time.  And now we understand why when I started to read from many different books, there was always so much pushback because this is something that the Church of Cain has been working to hide for hundreds and hundreds of years.  And now that the multi is starting to reveal this information again to his people, to the righteous, they know that their time is up. ",

I mean, it's all prophecy that was actually talked about over here as well.  in the Book of More that is also coming to a head.  It's being brought out to the world at this point.  And it's the wicked who are actually responsible for this.  Just like I said in 1 Nephi 13, what's going to happen?  That the wicked and the wicked church that was going to grow up out of the land of the Gentiles was going to do these kinds of wicked things, hiding information, taking away the plain things so that people could get a correct understanding.  When they left the hand of the Israelites, the books were intact and they were plain and people could understand them.  Once they went into the church, the church was going to skew things, take things out.  And we still have people even supposed Hebrews today who are still following, who are still pushing this whole doctrine of only reading this one book.  Everything in this book is pure.  There's nothing wrong with this book.  This guy right here is also a very learned individual.  I'm sure most I put a spirit on him to make this video to tell the truth. ",

You know, these books are for prophecy and for understanding Scripture in the end times.  But, you know, it's kind of funny how most prophecy teachers don't know anything about this.  They seem to know a lot.  They seem to know everything else, though.  They can tell you who this is in prophecy, who that is in prophecy, but I was never convinced because they seem to be just grasping at straws and making things up, you know, as they go. ",

            "text": "Is that not what we just had a video talking about a few days ago?  How they can sit there and they can try to break down things that were happening thousands of years ago.  They can explain to you who this is and who that is and where their land is and everything else.  But they can't even tell you who the true Hebrew Israelites are at this point.  They can't tell you who the true sons and daughters of the Most High are today.  Like he just said right here, it's like they're just making stuff up, grasping at straws.  That's exactly what they've been able to do and what they've been doing.  And our people have been conditioned to never even question anything that they say.  But as the Most High said, a prophecy was going to happen that the righteous were going to be given these books and they're going to be given understanding and they're going to be able to break these books down and be able to share the truth with the world.  And the whole world, except the Gentiles, are going to come to the Most High and say, you know, our fathers have inherited lies.  In Jeremiah 16.  And you're seeing this prophecy coming to life right before your eyes.  I'm going to definitely probably do a couple more videos on this subject alone.  Because he actually has a lot of information, you know, sparse out through the video.  But I don't want to make this video too long.  So I want to be able to just get this out real fast.  to give you guys an opportunity to watch the video.  And then as we go into it, you guys can just put some of your opinions, some of the things that you've learned in the description box.  Bring some of that information knowledge that you guys have, put it in the description box so that others may learn the truth about how the Bible has been manipulated.  how they have interjected their own beliefs into our scriptures by changing up things.  He talks about the vowels and how the vowels, when they actually started putting vowels in, it started to change the meanings of many things.  He breaks it down really well, so I will definitely leave the link in the description box so you can check this out on your own.  I thank that sister for actually sharing this video because it's very eye-opening information.  And as you can see, the Most High is also putting the Spirit on the Gentiles to tell the truth.  He's put, you know, and we don't know.  He might be a Gentile.  He might not be.  We're not sure.  But he's putting the spirit on many people to tell the truth.  This truth is now coming from all angles, from many different people, because the spirit has been released to tell the truth.  And like he said, you need these other books in order to understand the book of Revelation.  He said they didn't want to.  Well, I'll talk about that later, but later on another video.  But.  As you can see, biblical prophecy is being fulfilled right before your eyes with all these other books and all this information coming together.  And it's a beautiful time to be alive.  All praises to the Most High, Yahuwah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yahushua.  Shalom. ",
