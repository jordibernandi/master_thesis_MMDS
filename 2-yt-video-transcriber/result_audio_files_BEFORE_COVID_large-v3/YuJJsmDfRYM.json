The book of Hebrews chapter 7 verse 14.  For it is evident.  For it is evident.  It is evident.  That means what?  It's crystal clear.  We got a shadow of a doubt.  Come on.  That our Lord sprang out of Judah.  Christ came out of the tribe of Judah.  Give me Jeremiah 14 verse 2.  What is Judah?  What is the tribe of Judah?  The so-called Negro.  But what is there?  What is Judah?  What does Judah mean?  Worship, right?  Judah is the worship.  The Mosiah is praying.  God is praying.  Yes, yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Read Jeremiah 14 verse 2.  The book of Jeremiah chapter 14 verse 2.  Come on.  Judah mourned.  What?  Judah mourned.  So the Bible says that the real Jews are mourned.  Okay.  The last time, the first fire.  okay we occupy what ninety-seven percent of the jail system like.  we're the only one that do crimes right.  okay read that again judah and the gangster of language.  and what?  and the gangster of language?  our gates represent our leadership.  we don't have any true leadership.  okay we got fake leaders like crepe low dollar.  okay td snakes.  okay i'll shop them.

This is the acceptable year of Christ.  He's coming to redeem his people.  It's been so long.  What?  We are looking at what?  400 years, right?  Everybody's talking about 400 years, but what's the end of the 400 years?  What does that mean?  That we are going back to rulership.  That Christ, the so-called black man, is going to sit on the throne.  okay and we're going to be as people again.  okay read that luke chapter 1 verse 68. come on.  blessed be the lord god of israel.  bless me who the lord god of israel?  let's be the lord god of israel because a lot of people call on god's name right but is he a god to all people?  is he the god to our people?  Did we accept him?  Read it again.  Let's do what the Bible says.  We're in a new text for now, right?  Read.  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.  Read it again.  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.  Read it one more time.  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.  Go on through the Bible.  You see, the Bible says the God of Israel.  But guess what?  But there's more words to that, right?  There's more.  Come on.  Come on.  For he has visited and redeemed his people.  Now, he has visited and redeemed his people.  So the word his, H-I-S, what does that mean?  his possess the pronoun okay give me matthews 1 and 21. and she who's that she married?  come on read that again and she shall bring forth a son Christ, come on, come on, come on.  And thou shalt call his name Jesus.  It says Jesus, but there's no jig in the Hebrew, so I will say Yeshua.  Okay, come on.  For he shall save his people.  He shall do what?  Save his people.  He shall save his people.  So Christ is a Jew, so quite naturally his people are what?  The twelve tribes of Israel.  Yes.  Okay, so he's not, he didn't come back to save everybody like they teach him.  But let me ask you a question.  According to your knowledge.  But the ones that believe.  According to your knowledge, how many worlds were created?  How many worlds?  How many worlds were created?  How many worlds?  What does it say?  Give me John 3.16.  Give me.  John 3.16.  Because this verse right here, right, is the most misinterpreted.  Okay.  Okay.  verse in the whole Bible.  Okay, by a lot of Christians in the church.  Read that.  The book of John, chapter 3, verse 16.  Read all the way through.  Read how it's written.  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.  Did you hear that, sis?  Read that again.  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.  What world is that Christ is talking about right there?  What world is he talking about?  Is he talking about everybody?  how many words were created?  how many words were created?  to your knowledge?  right one word right.  give me that you know what i want.  hebrews chapter one verse one in the new testament.  right great god who at sun dry times and in diverse matters spake and time passed unto the fathers by the prophets by the prophets.  come on having these last days.  and what days are we right now in the?  we're in the last days right.  come on spoken unto us by his son spoken by his son of yahushua.  come on whom he have appointed heir of all things.  he's the air of all things.  come on by whom also.  he made the world.  maybe what the world spell it w-o-r-l-d-s.  so if you put an s in the back of anything what does that make it?  it makes it plural.  so now what world was christ talking about in john 3 16. you may have said 45 and 17.  You may say in 45 verse 16, 17.  Before every great kingdom was destroyed, what did the most high God do?  He set forth for service the prophets of the fourth one generation.  Okay?  We're in a mess set up in these last days to tell our people to repent and come back to the laws and the commandments in this Bible.  Okay?  America's going to be destroyed.  But what are we going to do?  How are we going to be saved?  They're not going to let us get on their American airline, their United Airplane.  Okay?  So Christ, in the holy ages, they're going to beam us up in the so-called UFOs.  We know them as what?  IFOs, Identified Find Objects.  Those are the chariots that I was answering this thing about.  Swing low, sweet chariot, come in the carrier's home.

World without end.  To find a what?  World without end.  So the Bible says Israel is that world without end.  That's the world talked about in John 3.16.  That's right.  That's right.  Where in the world are they talking about?  Okay.  Give me 1 John 2 and 15.  Okay.  I'm going to tell you that your preacher is not teaching correctness.  You're standing before the true service of God.  That's right.  I'm telling you, your pastor is lying to you.  why would you say that i didn't say anything about no pastor?  where do you go to church don't you?  yeah okay i'll read the word for myself but you're going to.  because you just read that lack of knowledge people perish.  so we have to know to study ourselves exactly.  but the both sides the both sides the ones that hold on the ones that sitting there just listening to what a man is saying them the ones that's being.  but let me show you what the most.  i got the book of jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 and i will give you pastors and i will give you pastors according to my heart according to his mind.  god's mind come on which shall feed you?  which shall what feed you?  which shall what feed you?  that's gonna feed you.  come on with knowledge with what with knowledge with knowledge.  come on and understand.  that's why we're here sis.

We're enlightening our people to come back to the laws and the commandments of the Lord our God.  To repent, to come back to the commandments.  Okay?  Forget about what those... Give me Jeremiah 23 and 1 and give me that understanding.  Jeremiah 23 verse 1. i'm enjoying y'all but i'm glad.  that's why we're here.  i'm enjoying.  i'm enjoying.  i'm in joy that you enjoy right.  there's no me without you sis.  okay read that.  jmi 23 verse 1. whoa be unto the pastor.  so the bible says one means what destruction said.  read that again whoa be unto the pastors that destroyed and scattered the sheep of my pastor people have been scattered.  they call themselves west indian caribbean afro-american.  listen if i was in light of 10 so-called black women right and ask each and every one of them what's your nationality?  i bet y'all get 10 different answers.  yeah because they're not dead.  that's why we are destroyed for lack of knowledge.  so we just acknowledge where we're from.  so let me tell you so i'm not from the west indies i'm from america.  so let me ask you a question If you were to go have a child right now in China, who would they call that child?  No, they're not.  They're going to call a Negro.  That's right.  Anywhere we go, they call us the N-word.  Oh, really?  Okay?  What if you're going to have a child?

It may not be today.  on the first day of the second month and they declared their pedigree after their family come on by the house of their father the house of who?  the house of their father their mother the house of their father from the house of their father.  okay that's why when a woman gets married what she takes the husband's last name.  okay but in this society it teaches all this folly Okay?  But now it's a new day, sis.  It's a new day.  So what y'all need to do is start getting our black men to understand where they from and what their responsibilities are.  That's why we're here, sis.  Because you got a lot of black men.  that's not taking on their responsibilities.  That's why we're here, sis.
