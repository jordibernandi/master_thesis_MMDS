            "text": "Just with this quick update, Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I want to come to you because as you know, whatever revelation, vision, dreams or whatever the Lord gives to me, I do not keep it to myself.  I always come and I share with the body of Christ and, you know, it's up to the individual to take it to the Lord and pray to see where it fits them.  But I wanna come to you today brothers and sisters because I had a vision about Beyonce.  Now this is the third, yes, this is the third time I'm seeing this woman turned up into my vision.  I don't even watch her.  Don't know the latest about her.  Don't read any magazine about Beyonce.  Nothing.  Zilt.  Stay away.  Me personally, I stay away from secular.  From the secular world really.  I don't get involved and read stuff about them.  So I was quite taken back that the Lord gave me this vision for the third time about Beyonce.  In this vision, brothers and sisters, it was like... I was sitting outside with lots of table and across me was Beyonce.  And I'm going to try and describe her to the best of my ability.  And as I said, sitting across myself was Beyonce.  Brothers and sisters, as I begun to look at Beyonce and she was looking back at me, she had two face, half side, two face.  Let me get this right.  So this is my right, so that's her left.  So the left side of her face, brothers and sisters, the left side, completely, completely and utterly demonic.  Nothing human there, even though you can tell that it was her.  I mean, this side looks manly.  It was fierce.  It was angry.  Just horrible.  I'm sorry.  I have to say it as it is.  The left side of her face was totally horrible.  And she split in half.  So on the left side of this horrible demonic face on Beyonce, I saw what appears to be the Baphomet sign.  You know, the goat sign with the two arms.  That was on the left side of her breast area.  Then on the left side of her head, there was no hair there.  The hair is completely gone.  Can't remember what was there instead, but there was no hair on Beyonce's head on the left side of her.  Then I began to look on the right side of her face.  Brothers and sisters, I am telling you this side of Beyonce's face, the right side that I was looking at, completely completely human.  But that side of the human was dying.  When I began to look at her and observe what was going on, this girl was dying.  I mean, the demonic side, you can tell that the demonic side totally, like totally, completely taking over Beyonc\u00e9.  And the demonic side was trying to intimidate me because as I was looking at Beyonce and she was looking back, both face was looking back at me, brothers and sisters.  But the demonic side, the left hand side was trying to intimidate me with the fierce look, the angry look, just being, you know, very ghostly.  In nature, that's how I can put it really, but I wasn't scared, not even a tip scared.  So the Lord began to speak to me and just said, ignore that side of her face, concentrate on the human side.  So I said, okay, Lord.  And as God spoke that to me, brothers and sisters, and I was looking at Beyonce, the human side, that side of her was completely dying and I could tell and I could see it.  and on the human side she had braided hair.  so her hair was braided but it was also knotted.  we call it bantu knots or shiny bump or something like that but it's basically when you braid the hair and then you wrap it around you know in different sections.  so her hair was at different bumps but it was braided but inside the bantu knots was pins and needle.  brothers and sisters when you look at those bantu knots on the human side of her it was literally big thick pins running through the hair ready to pierce the scalp.  and as i said as the lord said to me do not concentrate on the demonic side observe the human side.  brothers and sisters as the lord said that to me beyonce spoke the human side, not the demonic side.  The human side of Beyonce spoke and she says, I am so tired.  And I said to her, you're tired?  She said, yes.  She said, I'm very, very tired.  She said, I want to sleep.  and I cannot sleep.  The only time I can sleep is on this side, which is the demonic side she was pointing to.  She said, that's the only time I can sleep.  And even though I sleep on this, she didn't call it demonic side.  She said, even if I sleep on this side, I still cannot get any rest.  So I said to her, what's the problem?  Why can't you sleep?  She said, because of the knots in my head.  And I said, just pull them out.  She said, if I sleep on it, the pain will run right through my scalp and I'm not allowed.  She said, I am not allowed to sleep on this side, only this side, which is the demonic side she was pointing to.  So I said to her, why don't you just pull the knots out and get some rest?  She said, if I ever pull the knots out, they will kill me.  This is what the human side of Beyonce was saying to me.  She said, I cannot do that.  She said, once I pull it out, she said, that is it for me.  She said, they're going to kill me.  So I said to her, well, you're tired.  You need to sleep.  You need to get rid of the knots.  That's what I was saying to her.  Brothers and sisters, Beyonce, this is the human side because I'm not dealing with the demonic side.  Beyonce began to pull out these, we call them Bantu knots.  She began to pull out these knots and take out the pins.  Take out all the pins and pull out all these knots.  And then her braids just fell out.  And then she said to me, I know I'm going to die.  She said, I know I'm going to die, but I need rest.  I am too tired.  She said, I have not slept in ages and I need to go to sleep.  I need to rest.  And as soon as, brothers and sisters, as soon as Beyonce pulled out that side of her hair, her face brightens up and that demonic side begun to disappear.  And when it totally, that demonic side, when it totally disappeared in front of my eyes, I don't know who it was, but somebody threw her a burka.  a burka is like what the asian the muslim women wear that covers their face and you only can see the eyes.  somebody threw her.  i don't know who threw her but somebody threw her a white burka with a white muslim long dress and she puts it on.  and she said i have to put this on because if i don't put this on they're going to find me and i have to hide.  And she said to me, I feel so free.  I need to go to the shops.  I want to go to the shops because I'm in this burqa.  Nobody can see me, so I can do what I want to do.  So she got up from where she was sitting, brothers and sisters, and this was really strange because she was wearing white.  Her burka and her long dress was all white.  And she got up from where she was sitting and I was sitting down still watching her.  And she got up from where she was sitting, all smiling, you know, and eyes brightened up and everything.  And she said to me, she's going to go to the shop.  So she began to walk.  And when she walked off, brothers and sisters, there was a group of people, men and women, dressed in white as well.  Don't know where they came from.  Dressed in white.  And I heard when they say, let us follow this woman, which is Beyonce.  Because I don't think they knew who she was.  Because she was in this burqa all dressed up.  And they said, let us follow this woman.  So she had a little crowd following her.  Sat still in my chair watching all this going on.  Who turned up in full white?  Jay-Z.  jay-z turned up brothers and sisters full white.  first question was where is beyonce?  and i didn't answer him.  i just kept looking.  but in my spirit i could feel oh i could feel this fierce anger coming from jay-z because now beyonce as a letdown or bantu knots took out the pins and she's not supposed to do that because she said if she does that she does that she's gonna die.  she knew she's gonna die and i felt in my spirit i was picking up jay-z's emotion basically in the emotion jay-z is going to kill her.  And I have to tell you what I pick up from Jay-Z because he was saying, where's Beyonce?  Have you seen Beyonce?  I didn't answer.  I just sat in my chair, brothers and sisters, just looking at what's going on.  He realized that Beyonce was in the crowd.  I don't know how he realized that.  And he started walking in the crowd to get her, Beyonce.  Then she started running.  And as she started to run, she went to this place.  And my spirit followed her.  And I was there.  By the time she got to this place, I was there.  She ran up to this place.  There were a group of people.  I cannot tell if they were Christians or what.  I'm not sure about that.  But she went up to this group of people.  And she went to an elder.  And she said to the guy, can you please hide me?  Because they're going to kill me.  And they put her in like, I don't know.  It was like an underground.  It was like an underground box.  They opened it up.  They knew she was coming.  And they opened it up, put her down in there and tell her to hide and be quiet.  Brothers and sisters, as I was there in this place, I saw Jay-Z with a whole group.  I'm going to call them demonic because these are not humans that I saw coming to get Beyonc\u00e9.  jay-z came to the elder and said where is beyonce and the elder were like you know.  he lied basically and said i don't know where beyonce is.  there's no beyonce.  who is beyonce sort of thing.  and jay-z was saying i know she's here and i'm not leaving until i find her and brothers and sisters jay-z and these demonic entity.  they were men and women and they were all dressed in black black and white but Jay-Z was in full white and these demonic entities that look like human.  I know they weren't human because I picked them up in my spirit searching the place for Beyonce.  they searched and brothers they found her.  yep they found Beyonce Jay-Z found Beyonce and then the vision just ended.  I just came out the vision And when I came out the vision, I said, my Lord, I wasn't expecting a Beyonce vision like this.  I've seen her three, two, this is the third time I've seen Beyonce in my vision.  So I thought to myself, I'm going to share it.  with the body of christ because i think it's very very important.  sometimes we do not understand when you're not connected to the spiritual realm.  you cannot understand what's going on because the spiritual realm is very very busy.  it's not just one thing that's going on it's thousands Thousands of different situations.  And it's just where the Lord chooses to bring you in vision.  If he chooses to bring you to see Obama or Trump or World War III or nuclear weapons, it's up to the Lord.  And obviously, this that I saw about Beyonce is going on in the spiritual realm.  And the Lord allowed me to see this about Beyonce.  Now, I don't like to interpret my dreams on visions because they're pretty straightforward, to be honest with you.  When you listen to my visions and dreams, they're pretty straightforward.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  I think that something is desperately wrong.  Prepare your hearts and your mind, those of you who are Beyonce fans, because I know that some of you are still Christians, but you still listen to her music and you still love her and everything like that.  I said her because I know that some of you are going to comment and say, oh, It's not her, it's a man.  The reason why people say that Beyonce is a man is because of the demonic entity that's in her.  It manifests as a man because that is what I saw around the table with the split face.  That side was a man, but it looks like Beyonce, complete man, complete man.  So I can understand why people say, you know, she's a transvestite and this and that.  But, yeah, it is what it is, brothers and sisters.  You know, we're in the end times.  We know the story of these celebrities and how they get rich and famous.  They do sell the soul to Satan, unfortunately.  They do.  And some of them want to get out.  But... you know it is what it is.  so i just wanted to come and share this with you.  so god eternally bless you.  i love you all and i will see you soon someday in glory in jesus precious holy name.  amen and amen.  amen blessings amen.
