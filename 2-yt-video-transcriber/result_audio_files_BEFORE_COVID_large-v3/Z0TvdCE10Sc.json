You can stand up over there.  I had like two hours worth of getting my salad tossed, and I can't sit.  You know what I'm saying?  So is it okay if I stand here and wait for the bus?  Stand over there where you were supposed to be.  But then I can't film through there while I'm waiting. ",

We don't want to interfere with you.  Get away from us.  You know, that kind of thing.  Then he interjected the whole safety thing, and my first response to him was, where do you want us to stand?  Yeah, it's got to be reasonable.  Can't be across the street.  Or, you know, where it's like, okay, go stand over there where you can't film.  There's plenty of reasonable places to stand.
