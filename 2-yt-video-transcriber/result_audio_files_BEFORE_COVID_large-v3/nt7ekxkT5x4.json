Remember how we lived like we had nothing to lose?  The crazy nights and matching tattoos?  I miss those days.  I'm sorry.  I made every excuse because I didn't want to see your casket.  I had just buried two friends and I didn't want to believe that you were gone too.  You know, sometimes I question if I want to live this life.  But I owe it to you.  To search for the kind of greatness you had.  I just wish you knew that you're in my heart and never forgotten. ",
