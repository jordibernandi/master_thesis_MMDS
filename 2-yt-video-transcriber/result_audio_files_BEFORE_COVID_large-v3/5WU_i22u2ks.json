It because the court system obviously takes so far much longer than any other way to speedily resolve the dispute.  But the other striking thing to me about it today was apparently during the negotiations, which of course continued on apparently through last evening, The Democrats were prepared to offer that if the Attorney General of the Department of Justice agreed to go to court to seek an order to release the grand jury material, they would drop the contempt proceeding.  So, frankly, to me, that tells you all you really need to know.  They're not really serious about contempt.  Contempt was just a means of leverage in order to gain access to more of the report, which they know they can't.  Because the feckless Jerry Nadler, a profiling cowardice, wants to have it both ways.  He doesn't want to actually say that what they're doing is an impeachment proceeding.

You said, I think you said 92% was not redacted.  Actually, in the obstruction part, which everyone cares about, only 2% was not redacted.  Interesting.  And today, Chairman Nadler says, well, we really don't mean 6E material.  Well, of course they meant 6E material.
