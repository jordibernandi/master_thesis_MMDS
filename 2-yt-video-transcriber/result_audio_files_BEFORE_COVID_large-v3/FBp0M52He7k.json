            "text": "Vlog pro tip.  If you make a motion to dismiss and it's 45 pages long, chances are it's not going to be granted.  For those of you who don't know me, I am Viva Frye, a Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  I do these things called vlogs, V-L-A-W-G-S, where we break down and analyze something that's going on in the legal world in terms that can be understood by lawyers and non-lawyers alike.  In case you missed my breakdown of the Alex Jones deposition, go check that video out.  I'll link it right here.  And in case you missed my original breakdown of the Nicholas Sandman lawsuit against NBC Universal, check it out.  I'll link it right here.  Starting to rain.  That's better.  A subscriber in the comment section of my breakdown of Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit against NBC Universal asked what I thought of the Washington Post's motion to dismiss Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit against the Washington Post.  Now for those of you who don't know, Nicholas Sandman is that now infamous Covington Catholic high school kid wearing the MAGA hat who was smirking in the face of a Native American.  The reporting or the misreporting went totally viral.  Nicholas Salmon was depicted as the face of evil in America, the face of racial hatred in America.  Major mainstream news outlets ran with stories that proved to be totally inaccurate, and they ran with these stories for upwards of a week.  Some of the outlets issued retractions and corrections, others like NBC Universal did not.  After all the dust settled, it became totally clear that the reporting on Nicholas Salmon was totally inaccurate, and that the reputation of this 16-year-old high school kid was basically totally dragged through the mud.  He and his family ended up getting death threats as a result of the initial reporting which portrayed him as having disrespected a Native American elder, having shouted ethnic and hateful slurs at people.  Fast forward a few months, Nicholas Sandman is suing CNN, Washington Post, NBC Universal in particular for what is alleged to be defamatory reporting.  I broke down in extensive detail Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit against NBC Universal, which, by and large, is probably very much identical to the lawsuit against Washington Post and CNN.  The fact pattern is extremely similar, if not identical, mutatis mutandis, meaning that substitute the articles that were written and the tweets that were retweeted, and you basically have the same story against CNN, Washington Post, and NBC Universal.  With the notable exception that NBC Universal never actually issued a retraction or correction, and still has some of the original, inaccurate reporting up online for all to see.  Another noticeable difference... Okay, stop raining.  Another notable difference is that around April 11th, 2019, the Washington Post filed a motion to dismiss of Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit.  For those of you who don't know what a motion to dismiss is, it's basically the dismissal of the suit without getting to trial.  It's the dismissal of a suit at a preliminary stage without full evidence having been made.  Now, I am a Quebec lawyer, so I can only really speak to Quebec procedure, but I assume that this type of procedure is relatively the same in other jurisdictions.  Meaning that you can have a preliminary dismissal of a suit on a motion to dismiss on two bases.  One of which is that even if you take all of the allegations for granted in the original motion, in the original lawsuit, it is ill-founded in law and there is no reasonable chance of success.  The classic example would be something relating to the statute of limitations, or the prescription, or the time bar, the period after which a lawsuit can no longer be instituted.  In Quebec, for example, one has three years from the cause of action to institute proceedings.  So let's just take an example that someone punched me in the face and broke my nose, and I want to sue them civilly.  I have three years from the date that they punched me in the face and broke my nose to sue them for damages.  So, hypothetically, if someone had done this to me in 2010, and I sue them in 2019, and I say, on or about whatever date in 2010, Mr.  X punched me in the face, causing me all sorts of damages and pain and suffering,  etc.,  etc.,  therefore I'm suing him for $10,000 in damages, well, Mr.  X, what was the letter of the person?  Whatever, Mr.  X can make a motion to dismiss on the basis that even if we take everything for granted, even if we assume everything alleged in my lawsuit is true, too bad, too late, you waited nine years when your limitation period was three years to institute the lawsuit.  Another type of motion to dismiss that you can have is that after examination or depositions or whatever you call them in your jurisdiction, it is apparent that the lawsuit is totally frivolous or malicious in nature.  For example, somebody sues me and in deposition or in my examination of them it is revealed that they are only taking this lawsuit in an attempt to bankrupt me because they hate me and they want to drag my name through the mud, then I can make a motion to dismiss on the basis that subsequent to the examination it is apparent that the lawsuit is frivolous, ill-founded, or malicious in nature.  The Washington Post has filed a motion to dismiss that is 45 pages long.  45 pages long.  Now there is a principle in economics called Parkinson's Law, which goes to the effect that the time it takes to accomplish a task will expand to fit the time one has to accomplish that task.  There should be a principle in law called the Motion to Dismiss Law, which should go to the effect that the longer a motion to dismiss is, the less likely it is to be granted by a judge.  And the reason is very simple.  Seeking and obtaining the dismissal of suit prior to full evidence being made at a trial is the ultimate sanction.  It deprives the plaintiff of their day in court.  And it can only be granted in the most exceptional and obvious of circumstances.  So when Washington Post comes in with a 45-page motion to dismiss, quite clearly, on its face, the matter is not sufficiently simple that it can be dismissed at a preliminary stage.  But let's go over Washington Post's motion to dismiss.  Hello, Dougie.  What do you want?  You want to read?  Oh, yeah.  You want to read some lawsuits?  Let's do this.  Preliminary comment.  I don't know what the rules of practice are in this particular jurisdiction, but in my previous analysis of Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit against NBC Universal, I illustrated the fact that it is very useful to have each paragraph numbered, the lawsuit in general broken down into chapters, for ease of reference, so that a lawyer can refer the judge to paragraph 45, paragraph 57.  Looking at the Washington Post motion to dismiss, I don't know if the rules of practice require this, or if this is not drafted in accordance with the generally accepted rules of practice, but the paragraphs are not numbered.  So you have pages, but let's just say that the lawyer who's going to plead this thing is going to want to refer the judge to a given paragraph.  What are they going to have to say?  Which paragraph of page three are you referring to?  The second full paragraph of page five?  When each paragraph is not numbered, it becomes very difficult to refer to it in pleading.  Okay, you've got to get down.  And if we read through the Washington Post motion to dismiss, what we are basically reading is written pleadings as though we have already gotten to trial on the merits and all the evidence has been adduced.  Let's just read this, for example.  Bullet one of page five and the following paragraphs.  The Post published its initial news report online at 4.22 p.m.  on Saturday, January 19th under the headline, It Was Getting Ugly.  Native American drummer speaks on the MAGA hat wearing teens who surrounded him.  And then they go straight into pleading the merits.  The complaint does not challenge this description, but rather challenges the accuracy of the account provided by the Native American man, Nathan Phillips.  The allegations in Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit are not facts.  They are mere allegations.  Evidence has not yet been adduced to prove those allegations, and Washington Post has not adduced evidence to disprove the allegations in Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit.  But what we have here is basically an argument that seeks the dismissal of the lawsuit as though what the Washington Post is saying is true and what Nicholas Sandman is saying is false.  But no evidence has been made yet.  A lot of trains today.  On February 14th, 2019, nearly a month after its initial reporting, the Post received from Plaintiff's Council a demand that it retract and remove from its website the articles and social media posts that are the subject of this complaint.  In response, the Post published a series of editor's notes and uploaded online articles to provide additional information that was not available at the time of the initial publications.  This is going to be either proven or disproven at trial, but it can't serve as the basis of a motion to dismiss.  Nothing in here has been proven in front of a judge.  There are only allegations of Nicholas Sandman.  There is no evidence yet.  Oh my goodness, I have to go pick up the kid.  Okay, we'll finish this up a little later.  15 hours later.  So in their pleadings, Washington Post then goes on to describe the two types of defamation in the state of Kentucky.  Last full paragraph of page 15, because the paragraphs are not numbered.  In Kentucky, there are two classes of defamation, per se and per quad.  In the former class, damages are presumed, and the person defamed may recover without allegation or proof of special damages.  All other claims are for defamation per quad.  Defamation per quad includes words reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning as well as innocent one and which may be defamatory by reason of their imputation or by reason of certain extrinsic facts.  We may have to carry this vlog on a little later.  What is this?  Fishing rod.  This is my good fishing rod.  No, wait a minute.  These are two... I like this.  Yeah.  Okay, let's go.  Oh, we'll be back.  The Post's overall coverage did not defame Plaintiff.  It seems that that's something the judgment on the merits would decide, not on a summary motion to dismiss.  But let's read on.  The complaint challenges six post articles, more precisely, slightly varying versions of two news articles and two separate online commentaries in a single cause of action.  Although it is more common for a complaint to state separate claims for each separate publication, the grouping of these articles together fairly reflects the fact that this whole story was an emerging one.  No one could possibly have understood the initial article as having told the whole story.  That's a nice opinion.  What do you want?  Oh gosh, what's on your face?  What is on your face?  Show the camera.  Show the camera.  That is tremendously disgusting.  These are closing arguments.  These are not allegations in support of a motion to dismiss before evidence has been adjudicated and before the parties have had a chance to be heard.  Let's keep going and see if this gets any better.  First full paragraph of page 25, the articles reported that, quote, Phillips, 64, said he felt threatened by the teens.  But that is a statement of Phillips' subjective feelings based on the conduct of the teens in general.  It is not a statement of objective fact that this teen had threatened him.  Personal anecdote, I was recently in front of a judge on a party's motion to dismiss.  All that to say, I had no doubt in the race, I was just there to observe the motion to dismiss as presented by the petitioning party.  From the outset, the judge astutely observed that if he had even one lingering question as to the merits of the cause, he was not going to grant a motion to dismiss at a preliminary stage.  Reading through the Washington Post's motion to dismiss, it's not just that.  there are questions.  They are arguing interpretation of allegations that have yet to be made as evidence.  Last paragraph of page 25 reads as follows.  The initial Post news report is no more capable of bearing the other defamatory meanings alleged in the complaint.  According to whom?  We understand that this is Washington Post's position.  We understand that their defense is going to flesh out these arguments in allegations that are going to subsequently have to be proven to a judge on a hearing on the merits.  And the rest of the motion simply goes on to state the case that the Washington Post presumably is going to present in their defense.  First full paragraph of page 35.  Finally, the complaint challenges the headline of the third article, the print version of the initial report.  Marchers accost by boys in MAGA caps draws ire.  A headline must be read together with the article that follows, and this headline adds nothing to the account in the article itself.  To accost someone is to approach and speak to, to confront, usually in a somewhat challenging or defensive way, or to address abruptly, as in a chance meeting, and usually with a certain degree of impetuosity or boldness.  Webster's Dictionary.  A costing may be rude depending on the circumstances, but it is not something that exposes a person to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or that causes him to be shunned or avoided.  That is a nice opinion, but that is a fundamentally subjective interpretation of evidence that has yet to be adduced.  It's nice that the Washington Post thinks they didn't do anything wrong.  We wouldn't expect anything less of them.  But to use that as a basis to seek the summary dismissal of a lawsuit before the plaintiff has their day in court is preposterous.  All right, I can't do this with every page of the motion.  Suffice to say that this motion is nothing but argumentation.  It is nothing but what the defense of the Washington Post is presumably going to be.  And unless there's some ulterior strategic reason... David Fry, hey.  Daddy?  Yeah, what's up?  I left my lunchbox at home.  Okay, I'll bring it.  Okay, thanks.  Snack is at 9.40.  Sorry?  Snack is at 9.40.  That's eight minutes from now, Mila.  I'll see if I can get there in time.  Oh, well.  Okay, bye.  15 minutes later.  All right.  Good shit.  Okay, back to the pleadings.  Where were we?  I forget.  That's right.  I'm not going through this thing page by page.  Second to last full paragraph of page 44.  You see how easy this would be to reference if the paragraphs were just numbered.  The first tweet, which says that Phillips felt like a spirit was walking through me as teens jeered and mocked him, is not of and concerning plaintiff.  First, it refers only to teens.  Second, it must be understood in the context of the LinkedIn news report.  This is all arguments on the merits.  This reads like an argument brief, not a motion to dismiss.  The third tweet includes the quote from the Post's initial report, discussed in Section 2A Supra, in which Philip gave his perspective of the face-to-face account with plaintiffs.  As discussed in that section, the quotation is not actionable because it is substantially true and is not defamatory in any event.  It is substantially true?  Where is the evidence that that fact is, quote, substantially true?  There is no evidence in the file yet, and by plaintiff's account, it wasn't true, it wasn't accurate, and it was defamatory.  This is not a motion to dismiss that takes for granted the veracity of plaintiff's allegations.  This is a motion to dismiss that refutes, contradicts, and argues with plaintiff's version of events.  That's called a trial.  For the foregoing reasons, the complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.  Now, interesting thing, I didn't know at first what with prejudice meant in this context.  It seems that under American law, dismissal with prejudice means that the plaintiff cannot bring a complaint arising from the same cause of action ever again.  It means that the plaintiff cannot sue anew on a similar cause of action.  Basically, this motion to dismiss seeks the premature dismissal before any hearing on the merits, before any witnesses have been heard.  It seeks the dismissal of the suit and the preclusion of the plaintiff from ever suing on the same or similar basis again.  Chances of that happening?  I will eat, uh, what is an edible piece of clothing?  I will eat my torn Tommy John underwear.  How's that?  Sounds like a great collaboration also.  Tommy John.  Let's do a collaboration.  I love Tommy John underwear.  Am I wearing it right now?  I am wearing it right now.  No joke.  Tommy John right there.  I'm wearing pants.  I'm wearing pants, people.  Like, share, subscribe.
