            "text": "Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Thank you, Chairman Powell, for being here.  Earlier this month, two giant banks, SunTrust and BB&T, announced that they intended to merge.  This new too-big-to-fail institution would have about $450 billion in assets and become the sixth largest bank in the United States.  Now, as you know, bank acquisitions and mergers don't go through on their own.  They have to be approved first by the Fed.  So last spring, I wrote you a letter asking for data on the number of merger and acquisition applications received by the Fed and the number that had been approved over the last 10 years.  Chairman Powell, when you answered my letter in May of 2018, how many mergers and acquisition applications for the banks had you received since 2006?  Do you remember? ",

You and the banks get together in the back room and grease the wheels before the merger is announced.  And if you're not going to approve the merger, you tell the bank in advance and then they go figure out something else.  If the public wants a chance to weigh in, they have to wait until you've already made a decision.  No wonder you approved 100% of the merger applications.  Not a single no.  Your approval process itself appears to be a rubber stamp that everything is happening behind closed doors.  So the question I have is about the SunTrust and BB&T merger.

I just have to say, I'll bet that SunTrust and BB&T looked at that 100% merger success rate and saw what everyone else sees.  And that is that the Fed works for big, rich banks that want to get bigger and want to get richer.  And then everyone else pays the price for diminished competition, for worse service, for higher prices, for employee layoffs, for the risk that we have yet another too-big-to-fail bank on our hands.
