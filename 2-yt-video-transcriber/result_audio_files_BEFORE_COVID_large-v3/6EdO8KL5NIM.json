            "text": "I was wrong about MGTOW.  I was completely wrong about MGTOW, and in this video, I'm going to cover the things that I was wrong about.  I did a video like, I don't know, a couple months ago, and I just did kind of my first thoughts on MGTOW, because I had just heard about it.  I don't know how I had just heard about it, but anyway, I'm gonna clear some misconceptions up, because I was wrong, which means a lot of you guys, if you haven't heard of MGTOW, You might have had the wrong impression too.  And yeah, let's get into it.  And just to start, a shout out here to Sandman.  And those of you guys, if you haven't looked into MGTOW, do look into Sandman.  Shout out to Sandman.  First off, Sandman, if you happen to see this, you have a great, clear voice.  Very soothing voice.  very funny, and really understands female nature.  So just a warning to you guys, if you haven't taken any sort of red pill, if you go to Sandman, it will be a shock, and this is what they call about, you know, swallowing the red pill, but if you haven't yet, it's time to, and Sandman is a great resource.  So yeah, there you go, Sandman on YouTube.  The first thing here that I got wrong was I called MGTOW, Men Going Their Own Way, I called it a movement.  And what I've come to understand is MGTOW, it's a lifestyle, it's a philosophy, it's a mindset, it's something that you encompass as a man.  And as a brief rundown, it's a really beautiful mindset because it's the idea that you don't let your life be dictated by what society tells you to do, by propaganda on the fake news, you know what I'm talking about.  You don't let women tell you what to do.  You don't change your life just for women.  You're a man on your mission and you figure out what you want to do in life.  And you go about doing that.  You don't get influenced by outside forces.  You really kind of come to terms with yourself as a man.  And I think that's beautiful.  So that just already should show a lot of people that I have the wrong mindset when I heard of MGTOW.  The MGTOW that you probably hear of, if you don't look into it, is that there are a bunch of guys that got upset about women and they're bitter towards women.  And so they decided to shun women and go their own way.  That is kind of the spin you get on it, on the crap if you don't look into it.  And it's with so many things.  So again, that was totally my bad.  Thank you to some of you guys for calling me out in my last video because it helped me look into it and find out, I mean, not to spoil the surprise, but I've been MGTOW for 12 years and I didn't even know it.  So anyway, let's move on to the second thing I was wrong about here.  And this is actually when I... First go, oh, whoa, I'm MGTOW.  In one of Sandman's videos, and it was one of his earlier videos from four years ago or something, but he described that there's different levels of MGTOW.  So in my naive understanding when I first looked into it, I thought it was, hey, you decide as a man, I'm going to go my own way and just get rid of women.  I'm not going to interact with them.  I'm not going to do anything.  You go your own way and whatever.  I thought it was all or nothing.  I didn't realize that there are levels to MGTOW.  For instance, I date around, so I'm not, I haven't and I'm not looking for any long-term commitment.  I'm not gonna move in with a girl and I'm not gonna get married to a girl.  That's me personally.  So I'm a different level than a guy that decides that he's just like, hey, I'm getting off the grid.  This guy is a step higher up the MGTOW.  I'm not going to be needing support from the government, from this, that, anyone.  I'm going my own way up in a cabin type.  There's different levels to it.  And I love that because... I thought, I don't want to be put in a box like this or that.  So anyway, again, that was a shout out.  So many things, Sandman, Sandman's great.  But so many things.  as I was hearing this, I was like, oh man.  So a lot of you guys watching, you might have... had the MGTOW mindset and not really known it or knew that there was other people that did it.  because, quite honestly, I'm a guy that helps guys text and date better and all that stuff to get the girl.  So I didn't realize... I've been on my whole life basically for like the last decade.  People always like, Oh Adam, when are you going to settle down?  When are you going to settle down?  When are you going to settle down?  I've always been the odd one that wasn't set.  I didn't know that there were other people like this.  So MGTOW cool.  Good stuff.  Um, yeah, anyway, different levels of MGTOW.  Oh, uh, okay.  Here was another big one for me.  And, uh, So I'm a guy that I don't like to talk crap about something without a solution.  So I don't like to... point out an issue without having a solution.  My, this was another thing that I learned about MGTOW is when I first remember, I was very naive when I went into it, that was my bad, but I thought I don't see an end goal in MGTOW.  I thought that because again, you can, that's why I said go to Sandman because if you go to people that don't really understand MGTOW, that's kind of what I did.  You don't get the full kind of idea of what it really means.  And so, um, There is an end goal.  It's not just screw everything, go your own way.  It's like, as men, we have to, we have to do something or this won't change.  And it's gonna be hard for you guys if you haven't looked into it to know what I'm talking about, I guess.  But okay, let me skip to the next point.  I'll come back to that one then.  So there's only this and one more that I'll talk about and then I'll be done with this.  Oh, my hair's all crazy.  Okay, so marriage and family court.  All right, so this is huge.  Okay, this is one of the reasons why I need to get better as a guy.  Because, all right, so since junior year in high school, I haven't had a girlfriend or I haven't had a long-term relationship.  So I've literally been MGTOW for 12 years, didn't know it.  Now, I've never wanted marriage because of freedom.  I've always been like, no, I don't want anyone to tell me what to do.  I want to do what I want to do when I want to do it.  And I can only be responsible for myself.  I'm a guy that loves to improve.  I like to go work out.  I love to, I'm always improving something.  So I didn't like the idea that I just have to like, hope that this one person was going to, you know, I don't know.  Every couple years I look back and I'm like, two years ago I was a total idiot.  So I don't want to marry someone.  Anyway, the whole idea was I just looked at it from a freedom and I was just like, nope, good enough.  I don't even need to look into marriage any further.  I was set.  I'm good.  This is where I need to do a better job because what I've learned and when I get guys come to me that have been through a divorce or family courts, I didn't understand.  to the degree that I should have.  And what people got to understand about this, men going their own ways, because I'm sitting here going, if someone wants to get married, go get married.  Fine.  But what I need to do is warn you about it.  Because this is something I would have never looked into, but family courts and marriage courts, at least in the United States, a lot of places are totally, totally totally favored towards women.  now the reason why this is huge because i needed to really see this to let it all connect about why things need to change because in my head i can see how this all connects now.  is the marriage courts okay?  actually take it back me as a man the dating a girl my best weapon my biggest weapon i have and your weapon is a man.  it's not necessary.  it's not money and all that stuff like you know like having a bunch of money.  that's not your biggest asset towards women because you have all that and you don't give her any attention then it doesn't matter because she doesn't get any of that.  she never even goes on a date with you because you don't give her attention.  so your biggest weapon is a man.  period is your time and attention.  Your time and attention is your biggest weapon when you're dating women in the dating stage.  Because again, right?  If you don't give them your time, your attention, how are they going to get anything else from you?  So your weapon is time and attention.  When I'm dating women right now, I don't want a relationship.  So my biggest weapon is time and attention.  And if, if a girl gets upset and gives me an ultimatum, Adam, you know, right now I can't keep doing this either with me or you're not, or not hanging out, blah, blah, blah.  She gives me ultimatum.  My time and attention are my biggest weapon and I don't want to settle down.  So I just say, hey, I respect your decision.  I guess we won't hang out.  If you ever want to hang out again, let me know.  If you ever want my time and attention again, let me know in the future.  But I'm not going to sacrifice on your behalf to give you my time and attention.  Now why this is important is because if you get married, see my time and attention is so important because I can leave whenever I want.  That is your best weapon, guys.  It's never to yell at a woman and blah, blah, blah.  None of that is a weapon.  Your biggest weapon is to just walk away, leave.  That is your biggest weapon as a man.  Now, if you get married, that single weapon, no matter what else, you just lost it because you cannot walk away because of the family courts are so favored towards women that if you decide to walk away, you're screwed.  So your biggest weapon now becomes a deficit to you.  And now it becomes her biggest weapon.  She can walk away.  That is super duper sad.  And then when you guys look into Sandman and stuff, when you look into hypergamy and you look into monkey branching, all of these things that have been true for forever with women, and now you see that family courts are set up towards women, okay?  All right.  fine but now you have tinder bumble online dating everywhere you have social media you have women can meet men all over the place.  so now does it all start to make sense how okay women's nature are.  boom i'm gonna jump to.  well maybe you don't know that yet.  my bad i gotta do more videos on that.  but If a woman's nature is going to be to look for what can you do for my life, what can you provide, and she's going to be attracted to that, and now if she can attain that, she monkey branches to that, and the court systems are set up against men, do you see how marriage is a terrible idea?  Whew.  or at least you gotta go into it with full-on body armor, knowing what you're getting into.  Because if you give women an inch, she will take a mile.  And if you start to give women an inch in your marriage, then what will happen is she will start to see you as less valuable, she'll see you as less status, which will actually... it will actually like light up her hypergamy to wake back up and start.  So the more you actually like start submitting to your wife, the more she goes, Ooh, I don't like this.  And then the more she's like, Oh, my friends keep telling me about Tinder or whatever.  Oh, girls night out.  Ooh, these guys are giving me attention.  don't know if that made any sense guys that was just a ramble but man it's.  I had to do this video because I have to you.  it's like I'm looking back.  I want you guys now if you've seen any of my videos to understand that and I'll do a better job in the future but to understand that when I say like I love women oh women are the great.  women are the greatest creature on earth.  I've said this before.  I need to preface that because I've been doing, like I've learned about the red pill hypergamy when I was 20 or 21 or something.  So for eight, nine years, I've just lived with it and learned from it.  So when I say I love women and all that, I understand women and I love them with my understanding of women.  It might be different if I got in a relationship and she monkey branched away from me and left me hanging or got divorced.  I might not have the same type of cheery talk that I do right now about women.  I'm an optimist.  I have a great mother.  I have great women in my life, very strong women, like aunts in my life.  But the thing is, and that's another thing about MGTOW that you guys should know is MGTOW is not hating women.  I have no hate of women at all.  But MGTOW is understanding female nature, understanding women, understanding the hypergamy, understanding monkey branching, understanding these things, understanding the wall.  That's a big thing for you guys if you're dating.  When you understand these things, and then you see the court system right now for what it is, then you go, I hate the idea of getting married to a woman.  Again, I love women.  I love hanging out with women.  I just hung out with one last night.  She's beautiful.  She's amazing.  And again, when I'm saying this, guys, understand what I'm saying it for.  My expectations are, I understand all this, so therefore, I don't have a hatred of women, but I do not wish anyone to have to go through divorce.  Oh, guys, some of the horror stories I've heard.  So sad, especially if you lose your kids, man.  So anyway.  My bad.  Hey, just another shout out.  Thank you guys for those of you that on my last MGTOW video showed me the light because I needed to wake up to this.  And there's a guy and I'm not going to remember exactly the name right now, but you'll know who I'm talking about.  They made a comment when I asked, so what is it that you're not you don't like that I'm doing here?  And I was curious.  And he said, you're sending me.  You're basically sending sheep in to get slaughtered by the wolves.  And I took, I want you to know, I took that comment to heart because it's true.  Um, in a way, if, if I don't do the full job of really preparing you in right here, this is what connected everything because I can teach a guy masculine game and go, Hey, go have fun, go in a relationship.  You'll learn some of the other stuff, but I never looked into it enough to realize how bad the court system is right now for men, marriage and family court.  And when that when this is a lot of guys end goal is marriage and i was trying to help guys like hey here's what you got to do to go you know have a great first date so she likes you.  here's how you text her so she's into you and she wants to commit to you.  i'm sitting here telling all these guys that but i had to do.  i learned this guys.  so my bad seriously this is i don't know if you can see this.  yeah the marriage family court thing so seriously look into it.  if you're considering getting marriage uh getting married look into it before because you're gonna get married and you're not 100 sure of yourself as a man and you're confident as a man and you can hold your frame your masculine frame.  you will be eaten alive like a mosquito because it'll be slow.  marriage will be that slow.  she'll be slowly sucking your blood dry because you've got to be a oh one.  last thing is is i finish up here literally just the girl last night and she's I talk about this stuff now with women and they know a lot more than I thought they knew about all this.  Hypergamy and all that.  They know this a lot more.  That's why I need to start sharing this with you guys more.  But the girl last night, high quality woman.  She has a lot of guys chasing after her.  A lot of guys with more money.  A lot of guys that will do things for her and take her to nice dinners.  I don't.  She just comes over and we hang out.  A lot of guys are after her.  She tests me because she's used to testing guys.  She tests me over and over and over again and I literally will just stop and I'll just go, Come on, you really think I'm going to fail this test?  We can talk about it now where she doesn't realize she's testing me until I call her out.  And she basically laughs.  She's like, I hate when guys play along.  She's like, I hate when guys don't pass my test.  I hate when guys let me take advantage of them.  That's literally what she's trying to tell me.  I can pick up on this because I know this stuff, but you guys, if you don't know that, you got to be careful.  Anyway, as a quick recap, I was wrong about MGTOW.  I officially, guys, I'm MGTOW, man.  I don't consider myself getting, I don't see myself getting married anytime soon unless things change.  change as far as legally because there's no way i am walking in and going hey if you decide to leave take out my stuff like there's no way i'm cool with that.  there's got to be a better way.  and um that that's what i'm understanding about with with migtown man is hey us guys got to take a stand and uh yeah hey ring on it nah No.  And if you aren't nicked out, that's totally fine.  My intention, guys, is still 100% to teach texting and dating advice with women because that's what I do.  I date women.  But what I need to do a better job, and I will, is getting better at cautioning you guys about what could happen.  because like the comment I got, I do not want to lead you into... the den of the lion's den that we call women because women know far more than us men do we have to understand.  i honestly wonder how many women like behind closed doors really get told about like whatever even if they're in a relationship.  i wonder how many women if they're like thinking about breaking up with a guy I wonder how many women around them are like, well, Hey, don't do it yet.  He's got a good, he's got a really good job.  Get married with him, stick it out for a few years, then divorce him.  I honestly wonder how many times that's a real conversation.  Um, it's super sad.  So anyway, guys, I don't hate women.  I love the idea of women and all that, but I don't love at all the idea of marriage.  Uh, so, um, MGTOW, look into it if you want.  If not, Oh, well, um, and uh yeah either way you gotta own yourself.  own your purpose beyond your purpose as a man.  focus on something you want to accomplish.  don't let something else or some girl detract you from your goal.  don't forget subscribe like comment share the video but definitely subscribe.  peace.  Thank you. ",
