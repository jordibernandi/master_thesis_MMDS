MarijuanaStock.org is another great investment opportunity.  If you were lucky enough to invest in their last crowdfunding campaign, you know they raised a bunch of money in just a few months investing in legal marijuana farms.  Those initial investors now own shares of a publicly traded company, and I'm sure you're like, damn it.  Why didn't I get involved?  Now they have a new investment opportunity that is as good, if not even better, than the last one.  I'm talking about industrial hemp CBD.  For those who don't know, the hemp plant is the cousin to marijuana with a much higher concentration of CBD, which means hemp CBD gives you all the medical benefits of marijuana without getting you high.  Some of y'all like, dang, but that's the fact.  Until recently, hemp farming was practically illegal in the United States and heavily regulated by the DEA.  However, the 2018 Farm Bill changed all of that, making it legal to grow hemp CBD in the US, thus creating one of the largest commodities worldwide.  They need land to grow all of its plants, This makes for an incredible investment opportunity, and that's where our good friends at 420 Real Estate come in.  Their business model is simple.  They buy land that supports hemp CBD grow operations and lease it to licensed, high-paying tenants.  That's right.  They are hemp CBD landlords, and you can get in on the action by investing in this crowdfunding campaign for as little as $200 up to $10,000.  If you want to invest, go to marijuana stock.org.  That's marijuana stock.org.  Get in the game and do it now.  I'll back to your Roland Martin. ",
