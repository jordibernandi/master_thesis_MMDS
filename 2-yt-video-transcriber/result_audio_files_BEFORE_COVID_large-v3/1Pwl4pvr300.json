            "text": "There is a particular group of people who, under the threat of great danger, defended their livelihoods during a very violent event in America's history.  They go by many names, but I decided to pick my favourite one.  Roof Koreans.  foreign.  On March 3, 1991, Rodney King and two of his friends were driving in a car when the police attempted to perform a traffic stop as they suspected him of driving while black.  Rodney was on probation and driving under the influence, which was a serious violation of his probation, so Rodney fled and led the police on a high speed chase.  The police eventually caught him and what should have happened is the police just simply arrested him and took him down to the station.  Unfortunately that's not what happened.  Instead the police tasered and beat the ever-loving shit out of him for a prolonged period of time, an event that was filmed by a bystander.  and this infamous video was shared worldwide by many news and media outlets.  and a lot of communities and a lot of people to this day see the video as a reflection of institutional racism and people are still making that argument to this day.  People get very divided on the video.  Yes, Rodney did resist arrest at first and he also spit at a police officer but the police beat him after he had already surrendered and kept beating him.  so in my eyes nothing can justify that.  The video itself caused massive unrest within minority communities.  however all of the officers involved were charged with assault and excessive use of force and an investigation was started.  However despite the video evidence on April the 29th 1992 All of the officers involved were acquitted of any wrongdoing.  People were furious.  So furious that they decided to take to the streets and unleash their fury on anything and everything that they seen.  And so started the LA Riots.  The riots themselves were some of the worst that America has ever seen.  In total there was around 2,500 people injured, 3,600 fires were started, 1,100 buildings were completely destroyed, there was mass looting on a completely unprecedented scale and they estimate the total damage done was over $1 billion.  There was a community however that bore the brunt of the LA riots and they were specifically targeted.  the Korean store owners.  There was a lot of tensions between them and the other minority groups due to differences in culture and attitude. ",

As a result, many Koreans had their stores burned down and their livelihoods destroyed.  Over 2,300 Korean stores were damaged through attacks and looting.  Why are we the victims?  I mean, my friends are good Christians.  I mean, we went through so much and to go through this.  I mean, everything 22 years down the drain.  And it wasn't just the Koreans who got it.

So what happens when a group of people come under attack and this group of people are all trained because they did their mandatory military service back in Korea and then you sprinkle in a little touch of the Second Amendment?  You get roof Koreans.  The Korean community formed armed militias.  They called in their friends, family and employees to arm themselves and come to the stores to defend them.  Can you come in for a shift today?  Bring your gun.  They took up positions on the rooftops and on the outside of stores building barricades and fortifications and they would at first fire warning shots at the gangs of looters trying to attack their stores.  The Koreans then became targets of drive-by shootings because the gangs were trying to get rid of them so that they could go in and loot the stores and as a result many Koreans were wounded.  They stuck by their guns and used their right to defend themselves and their property, and that is exactly what they did.  And this resulted in the infamous and insane video footage that we got from gun store manager David Du.  There were a group of Korean stores that were being targeted and so David Joo and his fellow staff armed themselves and positioned themselves outside of the stores to defend them. ",
