            "text": "He's been recruiting players to come and try to be in Space Jam with him this summer, and he hasn't been able to close some of those deals.  Hey, LeBron, we heard you've been having some trouble casting your new film.  Now, we don't know too much about this film, but we do know that you, Bugs, Daffy, and company will probably have to play against a new team of antagonistic aliens.  So the question is, who will be those new Monstars?  With that in mind, we're going to give you a little bit of an assist, LeBron.  Using math, we're going to help you cast Space Jam 2.0.  Okay, quick recap.  Back in the original film, five aliens collectively called the Nerdlucks are ordered by their boss, Danny DeVito, a.k.a.  Mr.  Swackhammer, to kidnap the Looney Tunes and make them entertainment in Swackhammer's failing intergalactic theme park.  The Looney Tunes challenge the Nerdlucks to a game of basketball, which leads the Nerdlucks to steal the powers of five NBA players.  These new basketball powers allowed the tiny Nerdlucks to become the Monstars.  Whew.  Back in 96, the Nerdlucks stole their powers from Patrick Ewing, Sean Bradley, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Muggsy Bogues.  If the Monstars wanted to run it back against LeBron, we thought we would give the filmmakers a hand with their casting.  To clarify, we're not casting just the five best players in the NBA right now, or even the five best actors.  We're looking at you, James Harden.  But using our career arc regression model estimator with local optimization, or as you might know it, the Carmelo projection system, we can identify the current players who are most similar to the Monstars from 1995, the year the movie was released, using those Space Jam players' key stats.  Easy enough, right?  First up, Pound, the orange leader of the nerdlucks who stole Charles Barkley's powers back in 1996 to become the fearsome orange Monstar.  During the 1994-95 season, Barkley was averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds, and almost one block per game for the Phoenix Suns.  Using Carmelo, let's see whose powers Pound should try to steal in the league now.  Giannis Anetokounmpo is a good shout, or maybe Kevin Love.  But our Carmelo projections think a very good fit for Pound is none other than DeMarcus Cousins, which kind of checks out.  Boogie is another super high usage all-around big man who passes and rebounds well and excels at getting to the line, in addition to being a bit of an outspoken character.  Next, we have Bang, the skinny green nerd luck who drew powers from New York Knicks legend Patrick Ewing.  So who's the Patrick Ewing of today?  Carl Anthony Towns?  Maybe.  Giannis even comes close.  He's very versatile.  Our Carmelo projections, though, think that Anthony Davis could be the victim in a new film, and that really shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  Both Ewing and Davis are defensive beasts who block a ton of shots and also grab a lot of rebounds while maintaining very high usage rates on offense.  Okay, let's finish finding the big men in this lineup, although I guess they're all pretty big on the Monstars, and look for the current Sean Bradley at center.  Back in 95, Bradley got his power stolen by Blanco, the tall, blue nerdluck.  Nowadays, our projections think Blanco could maybe steal from... John Henson, Miles Turner, Rudy Gobert would be a great choice, but none of these quite fit the bill.  Actually, our Carmelo model thinks Magic Center Mo Bamba will be the best fit.  On height alone, we might have picked someone like Boban or Zhao Qi, but in terms of performance, Bomba and Bradley are both defensive-minded centers who grab a bunch of rebounds, block a ton of shots, and, let's be honest, seldom are asked to handle the ball.  Our new Monstars are more than halfway complete, and now we just have to fill in the guard slots.  Let's start with Knott, the tiny red nerdluck who stole his powers from the Hornets' 5'3 Muggsy Bogues.  In 95, Bogues was averaging 8.7 assists per game, which was fifth best in the league, while scoring 11.1 points and grabbing 1.3 steals.  So in this modern era, we're looking for a pass-first point guard who isn't afraid to steal the ball.  Rajon Rondo?  Eh, maybe if this were a few years ago.  Sorry, Rajon.  Jeff Teague?  Ricky Rubio?  That's a pretty good pick, but our projection actually thinks that Raptors guard Fred Van Vliet could be in the new film as the modern-day Muggsy, despite standing nine inches taller.  In addition to passing, both were great at steals and solid overall point guards, despite not being the most efficient shooters in the league.  Okay, last but not least, we arrive at the purple nerd luck they call Bupkis, who stole Larry Johnson's powers back in 95.  Wait, did they really choose one center, three power forwards, and one point guard for this team?  No wonder they lost.  That lineup is so uneven.  But we're not here to judge.  Let's see who is today's Larry Johnson.  Ooh, I see Blake Griffin on the Carmelo list.  That's a pretty good one.  I also see Aaron Gordon, Bradley Beal.  Huh.  Okay, let's put those aside.  The closest comp to LJ is actually Tobias Harris.  That's kind of perfect, actually.  Look at these numbers.  Both players play the same small-slash-power-forward hybrid position with nearly identical rates of usage, rebounding, steals, free throws, and even true shooting percentage.  Tobias Harris truly is the modern-day Larry Johnson.  According to Carmelo, our new Monstars, if they really want to run it back against the Toon Squad with a similar lineup to the one they had back in 95, need to find these players today.  Boogie, AD, Mobamba, Van Vliet, and Tobias Harris.  That's a pretty formidable lineup to go against James.  A lot of size with big men who can shoot, but Carmelo actually has one last surprise up its sleeve.  While LeBron was an obvious pick as the star for Space Jam 2.0, he's actually not the most similar player to Jordan circa the mid-90s.  According to Carmelo, the best match for MJ among currently active players is Kawhi Leonard.  It's perfect.  Next to a cast of a bunch of cartoons, Kawhi could really put his impeccable comedic timing to good use. ",
