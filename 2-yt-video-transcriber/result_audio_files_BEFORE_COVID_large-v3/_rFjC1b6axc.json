            "text": "Every black person on the planet who has been exposed to white supremacy, and the assumption is every black person on the planet has been, even when they haven't been in contact with white people directly, they've been exposed to the white culture indirectly.  White culture is about white supremacy.  Now, what does white supremacy do?  It teaches people of color that if you are a male, you cannot be a man.  Period.  not in the system of white supremacy and you're not going to be treated like a man ever now.  you can walk around and think that you're a man but that's between you and you strictly between you and yourself because no white person has an obligation if you're a black male to treat you like you are a man and it's logical simply because in the system of white supremacy it's impossible for a black male to be a man.  It doesn't make any difference how old he gets or what he knows or who, what kind of connections.  I can't be done.  I just started with myself.  I'm not eligible, not qualified to be a man.  Why?  Because I was born in captivity.  That's why when you're in captivity, when you are a prisoner of war, you or strictly that and nothing else.  A prisoner of war.  A victim of white supremacy.  And you don't have another title.  You can give yourselves all kinds of titles, which is why black people love titles.  We give ourselves all kinds of titles.  We give each other all kinds of titles.  Some titles, it's not as bad as it was in the old days.  I say bad if you want to use that word.  But some people used to say a professor, reverend, most high.  I mean, before you ever get to a name, you would have about 40 titles, you know, when somebody introduces you, if you're supposed to be what you call a big shot Negro in the old days.  This is not new.  This goes way back.  That struggle.  Oh, I just love to be a man.  I mean, what can it take?  But by this generation, what you call the new millennia, Most young black people have looked around.  They have looked at the people that came before them who, since the 1960s, the white supremacists have done a terrible, a rough job on black malehood.  First of all, giving them an option that you can continue to be a big boy, or if you really want to get some material benefits, put on some gold slippers and skip around, I mean, and grin all the time and all like that, and have a little money in your pocket.  Now, you can be a black girl if you're a black male.  You can be a black girl, but you cannot be a man.  You will never be a man in the system of white supremacy.  Now, they have put that in cement, or rather in steel, or whatever the hardest subject, a diamond.  The white supremacists have put that philosophy out here since the 1970s.  That's the benchmark that I give it.  all over the world.  And they're spreading it.  They're saying, you're not going to be a man.  You're a black male.  And you think you're going to be a man on my watch on my watch.  This is the voice of the white supremacist.  Now, racist man and racist woman say that's not going to happen.  Say now Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad and all of that.  They say it, that that's what they're going to make you out of, but it's not going to happen.  Now, you can talk it, but you make any move to make that real, and you're going to wonder what fell on you.  Now, they have made that clear to all of us, and the young black people have picked up that signal.  And they say, well, if I can't be a man and I don't want to be like my sisters, I don't want to switch around all day looking for a male, and I pretend to be a female or try to switch over and be one.  If they can operate on me and make me one, because then things become easier.  I mean, I guess, I hope, you know, but I definitely can't be a man because I'm in big trouble if I try to be.  Then what can I be?  Well, the white supremacist said, well, I'll give you another outside option.  You can go around and pretend that you're a man by doing harm to other black people.  That's cursing out black females, calling them names and all like that.  Write songs about them where you call them all kinds of names and kick them all up and down the street.  We don't care about that.  Kick your mother up and down the street.  I mean, we rejoice when we see you do that, okay?  But if you start acting anything like you ask for respect from us, the white supremacists, Boy, you're going to get dead real quick.  Most black males, we know that because they teach us that in no uncertain terms.  When we really start asserting ourselves and say, you're going to respect me as a man.  And the white supremacist said, you tell that to other black people.  But don't you get in my face ever, boy.  And act like you're even thinking like that, dealing with me.  Now, I'll play with you for a little while.  I'll laugh and joke with you.  But if you get serious and think that you're going to be a man when I'm here, because there ain't but one man in this house, and when I say house, I mean the entire planet Earth, anytime you think with your black self you're going to be a man in my presence, you've got another thing coming.  Now, like I said, I'll play with you.  I'll kid around with you.  I'll joke with you.  I'll play some ball games with you and all like that.  Don't you ever think that you're a man?  You're a boy?  Or you can act like your sisters and be a girl, and you ain't got no other choices with me.  But you've got all kind of choices with your own people.  Even though your own people are really not your own people, they're mine too.  But you can kill them.  You can tell them, Ain't nobody going to disrespect you.  Well, you tell that to other black people, boy, but don't you ever even think it in my presence, you don't even have to say it.  Don't you even act like you might be thinking that, or you're going to find out what L is.  And you know what?  The white supremacists are proven that they can deliver on that message every time.  And I don't care who you are.  If you're black on this planet, when you really put them to an acid test, They have so far proven that nobody will take them on because nobody knows how to include nearly full.  I'm just trying to find out.  I'm in their prison too.  I was born in their prison too.  So to get to the crux of what we're talking about here or black males, we're talking about manhood and it's not going to happen folks.  as long as you have the system of white supremacy in place and not having a system of justice.  This is why, rather than running around killing each other, that's not going to help. ",
