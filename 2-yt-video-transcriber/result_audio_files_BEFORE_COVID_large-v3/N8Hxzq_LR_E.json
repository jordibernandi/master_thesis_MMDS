Do you think this is Burkina Faso or Britain?  Why would we have medicine shortages?  We make medicine.  We export medicine.  We have money to buy medicine that we don't make.  and many willing sellers why have you as a fellow lefty fallen hook line and sinker for this project?  fear rubbish?  what makes you think that this kind of nonsense has any more credibility than, for example, the campaign that Jeremy Corbyn is a racist and an anti-Semite.  Don't you know, actually, that these arguments come from many of the same actors?  And I mean actors.  Why have you fallen for this guff when you don't fall for the other guff?  Why are you so content to be marching to the orders, to the drumbeat of Tony Blair?  Alistair Campbell, John Major, the CBI, the banks, Goldman Sachs, all the big international finance capital institutions.  Why are you as a lefty marching to this stupid drumbeat? ",
