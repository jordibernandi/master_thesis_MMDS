Of course there's communism, radical feminism, anti-white identity politics, Islamism, studies of taboo sexualities like necrophilia, bestiality, pedophilia, incest.  Ideas which are far outside of societal norms and standards.  But that's not a bad thing.  Exposure to shocking and outrageous ideas that were far outside of my worldview taught me one of the most valuable and empowering lessons, which is simply the idea that it's okay to study things that you disagree with.  that we can tolerate views that we don't like, that we can separate our personal politics from our subjects of inquiry, and that we can engage with ideas without endorsing or legitimizing them.  But while university did expose me to a universe of ideas that I once thought were unthinkable, university students do not get exposed to all kinds of ideas. ",

They can also be exposed to the leftist critique of liberal ideas.  Sometimes there are entire programs that stem from leftist critique of liberalism ideologically, built into their foundation.  Grievance studies are largely leftist critique of liberalism axiomatically.  Well, if we now look to see is right-wing anti-liberalism represented anywhere, in an intellectually sound manner.  In other words, we study liberal theorists, not just liberal ideas.  You can actually be exposed to the axioms and ideas of liberalism.  And you'll study Marx in a first-year political science class.  You probably did.  And not only Marx, but Marxists and neo-Marxists and postmodern thinkers.  So there's a theoretical basis or foundation.  And that's good.  There should be, in my view.  But, by the same token, there should be an acknowledgement of right-wing anti-liberalism as a rich theoretical tradition. ",

I guess that right-wingers are just dumb and that when it comes to right-wing ideologies, there's just not much there to study.  But according to Dr.  Ronald Biener, a political science professor who recently wrote a book about the resurgence of the far-right, that idea is totally wrong.  Even today, it's a revelation for me to have it framed this way, but according to Dr.  Biener, not only is it the case that far-right thinkers made a significant contribution to modern political and philosophical thought, not only was their contribution very influential, But far-right fascist thinkers were actually the most influential and the most significant thinkers of the 20th century.  His book is called Dangerous Minds, Nietzsche, Heidegger.  and the return of the far right.  You probably know Nietzsche and Heidegger, but you might not have thought of them as right-wingers.  That's because, according to Dr.  Biener, there has been a conscious effort to reshape the narrative about Nietzsche and Heidegger and to appropriate them in the service of leftist politics.  Dr.  Milliman's thesis was on exactly this topic, how different theorists, including left-wing thinkers, have been influenced by the right-wing thought of Martin Heidegger. ",

But it is true that Heidegger and Nietzsche can be, and Schmidt, Carl Schmidt is somebody else, that democratic political theorist.  I mean, Carl Schmidt was a Nazi thinker on the right.  His books are well worth reading.  He's a very smart man, but the fact remains he was a Nazi thinker on the right whose ideas were very influential on the left.  So these leftist thinkers, they are not blind or stupid.  They're aware of the existence of right-wing thinkers.  But because they stand opposed to the right and they don't want to give it oxygen, they pick and choose certain ideas, certain concepts, certain arguments that may be helpful for their cause.  They're very good at doing that. ",

A common theme in conservative media is the idea that the indoctrination that students are receiving in university is going to transform them into leftist radicals.  But contrary to the conservative narrative, it's often the opposite that happens.  For those students who perceive that their leftist professors are not telling them the full truth or that ideas are being pushed on them, rather than turning them into leftist radicals, the university experience can actually ferment a distrust and resentment for the far left.  And while a leftist indoctrination might not successfully instill leftist political positions, what it definitely does instill is an open mind and a cognitive tolerance for the study of radical ideas.  This is the central theme of Dr.  Biner's book on the return of the far right.  The idea that through exposure to the radical right-wing ideas of thinkers like Nietzsche and Heidegger, that students will be swayed to right-wing positions like white nationalism.  for myself, my education in those issues, of right-wing thought did not come from the university, I went to go find it on my own.  And my education in right-wing ideas came from right-wing websites, alt-right, white nationalist websites.  And I would think that if professors are concerned about the effect that these ideas might have on people, that they would want to be the ones to introduce and perhaps control the teaching of those ideas to make sure that they're not perhaps twisted.

But obviously that is not what happened in my case, and it's not what happens generally, because it's not just an accident that there's no right-wing anti-liberalism represented on the spectrum.
