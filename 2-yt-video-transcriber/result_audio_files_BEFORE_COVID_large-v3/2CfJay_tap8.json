            "text": "I have a conceptual memory of being born.  That sounds ridiculous.  I didn't come out of the womb and say, oh my gosh, there's a fluorescent light and it was made by Sylvania.  No.  In the womb, there was a sensation of compression and advancement against one side and another to this sudden... urgent pressure to burst out.  I had this dream repeatedly through my youth.  And one day I said, you know, that's kind of like being born.  And the dreams stopped.  I believe that the consciousness of the child has begun in the womb.  And when you kill a child, you are killing a person who is not just aware of nothing, but of being a person.  You know, Rene Descartes, the philosopher, said, cogito ergo sum, I think, therefore I am.  The child in the womb doesn't have any knowledge of what's outside the womb yet, except for impressions from pressures and so on.  But he recognizes the fact that he is a person.  Those things he's sensing aren't just happening, they're happening to him.  So when the court says they have no way of knowing, We know that they're wrong there.  But there's even more clearly.  At the time of Roe v. Wade, in Tennessee law and the law all across the states of the union, a recognition that life existed in the womb.  Because what the Tennessee statute is, 68.3.501.  It's the uniform determination of death act.  An individual, it says, who has sustained either irreversible cessation of circulatory functions, i.e.  heartbeat, or two irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain is dead, which means that the law presumes that that if there is a brain functioning and a heart functioning, then life is functioning in the womb or anywhere else.  It makes clear that life has a legally medical consensus, even though the court said there is no consensus.  And that consensus is that when a heart and a brain are functioning, there can be no legal argument that person is alive.  Now, it's argued that Tennessee will waste millions of dollars fighting the proposed law, appealing up to the Supreme Court only to lose to the supposedly impregnable fortress of Roe v. Wade.  I argue that regardless of how entrenched our opposition, it is immoral not to fight for the thing that makes Earth different from every other known body in the universe, Life.  We can win with this bill.  It is also argued that even before that loss is consummated, many more millions of dollars will be lost as businesses reject the values because we defend life.  These arguments simply suggest that all we're really worried about is whether it costs a lot, because life is simply a trade-off for money.  If this bill is abandoned and our tolerance of abortion persists, how many pieces of silver do you expect to get for each child killed by our betrayal? ",
