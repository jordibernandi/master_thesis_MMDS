There was this really pervasive sense that there was no alternative to capitalism.  not simply because there was no political movement to push against that, but because they literally could not imagine a world which could be better and not be capitalist.  And again, that was based on some very unique historical economic conditions, which are now over.  And I think we really have started to see the death of capitalist realism in the period since the financial crisis.  It did not happen immediately after Lehman Brothers collapsed.  It would be bizarre to expect that it would.  No one knew how the period after the crisis was going to play out.  But, you know, 10 years into austerity and with an economy that is just not working the way that it should, the way that people have expected it to over the most of their lives, with intergenerational equality matters increasing, wealth inequality, all these different inequities.  And that has both contributed to the emergence of a movement to replace capitalism with socialism and has been based on the emergence of that movement. ",

The disintegration of how the world economy is supposed to operate.  The fact you have the two largest economies on the planet going ding-dong at each other over a trade war, over really quite a weird trade war, talking about intellectual property and all sorts of other things.  So that's neoliberalism as a big global organising thing really crumbling away in front of us.  The space is there to organise different things, but how it gets organised and for whom it gets organised is the question to get into.  Donald Trump has his own version of what that organisation looks like.  It would not be one that I'd support and Grace supports and lots of other people. ",

It's like the vision is either, you know, we are going to sort of hyper-excited national capitalism that will work very definitely for a few people at the top and maybe that will turn into something for everybody else.  and here's a bunch of racism to make it all look fair.  Bernie Sanders has something quite different to that.  And I think what you've got with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour in Britain is something quite different to that as well, much closer to Bernie Sanders.  and saying, actually, we can make the economy, to coin a phrase, work for the many, not the few.  And that's what we need to get to.  And climate change, yes, the overwhelming problem you run up against, the bit that accelerates all of this, the bit that forces all these questions in a really dramatic way, is the fact we now have to deal with a world that's visibly and obviously getting warmer and all the consequences of that.
