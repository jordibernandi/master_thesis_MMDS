            "text": "Every Christian church in the country should be able to answer some basic questions about homosexuality.  Do you consider it a sin?  Do you support same-sex marriage?  These are hot-button issues among the broader spectrum of Christians, but my point is that most churches have firm positions on them.  They know their answers.  yet those answers are rarely advertised.  It's not like you'll find them on their websites.  The website might say, We love everyone or We welcome all people.  But the fine print says something else.  Why hide from the truth?  Because if a church is open about being anti-gay, it could be a deal-breaker for some new members, especially the young people they're trying to capture.  Pastors would rather bring LGBTQ people and allies into the fold than spring all the bigotry on them later on, even if that takes a couple of years.  It's honestly just cruel.  Because by the time some people find out just how horrible their own church's positions are, their entire life could be mixed in with the church.  Walking away would leave them maybe without a job or friends or any kind of social safety net.  And that's the whole point.  The churches want to suck you in so that you can't leave even if you wanted to.  Now, there's no way to force these churches to do the right thing. ",
