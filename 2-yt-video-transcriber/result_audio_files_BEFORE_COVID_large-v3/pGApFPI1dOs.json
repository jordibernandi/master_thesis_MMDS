The answer is simple.  It gives the police a massive advantage over the detainee.  Once inside, people will do or say whatever it takes to exit that police vehicle as quickly as possible.  To any passers-by, you are showcased as the evil villain.  Embarrassment and humiliation can make for loose tongues.  And because so many people believe that cop reality shows are a true reflection of policing in this country, almost everyone seems to believe that police vehicles have cameras inside them.  They don't.  Trust me, if they did, the police would not be inviting you into the back of them.  Worse still, if you complain later on that you were falsely imprisoned, you'll be rebuffed on the basis that you consented to entering the vehicle, even where the police deliberately mislead you into believing that you're obliged to do so.  Of course, they'll never inform you of your right not to enter their vehicle because the police have no interest in respecting your civil rights, especially where your right not to do something will make it harder for them to get a roadside confession and an easy conviction.
