            "text": "hard times for farmers got tougher under trump because of his trade war and now according to huffington post midwestern farmers midwestern farmers are filing the highest number of bankruptcies in a decade.  that's according to a wall street journal analysis of federal data.  that means During the Obama years, bankruptcies were way down.  During the first two years of Trump, before the tax, I'm sorry, before the trade wars began, bankruptcies were not as prevalent.  But now, the highest number of bankruptcies over the past 10 years are occurring.  And farmers aren't hopeful about this year, 2019.  It says twice as many farmers in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.  Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin declared bankruptcy last year compared to 2008.  Twice as many.  It's according to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals and the Wall Street Journal.  Bankruptcies in states from North Dakota to Arkansas were up 96% according to figures from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals where these bankruptcy petitions are filed.  Farmers are battered by sinking commodity prices and stiff tariffs from China and Mexico that were put in place in retaliation for Trump's tariffs on imports from those countries.  So here again, here's another big subsection of the country who are having the shit kicked out of them, and farmers who voted for Trump.  And what did he say, this orange bastard during the State of the Union, that because of his tax law, that all the millionaire family farms out there, they don't have to pay the death tax anymore.  Ooh, that's right, they don't have to pay it because they don't have any fucking thing worth anything.  When you file bankruptcy, what are you going to pay taxes on?  Oh, Jesus.  The new 11-nation comprehensive and progressive agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty.  How's that?  The CPTPP that was passed last year slashed tariffs but not for US farmers because the Trump administration pulled out of those negotiations.  That drove customers to farmers and ranchers in competitive countries like Australia, which resulted in another kick in the scrotum to American operations, farming operations.  Now farmers say that they're afraid it's going to take years to repair the damage that this orange son of a bitch perpetrated against farmers.  Why did farmers vote for this psycho fuck anyway?  What was your point?  What made you think that Trump, being a liar, a cheat, a con artist, a crime lord, what made you think that he would say, oh, farmers, yeah, I'm going to give them a good deal here?  What?  You're going to vote for him again in 2020?  Maybe not, huh?  According to figures from the U.S.  Agriculture Department, farm income last year was about 50% of what it was in 2013.  Half.  That's according to the Wisconsin State Farmer publication, published those figures, Wisconsin.  Let's see, that state, didn't that state go for Trump?  You dumb shits.  The dairy industry had been hopeful about meeting the growing demand in China for its products, but BOOM!  Down the commode.  According to A director of dairy policy analysis, University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin, this guy said at an agricultural forum last week in Madison, and this is bullshit, he said, quote, the problem is that both nations have stubborn leaders.  No, that's not the problem.  The problem is that one of those two nations, well, both of them actually, but the one we're concerned with is run by a fucking psychopath, a gangster, a punk, a thug, Donald Trump.  Soybeans also were a major victim for farmers.  According to agribusiness professor University of Wisconsin in Platteville, quote, agriculture prices live and die by exports.  In all commodities, we're heavily dependent on China, especially where it concerns soybeans.  And what did Trump do?  His trade embargoes.  There go the soybean farmers.  So, government subsidies to farmers.  Now, remember, farmers are the ones who will tell you, oh, we don't like that big government shit.  We just want to be left alone.  Really?  Okay, I can accept that, but being left alone.  when you have a president that you voted for who slaps trade barriers up, who slaps tariffs on imports, then you're not being left alone, are you?  Anyway, government subsidies to farmers were up almost 20% last year over the previous year due to the $5 billion in tariff aid and $1.6 billion in disaster payments to farmers impacted by hurricanes, floods, and other disasters.  But it wasn't enough money to stave off the end through bankruptcy for a number of them.  This is part of Trump's gift to the people who voted for him.  And I realize that farmers and other people have other things on their minds than to sit down and figure how much bullshit is being shoveled their way by somebody like Trump, this gangster son of a bitch.  I realize that.  On the other hand, I know a lot of you voted for Trump because you bought his bullshit.  How could you be so fucking stupid?  Lying Hillary?  Well, crooked Hillary.  For the number of people, or for a number of people who voted for Trump, You are feeling the pain and you are going to continue to feel the pain because you put in place as your leader a fucking mafia gangster who doesn't care if you live or die.
