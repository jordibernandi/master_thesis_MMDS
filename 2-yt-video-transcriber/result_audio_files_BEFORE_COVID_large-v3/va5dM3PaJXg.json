            "text": "This last month, I visited Israel to speak at the Israeli Atheist Association's Makar Conference in Tel Aviv.  I had a fantastic time, and the people, culture, hospitality, and everything was wonderful.  But while I was there, some of my Jewish friends took me to Jerusalem for the first time, and I thought I would share with you some of the thoughts that I had as an atheist in the Holy Land.  Our first stop in Jerusalem was the Wailing Wall, where Jews mourn the destruction of their holy temple.  The men and women are segregated, and I watched as religious practitioners ritualistically rocked back and forth praying to God, while shoving small pieces of paper between the cracks of the walls with prayers on them.  Now, I wanted to see the Dome of the Rock on the other side of the wall, where Muhammad allegedly ascended to heaven.  Now, although Jews aren't allowed to pray on the Temple Mount, sometimes non-Muslims are allowed to enter, but unfortunately, it was closed to non-Muslims while I was there.  Everywhere I went, there were soldiers, and while my time there was peaceful, it was abundantly clear that tensions between Jews and Arabs remained high, and it served as a constant reminder for that.  There were crowds everywhere.  Pilgrims flocking by the millions to this spiritual destination, hoping to get just a little closer to God.  Now, even when I was a Christian, I didn't believe that we actually knew where the exact location of Jesus' death and burial was, but I guess I expected to find something different than what I saw.  I thought the location would at least be on a hill or something outside the city from the temple that matched the description of the Bible, or at least looked like what the Jesus films depicted as.  I thought that maybe Jesus' tomb would be a ways away from the crucifixion site, not right next to.  I didn't expect to just find a church with icons everywhere.  It was all inside of a building very similar to what you might expect from a Greek or Russian Orthodox church.  Although, it was kind of underwhelming, and was way less impressive than, say, the Hagia Sophia in Turkey or the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow.  I've been to plenty of religious holy sites before when I was still a Christian, and I've experienced the thrill that I would have called a spiritual experience at the time.  The cognitive rush of excitement and the feeling of awe that you feel when you're primed to feel it.  And yet this time around, as an atheist, detached from spiritual expectations, as someone able to objectively witness the flock of spiritually thirsty visitors descending upon this venerated site, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly depressed.  Not for myself.  In fact, I felt relieved to be free of religious binders, relieved that I don't need a savior because I'm not lost, I don't need to be fixed because I'm not broken, and relieved that I don't need a religious shepherd because I'm not a sheep.  No, I didn't feel depressed to be excluded, but I felt sad for them.  Watching spiritual pilgrims flock by the millions to a small stone building in a patch of desert land hoping it will somehow bring them closer to God.  I felt sorry for those who are told their entire lives that they're broken, inadequate, sinful, and deserving of eternal torment.  Told they were born filthy and need to spend their entire lives in pursuit of salvation.  I felt pity for the desperate, searching for some straw of religious hope to grasp at, to give them hope against the torment and unease that the same religion saddles them with.  As I watched them sob over a stone, I felt tinges from my past of times when I cried those same tears, when I felt what they felt.  Not just the feeling of inadequacy, but the follow-up excitement that I had found the cure to sin.  The misplaced ecstasy over the simulacrum of a cure to a non-existent disease.  The religious solution to save you from a problem that only the religious have.  And here they were, pouring their hearts out at holy sites that are so obviously fake.  Jerusalem was completely sacked by the Romans in 70 CE.  300 years later, the Roman Emperor Constantine decided to convert to Christianity and sent his mom to Jerusalem on a quest to find Jesus' cross and nails.  Now, he didn't assign this task to an archaeologist, a historian, a cartographer, or even a local Jew.  Nope.  His mom.  And, according to secondhand folklore, amazingly, she found the original cross of Jesus, the site of the crucifixion, and the nails that pinned him up there.  Now, even if you're the emperor's mom, you probably don't want to disappoint a Roman emperor and come back empty-handed.  I should add at this point that relics like this would become a forgery epidemic over the course of the next thousand plus years, with enough pilgrims returning from the Holy Land with shards of Jesus' cross to create a crucifixion forest.  Totally real.  And they found so many nails of the crucifixion that it would have made Jesus a divine pincushion holier than Swiss cheese.  The fact is, the earliest claims as to where any of this stuff went down, if it happened at all, emerged hundreds of years after Jesus' death, after the city of Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans and rebuilt.  And so many holy sites and relics were simply tacked as such, hundreds of years after the fact, based occasionally on oral tradition, and more often than not on the imaginations of crusaders and religious zealots.  I don't know what kind of oral tradition they had, but anecdotes are the least reliable type of evidence, and they get exponentially less reliable the more links you have in this generational game of telephone.  Now, the rock that Jesus was allegedly crucified on is less than five minutes from the temple and is conveniently placed right next to the tomb that he was allegedly buried in.  Perfectly placed so that spiritual tourists can be bombarded by walls of merchants selling spiritual trinkets.  Even Christians can't agree on which sites are the real locations for this stuff.  I'm not convinced if it happened at all.  Sure, some guy named Jesus probably existed, but legends and new religions pop up all the time.  Sometimes loosely based on real people, sometimes not.  Take Mormonism or Scientology, for example.  Even if these holy locations fit the descriptions of the scripture perfectly , that still wouldn't meet the burden of proof for the extraordinary claims put forth in these books.  For example, I don't even live in the UK and I've only visited it a few times, but I could easily form a religion that worships the divine lord of chaos Egg Fart Man, who encouraged his followers to let it all out.  I can claim that if we don't eat eggs, his wrath will burn against us, and I can tell the tale of how he ignited his flatulence and burned half of London to the ground while he sat atop London Bridge playing a fiddle.  A cult following could spring up out of this, with extensive fanfiction and lore.  But if archaeologists 2000 years from now discover remnants of UK egg farms, London Bridge, as well as evidence of the Great Fire of London, and they find a fiddle dating to around this time, and even if they discover my original manuscripts, that doesn't make the story of Egg Fart Man true.  And yet you have people who find locations matching the descriptions from the Bible, buying the whole story hook, line, and sinker.  Just how low are your standards of evidence?  Now, as much as I appreciated the history of this spiritual curiosity, I couldn't help but be constantly reminded that religious groups have been slaughtering each other for centuries for control of this utterly underwhelming religious sham, killing fellow humans over something as cold and lifeless as a couple of stupid rocks.  Was I the only one in the crowd willing or able to see this madness?  I felt like a time traveler or an alien looking in on a foreign species.  Except, I wasn't.  These bizarre rituals, practices, superstitions, customs, and traditions belonged to my own species, in my own time.  When you remove the religiously induced stupor, the veil of indoctrinated excitement over the most meh stones of the millennia, it was utterly and completely depressing.  I didn't feel anything but pity.  Throngs of people were being totally suckered right in front of my eyes.  three different mutually exclusive competing religions.  Not because they were stupid, but because religion is the world's oldest and most successful con.  And it made me wonder what the world would be like if rather than revering cold hard rocks and silent deities, if religions made pilgrimages to community coffee shops, if they prayed at bridges instead of walls, Or better yet, if instead of revering buildings and the dirt they rest on, if we ditched religion altogether and started treating our fellow human beings with respect and dignity.  Now my goal is not to strip a country of its spiritual tourism income or rob it of its history.  But I dream of a day where that income is replaced by flocks of history lovers and tourists of mythology on a quest to observe the graveyard of the gods.  Thank you.  But before I go, I want to give a quick shout out to my friend Elon.  He not only hosted me while I was in Israel, but he also has an atheist YouTube channel in Hebrew with English subtitles that I'll link to in the description below.  Definitely go check that out.  And finally, I want to give a heartfelt thank you to everyone who's been supporting me on Patreon.  Recently I asked for your help and I have huge goals for this channel.  We just hit the amount that I need to break even and not be sweating to pay my basic bills month to month, but I'd really love to expand this and to be able to hire additional people to assist me, to be able to put out better quality content and get a studio space, and you guys are the ones that make it possible.  So thank you so much for your support, thank you for everyone who's stuck with me this far for believing in me, And if you want to go and help me out on Patreon, you can go and make a pledge per video.  Or in the spirit of the holidays, you can make a one-time donation on PayPal.  Thanks as always, dare to be curious, and don't drink the Kool-Aid.  Thank you. ",
