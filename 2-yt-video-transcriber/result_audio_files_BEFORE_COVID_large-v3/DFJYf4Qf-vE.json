BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED, WHERE WILL THE EUROPEAN UNION BE?  I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS NEXT ARTICLE.  THE EU, THE EUROPEAN UNION, WILL ONLY WAKE UP TO IRAN.  THREAT WHEN THE NUKES FALL ON THEM.  NOW, NETANYAHU IS SPEAKING HERE.  HE SAID, COME ON.  You've got to realize where Iran is going, and you've got to be ready.  And on our side, actually, he's saying the EU has got to wake up before the nukes fall on them.  That's very well said, don't you think?  And, you know, Jack, I'm going to come to you right now and say, where is the European Union going?  Are they going to wake up and be on the side of Israel?  or what are they going to do? ",
