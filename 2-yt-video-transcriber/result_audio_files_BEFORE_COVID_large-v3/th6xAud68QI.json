            "text": "Hello friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor here.  I want to welcome you to our Friday evening Bible Question of the Week, where we're going to be talking about, do Christians worship the same God as the Muslims?  This has been in the news a little bit lately, because on several occasions, Pope Francis has said that the Christians and the Jews and the Muslims all have one Father, or variations of that.  And you might have heard a little more than a year ago, one of the professors of Wheaton College was dismissed for saying the God of the Bible and the Christian is the same as the God of Islam.  So what's the truth on this subject?  Well, it's a complex question, depending on how you understand what is meant by one God.  If you were to say, do the Christians and Muslims have some common history?  Well, historically they do.  They believe in heaven.  hell, judgment.  The Muslims do believe in the story of Adam and Eve, though their story is very different.  They believe in Noah being delivered during the time of the flood.  They believe in Abraham having great ancestors that would fill the earth.  There's some very different beliefs connected with that.  They believe that Abraham offered Ishmael and not Isaac.  So even in the Quran, it asserts that Muslims are taught to say our God and your God is one and to him we surrender.  If the Quran asserts that the Muslims worship the same God as the Jews, then why would we have a problem with that?  Well, because really the question we should be asking is, do Christians and Muslims have the same concept of God?  Now, once we understand we're talking about a concept of God, We have to say it's very different, which ends up meaning that they're really two different gods.  For example, Islam sprang from the Arabian people.  They descended from Ishmael and the six sons of Keturah.  But most Muslims today are not Arabs.  Christians sprang from the Hebrew people.  children of Jacob.  but most Christians today are not Jewish.  so when you talk about Islam and you talk about Christianity they may have sprung from a particular races of people but now most of the Muslims in the world they're in Indonesia.  they're not in Arabia.  so when you think Muslim don't always think Arabian.  and likewise Christianity springs from the Jewish religion, but most Christians today are not Jews.  They are Gentiles or might be spiritual Jews.  And so there's some vast differences.  They are the two largest religions in the world today.  Islam has about 1.7 billion followers, Christianity about 2.2 billion.  Islam is growing more rapidly than Christianity, which has caused a little bit of concern and consternation for Pope Francis, which is part of the reason some believe that he's reaching across.  Christians believe Jesus is God.  The Koran is so opposed to this belief that it condemns Jesus' worshippers to hell.  It says in the Koran 5.72, for Christians, Jesus is certainly God, and for Muslims, Jesus is certainly not God.  And so right there you find a fundamental difference that is hard to overcome.  Furthermore, according to Jesus, God is our Father.  Yet in the Quran, it specifically denies that Allah is the Father.  And that's in 1.12, verses 1 through 4.  In fact, in 5.18, the Quran tells Muslims to rebuke Jews and Christians for calling God their loving Father because humans are just things that God has made.  Well, there again, a very different concept.  Christians and Jews believe God is our loving Father.  And the Quran says it cannot accept that.  The Bible tells us that man is made in the image of God.  The Quran says that that's borderline blasphemy to say that we are made in the image of God.  And of course, the doctrine of the Trinity, the Muslims categorically reject that.  And this is something foundational to Christianity, that God is the God of our Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.  These three persons form the Godhead.  you have in the two religions are fundamentally incompatible because according to Islam worshiping the Christian God is not just wrong it sends you to hell.  so they cannot be the same God.  Islam says God cannot be known But Christianity tells us that Christ came to help us better know God.  In the God of the Bible, you see that God is always entering into man's history.  He walks with Adam and Eve in the garden, not in the Quran's version of paradise.  In Christianity, you see that God speaks with Abraham.  He speaks with Moses.  He speaks with Jacob and with Gideon and with Samson's parents and many others through history.  In the Quran, God never speaks directly to man, maybe with the exception of Muhammad, but he always uses some other method of communicating to man.  But you see, the God of the Bible is entering into the experience of man.  In the Bible, Jesus is a spiritual leader who laid down his life to save the world.  Muhammad was a spiritual leader who becomes a political leader, who takes up violent military means to accomplish his mission.  Jesus died on the cross to accomplish his mission, and he tells us that we should not do it by the sword.  As a matter of fact, he told Peter, when Peter took up a sword there in the Garden of Gethsemane, he cut off the ear of Malchus, and Jesus said, put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish with the sword.  Yet, Muhammad very much endorsed using military means to force people to accept Islam.  Jesus never attacked or recommended someone being attacked and compelled to believe in him.  The worship of God and belief in Christ must come from the heart.  It must come willingly.  It cannot be compelled.  It cannot be forced by government edicts and laws.  And I recognize there are many loving people Good people.  Just this week I was with a Muslim friend who invited me to come and participate in some function of Ramadan to celebrate the end of Ramadan or beginning of Ramadan and I told him that I might not be comfortable doing that.  Karen and I are going to be in a predominantly Muslim country next week.  And we know there are a lot of loving people that are there.  God wants to save.  And that right.  there is a difference.  The Bible tells us that God loves sinners.  The Quran says God hates sinners.  He only loves the godly.  But the Bible tells us that while we were yet sinners, Christ Jesus died for us.  So that there is a big foundational difference.  And Christians, the way that we're saved is a big difference.  Christians believe we are saved by the work of Christ through faith in his work.  We are recreated.  We receive new hearts.  It is a salvation by faith.  Islam is very much a salvation by works and by deeds.  And finally, I should probably close with a scripture that you find in 1 John chapter 4.  I'll read verses 2 and 3.  By this you know the Spirit of God.  Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God.  And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.  And that is the spirit of Antichrist, which you have heard was coming and is now already in the world.  Indeed, John says there are many Antichrists even in his day.  And I think that the teaching of Islam is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus in Christianity.  In summary, do I believe that Christians worship the same God as Muslims?  I'm not true Christians.  It's a whole different concept of God and a different method of salvation.  Muslims believe a different gospel if it's any gospel at all.  Just when I finished recording this question, I realized I didn't have a sermon book that we can offer you that specifically answers this question.  But I did just do a series last year called Islam and Christianity in Prophecy.  It's a three-part series where the contents of this question are included in this DVD and, of course, much, much more.  You can find this at the Amazing Facts online bookstore.
