            "text": "Hang on, people.  Well, just another example of quota hiring endangering the public, endangering the quota hire, and endangering other officers.  So they send Megan, this is Megan with the blonde hair, you know, hired because, not because she was qualified, not because she could do what a man could do.  They lower the standards so she can pass, then they pass her, then they give her a gun, and then they put her out here and think everyone else, criminals, will care that the PD was trying to be PC by hiring more female officers, therefore the crooks won't shoot them or take their guns.  Well, another prime example, I mean, the stats... Every agency I worked, every area I worked, women either lose their guns, run from a scene, don't back up officers, get taken out within 15 seconds of showing up at a scene, retire earlier.  It's just the biggest scam that's ever been run in a government.  This woman's in the hospital.  She wasn't even shot.  She lost her gun.  The guy shot at her.  Luckily, a bunch of other male officers came and shot the guy that had her gun.  So she endangered all of them's lives by screaming and giving up her gun.  And now she's in a hospital, not because she was shot, because she's upset and she was injured.  And now she's going to claim stress.  And now she will go out on taxpayer money with her salary for the rest of her life.  Meanwhile, the department won't be able to hire another agency because they'll be paying her retirement for the next so many years.  And then when they hire someone else, they will hire another quota hire, not because they're qualified or they're good.  but because it's just damn fashionable to be PC nowadays.  Let's watch this video.  Woman shows up, deputy.  Mother calls on son and says, I want my son out of the house.  I want him gone.  Then hangs up on 911 and then stops responding.  So she shows up to deal with the kind teen.  And here we go from the start.  So she's yelling, I'm going to kill you, while she's getting punched in the face.  Gun's discharged while the guy's taking it.  If there was a kid over here, if it went through the house, it killed a kid.  That's okay.  We'll blame everybody but the agency that hired a woman that couldn't even keep her gun from a teenager.  And her response when she loses her gun is to scream and run off.  Good luck, public.  I know we told you guys to give up your guns and gun control was good and that only government should have guns, but you know what?  I just gave my gun to a criminal and now you're going to shoot up the neighborhood and I'm going to run away.  Thanks, kind citizens, for giving up your guns.  It's just freaking crazy.  What the fuck?  This guy pulls up pretty damn close to a guy with a gun.  And the way they're responding, I'm assuming she got out shots fired or somebody called 911 and said this cop's beating the hell out of your deputy.  Because these guys were rolling in hot.  And she wasn't rolling in hot by herself because she'd have never went up there if she thought it was dangerous.  But anyway, this cop pulls right up to the guy with the gun easily for this guy to take this driver out.  But... So they fire multiple rounds.  The guy lived.  He's in the hospital.  They're saying his injuries aren't life-threatening.  Just a multitude of errors blamed on.  Nobody's going to blame it.  No media's going to cover this.  No one's going to say, what's your hiring prophecy?  Why was that woman out there?  Why was this teenage kid who was smaller than the woman able to take her gun and become a danger to the entire neighborhood because she couldn't even hang on to her gun?  Well, Rick, it's not her fault.  Okay, of course it's not because she'll get the P-pass and everyone will go around saying women are equal.  Hire them.  They need equal pay.  They're not paid fairly.  They should get promoted more because we need more women sergeants.  We need more women police chiefs.  We need more minorities.  We need everything but good quality people that the government keeps telling us.  if we give up our guns, they'll only give it to their people who they tell us are qualified.  You want this woman coming to save you?  Are you kidding me?  This guy isn't even throwing good punches.  Not only is he little, his punches are very weak.  But unfortunately, nobody wants to say that even a weak punch will take out most women.  And this woman is a trained professional.  Rick, she went to the police academy.  She's got a bulletproof vest.  Why did she pepper spray him?  Why didn't she use her mace?  She had her gun.  What happened, Rick?  I'll tell you what happened.  They hired somebody that wasn't qualified because of their sex.  And now they're out there endangering the public, giving up their... That's why I didn't like responding to calls with female backups.  That's why when I went on certain incidents, I would rather be by myself than have a female with a gun because I was always worried that somebody was going to take her gun... and use it against me.  So we go to a call, and nobody's got a gun but us, and then all of a sudden, they take her gun, and now they have a gun.  And now I'm defending myself.  And guess what?  What do most female cops do when they lose their gun?  Exactly what this female cop did.  They run away.  You're on your own.  Look at these punches again.  I'm going to slow it down.  Not that effective.  Not that great.  I'm gonna kill you!  This woman gives up about right here.  All she's doing is screaming now.  She's in an emotional state.  She is not in a fight.  She is not attacking his eyes.  She doesn't have violence of action.  She is not aggressive at all.  Her only thought right now is to get away or to have a male cop come save her.  Those are the only two things that she's thinking of.  I guarantee you.  Of course, in a press release, it'll be like, I just thank God for my training and experience that I was able to survive and live through... Lady, you didn't do nothing but give him your gun and run away.  Are you kidding me?  Luckily, this guy can't shoot because she wasn't that far away and he missed her.  What the fuck?  This guy walks up to them with his gun up in the air, but they get out and open fire.  So I don't know if he points at them or fires at them, but the first deputy pulls really, really close.  Look how close this deputy is.  This deputy could have stopped here or even further back, but he keeps coming closer.  I mean, he pulls up literally with his driver's door and a guy with a gun.  I don't know who this guy is, or female, but who's ever in that car ain't too damn smart either.  They said he shot twice at her.  I think that second shot was him shooting at her again, and that's why they probably opened fire, but I don't know for sure.  Okay, so... lessons to be learned.  look I you know people want to come here and say I'm sexist and I don't like women and it's not women's fault or I don't like quota hiring.  and quota hiring isn't fair.  and I'm telling you government fails and it is competent.  and the reason they're incompetent ninety percent of the time they don't hire the best people.  why can they get away with that?  because they're not a business.  they don't work on profit.  businesses that work on profit don't hire people because it's cool.  they hire people who can do the job better than someone else.  so it increases their productivity which increases their money inflow.  So if it increases profit, that's who they hire.  Government, because they don't care about profit, they just take taxes, they hire people for everything but competency.  Those are the facts.  You can blame me or hate me, but that's the way it is.  All right, we'll end that there.  Oh, I wanted to show the article.  This happened in Victorville, California, Wednesday.  And here's an article from Channel News 19, where they say, Found 21-year-old.  Okay, he wasn't a teen.  He was 21.  Sorry.  He became combative.  Hell, if I was writing this story, female deputy showed up, no fighting skills, poor officer safety, engaged a kid who was smaller than her, gave him her gun, screamed a lot, and ran away.  That's how I'd write this article.  But you know me.  I'm just a big old bootleg jerk.  Whatever.  All right, we'll end that there. ",
