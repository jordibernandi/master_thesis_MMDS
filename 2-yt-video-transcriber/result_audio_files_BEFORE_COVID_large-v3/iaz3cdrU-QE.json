            "text": "Hey there, stackers and other smart investors.  This is Half Dollar coming at you from Silver Doctors.  Today I want to talk about a few things that people should be considering when they're buying gold and silver coins, bars, and rounds.  This is an investment and it's a big decision and it's not always easy to know what is it that I should be buying.  Case in point, fractional silver.  Now, what is fractional silver?  Fractional silver are those coins, bars, and rounds that are in weights less than one ounce, right?  So we're talking about three quarters of an ounce, half ounce, tenth of an ounce, even go down to one gram in size and get little one gram rounds, little one gram bars.  The thing about fractional silver is that there's a lot of heated debate about whether a person should invest in fractional silver.  On the one hand, people say that the premium is too high.  You're paying more for your silver to get that smaller size.  On the other hand, people say that fractional silver works better in a barter scenario because you don't want to barter part of that 100 ounce bar.  you don't want to shave off part of that 100 ounce bar right.  it'd be nice to have a half ounce coin if something is in a barter scenario where that would be the ideal amount to exchange.  so the question is is fractional silver too expensive?  i don't think so and i'd like to show an example.  check this out.  there's a half ounce buffalo right there if i can zoom in on it.  there we go nine nine nine find silver half ounce buffalo but there's a half dollar.  right.  this is fractional silver right.  check this out.  let me put this half dollar right beside this generic round here.  it's pretty much the same size right.  so what's my point with that?  my point is silver has been so unloved for so many years and the premiums have been going down for so many years that in my opinion I think fractional silver is in fact a wise investment decision especially when it comes to ninety percent.  ninety percent is government issued fractional silver.  right because you know you've got your standard silver dollar here right.  here's a Morgan right.  so when the coinage act of 1792 defined the dollar what they defined the dollar as was a specific weight and purity of silver, right?  So a half dollar, right?  Like this walking Liberty right here.  I've also got a Franklin right here.  I've also got Kennedy, 1964 Kennedy right here, right?  So a half dollar is half of the weight of a dollar, right?  So what we're talking about is, fractional silver.  Here's the Kennedy, half dollar.  Here's the silver dollar.  There's the Franklin, and there's the silver dollar.  We can get the weight even smaller with a dime.  This is even more fractional than the half dollar, right?  So what does fractional silver mean?  Fractional silver means that 10 dimes is going to be the same weight and purity as one silver dollar, right?  Two half dollars is going to be the same weight and purity as one silver dollar, right?  What about four quarters?  I got four quarters here.  Here's some quarters, some Washingtons, right?  Four quarters is the same weight and purity as one dollar, right?  Two quarters is the same weight and purity as a half dollar, right?  This is fractional silver.  This is really cool stuff.  Now here's what's cool about fractional silver.  Here's what's cool about the market right now.  Fractional silver has a very low premium.  So when people say that fractional silver is too expensive, right now that is not the case.  Now I'm not telling anybody to buy anything right now.  I'm not saying go out and buy this, go out and buy that.  I'm just saying here's some things to think about, right, when you're buying gold and silver.  And I'm going to use SD Bullion as an example here.  Alright, here is a $10 face value of 90% silver.  Now, you don't get to choose, right?  So, you know, there's some standing liberty quarters there, there's a barber dime, I can see if I move my head a little bit, there's a merc dime, there's a rosy.  You know, you're not going to really know what it is that you're getting.  But the point is, is that 49 cents over spot, that's a heck of a deal on fractional silver, right?  And not only that, but there's a finite supply of this.  So when the various private mints are making half ounce rounds, like this buffalo right here, the sky's the limit.  They can make as many as they want.  But they're no longer making half ounce walking liberties.  So this is a point that I want to make.  90% silver is so unloved, silver in general is so unloved right now, that you got premiums of 49 cents over spot on fractional silver, right?  And not only that, but this has the potential to rise as far as the premium goes.  Perhaps people who were stacking in 2015, 2016 remember the shortage, the rationing of American silver eagles.  And... When that came about, another thing that happened was people were scooping up fractional silver.  They were scooping up 90%, right?  Because there were some supply issues going on.  premiums on 90% silver have the ability to appreciate.  And I'm talking about several dollars, right?  In late 2015, in September 2015, if you were looking for 90% fractional silver, you would have been paying like $5, $6, over $6 over spot per ounce for fractional silver.  Yes, that's expensive.  But look at the potential there, right?  Because right now the premium is ultra low because silver has been so unloved for so long.  So not only is fractional silver, viable again as an option but you have the possibility for fractional silver to appreciate not just in the silver price right not just in the value of the silver and the value of the metal but also in the value of the of the premium right because there's a finite supply of this and this is one of the the barometers of the silver market in and of itself right just as the american silver eagle is a staple.  the stagger community 90% is also a staple in the stacker community and it's fractional silver really cool.  so these are just a few things that I wanted to talk about related to fractional silver.  here You can barter with it in a grid down Teotihuacan SHTF scenario.  You can more easily exchange it because it's easier to sell a few half ounce, three quarters of an ounce rounds or coins, it's easier to sell a bag of 90%, right?  It's easier to sell 90% quarters than it is to sell thousand ounce bars.  Just, I'm talking about locally, right?  And just normal times going out and about.  So the point is, fractional silver is not that expensive right now, right?  Because silver has been so unloved.  Now, it's true, right?  Once more interest comes back in the sector and more people start investing in gold and silver, then those premiums are going to go back up, right?  Because you have supply and demand coming into an actual real physical market for physical gold and silver.  So during our live show on Wednesday, Mike and I also discussed a few things that people should be considering when they're buying gold and silver coins.  And at this time, I would like to just direct everybody's attention to that clip.  I'd like to play that clip and I'd like to know, the comments below what do you think about fractional silver?  do you think fractional silver is a good deal?  are you buying fractional silver?  I am and I'm gonna keep buying it.  I really like 90% because I think the premium has the potential to appreciate in price in addition to the silver value.  so it's like a double win.  right but enjoy this little segment that I've split out of our livestream from Wednesday and here's a few more things that people can consider when they're buying gold and silver coins.  I want to talk about some of the things people should think about when they're buying gold and silver.  This is important.  I'm not trying to pump a product.  I'm trying to talk about decisions that people should make.  But these coins are so fresh, Mike.  They don't even have the actual pictures of the coins.  They have the designs on the SD Bullion website.  This is called the giraffe, and I don't know if it's the world's wildlife.  I thought it was wildlife world.  It's World's Wildlife Series.  This is called the draft.  This is one ounce.  This is 4-9 fine gold.  This is a beautiful coin.  And it comes encapsulated like this.  But what I want to talk about are some of the things that people should be thinking about when they're making the decision to buy gold or silver coins.  This is the silver one.  And I got a little bit of smudges on it because I'm having trouble putting these things down because they're that beautiful.  I like looking at them.  You know, it doesn't really show this on the website because, like I said, these things are fresh off of the presses.  They still have the illustrative designs, not the actual photos of the coins, on the website at SD Point.  So my point is, these are brand new.  This gold coin right here, this is point number one.  Okay, point number one is, and I got some points here.  I want to make sure I hit all my points.  So I got the website up, and I'm thumbing through it as you speak.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Yeah, so point number one, there's only 1,000.  I've got one of these 1,000 coins.  There's only 1,000 of these made.  These are actual coins, right?  This is not a round.  This is an actual coin.  Check this out.  You see where that's from?  That's from the Republic of Congo right there, right?  So this is an actual coin.  Guess who's not on the back, Mike?  Guess who's not on the back?  I really like it.  And why is that?  Because... this design is going to change every single year, right?  So that's another reason people can think about when they're buying gold and silver, right?  Series.  This is the first in a series.  SD Boyin is the only company that has This gold coin in North America, the giraffe, the World's Wildlife Series from the Republic of Congo.  Oh, and it's made by Geiger Edelmetau, right?  I don't even know how to say the second word, but it's German mint, right?  So think about this.  I mean, there's just so much awesome interest with gold and silver that African countries, working in conjunction with German mints, coming up with an agreement with S.D.  Boyan to produce actual coins.  This has a face value on it, Mike.  That's it.  100 francs, yeah.  Isn't this cool?  This is 4.95.  This is a really, really nice coin.  And it comes in the capsule like that.  But my point is, what are some of the things people should think about when they're buying gold and silver?  With that gold coin, there's only 1,000 of those that are minted.  What does that mean?  That means that that is rare, right?  That's a rare type of coin.  That's what you call semi-numismatic, right?  Because it's not like a graded and slapped coin, but you still have two possibilities for appreciation.  You have the appreciation for gold, and you have the appreciation for the rareness of that coin in and of itself.  I did the math, Mike, and I'm making it simple.  So let's say it's $1,600 for that coin.  At $1,000, this means that someone could drop $1.6 million and buy up every single one of these gold coins.  But wait until I get to silver.  It gets even crazier than that.  So my point is when people are buying gold and silver coins, one of the things that they can be thinking about is, will I have a chance for the premium to appreciate in addition to the price of the metal in and of itself?  Then that's like a win-win.  That's like a double win right there.  The other thing about buying a coin is, you know, is there appeal to a broad range of people?  Like, think about this, Mike.  Who would this coin appeal to right here?  When I'm thinking about these coins, I'm thinking this coin has appeal to people who are into wildlife, right?  It's a wildlife series.  Speaking of series, this coin has appeal to people who are into collecting series.  You've heard of the Perth Mint Lunar Series, right, Mike?  Yeah, yeah.  This is based on, you know, the lunar calendar, the Chinese lunar calendar.  And those are series.  So this is the first in a series, right?  There's only a thousand of those gold coins.  One of the things people look for is, you know, if you buy a complete set of American silver eagles, that costs more.  than an incomplete set.  right because people want that complete series.  so this is brand new right and it's not something that's going to be around and the mintage is limited.  these silver coins right here these silver ones are limited to 30 000 only 30 000 of these.  you know how much money could buy up every single one of these coins mike?  uh third so let me see 30 000 times.  uh 23 dollars give or take i don't know i don't know.  man give me give me your math.  Less than 750 grand, Mike.  We're not talking about, like, any money at all, right?  Someone with deep pockets could buy every single one of these coins as well, too.  But, no, it's really cool because I don't know if they're calling this proof, right?  It's not really proof, but it's definitely a mirrored finish.  And I got some, you know, fingerprints all over it because I've been playing with these things all morning because I really can't put them down.  They're that beautiful.  But they're really nice.  They have that really deep mirrored finish.  But my points were you've got... The appeal, broad appeal, right?  People who are into wildlife, people who are into Africa, people who are into low mintages, people who are into collecting series of coins, right?  So that's one.  You've got... Beyond what like Perth Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint and all them do, you've got diversity in the coin in and of itself because one side of that coin isn't always reserved for the queen, right?  You've got limited mintage, you got depreciation.  So there's just a number of things to think about when buying a gold or silver coin.  These right here are definitely something to think about.  You know, those are like those like those tree of life coins that were also exclusively SD boy.  And those things sold out.  And because you never really know.  Right.  You don't know, like how the appeal is going to be.  Right.  Because like for me, I'm not into collecting.  a lot of the coins with the queen on the back, but I do own a lot of the dogs, the Year of the Dog for 2018 from the Perth Mint.  Why is that?  Because I like dogs.  I really like dogs.  I really like the German Shepherd on it.  It's got a German Shepherd with the German Shepherd puppy on it.  I mean, it's a beautiful coin, right?  So this is the same thing, right?  This has awesome appeal.  It is a beautiful coin.  It's the first in a series.  Next year, the design is going to change.  And it doesn't even, you know, the premium isn't even that expensive.  I don't know if they're calling it a semi-numismatic on the SD Boyan website.  But to me, this would be what you would call a semi-numismatic coin.  Or a coin that has the potential to increase in numismatic value in addition to the value of the silver.  It's kind of like the American Silver Eagle from... 1996. right that's the lowest mintage of american silver eagles and that's the one that goes for the most right.  so my point is you know just buying.  oh and that's the other thing.  this is actually a government coin.  right this is not around.  this is actually a coin.  it's got a face value on it.  so you know.  my point there is that you know you can buy something that still has a decent premium on it that has the potential for that premium to rise in addition to the metal.  I'm rambling on way more than I should.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm listening and learning, so I appreciate it.  So good stuff, my friend.  So let's get to the chat.  Anybody in the chat got any questions or thoughts?  We got some good comments on the coin.  We got Cuba.  Void says he thinks that the animal coins are lame.  I don't know.  I think that they're awesome.  You know, in the African coins, like the Somalian one has \u2013 I don't have that coin on me.  I mean, I own the coin, but I don't have it right now.  It would take me a while to get it.  But dig it out.  But the African, the Somali one does some really cool elephants, right?  I think it's Chad, right?  Chad did a really cool Deathstalker scorpion coin.  I got some of those.  So I actually like the animal-themed coins.  You know, it comes down to what you like as your personal preference, right?  Exactly, yeah.  Good point. ",
