Warrants say Valeria was an accessory after the fact of Keith Smith killing his wife.  The acting police commissioner said investigators learned Smith and his daughter were out of state.  They were arrested in Harlingen, Texas, not far from the Mexican border.  Smith has a history of committing serious crimes for money.  This was the scene in September of 2000, when Smith led police on a chase, then crashed into a city patrol car, sending an officer to the hospital.  Smith was pursued as a bank robbery suspect.  Once arrested, police reports say, he admitted to robbing the same bank in Timonium three times.  His  M.O.,  forcing tellers to the floor at gunpoint and ordering them to turn over the money.  He told investigators he was HIV positive and needed the money to raise his daughter.  Now, Smith and Valeria Smith have waived expedition on the murder charges and could be back in Maryland within a few days.  The district attorney in Cameron County, Texas released a statement in this case which reads in part, this high-profile case is generating national interest because the Smiths are accused of fabricating an elaborate story in which the victim was killed by a panhandler.  Maryland authorities, the statement goes on now, have reason to believe they are the main suspects in the murder.  According to a Baltimore police spokesman, Homicide detectives from Baltimore will be in Texas by tomorrow, hoping to interview Keith Smith there.  Reporting live tonight from East Baltimore. ",

            "text": "All right, my royal family.  So, y'all here, we all heard it together.  So he is HIV positive.  So this is how the stuff, how I'm looking at it.  Okay, once the police were doing their investigation, once Jacqueline got killed, they always look up the records of the closest people around them.  So naturally when they pulled her husband's record, they seen that he had robbed multiple banks and he had to spend, um, you know, they see he's a criminal, spend some time in jail.  So, it made them based on his record have to look at him deeper because if he was he you know he confessed that he robbed you know rob banks and he got HIV.  so um now let's get to the HIV part.  um maybe it was revealed and they had a heated argument but I'm not going to speak in the absolutes, but I don't think this woman knew that her husband was HIV positive and when she possibly discovered it, it got real heated.  because usually when people are killing you with a knife, nine times out of ten it's not premeditated.  They usually use a gun.  It's not always a given.  Um, and the daughter was right there.  Now, my theory about the daughter, I still keep that in place because she is 28 years old and she hanging on her daddy, you know, and she's living with them.  And they did say that, um, the, um, um, Jacqueline's family, they did say that she did not get along with her stepdaughter.  So she probably, you know, just, shoot, my daddy going to take care of everything.  I'm just going to lay up, you know, lay up in the house, you know, I'm, you know, be highly dysfunctional.  So that would cause friction in the household.  So it makes an unquote perfect storm.  Possibly you knew it was inappropriate behavior with his daughter.  She discovers that she's HIV positive and also she might have even discovered his criminal past.  wow I did not I'm it.  I did not see that come coming at all.  I really didn't what it do me for a loop.  I said I can sit on this one.  I gotta do this video now right now because it just that their vibe is weird.  you know the vibe is really really weird but but it still.  it has not been revealed why he actually So remember the part.  I'm going to call this a crime of passion because you want to, you know, you don't want anything revealed.  And his daughter harbors her father's secrets.  So for them to run off.  off into the unquote sunset, yeah, they got an inappropriate behavior.  And it is really, really sad, my royal family.  We have to really, you know, when you hook up with somebody new, you really got to find out who they are.  You really need to find out if they do have HIV, you know, because some people don't care.  They'll have sex with people raw, and it doesn't matter.  And, whew.  That's tongue twister there.  I really hate that.  that sister experienced that and went through all of that.  But I bet you up to the moment of there was a lot of turmoil and trauma.  in that house you know a lot of mental gains because when you got people harboring secrets and stuff um you feel that.  so it wasn't.  it wasn't pleasant for all three of them to be living together and she's basically the breadwinner.  um i think don't hold me to it.  i think she's an engineer, but don't hold me to it, my royal family.  So anyway, I just wanted to give y'all an update.  So my royal family, render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, I shake. ",
