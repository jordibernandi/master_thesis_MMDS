The politics that it breeds.  And I'm speaking of course, now this measure failed in Georgia, but you may have read of this piece about this town in Georgia that had, that basically it's become a very, it's like growing in population and they film a lot of movies there.  It's become sort of like the southern Hollywood because of like a lot of tax breaks.  It's called Stockbridge, Georgia.  And basically they were voting on election day to resegregate their town.  Yeah, they wanted it.  Basically, it's a town that just elected its first black mayor and has an all black city council.  The white residents of the town basically got on the ballot a measure to split the city in two between the white part and the black part and basically take away all of the tax base of the white part.  And essentially they were doing this so they could get a Cheesecake Factory and a P.F.  Chang's.  I'm reading here from this. ",
