But I think it is worth spending some time on the life and career of Joe Biden because basically his career in American politics is uniquely awful in almost every way.  And to start, to prepare for this, I went back to one of my Bibles, one of these tomes that I thumb through from time to time when I'm feeling down and need to connect with some of the wisdom of people who have come before me.  I'm speaking, of course, about Alexander Coburn's A Colossal Wreck, A Road Trip Through Political Scandal, Corruption, and American Culture.  And I knew Alex would have some good words about Joe Biden, and I'd like to start by doing a very rare anti-reading series.  By anti-reading series, I mean I'm going to read you something that's actually good.  This was written in August 23rd, 2008, around the time Joe Biden became Obama's running mate.  Change and hope are not words.  one associates with Senator Joe Biden, a man so ripely symbolic of everything that is unchanging and hopeless about our political system that a computer simulation of the corporate political paradigm, Senator in Congress, would turn out Biden in a nanosecond.  The first duty of any senator from Delaware is to do the bidding of the banks and the large corporations that use the tiny state as a drop box and legal sanctuary.  Biden has never failed his masters in his primary task.  Find any bill that sticks to the ordinary folk on behalf of the money power, and you'll likely detect Biden's hand at work.  The Bankruptcy Act of 2005 was just one example.  In concert with his fellow corporate serf, Senator Tom Carper, Biden blocked all efforts to hinder bankrupt corporations from fleeing their real locations to the legal sanctuary of Delaware.  Since Obama is himself a corporate serf and from day one in the U.S.  Senate has been attentive to the same masters that employ Biden, the ticket is well balanced.  The seesaw with Obama at one end and Biden at the other dead level on the fulcrum of the corporate capital.  Another shining moment in Biden's progress in the current presidential term was his conduct in the hearings on Judge Alito's nomination to the U.S.  Supreme Court.  From the opening moments of the Judiciary Committee's session in January 2006, it became clear that Alito faced no serious opposition.  On that first ludicrous morning, Senator Pat Leahy sank his head into his hands, shaking in an unbelieving despair as Biden blathered out a self-serving and inane monologue lasting a full 20 minutes before he even asked Alito one question.  In his allotted half hour, Biden managed to pose only five questions, all of them ineptly phrased.  He did pose two questions about Alito's membership of a racist society at Princeton, but had already undercut them in his monologue by calling Alito a man of integrity, not once but twice, and further trivialized the interrogation by reaching under the dais to pull out a Princeton cap and put it on.  What? ",

His vanity deludes him into believing that every word that drops from his mouth is minted in the golden currency of Pericles.  Vanity is the most conspicuous characteristic of U.S.  senators en bloc, nourished by deferential acolytes and often expressed in loudest sexual advances to staffers, interns, and the like.  Why did Obama choose Biden?  One important constituency for Biden was no doubt the Israel lobby inside the Democratic Party.  Obama, no matter how fervent his proclamations of support for Israel, has always been viewed with some suspicion by the lobby. ",

Bush delivered a speech outlining his national drug control strategy, in which he called for harsher punishments for drug dealers, nearly $1.5 billion towards drug-related law enforcement, and more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors at every level throughout the country.  At the time, the Heritage Foundation gushed that it constituted the largest increase in resources for law enforcement in the nation's history, and it's now remembered as a key moment in the escalation of the war on drugs.  For Biden, however, it was a half measure.  Quite frankly, the president's plan is not tough enough, bold enough, or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand, Biden said in a televised response to Bush's speech.  In a nutshell, the president's plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them, or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.

In the 1980s, Biden worked with his, quote, old buddy, arch-segregationist Strom Thurmond, to pass several bills that fundamentally reshaped the American criminal justice system in the direction of more incarceration.  They, along with Ted Kennedy, had worked on earlier unsuccessful proposals that raised maximum penalties, removed a directive requiring the U.S.  Sentencing Commission to take into account prison capacity, and created the cabinet-level drug czar position.  In 1984, they passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which, among other things, abolished parole, imposed a less generous cap on good-time sentence reductions, and allowed the Sentencing Commission to issue more punitive guidelines.  Just following up that little hyperlink about his good buddy Strom Thurmond, I came across this anecdote.  Joe Biden delivered Strom Thurmond's eulogy at Strom's own request, saying of it.  Oh, God.  He says, some of you knew my relationship with Strom.  Did I ever think when I got here I would become friends with Strom Thurmond?  He stood for everything, everything.  I got started because of civil rights.  Yet, on his 100th birthday, again, evil people never fucking die.  God damn it, it's just awful.  Yet, on his 100th birthday, shortly thereafter, on his deathbed, I got a phone call from his wife, Nancy.  She said, I'm standing here at the nurse's station, Joe, with the doctor.  Just left Strom.

And this will bring us back once again to the issue of the Israel lobby.  Alexander Coburn writing in July 10th, 2009, after he's become vice president, writes, appropriately, it was on the topic of Israel.  as vice president, Biden first tossed aside unmanly prudence.  Even given the zeal of almost every member of the US Congress to satisfy the Israel lobby, Biden has always been conspicuous for his slavish posture towards the holy state.  Accepting Obama's offer of the vice presidential nomination last summer, he announced emphatically that he would not have considered accepting the invitation if he had entertained the slightest suspicion that Obama was not 100% in Israel's corner.  In fact, the Israel lobby did entertain these unworthy suspicions, which is why it pushed strongly for Biden as Veep.  It wasn't far into Obama's first months in the White House that the lobby began to feel that even though Obama's chief of staff is Rahm Emanuel, their suspicions were justified.  The president dared to mention in public the right of Palestinians to some form of state.  He said that the settlements on the West Bank had to stop.  True, he didn't say anything categorical about the actually existing illegal settlements.  He seemed too eager to parlay with Iran, too demure on the topic of its nuclear program.  On July 5th, George Stephanopoulos interviewed Biden in Baghdad for his Sunday morning talk show on the ABC network and promptly put the question, if the Israelis decide Iran is an existential threat and they have to take out the nuclear program militarily, the United States will not stand in the way?  Biden lunged for the driver's wheel and swerved US government policy in a whole new direction.  We cannot dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do when they make a determination.  If they make a determination, they're existentially threatened and their survival is threatened by another country.  The White House spent the next two days categorically denying that it was giving via Biden Israel the go ahead to make a unilateral attack on Iran.  The United States is absolutely not flashing Israel a green light to attack Iran, U.S.  President Barack Obama told CNN in Moscow on July 7th.  Then, in the same Stephanopoulos interview, Biden sucker-punched Obama again, addressing the failure of Obama's stimulus program to halt the surge in unemployment and prompt recovery, a failure that has the president tumbling in the polls.  In devising this program, Biden confided to Stephanopoulos, the Obama administration had misread the extent of the economic catastrophe it inherited.  The truth is we and everyone else misread the economy.  The figures we worked off of in January were the consensus figures and most of the blue chip indexes out there.  So once again, back to Biden and his wonderful views on foreign policy and on banking. ",
