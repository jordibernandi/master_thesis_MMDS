Trump made it happen.  I know people that worked on it, that lobbied for it.

So we can have them watch the debate between us and a leftist, and they'll say, you know what, I don't really follow politics, but I'm definitely not that lady saying Donald Trump is worse than Hitler.  So as many of those as we can do, that's going to be the key to 2020.  53% of eligible voters don't vote.  So really focus your energy on engaging your apolitical friends that don't follow politics.  We can wake them up with a few videos.  And once they say something that's as easy as Donald Trump is not that bad, once they say something like that, they're not going to be progressive enough for the mob.  They're going to be kicked out of the mob.  And we have to scoop them up with a more appealing community and culture. ",
