            "text": "and welcome to Matt Baume's Culture Cruise, where we take a deep dive on LGBTQ themes in the entertainment we love.  This time we're looking at Maud's New Friend, a 1973 episode of the sitcom Maud, in which Bea Arthur gets a gay bestie who turns out to be a bit less fun than she expected.  Culture Cruise is made possible by the folks who pledged their support on Patreon, folks like Tony Holowinski.  Thanks Tony!  Head over to Patreon.com slash Matt Baume or click the link in the description to check out the rewards available to backers.  And a big thanks to viewer Andrew, who helped me track down high quality clips for this video.  If you're not familiar, the show Maud was a spin-off from All in the Family.  Bea Arthur plays Maud, an outspoken liberal feminist, and each episode deals with some current topical issue like reproductive freedom or racism or marijuana policy.  You know, the very same things that we are still dealing with to this day.  Despite airing nearly 50 years ago, this episode touches on homosexuality in some ways that feel surprisingly current.  But in other ways, it can also feel very dated.  So just a heads-up, we're going to be talking about a show from the 70s that was known for courting controversy, and there's going to be some frank language that includes some slurs and some gay jokes.  Just so you're prepared.  The episode starts with us hearing quite a bit about Maude's new friend.  We learn that he's coming over for dinner, his name's Barry Witherspoon, and Maude's husband Walter isn't a fan.  Barry Witherspoon?  Not Barry Witherspoon! ",

Back then, homosexuality was illegal across most of the United States, and the movement to legalize same-sex relationships was just getting started.  No openly queer person had ever been elected to office, and Pride celebrations were a brand new concept.  Today, queer characters have gained so much acceptance that the kids' show Arthur just had a same-sex wedding.  And when a station in Alabama refused to air it, there was a huge outcry.  Now imagine what it must have been like 50 years ago, when TV barely acknowledged your existence.  And then when it did, was to call you mentally ill, or a killer.  In fact, this episode ran just one year after the American Psychological Association voted to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness, which was at the time a controversial move.  So while the nation's top psychologists were still debating whether gay people are all sick, this TV show showed a bunch of people just casually looking forward to hanging out with a gay guy.  It must have been nice, as a gay person who only just learned that you do not in fact have a mental illness, to see that regular folks might not think there's anything wrong with you.  I also want to point out that Maude is particularly intense about expressing her support for Barry, to the point that she tries to shut down any talk about his homosexuality.  Every time someone tells a joke... Why is Maude getting so furious at everyone?  Well, Walter has a theory. ",

Even for me, I live in about as gay a bubble as a person can, and I still worry about walking into a situation or bumping into a person that's just going to turn on me.  Sometimes I feel that temptation to be a Barry and just be mean to strangers as a kind of armor.  It's especially easy to do when you're extremely online, and you never actually have to look at somebody in their real face.  When you know that there's a good chance people are going to be awful to you, one way to respond is to be even worse to them first.  But there's a downside to being preemptively awful to everyone, and that's that it makes it really hard to have friends.  I mean, real friends.

Well, for one thing, it just kinda sucks to be laughed at.  But one laugh and he never wants to see her again?  Surely a friend could just let that slide.  Maybe Maude's laughter makes it seem like she never took Barry seriously.  Maybe Maude's suggesting that it's ridiculous for a straight man to be jealous of a gay man.  Maybe Barry's got some internalized homophobia and infers that Maude's mocking him for being gay.  Maybe there were some lines in the script that made it clearer, but the network made them take it out.  Maybe this is some 70s thing that we just don't get today.  I ran this scene by a couple people, including some who wrote for TV around the time this episode aired, and nobody could really crack it.  So I'd love to hear from you.

So for all their talk, it turns out they really do harbor bigotry, and the show fades out on Maude being a totally clueless hypocrite by not even recognizing it.  Ultimately, I think that slur at the end confirms what Walter was saying.  It is important to confront bias, especially unconscious bias.  I just think something got left out of this episode.  Whether it was a line that got deleted by a censor, or just wasn't written clearly, there was still a lot more that needed to be said about recognizing implicit bias.  And that wasn't just needed on Maude, but on TV in general.  In the wake of Stonewall in 1969, queer people rapidly gained public visibility, but TV was still trying to figure out how to portray gay characters.  So there were bound to be some hits and some misses.  A year earlier, The Mary Tyler Moore Show featured a gay character, and they also had an interesting way of handling it.  The episode keeps it a secret that he's gay until the last 30 seconds.  I have a separate video about that one on my YouTube channel.  And what's more, Maud herself came around four years later and offered much stronger support in an episode that aired in December of 1977, just one month after Harvey Milk was elected.  In that episode, Maud's neighbors have a much more explicit bias. ",

            "text": "Maybe this change is due in part to everything that happened in the real world between Maud's new friend and Maud's gay bar.  There was a lot of new queer activism between 73 and 77.  A bunch of states decriminalized homosexuality, Harvey Milk was elected, President Carter met with gay activists at the White House, someone hit anti-gay icon Anita Bryant with a pie, protests got louder, gay pride got bigger, and queer people made more and more noise.  America was in the process of confronting decades-old, deeply held biases.  And it was messy and chaotic, and sometimes tragic.  But after all that time being whispered about, being told that gay people are sick, being left as implications and inferences, there had to be noise, and a lot of it, if those biases were ever going to be overcome.  When I look back on this episode and what was happening in the real world, what I see is that bigotry isn't something that you can just imply and infer your way out of, especially when it's something so deeply ingrained that it's hard to even see.  I think it's something you've got to do on purpose, confronting bias directly, even when it hurts to hear, because otherwise it'll just stick around, always simmering in the background, until someone finally shines a spotlight on it, calls it out, hits it with a pie, turns it into the butt of a joke.
