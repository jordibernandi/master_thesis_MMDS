            "text": "What's going on guys, welcome to the video.  Lib Dem leader Joe Swinson appeared on Sky News earlier today to discuss misleading election campaign material that appeared to show the Lib Dems as the main challenger in the South East Somerset seat currently held by Tory MP and leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg.  When in actual fact, The Lib Dems only got 8% of the vote in that seat back in 2017, with the Labour Party on 34.7% and Jacob Rees-Mogg getting 53% of the vote respectively in that constituency.  So, clearly not what the illiberal undemocrats are trying to pump out.  The Sky News host even points out that Joe Swinson and the Lib Dems have previous form when it comes to misleading campaign material.  Why am I not surprised by that?  Now as you can guess, she refuses to apologise for this blatantly forced poll aimed at swaying the mind of the average voter who won't read the small print like most people don't bother to.  But she is not finished there.  She claims Labour voters in that area who backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 are going to back her now because Labour let them down when it comes to remaining in the EU.  Which is just another astonishingly stupid comment made by Jo Swinson.  Now enough talking about it, let's check out the interview itself. ",

Now, I just want to have a look at this.  This is North East Somerset, the Liberal Democrats in North East Somerset.  Liberal Democrat campaign literature.  Results of a survey done in the constituency of Jacob Rees-Mogg.  You would think this was a two-horse race, wouldn't you?  Between the Conservatives on 38% and the Lib Dems on 32%.  Until you look at the very, very tiny small print at the bottom.  which says the question was, imagine that the result in your constituency was expected to be very close between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates and none of the other parties were competitive.  In this scenario, which party would you vote for?  And I just want to show the last result from this constituency at the last election, which hopefully we should be able to bring up now.  which shows that actually the Conservatives won 53% and Labour won 34%.  The Lib Dems won 8.3%.  I mean, this is entirely misleading, isn't it?  Well, I think politics... It's embarrassing. ",

            "text": "No, it has.  I love how Joe sits there nodding when the host points out the Liberal Democrats are well known for lying to the voters in campaign literature.  Like, we don't care that we are lying, cheating, undemocratic slime.  We know what's best for the stupid working classes, so do as you're told, you peasants.  The complete snobbery and entitlement of this bint really annoys me.  You can tell that the host is shocked by how misleading the poll is, and as I said earlier, the video itself shows the actual results from 2017, that puts the Lib Dems on 8%, meaning the chances of them making a 45 point swing against Jacob Rees-Mogg to take that seat, nearly zero.  Her excuses for the bullshit poll they have imagined up is incredible though.  When the host states it's entirely misleading and embarrassing, Joe Swinson responds with, well, politics has changed dramatically since 2017.  Like that is an excuse for the embarrassment that is this imagined poll designed to swing voters' minds.  It begs belief.  how it's even legal, considering a company cannot just print bullshit about its products like we see these politicians do.  To simply respond that politics has changed over the last few years has to be the dumbest defense of a blatant lie I have ever heard.  I mean you can see at the end the Skyhost is even laughing at her, it's that bad.  Now let's continue because Jo is not finished yet. ",

And part of the reason for that is that the people who voted Labour in 2017... because they thought that Labour would stand up to remain in the EU have been bitterly disappointed.  And they know that now it's the Liberal Democrats who are the place to vote for if you want to stop Brexit. ",

            "text": "So when all else fails, Joe Swinson goes back to the same old bullshit that this dopey bin has been pushing for the last few years.  days, claiming that the Lib Dems beat the Tories and Labour Party at the last national election, of course referring to the EU elections in May.  Completely omitting the fact that the Brexit Party absolutely smashed the EU elections like 12 weeks after the party was created, making them the single largest party in the European Parliament currently.  The Lib Dems beat a destitute Labour Party run by the Corbynated Chicken and a Tory government run by the incompetent Maybot.  But they all got their arses handed to them at the end of the day by the Brexit Party.  So her claims that politics are changing is not backing up the agenda she is trying to push, if using the EU elections as a metric to gauge public opinion.  Because, of course, the Brexit party will be the most popular party and should get a majority if that was the case.  Now, we all know the EU elections are never the same as a general election, so the Lib Dems are dreaming here by doubling down to use dishonest interpretations of the EU election results in a crazy attempt to try and defend the dishonest poll in their campaign material.  it seems the only thing the Liberal Democrats are liberal with is the truth.  Which is amazing considering they run around calling Boris Johnson a liar consistently.  I mean, she even attempts to claim that they labelled the question the poll was answering clearly, when in actual fact the question was hidden in the small print underneath the poll because the Lib Dems PR team told them to put it there as 90% of readers won't bother to check the small print and so will go on to believe what the poll claims and think the Lib Dems are actually contenders in East Somerset.  But she finished up that clip with an absolute peach.  She said part of the reason Jacob Rees-Mogg has a Lib Dem councillor right now is because the people who voted Labour in 2017 thought Labour would stand up for remaining in the EU.  When, as we all know, the Labour manifesto was pledging to honour the referendum result.  meaning they had no plans to remain in the EU at all.  I'm sorry, Joe, but this is just more misleading bullshit.  It's really pretty stupid sitting there claiming people backed Labour in 2017 thinking they was going to remain in the EU.  And let's now remain.  voters are just like Brexiteers to Joe Swinson.  You know, they didn't know what they was voting for or are too stupid to understand the question.  Because of course the only way a Labour voter would have voted for Labour thinking that they were going to remain in the EU is if they didn't read the manifesto or watch any television for a couple of months in the lead up to the election in 2017.  Because like I said, Labour stated they would honour the referendum result and leave the EU.  No wonder the Lib Dems are continuing to tank in the other polls.  Maybe that's why they are using these made-up ones, because the real ones don't say what they want. ",

When in In actual fact, the Lib Dems are well known for being liberal with the truth when it comes to campaign literature, as I've said already.  Jo, like an idiot, decides to double down and claim the Boris bus \u00a3350 million to the NHS bore no semblance to reality.  So it's not the same as her campaign poll nonsense.  Clearly forgetting the shit she is on here trying to defend is not based in reality.  Remember, the Tories and Labour took 90% of the vote in that given constituency in 2017.  That is a reality.  The shit you put out in this campaign material is literally so far from reality, it's unreal.  It seems the Ramonas are only good at one thing, blatant hypocrisy.  But on that note, I'm going to end the video there.  These Remain MPs really need to stay off TV because they are just making themselves look like complete idiots to the electorate, which is of course good for us, but counterproductive to what they want.  Now, we just need Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to stop with the party political bullshit and figure out a way forward.  The nonsense over the last few days will only serve to embolden the Remainers who are in complete disarray right now with the People's Vote campaign shitting the bed and the Lib Dems and SNP defying the Labour Party and Tory rebel Ramona's wishes to reject a general election because a lot of these Labour MPs and the Tory rebels know the time is coming when the British voter are going to destroy these traitors at the ballot box.

Twice they have been asked to let the electorate decide upon whether they should continue to sit in their seats while they block 17.4 million people.  This Parliament is a disgrace.  But they're too cowardly to give it away.  But the time is coming, the time is coming, Mr Speaker, when even these turkeys won't be able to prevent Christmas. ",
