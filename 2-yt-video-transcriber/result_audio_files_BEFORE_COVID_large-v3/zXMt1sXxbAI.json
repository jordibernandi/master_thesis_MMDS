            "text": "Hello and welcome back to Redirecting.  I'm going to be sharing a video clip with you all that many are sharing across the internet in regards to Kobe Bryant going down in a helicopter.  It is a cartoon that was Very short, but it depicted him going down in a helicopter crash.  So I'm going to go ahead and roll this video clip and I will be right back.  See, that is very strange.  I hear a lot of conspiracy theories swirling around this incident.  I'm not going to get off into all of that trying to unravel any of it because I'm pretty sure that many will cover that.  But I do want to say that I think it's very strange.  This is right around the time of the Grammy Awards.  And then he goes down in this plane and it's reported that one of his daughters was in the plane as well.  And she also died.  This is a very tragic thing.  But it does leave us to wonder what is going on here.  When you look at the fact that there was a depiction of him going down in a helicopter, and then there was the explosion of that cartoon clip with the helicopter.  We're talking about the Grammys, and now he's dead.  And so that is definitely something that I'm sure many people will uh try to unravel.  i just wanted to share this video clip with you because i do think it's very strange.  it is very strange.  he dies on january 26 right around the time of the grammy awards and there was a previous cartoon clip depicting this.  Tell me what you think in the comment section, family.  What do you think?  This is very tragic, but I would definitely like to hear your thoughts on this.  I'm out. ",
