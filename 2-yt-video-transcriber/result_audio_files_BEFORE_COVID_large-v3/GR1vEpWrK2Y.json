            "text": "Well, the dumbass Democrats begin to eat their own.  Did these morons learn anything from the Jussie Smollett fiasco?  Apparently not.  Oh, Joe Biden tried to kiss me.  Boo hoo, boo hoo.  I tell you, these people.  Well, look at the picture.  Here's Joe Biden next to Miss Flores.  You notice his arm is not even around Miss Flores.  And I don't blame him.  Just look at her.  I mean, she dropped out of high school.  She stole a car.  She joined a gang.  And she's crying about an old 70-year-old man stealing a kiss.  I tell you.  And then Joe Biden.  Think about this.  Old Joe Biden took the time out of his life, the limited amount of time he has on this planet, and he took some of that precious time.  He came to Nevada.  And he pushed Miss Flores up into the limelight.  Can you imagine?  The guy was the vice president.  Makes a special trip to Las Vegas to put you up in the air.  Put you in the limelight.  In what respect does Miss Flores give up?  Joe Biden, how does this ungrateful ingrate thank him?  Oh, Joe Biden, he grabbed my hair, he touched my hair, he tried to kiss me.  I mean, think about it.  I mean, this is a former gang member, Lucy.  She stole the car.  I mean, and she's crying about Joe Biden trying to steal a kiss.  I mean, I wonder how Lucy felt in her gang initiation ceremony.  Yes, I'm sure they just gave her a little kiss on the forehead and patted her on the butt and said, go ahead, Lucy.  Now you're in the gang.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Where in the hell do they find these people?  I mean, come on.  Joe Biden tried to kiss me.  I mean, you should be so lucky that anyone in the world would want to kiss you.  Have you looked in the mirror lately?  Jesus Christ.  Good God.  I mean, Bernie must be really worried.  Yeah.  Bernie Sanders must be really concerned about Joe Biden.  to send out a criminal like this to make up lies about Joe Biden.  I mean, come on, Bernie.  How sad.  And here I thought that Bernie was serious and he really wanted to win.  I thought he had a chance.  But if Bernie's going to hire former gang members into his campaign and they're going to make ridiculous accusations about white men, I mean, come on.  Maybe I need to give those guys a little tip.  Here's my little tip to Bernie and all the dumbass Democrats who are starting to eat their own.  I mean, think about this.  Dummies?  I mean, in America, there are 7 million Hispanic men who self-identify as a Caucasian.  In America, there are 1 million Cuban, Argentinians, and Spaniard men who identify as a Caucasian.  In America, there are 10 million Italian, Portuguese, and French men who identify as Caucasians.  In America, there are 35 million German, Austrian, Polish men who identify as Caucasian.  In America, there are 2 million Russian, Greek, and Serbian men who identify as a Caucasian.  In America, there are 15 million Dutch, Brit, Scandinavian men who identify as a Caucasian.  In America, there are probably at least 20 to 30 million men who have some amount of Irish in them.  And guess what?  They all consider themselves Caucasian.  Hey, Einstein!  News flash!  There are over 110 million so-called white men in America, and many of their white women stand by their Caucasian men.  220 million in total!  What do you think your chances are of winning a national election by pissing off 110 million white men?  You might as well call half of America deplorable.  You people make me sick.  You are idiots, morons, and imbeciles.  You make me laugh. ",
