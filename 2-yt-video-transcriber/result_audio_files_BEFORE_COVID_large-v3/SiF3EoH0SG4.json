            "text": "Good evening, brothers and sisters.  It's Pastor Tim.  Well, now, I'm going to say right from the beginning, I am not saying the rapture is happening on December 26th.  However, the rapture is imminent.  It could happen any nanosecond.  I will never set a date nor hour.  But what I do want to share with you, and it's so strong in me, I actually... had an open vision of a calendar zoomed in December 26th.  So what I'm saying is something is happening on December 26th.  What is that?  I don't know.  It could be an awakening.  It could be, I don't know that to the apocalypse.  I don't know.  But what I'm telling you is, so for the past few weeks, a couple of times I shared with our sister Rosemary, excuse me, and talking to her, I said, Rosemary, December 26th has been... I've been impressed in my spirit, December 26th, December 26th.  So I've already been praying, brothers and sisters, and I'm not anxious.  That's not what I'm trying to create.  That's not what I'm saying.  And Rosemary told me, well, what about the eclipse?  And I don't know how I missed that, how I... And then a couple times at least, she's reminding me, yeah, the eclipse on the 26th.  Sometimes I can be thick-headed.  And, you know... There are, so let me explain it this way regarding, based on an interpretation of Genesis 114, rabbinic Judaism considers celestial events to be signs from God.  And this is what it says.  And God said, let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs.  An eclipse, a luminary being stricken, is a prime example of such a sign.  So they go to the Talmud.  Now, some will say, well, what are you doing repeating that?  Well, I also believe, based on Genesis 1, 14, that they are for signs, and I believe we're seeing a lot of signs Again, I'm not, you know what, I'll be, I'll probably be in the Daily Star again.  Back on July, before July 17th, they said that Tim Henderson, Pastor Tim Henderson predicts the end of the world on July 17th.  That's not true.  I never said that.  In fact, those who have been following for some time know I spoke against that.  I never said that.  So, but for some reason they named me and I'm okay with that.  I don't care.  What I'm telling you is I had an open vision of December 26th.  Something's going to happen.  I don't know what.  But I'm sharing that with this channel family.  I do want to share, there are references to eclipses in the Bible.  I'm not going to give the context of those just to show you that it is referenced in the Bible.  Not only are they for signs, those celestial events, as Genesis 1.14 says.  I think the rabbis identified that and explained that well.  And I agree with that.  That's our Bible, brothers and sisters.  That's our Genesis.  All of the Bible is for the believer.  All of the Bible is God-breathed and inspired.  Not all of the Bible is about the believer.  You want to read the prison epistles or the prison letters.  Isaiah 13, 10.  For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not flash forth their light.  The sun will be dark when it rises and the moon will not shed its light.  Ezekiel 32, 7.  And when I extinguish you, I will cover the heaven's.  Joel 2.10.  Joel 2.31.  Joel 3.15.  The sun and moon grow dark and the stars lose their brightness.  Matthew 24, 29.  But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.  And the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  Mark 13, 24.  But in those days after the tribulation, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.  Revelation 6, 12.  I looked when he broke the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair and the whole moon became like blood.  Revelation 8, 12.  The fourth angel sounded and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine forth a third of it.  and the night in the same way.  So it's describing eclipses, right?  We see celestial signs referred to in the Bible.  And I always share that because some people say, well, that's not biblical.  Yeah, celestial events, signs are biblical.  They are in the Bible.  So all I'm saying to you is, we are living, we can see so many signs.  that we are in the final moments of the end of days.  That is not to fearmonger.  That is not.  Listen, we occupy and redeem the time.  We boldly proclaim the gospel of grace.  Listen, admit you're a sinner in need of a savior and believe on the redemptive work of Jesus on the cross of Calvary.  He shed his precious blood to pay the debt for your sin once and for all, past, present, and future.  He died, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  as the scripture states, 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  The ABCs of salvation will be in the description box.  I just wanted to share with you guys, I have had an open vision of a calendar of December 26th.  Before that, if Sister Rosemary were on here, she would tell you.  We, in fact, had conversations where I said, Rosemary, there's something about the 26th.  What does that mean?  Well, we'll have to wait and see.  It may not be anything you even recognize today, I believe it will be something at least substantial in my life, but I can't tell you exactly what.  And could it be the rapture?  It could, because the rapture could happen at any moment.  But do not go out and say that Pastor Tim said, and I'm not trying to pinpoint a date.  What I am telling you is there's something significant.  Keep your eyes open.  around December 26th and always, We should be looking for the bridegroom coming.  That is our blessed hope.  1 Thessalonians 4, 16-18 and 1 Corinthians 15, 50-53.  The Lord himself will descend with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God.  The dead in Christ will rise first and then those of us who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the air and we will be with the Lord forever.  Hallelujah.  In the meantime, let's occupy and redeem the time and boldly proclaim the gospel of grace.  Today is the day of salvation.  God bless you guys.  Have an awesome rest of your day. ",
