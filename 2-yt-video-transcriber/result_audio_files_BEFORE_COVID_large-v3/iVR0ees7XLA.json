            "text": "pigs and his secret weapon against the deep state here domestically is pigs but a different variety of pig.  this would be the two-legged pig and the pig du jour domestically is Jeffrey Epstein.  This Jeffrey Epstein issue is huge.  Many people in the bought-off, lamestream, fake media that's a tentacle of the deep state want to pass this off as not a big deal.  It's a huge deal.  And it's not just Jeffrey Epstein.  Because it's who and what is behind him.  Jeffrey Epstein was a front.  He was a front to leverage politicians, Hollywood moguls, and business leaders into positions that they were forced into compromise in what they did and the positions they took, whether it was legislation or whether it was in media marketing or whether it was in business ventures.  It's much deeper than the pig Jeffrey Epstein.  Michael Schneider recently wrote on Economic Collapse blog, and I think he's on target, major red flags are causing many to doubt whether justice will be done in the Epstein sex scandal.  It won't just be Jeffrey Epstein that will be on trial in the months ahead.  As the scandal unfolds, the entire U.S.  legal system will be on trial.  And if justice does not prevail, many Americans will lose faith in the system for good, and rightfully so.  And of course, the rest of the world will be watching too.  And so what are they supposed to think about us if we're not able to put Epstein and all his dirty friends in prison?  If Jeffrey Epstein is put behind bars, that will be a step in the right direction, but it will nearly not be enough.  And that is correct because it's who is behind him and what is behind him.  And I believe who and what is behind him is the deep state and the deep state's intelligence agencies.  They put Epstein up as a front.  The individuals that I have contacts with in the NYPD and on Wall Street, when I asked them, you know, this guy's a whale, this Epstein.  He's a billionaire.  I mean, how did this guy make his money?  And every single one of them are like, doesn't add up.  His money just kind of vaporized and was there.  Reportedly, he was very tied with this Les Wexner from Limited Brands, Victoria's Secret, one of the branches of Limited Brands.  Reportedly, the mansion that Epstein has, this house of horrors, if you want to call it, in New York City.  Reportedly, that was gifted to him by Wexner.  Jeffrey Epstein was a front, a front for the deep state, to entrap politicians, Hollywood moguls, and business leaders, entrap them with young girls, possibly even young boys.  Videotapes made at his house of horrors, whether they were in New York or on his pedophile island, that little St.  James Island, or his mansion in Palm Beach, Parties would be had.  Young girls would be there.  These individuals, high-profile individuals, some of them would end up in a bedroom which was audiotaped and videotaped.  And Epstein was the front for that.  Along with his main squeeze, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has quite the history by herself.  She supposedly helped bring some of these girls in.  Many of these girls in.  It's been documented.  But she has some pretty deep ties.  Her daddy, Robert Maxwell, was no saint.  He had been tied to MI6, the CIA, and Mossad, Israeli intelligence.  He died, I believe, in 1991.  Some people called it a murder.  Some people called it an assassination.  But he had ties.  And the little apple, Ghislaine, apparently did not fall far from the tree.  And apparently she was Epstein's handler for the deep state.  She handled him to set people up.  So that when a high-profile individual went to one of these parties, And that's not saying, I mean, these people were sick.  Every single one of them.  They're all pigs.  And they'd end up in a bedroom with a kid.  And videotapes and audiotapes would be made.  And then let's say it was a politician.  Well, they owned that individual at that point.  Because then, you name the deep state player, you name the intelligence agency behind the deep state, they would then go to this politician and say, we want this done.  And let's say that politician said, well, that's not in the best interest of the United States.  No.  The next part of that conversation would be, well, do you remember that party at Jeffrey Epstein's mansion in New York?  Do you remember this young girl?  If you don't, let's refresh your memory because we have this videotape.  What would your wife say if she saw this?  What would your constituents say?  What would the media say?  We have friends in the media.  We could just show that.  What would happen then?  That politician has three choices.  They can tell him to go push off.  They can decide to walk away, resign.  Funny that so many people resigned.  Wasn't it last year that just left office and decided not to run?  Some even in the middle of their terms.  But the third option would be, all right, you got me.  What do you want me to do?  Even though it's not in the best interest of the United States.  And that conversation, I believe, not just happened a dozen times, not just happened a hundred times, happened hundreds, if not thousands of times.  Whether it was political leaders, business leaders, or people in Hollywood.  It's all about leverage.  It's all about control.  It's all about power.  The bought-off lamestream fake media wants you to make you think that this was about one pig, Epstein.  No, folks.  No.  It is about thousands and thousands of domestic and international pigs that are all feet at the trough of the deep state.  The deep state is behind Epstein and his operation.  The deep state, the same players, I believe, are behind the fake Russian hoax collusion narrative.  That's right.  They were about and behind the coup of the duly elected president, Donald Trump.  But you see, just as President Trump used the pig issue to beat the deep state with the trade negotiations with China and with the peace initiatives with North Korea, I believe he will use the pig Jeffrey Epstein and the pigs associated with Epstein to open up This entire criminal enterprise, both domestically and internationally, whose goal was to strip every person of their freedom and their liberty and their future.  I believe Donald Trump and his team are going to use the pig Epstein and all the pigs and swine behind him to destroy the deep state.  The storm has hit.  The storm has hit.  And do not buy into the narrative that the bought-off lamestream fake media that's a tentacle of the deep state.  Don't buy into the narrative that this Epstein pig is just a one-off.  That it's not a big deal.  It's a huge deal on so many fronts.  Thousands of children were abused by Epstein and by the other pigs he associated with.  But the crux, the force behind Epstein was the deep state.  I believe Trump, President Trump and his team will also be victorious in taking down the deep state.  And they'll use pigs to accomplish their goals and objectives.  I thank you for your time.  I thank you for joining me today.  Until next time, Dave Janda signing off.  Dream big and dare to fail.
