And the reason Joe Biden has been able to sort of maintain this image is that he does something that I call offshore his corruption.  And what offshoring the corruption basically means is, you know, he does not take payments from foreign governments and foreign entities.  His wife does not, but his adult son does.  And what that means is he doesn't have to disclose the business relationships, which are highly questionable, that his son has with all these foreign entities.  And it's really highlighted by the fact that that these business dealings are exactly in the foreign governments where Vice President Joe Biden was the point person for Obama policy.  And in fact, in one instance we know, his son actually flew with his father on Air Force Two to close the deal with a foreign government.  So Joe Biden can't plead ignorance to this by any stretch of the imagination. ",

            "text": "Yeah, we're talking about mind-boggling deals.  So in December of 2013, Joe Biden is flying on Air Force Two for a trip to Asia.  He goes to Tokyo.  He goes to Seoul, South Korea.  But the main part of the trip is to Beijing, China.  On the plane with him is his son, Hunter Biden.  They spend three days in China.  Biden is, frankly, criticized by the Washington Post and other entities for going soft on Beijing.  He basically doesn't challenge them much on the South China Sea, on human rights.  on trade policy.  the most important thing that happened uh... happened ten days after they come back and that's when hunter biden's very small financial firm uh... into a one billion.  that's with a b one billion dollar private equity deal with the government of china.  uh... this is not a chinese corporation this is not an american company this is the chinese government.  It's later expanded to $1.5 billion.  And here's the important part, Glenn.  Hunter Biden really has no background in private equity, and he has no background in China.  And this deal through the Shanghai Free Trade Zone is unlike any deal that any other investment firm has in China.  J.P.  Morgan doesn't have this deal.  Goldman Sachs.  So it stinks to high heaven.  And it's the first of a series of deals that Hunter Biden's small financial firm does with the Chinese government.  It involves real estate deals.  It involves the Chinese military.  It's extremely troubling and really daunting to get your hands around the size and the scope of these deals that he cuts.  Okay. ",

            "text": "You know, I understand exactly why you're raising that question, Glenn, because this is so shocking.  But the fact is, Joe Biden, when he becomes vice president, up until that point, his son Hunter is a lobbyist in Washington,  D.C.,  for online gambling entities.  The point being this private equity deal with the Chinese government.  And again, this is the Chinese government giving Hunter Biden and this firm the opportunity to invest what becomes $1.5 billion in Chinese government money.  And he has no background in this area.  And it's very clear that he doesn't have background in this area.  But he is glad to take the deal.  And again, if you look at White House logs, we know that there are meetings that take place with A couple of the other guys that are his business partners, there's a guy named Devin Archer, who's a longtime friend of Hunter Biden's Devin Archer, who went on trial last year for a bond scheme that basically ripped $60 million off of the poorest Indian tribe in America.  There is no conceivable path or way that you can justify the Chinese government giving this deal to Joe Biden's son other than the fact is he is Joe Biden's son, and Joe Biden was the point person, Barack Obama said explicitly, the point person on U.S.  policy towards China during the Obama administration.

            "text": "There are.  And here's the thing.  We've sort of scratched the surface on this.  We know that there was also a dirty deal done in the Ukraine.  So Ukraine, of course, you know, facing aggression from Russia.  In 2014, now this is April of 2014, so this is only four months after that Chinese deal is inked, Hunter Biden joins the board of directors and is an advisor.  to a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma, and it's headed by two very corrupt oligarchs.  I mean, these oligarchs, if you read about them, Kolomoisky and Vlachevsky, they're like villains out of a Bond novel, a James Bond novel.  I mean, they're that troublesome.  Hunter Biden joins the board of these Ukrainian companies at exactly the same time that his father is responsible for all Western aid flowing to the Ukrainian government.  And that includes $1.8 billion that we pump in to the Ukraine through an entity called PrivatBank.  We give them $1.8 billion.  A billion of that disappears.  Disappears overnight.  This is not in dispute.  It's been widely reported.  Here's the troubling part.  Who owns PrivatBank?  The same oligarch who has Hunter Biden on the payroll, who controls Burisma Energy.  Let me add again, Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine.  He has no background in the energy field.  He gets this position because his father, again, is the Obama administration's point person on policy towards Ukraine at this very, very crucial time.  And they figure out the way to get favorable treatment from Joe Biden is to set up the sun with a very lucrative arrangement. ",
