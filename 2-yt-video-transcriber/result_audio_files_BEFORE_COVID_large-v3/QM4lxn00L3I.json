            "text": "Cartoon titties.  Today's video is about cartoon titties.  This is just gonna be a really quick rant about something I've been noticing online more than ever recently, and that is the art police.  These Tumblr refugees that swarm artists on Twitter who have the audacity to draw female characters with exaggerated feminine features.  So today we are going to take a look at their big-brained critique of this art.  So, the first drawing is this one.  Some superhero in a skin-tight purple catsuit.  I don't know who it is.  I'm a normie.  If it's not in some Marvel movie or DC movie, I don't know who it is.  Looks like Batgirl something, or is that an M?  I don't know, nerds, okay?  Don't bully me.  You know, I'm a fan of the purple catsuit.  That's nice.  Her knee looks a little crooked.  Nine, 10, knees too pointy.  But let's see what the Twitter mob had to say.  Have you ever seen a woman in real life before?  Gross.  Have you ever seen a woman?  Has you ever seen a woman in real life?  Y'all ever see a female before?  Have you ever seen a woman before?  Have you ever seen a clock before?  Have you ever seen the sky before?  Not everything has to be realistic.  Where are her organs?  Her organs would not physically be able to fit in her body.  Do you know what organs are?  If so, then where are they?  Is she okay?  She breathing?  She digesting her food?  She's a drawing.  She doesn't breathe.  She doesn't digest food.  Men are no longer allowed to draw women.  Thank you.  Again, men are trash and shouldn't be allowed to draw women.  I love how they're all focusing on her boobs and stuff.  Meanwhile, her hair is like 10 feet tall.  All the men are property proportioned.  And the women have no organs.  Okay, J. Scott Campbell.  All the men are properly proportioned?  Are we looking at the same picture, ma'am?  Look at Wolverine.  Look at Captain America.  These clearly aren't average male body types.  Like, yes, a man could go to the gym and could get swole like that and a woman could have that body type, but these are cartoon characters.  The male and female characteristics of them are exaggerated.  And when you try to point out that the men also have unrealistic bodies, they'll just say, oh, that's a male power fantasy.  Tall, jacked, shirtless men are a male power fantasy only.  Like I'm sorry, have you seen romance novels?  Have you seen those like cowboy firemen romance novels at the grocery store?  I don't think those are just pandering to the male power fantasy.  Also this whole argument that female characters look like that for men, for the male gaze, unironically erases the existence of the female gaze.  Organs in all female characters are missing.  You know women have, like, organs and blood inside them, right?  Wha- where are the girl's organs?  The organs!  I need the organs!  She doesn't have organs!  She's a drawing!  Oh god, this one.  This one pissed so many people off.  So this artist, who by the way is a porn artist, keep that in mind, drew a busty Rey from Star Wars.  And this of course was the ultimate sin.  This is the worst thing I have ever seen today.  Why do some people have to sexualize everything?  Okay, first of all, if that's the worst thing you've seen all day, Millions of people would envy you.  Second of all, why do people have to sexualize everything?  You're on a porn account.  Close your eyes.  Everyone is entitled to their own interpretation of characters.  Okay, off to a good start, but this ain't realistic.  Nobody can have boobs this big and fight without a supportive sports bra.  Make her whatever shape you want, but give her boobs support.  You're missing the point.  of this drawing.  I love these people.  I love these people when they see things like this.  They go full literal and they're just like, she can't fight like that.  That's not how any human woman has ever looked ever.  Wrong.  I have seen women with this body shape.  I have done extensive research for this video, they exist.  That's not how bodies work.  Rey is a character created to inspire young girls, and all you're doing is telling them that this is what they should strive to look like, like even though it's insanely unhealthy to do so in reality.  This whole, have you ever seen a woman, unrealistic, ugly proportions thing is like unironically really anti-body positivity.  And I didn't even realize that until a girl I followed replied to me and was like, these threads make me feel like shit.  It's just weird that these people are putting down big-breasted women to like own the men.  Rey is a character created to inspire young girls and all you're doing is telling them that this is what they should strive for.  This isn't like the official Star Wars account.  This is like going on to DeviantArt and finding like sonic inflation and being like, this is not what Sega had in mind.  And this is why men aren't allowed to draw anymore.  Why do these people all have the same insults?  Where's her organs?  Have you ever seen a woman before?  And men aren't allowed to draw.  From one dude to another, this ain't sexy, this is boring, and looks nothing at all like the character.  I am wondering how your sexy men drawings look like when this is how you draw the women.  Everyone saying this is okay because it's their style is stupid.  I'm a lesbian and I don't find it attractive, while Movie Ray, aka Daisy Ridley, I do find attractive.  Okay, so for a second, let's pretend this is not a porn account and these people are not angry at porn existing.  If this artist drew normal Ray... You admit she's sexy to you, she's attractive to you.  So would that be sexualizing Rae?  Or are busty women inherently sexualized no matter what?  Oh god, delete this.  It's not sexy.  I don't find a lot of things sexy, but I recognize that things I don't find sexy are also allowed to exist on the same planet as me. ",
