I can never ever hold a grudge or have hate for you, I ask.  Like, wow, would you do that?  You keep God's commandments, I know that's right.  Do you do that?  Gotta prove you first, and I got your back, like Kyro Brack.  I don't want no drama, my wife just ain't got no time for that, time for that.  If you in sin, then you know I gotta mention it.  We don't want no beef, but we got fruits to meet.  Repentance ends to save your life, for a life.  Matthew 18, you can end the strife, and that's precise, and you're best like that.  You deal with the same things I deal with.  We can fight it then.  One body, you know, we got the same mind.  It's funny, we say the same things at the same time.  You say what I say. ",
