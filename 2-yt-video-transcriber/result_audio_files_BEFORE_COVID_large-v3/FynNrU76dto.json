            "text": "As we launch this campaign for president, you deserve to know where I came from because family history obviously heavily influences the values that we develop as adults.  I was born literally a few miles away from here on East 26th Street and Kings Highway.  My family and I lived in a three and a half room rent controlled apartment.  My father was a paint salesman who worked hard his entire life but never made much money.  My mother raised my brother and me.  I learned a great deal about immigration as a child because my father came from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, without knowing one word of English.  He came to the United States to escape the crushing poverty that existed in his community and to escape widespread anti-Semitism.  And it was a good thing that he came to this country because virtually his entire family was wiped out by Hitler and Nazi barbarism.  I am not going to tell you that I grew up in a home of desperate poverty.  That would not be true.  But what I will tell you is that coming from a lower middle class family, I will never forget about how money or really lack of money was always a point of stress in our family.  My mother's dream was that someday our family would move out of that rent-controlled apartment to a home of our own.  That dream was never fulfilled.  She died young while we still lived in that rent-controlled apartment.  My experience as a child living in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my values.  I know where I came from.  And that is something I will never forget.  Unlike Donald Trump, who shut down the government and left 800,000 federal employees without income to pay their bills, I know what it's like to be in a family that lives paycheck to paycheck.  I did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers, casinos, and country clubs.  I did not come from a family that gave me a $200,000 allowance every year beginning at the age of three.  As I recall, my allowance was 25 cents a week.  I had something more valuable.  I had the role model of a father who had unbelievable courage in journeying across an ocean with no money in his pocket to start a new and better life.  I did not come from a family of privilege that prepared me to entertain people on television by telling workers, you're fired.  I came from a family who knew all too well the frightening power employers can have over everyday workers.  I did not come from a family that could afford to send my brother and me to an elite boarding school.  In fact, I was educated proudly in high-quality public schools here in Brooklyn and began my higher education right here on this campus.  This is what I believe from the bottom of my heart.  If we stand together, believing in justice and human dignity, believing in love and compassion, if we stand together, brothers and sisters, the future of this country is extraordinary, and there is nothing we will not be able to accomplish.  Thank you all very much. ",
