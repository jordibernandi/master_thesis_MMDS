            "text": "Thank you.  So many of our folks across the aisle think that this is a debate about whether we should be asking who is a citizen or not in this country.  The census is a constitutionally mandated operation that we are required to implement every 10 years.  It is one of the most vital and sensitive things that we do in our government.  Any change to the census, any addition of a question, usually takes five years of a process to make sure that it is vetted, that every word has been tested, to make sure that it is effective, because it is one of the most important things that we do.  So this is not about whether or not I want to know who is a citizen in the United States or not.  What I want to know is why this question was added, why two years have been shaved off of that five-year process.  I want to know why we have skipped every normal mandated procedure in testing how this question gets added in the census.  I want to know why this question was magically added after we have seen that a political operative knew and detailed an intent to intimidate racial and immigrant communities for a partisan purpose.  saying this will hurt Democrats and help Republicans.  That's what I want to know.  I want to know why Wilbur Ross, why Secretary Ross continued to meet with people of disturbing political affiliations after his own administration warned him to stop.  He came right here and I asked him, did you continue speaking with him after this?  He told me no.  We had an email and he did.  did.  I want to know why people like Chris Kobach, with a documented history of overseeing effects, he has a resume of voter suppression techniques in the state of Kansas.  I want to know why folks like that have their fingerprints all over the most sensitive census operations that we have as a United States government.  This determines who is here.  This determines who has power in the United States of America.  That is what we want to know.  I want to know about corruption.  That's what I want to know about the racism and the very disturbing history that we're seeing here.  That's what I want to know.  And so we gave the opportunity to ask.  We asked.  Why are all of these things happening?  Why is all of this connected?  Why are there so many people, everyone from Steve Bannon to Chris Kobach, having their fingerprints and their political intent all over the United States Census?  Why?  And what do we get?  Nothing.  No response.  Stonewalling.  We're getting obstruction.  We're getting a lack of answers.  I don't want to issue a subpoena.  Nobody wants to be in a position where you have to issue a subpoena of an administration official.  Because we are a co-equal branch of government.  And it should be expected that when we ask a question, we get a response.  But when we don't, we have to do our job.  I never, no one wants to be in a position where we have to issue a subpoena.  But today, because of the Secretary and because of the Attorney General's refusal to cooperate with a co-equal branch of government, we have no choice.  This is about the rule of law.  This is about the respect of our institutions.  And this is about the power of all of us as a body, as the United States Congress, and the integrity of the government of the United States.  Thank you very much.  I yield the rest of my time to the chair. ",

When I became chairman of this committee, I made it very clear that I took the issuance of subpoenas very, very, very seriously.  I don't know if you know it, but in the past, we have had chairmen that have literally put out hundreds of subpoenas.  We've put out very, very few.  And we've been very, very careful for the very reasons that you just stated.  We see it as a very, very serious matter.  And you're absolutely right.  We have come to this point.  And we need to be very clear.  You're right.  This is our job.  And I would consider it legislative malpractice if we don't do our job.  We are not sworn to the president.  We're not sworn to our party.  We're sworn to the Constitution.  And so I want to thank you for your comments. ",

            "text": "Thank you.  I just wanted to make sure, and speaking on this amendment again, and while I respect the intent of trying to acknowledge the historic moment and the historic ruling that is before us and before the Supreme Court, I want to reiterate the sentiment that Mr.  Raskin and Ms.  Tlaib expressed because There is a reason that our government is designed the way that it is, and it is because it is designed to acknowledge the flawed human nature in our grand experiment of self-governance.  Unspeakable horrors have been executed by the United States in the name of citizenship, in the name of determining who is a citizen.  And by citizen, we mean who is a person in our democracy.  That is what citizenship means.  It is an acknowledgement of personhood in American democracy, an acknowledgement of power.  And when I think about Supreme Court decisions with this, I think about Dred Scott.  I think about Korematsu versus the United States, where the Supreme Court upheld Japanese internment regardless of the citizenship status of Japanese Americans.  And how did that start?  It started with the United States Census.  It started with the United States Census.  We have laws on the books.  saying that information from the census cannot be used in any other way, that it must be confidential.  And what happened?  when the federal government, the executive branch, the president of the United States, I don't care if he was a Democrat, I don't care if he was a Republican, it was wrong.  And what he did, he asked for information and the Census Bureau broke the law and divulged information on zip codes where Japanese Americans were concentrated.  And that information was used to intern American citizens and non-American citizens alike.  And the Supreme Court upheld that.  Dred Scott, a black man suing for his freedom, came right before the United States Supreme Court.  And what they said was that the U.S.  Constitution did not give African Americans citizenship.  They have gotten it wrong.  The Supreme Court has gotten it wrong.  And unspeakable violations of human rights and civil liberties have been executed by the United States government in light of that.  And I can tell you, with this Supreme Court argument, they could very well get it wrong again.  And I don't even want to think about how far that could be pushed.  But that is not even what the question is at hand today.  Because what this subpoena is about and what this contempt is about is the fact that we have asked for information and there is a refusal to comply with a co-equal branch and our power.  That's all that this is about.  That's all that this is about.  And so we have to execute our power and hold that power to account and vote on contempt.  So the reason I do not want to support this amendment is because I don't want to muddy our waters.  I want to make sure that we are laser focused, that we are effective, that we are efficient, that we don't add any blow and we do not confuse people as to why we are doing what we are doing.  what we need to do.  We are voting on contempt because we need to do our jobs, and people are refusing to comply, and because we have given no choice.  Regardless of what's being held in front of the Supreme Court, regardless of what's happening in the executive branch, we need to do our job, and that is what this vote is about today. ",

And I just wanted to say that I, When I listened to Mr.  Raskin and I listened to our arguments and then I heard Mr.  Jordan say, he suggested that the true purpose of the amendment is to be able to argue that we are interfering with the Supreme Court.  I don't want that muddled either.  I want our committee to do what our committee is supposed to do.  I want our Congress to do what it's supposed to do.  And I want to preserve the power that the Founding Fathers gave us in their wisdom.  I do not want it diluted.  I don't want it power-light.
