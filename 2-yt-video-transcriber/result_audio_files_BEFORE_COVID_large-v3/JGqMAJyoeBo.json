            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  Medjugorje has been approved by the church as a place of pilgrimage.  The events of Medjugorje are not approved by the church.  They are still under investigation and of course we submit to the judgment and the discernment and the timing of the church.  The reason Medjugorje has been approved as a place of pilgrimage is because of the abundant fruits, the countless conversions through Medjugorje and particular people returning to the sacraments going to confession returning to the Holy Eucharist and so on and so I think it's fair to learn a little bit about Medjugorje.  I haven't been following Medjugorje for probably close to 20 years.  But everyone's been talking about this book, My Heart Will Triumph.  I finally read it.  It's an amazing book.  Reading this book caused me to want to love God and my neighbor so much more.  It gave me a desire to love God and to be more loving towards others, which I guess is a good fruit.  They say you judge a tree by its fruits.  And everything seems to be legit in this book as well.  I'm not an expert theologian, but I didn't find anything that concerned me too much.  Anyways, one of the fascinating things about Medjugorje is the 10 stars.  And we're all kind of curious about these 10 secrets.  I just want to quote to you a few things from the book.  Mariana says, Our Lady revealed to us that God's plan would ultimately be realized through a series of future events.  She began to relate these events to us with instructions to keep them secret until just before they were to take place.  And she also says... There is so little I can say about the secrets.  They are, after all, secrets.  When Our Lady entrusted me with the third secret, though she allowed me to reveal a few details about it, perhaps because we had asked her so many times to leave a sign, I can say this much.  After the events contained in the first two secrets come to pass, Our Lady will leave a permanent sign on Apparition Hill in Medjugorje, where she first appeared.  Everyone will be able to see that human hands could not have made it.  People will be able to photograph and film the sign.  But in order to truly comprehend it, to experience it with the heart, they will need to come to Medjugorje.  Seeing it live with the eyes will be far more beautiful.  The six of us visionaries do not speak to each other about the secrets.  The only part of the secrets that we know we share in common is the permanent sign.  I cannot speak about the details of the other secrets before the time comes to reveal them to the world, except to say that they will be announced before they occur.  After the events take place as predicted, it will be difficult for even the staunchest skeptics to doubt the existence of God and the authenticity of the apparitions.  And then she goes on to say that the seventh secret, which apparently was quite severe, was lessened because of the prayers and fasting of the Lord. ",
