The Lord and my accountants, although not in that order, have called me to follow history's surest path to financial blessings.  Yes, start a church.  So welcome to The Gospel According to Betty on Patreon.  It's a gathering place for all who are just so fed up with the current hypocrisy they just can't even... Jellicle.  Patreon is a popular new way for the discerning to gather and support those they follow on social media.  It allows you to tithe at different monthly levels, and those tithes will be used to make exclusive content that only the flock will be blessed enough to witness.  Glory!  And the more you tithe, the more you get.  Without that promise, it wouldn't seem like a real church.  Am I right?  Depending on your tithing level, you will get access to many exclusives, including video sassy sermons, personalized shout-outs, memes, and credits.  in videos you can brag about to unsaved trash.  By unsaved trash, I mean your friends.  Silver level and above tithers will be invited to my inner sanctum to join together in fellowship with me, America's best Christian trademark glory.  Oh, yes.  We dish evangelicals and politicians, but we'll only ever viciously gossip to save a soul or conversation.  Friends, when your BFF watches everyone masturbate, you can really put the tea in testimony.  Goodness, Jesus, revenge porn?  Frankly, I thought Judas would have been circumcised.  Eh, and smaller.  The Gospel According to Betty, Episcopalian style, at Pentecostal prices.  Glory! ",
