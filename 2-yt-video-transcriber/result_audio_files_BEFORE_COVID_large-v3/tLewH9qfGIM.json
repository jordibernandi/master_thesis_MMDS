            "text": "Sure.  Okay.  Well, excellent.  I'm so glad you did, and I appreciate that.  Let me answer on a few different levels, okay?  One is in Zechariah, Zechariah, Zechariah, the 12th chapter.  where it talks about the final war and the nations gathering against Jerusalem and then God fighting for our people.  And then it says in chapter 12, verse 10, So they will look to me whom they've pierced and mourn for him.  And then it goes on, the end of the chapter, deep mourning among all the people.  And then the 13th chapter begins that God will open up a fountain for cleansing of our impurity.  And the Talmud discusses what it means.  There's one tradition in Sukkah, one tradition that says they're mourning because they saw the evil inclination, yet ser hara, and it should have been so easy to defeat, yet they were defeated by it.  Others say they're mourning because of Moshiach ben Yosef, who dies in the final battle.  Moshe Alsheikh says, Rabbi Moshe Alsheikh says that the death of Moshiach ben Yosef is a perfect atonement for Israel.  I say they're mourning because they're looking to the one they pierced.  They recognize that they missed the Messiah.  They missed him when they came.  And now there's great mourning and repentance among the people.  And they're looking to the one that they pierced.  So I look at that as one major passage.  I also look at the words of the Eved in Isaiah, the 49th chapter, when he says that he's labored in vain to regather his own people.  That he says, So I've labored, I've spent my strength for nothing.  trying to regather my people.  And that's when God says, no, no, not only will you succeed in regathering Israel, but you'll also be an a light to the nations.  So there I see another example.  And then through our history, I mean, no sooner does God give us Torah on Mount Sinai than then we reject it and make a golden calf and end up suffering for that.  We reject the prophets like Jeremiah.  Our tradition says we killed Isaiah.  So we've often rejected the prophets. ",

Could it be Sinai's baseless hatred in rejecting the Messiah and giving him over to be crucified?  Have you ever considered that?  I don't know, Aaron.  no no you think you might consider that.  might you consider that right right okay so all right.  so number one I showed you in Isaiah 49 where the Eved of the Lord seems to have failed in his mission to regather Israel.  But God says you'll ultimately succeed and be a light to the nations.  And then the end of 52.13, So the sermon will be highly exalted.  So many were startled because of terrible suffering first.  And then the nations, the kings will be startled.  And now we begin Isaiah 53, 1, So who's believed our report?  You would say that's the report of the kings of the nations that they rejected Israel and that they thought Israel in exile was suffering for its sins, but instead Israel was suffering because of the sins of the nations.

Maybe it's your point, which is how many of the Mepharshim, many of the rabbinic commentators understand it.  So let's dig a little deeper.  All right.  According to you, the kings of the nations are saying this, all right?  So surely this righteous remnant has carried our sicknesses and borne our pains.  And we, the kings of the world that punished Israel, we thought that the righteous remnant was being smitten by by God and suffering for its own sins.  And now the kings, according to your interpretation, are saying, but he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities, the punishment that brought us peace is upon him, and at the cost of his wounds were healed.  I say it can't refer to the righteous remnant because when the nations mistreated Israel, God destroyed them.  He destroyed Assyria.  He destroyed Babylon.  He destroyed the nations that mistreated Israel and the righteous remnant.  But here the kings are saying that we received healing and it brought us shalom.  It brought us peace.

Through the suffering of the Messiah, salvation comes to the nations.  And we see earlier in Isaiah 42 and Isaiah 49 that this servant will be a light to the nations.

That's why I was giving what your interpretation would be.  And you correctly said it has to be the righteous remnant.  So I agree with that statement.  I just take it further.  I say it's a righteous remnant of one.  But see if you could step back and read Isaiah 53 and ask, okay, what if this was the prophet speaking on behalf of Israel?  So at least you understand my point of view.  And then, God willing, when I see Amichai from Israel, I will get to you as quickly as possible on a show.  Is that good, sir? ",

So you're saying at the end of the age, God will do mighty things for Israel, and the nations will recognize, we thought Israel was suffering for its sins, but instead, God is delivering Israel and showing that he's really the God of Israel, and he's the true God, and we were wrong.

Again, you're saying it only really applies, Isaiah 53, to the righteous remnant, which qualifies that sum, and it doesn't really work in history because God destroyed those nations that sinned against the righteous remnant.  But in the future... Nations will say we were saved by it.  So that's what I want you to try to find scripture that supports that view, that the suffering of the righteous remnant brings salvation to the nations, because that's our whole gospel message, the Bessara, the good news, that the suffering of Messiah brings redemption for Israel and the nations.  So we're close, but we're far apart at the same time.  Good place to resume, though, okay?  I'll try to call you next week, and I hope you will answer me again.  God willing that I'm hearing you call, I will answer you with joy.  Thank you, sir. ",
