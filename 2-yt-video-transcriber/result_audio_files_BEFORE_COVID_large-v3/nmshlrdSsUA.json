I'm deceased.  hey guys welcome back to my channel so you may notice the change of scenery.  i am on my kitchen floor.  i felt like you know because this is a response video to tisha paytas who is famous for her mental breakdowns on the kitchen floor.  i would in turn sit on my kitchen floor for this video and you also may notice that i am rocking an all black outfit and that's actually because I am currently mourning the death of my last two brain cells from watching Trisha's new video.  I also have my Chick-fil-A in an attempt to be a kindred spirit with Trisha, who routinely mukbangs on her channel.  So the amount of people that have requested, insisted, demanded that I respond to Trisha Paytas' new video, I Am Transgender, is just out of this world.  And shockingly, it's actually surpassed the amount of people who request me daily to start an OnlyFans account.  Times are not that rough, honey.  But before we jump right into the existential crisis, I want to just say that I have new merch as of today, like literally today.  On my merch store, we have the Pronouns shirt. ",
