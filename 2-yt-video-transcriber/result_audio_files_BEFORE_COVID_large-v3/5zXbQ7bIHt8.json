            "text": "Well, thank you all so much for coming here today.  It's an honor to be here with you on this cold morning.  My name is Jason Lemieux.  I'm the Director of Government Affairs at the Center for Inquiry.  We're a nonprofit organization that seeks to foster a secular society based on reason, science, and humanist values.  I'm also a veteran of the United States Marine Corps.  I served three tours in Iraq from 2003 to 2006 as an infantryman with 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines.  And I'm here today to tell you that for the defendants to force this cross on the people of Maryland is lazy and it's callous and it's divisive, because that cross does not honor all fallen veterans.  It leaves behind veterans who weren't Christian or who didn't believe in God.  And it tells everyone who's looking that the Christian veterans are the ones who matter, and then the rest of us should just be grateful they did anything at all.  So it's time for veterans like myself who are not Christian and who don't believe in God to stand up and say that the American Legion does not represent veterans.  They do not define patriotism, and they can never do these things because it's a Christian nationalist organization.  And that's not just me talking.  That's their founding documents.  The preamble to the Legion's Constitution tells us that our endeavors in this life are only worthy under the influence of an almighty God.  It tells us that the Legion exists to spread Americanism because that is the creed that has blazed the worldwide trail for belief in God.  The American Legion was founded on proselytizing their religion under the banner of our constitutional republic and not just any religion either.  So the Legion has a national chaplain and he has a message to his fellow chaplains on their website.  He doesn't even try to include all veterans or even all religious veterans.  No, he celebrates the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in the form of a little innocent baby.  And then, you know, there's a nod to our Jewish brothers and sisters.  But there's nothing about veterans who are Wiccan or Buddhist or Ahmadiyya or Baha'i or Hindu, excuse me, or Shinto or Muslim.  These guys don't even make room for all takes on Yahweh.  We're here to honor veterans of all faiths and veterans of no faith at all.  They don't even want to do the all faiths part.  And that brings us back to the Bladesburg Cross today, because the Legion's argument to the court is that the cross is about history and tradition and not religion.  And so, after everything that I just told you, they're going to walk in here and they're going to tell those justices that they're fighting for a 40-foot cross because it's a war memorial and not a religious symbol.  Well, in the Marine Corps, we had a name for that.  We called it an integrity violation.  The truth is, our ancestors treated atheists like me as second-class citizens, and the American Legion wants the Supreme Court to tell them that they can keep doing it, because it's their tradition to lord their Christian superiority over the rest of us.  But we know better than this.  We know that our country and our society is beautiful but flawed, and that it gets better over time because people like us have the compassion and the dedication.  And?  and the perseverance and the integrity and the courage to admit when we did something wrong, when our ancestors did something wrong.  And we endeavor to make our country work for all Americans, including the Americans that were left behind in the past.  We can leave our country a better place than we found it, and we can show the evidence that we're making it better and stronger and more welcoming to everyone with a stake in our future.  There's nothing about our constitutional republic or our democracy or freedom that we need to take on faith.  We make our country better by improving on the past.  And that's really important because the Bladensburg Monument, the entire monument, contains a plaque.  There's a plaque on it that lists all of the service members from Prince George's County who were killed in World War I. And the plaque was really rare for its time because it listed African-American service members alongside white service members on an equal basis.  Now, that didn't make African-Americans and white service members equal by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a really important symbolic moment.  And there are news articles in which Legion members have used that plaque as a weapon.  to try to say that this would be a\u2014to remove the cross would dishonor this symbol of equality.  But we know that rather than use that plaque in bad faith to keep other veterans out and other veterans down, we should preserve it and move it to a new memorial that remembers and honors all veterans, a monument that is more honorable.  They want us to think that we can't honor our fallen veterans without clinging to everything that was done in the past.  But we know that it dishonors veterans who defended our Constitution when we limit our freedoms only because they were limited in the past.  And just as we honor those who came before us, we honor future generations by improving our society, so that when they inherit our legacy, they can look at our example and they can be expired, inspired.  And we don't buy for a second that what was good enough in 1919 is good enough today.  We strive for a more perfect union, where freedom of religion is for everyone, including everyone who is not religious.  including everybody in this crowd and everybody who can't make it and all of the people who don't have the freedom or the opportunity to stand up and speak for themselves.  So please, keep speaking up for our freedom of and from religion and never bow down to theocrats or religious supremacists or Christian nationalists.  Keep carrying on that legacy and lift up and honor all Americans and all veterans, regardless of what they believe or don't believe.  Thank you. ",
