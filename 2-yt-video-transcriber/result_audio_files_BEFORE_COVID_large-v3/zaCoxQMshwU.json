            "text": "But the message that HaKadosh Baruch Hu sends to the loyal and observant Jewish people is, study the Chum and learn the necessity to strive for excellence in your lives.  Strive to respect the Talmidei Chachamim.  Among firm Jews, when the time comes out And on Mervazer, a big Talmud, it's such a tragedy.  Even though they consider themselves justified in their kanoes, they think they have reasons.  The outside world is waiting for them.  The New York Times, the assimilationists are so happy to report that the Jews are fighting each other.  It's a among Jews.  It shouldn't be any much like this.  As much as possible, Jews have to be together.  Now, I cannot say, oh, the should become ,, or the should become .  But in ,, all the Jews should be united behind the .  In ,, all the should be united behind the .  All should be united.  In every yeshiva, you should be loyal to your yeshiva.  There shouldn't be any malchalikas anywhere among you.  That's a very important lesson that the Hormon comes to.  tell us that no matter what the reason is, the underlying purpose of the Hormon was in order to be a spurt to encourage the Jewish nation to strive to perfection.  Now, you'll ask a question.  Is that the way to get perfection, to go mixed among the Gentiles and to wander among.  And the answer is, absolutely.  I'll explain a very important point, one of the most important points of our history.  Let's say you're walking in Flatbush.  The films used in the country today, many of them.  On the streets, the women are dressed with chutzpah, undressed with chutzpah.  Men without hats.  Burin, Amiratzin, Warsaw.  All of a sudden you see across the street, as you with the black hat, maybe with a beard too.  you should have a tremendous affection for him, a love for him.  How can you walk by in such a mob of low people, and you see a brother of yours, a shaman of mitzvahs, without a gush of affection towards him?  So we have to learn, first of all, to love from Jews.  That's the first requirement.  From a distance, you'll know him.  He says, no, man.  The pleasure is here from you.  means he believes in our Kodesh Bolechu.  He believes in the Creator.  Yeah, he belongs to us.  Well, suppose, however, you're always in Borough Park and around you Jews with black hats and beards are the rule.  After a while, you start forgetting about how important a firm Jew is.  And you look at him with eyes of habit.  And many times, you can express your resentment or your discouragement, invite, say something against a fellow Jew.  But today, if you're a murder part in all sides firm Jews, You don't feel this has to be the highest.  This is the important thing.  And therefore, to be together with Frumjus is a very big test to maintain a tremendous appreciation, even though there are many of them.  So first you have to practice.  When you see a Jew or Frumju from the distance, immediately you should feel a love for him.  And you should bless him.  And you should feel that he is a ,, who's chosen one.  He represents a holy nation.  He's fulfilling the laws of the Torah like nobody else in the world.  Who else keeps the Torah, not the Ephraim Jews?  We're the ones that don't eat pork or snails.  We're the ones who fast on Yom Kippur.  We know the things of the Phobos.  Nobody else keeps the laws of the Phobos except we.  And therefore, the Jew was observant.  and demonstrates it by a black hat, or the scissors out, or the beard, that man is our brother.  And we have to work on that feeling with all our until we gain an absolute love for that Jew.  Now, when we begin to walk among Jews, they're coming back from the country soon.  And again, the streets were full of Jewish women with baby carriages.  And children only go alongside the baby carriages.  On all sides, they see fern shoes again.  Don't lose sight of the fact that because there are many of them, therefore, they become unimportant again.  No, they're very important to us, no matter how many there are. ",
