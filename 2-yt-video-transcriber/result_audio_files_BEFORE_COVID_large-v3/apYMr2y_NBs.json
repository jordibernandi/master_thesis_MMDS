            "text": "hi this is mike maloney.  as you probably know i've been giving making videos and giving lectures on what i call the death of the global dollar standard the fact that throughout history every once in a while the world monetary system changes and we have a very big change coming up that's going to affect everybody.  and now jp morgan has said that they believe that the dollar could lose its status as the world's reserve currency.  That would mean a different global monetary system.  And they published this chart that was first created eight years ago by J.P.  Morgan.  And there are some errors in this chart that I will get to later because I have an updated version of this chart.  But basically the concept is true.  Every once in a while there's a shift in the world monetary system and power sort of goes from one place to another.  But in scrolling down in this article, what really jumped out at me was this chart.  And this is the U.S.  dollar's share of global central bank reserves.  And it used to be up at 64%, and it's dropped to almost 54%.  And that is huge.  And it's been doing that since 2008 was one of the peaks back here.  It's been falling since 2008.  And this is world central banks getting rid of dollars and sort of hedging their bets that something is going to happen and the U.S.  will not have quite as much global dominance when it comes to finances.  This is an article that got really overlooked and underreported.  Iran announces a gold-backed national cryptocurrency.  Now, blockchain is something that just can't be destroyed.  It's there, and as long as people run the mining rigs and stuff, it works.  So as long as there's power, and as long as there's somebody doing it, and the government can't really shut it down very easy.  So this isn't something that the U.S.  government can just say, oh, we've got to stop that right away.  So, I didn't know what the death of the global dollar standard would look like.  I mean, the dollar will still exist.  It's just not going to be the dominant currency on the planet anymore.  We won't have quite as much power to use the dollar as a weapon.  And that's what we've been doing.  And we do it too often.  And it's got countries all over the place trying to turn away from U.S.  dollars.  And it's happening at an increasing rate right now.  Cryptocurrencies are playing a large role in what this shift in the global monetary system is going to look like.  And so I urge you to read this article.  And then there's the Triffin dilemma.  And this is something you should just do a Google search on the Triffin dilemma and read about it, because the Triffin dilemma is something that a Yale professor of economics first presented in 1959.  He gave testimony in front of Congress saying why the Bretton Woods system was doomed.  and why that monetary system was going to fall apart.  And it came true in 1971, everything that he said.  And it still applies to the global dollar standard.  So now I'm going to take you to some charts, and we're going to see why that chart of the different reserve currencies was incorrect.  So this is a chart of my updated version on that same JP Morgan chart, showing the spans that these were predominant currencies.  They weren't reserve currencies because central banks did not exist yet.  So it's just the predominant currency, and whatever country is experiencing a big economic boom, they start doing a lot of trade with other countries, and they import goods, and when they do that, they pay with their currency, and so their currency flows out.  So the Spanish mill dollar became a predominant currency in many countries back here.  In fact, the United States silver dollar was based on the Spanish mill dollar, because there were a lot of them in North America.  but so if this is just whatever country is having an economic boom becomes the world's predominant currency.  then with the birth of the bank of england central banking was established and the gold standard came about and we had international settlement being done at the Bank of England.  And then I put in this overlap here, because at the Genoa Conference in 1922, the U.S.  was added as a global clearinghouse for the global gold standard at the time, and then Great Britain pulled out of it in 1931.  So for a little while, we shared the dominance with Great Britain, Great Britain was the great world power before World War I, and after they lost the ability to run the world monetary system, Great Britain sort of faded and the U.S.  took over as the world's predominant financial powerhouse.  But the predominant currency status lasts an average of 94 years, and this is already a year or two old.  So we've been going along for quite a while now.  And gold has been a financial asset.  It's one of the reserves that they hold here.  And gold and silver were actually in circulation here.  These predominant currencies are made up of gold and silver.  That's the reason for the coloring of these squares here.  This is paper currency issued on a gold standard and then a fiat currency system that we've had for quite a while.  But real money and the predominant currency for more than 5,000 years has been gold.  Now, this is gross federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product.  And we've gone past 100% here, which is very dangerous.  The only other time that we did it was because we were fighting World War II.  And so it was a global fight for freedom to protect ourselves from the enslavement of brutal dictator Adolf Hitler and Japan.  And we were able to grow the economy much faster.  than the debt.  We always went deeper into debt, except for just a couple years during this time period, but we grew the economy faster, and it became a smaller and smaller percentage of the global economy.  And then this is where supply-side economics came in.  Here, this is the Clinton years, we didn't actually have budget surpluses.  They weren't real.  It was a smoke and mirrors accounting.  The national debt grew every year.  However, the economy grew much faster than the national debt.  So this ratio fell.  And then ever since the crisis of 08, we've been borrowing and spending like crazy.  And we're in a real danger zone that we probably will not be able to come back from.  So again, here's World War II, and the factor of one here, what I've done here is I've divided gross domestic product by gross federal debt.  And what you see here is when it's at one, they're the same.  So the amount that we owe is equal to one year of the GDP of the entire country.  when it's at one.  And we paid down the debt and thus grew.  This is like a savings account.  And this, especially back before the 80s, this is all real assets.  None of it is virtual assets.  This is buildings and bridges and roads and production of goods and services.  It's factories.  And it grows to where our economy was three times the national debt.  We produced goods and services, and the transactions were triple the national debt every year.  And then we started spending that savings account, and we spent it down, and we spent it down, and now we've gone negative again, and we've done this in relative peacetime.  Remember, we had the Korean War, the Vietnam War during this period of time when we were actually paying down the debt.  This is all of the spending for World War II that got us into debt that was greater than the size of the economy.  Why we're doing this reckless spending and burning the credit card right now, and then if we have to get into some big war, we don't have any headroom to spend anything.  Now, a little while ago, John Williams of Shadow Government Statistics published this graph, and it's the gross domestic product minus the gross federal debt.  And so it shows that basically this would be like a balance sheet.  And when you're below zero, you're sort of bankrupt.  When you're above zero, you've got savings.  You're robust.  You can withstand a sudden shock.  You've got something put away for a rainy day.  But when it's below zero, you're already in trouble.  This is a graph I just had my researcher put together.  Basically, what we're doing here is we're taking change in GDP so how much was the gdp five years ago and what is it today?  and then we're also taking the change in the gross federal debt of what it was five years ago and what it is today.  so whatever those differences are we then take them and divide them by each other And what that shows is that for every dollar that we would spend, in every dollar we would borrow, we used to get seven, eight dollars worth of growth.  And then it would diminish.  The bigger the debt got, the lower this figure goes.  And now it's below 100.  So if we borrow a dollar, five years from now, the economy will have grown by 80 cents more.  So we're borrowing ourselves now into a whole that we can never get out of.  This is really, really dangerous stuff.  We borrow a dollar and increase our debt by that amount, and we get a growth pop of 80 cents.  And so we can't borrow our way out of this mess.  And then, this is the Congressional Budget Office's projection for the increase of interest payments, and that's based on the super low interest that we've got right now, but it's as a percent of gross domestic product.  And these are their best estimates, but they're showing this growing from under 2% to almost 5% of GDP, the interest payments.  And so the country is in some deep trouble.  And this is a chart that was created by Jeff Christian of CPM Group.  And what he came up with was that if you take all of the years from 1968 through 2017, that a portfolio that consists of S&P 500 stocks, treasury bills and gold, the best risk reward ratio is is somewhere between twenty seven and thirty percent gold in your portfolio.  that's higher than what most people recommend.  i'm very very very heavily tilted toward precious metals mostly silver as most of you know.  And so the message of this whole thing is that we're in some deep trouble.  When the U.S.  comes out of the next recession, it will probably never have the economic vitality it has had in the past.  In the end, you got to ask yourself, have you got gold?  Thank you very much for listening.
