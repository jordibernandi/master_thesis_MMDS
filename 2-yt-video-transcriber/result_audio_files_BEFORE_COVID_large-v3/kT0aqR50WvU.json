First, you're contending that I contend that because the Democratic Party was the party of slavery before the Civil War... Therefore, the Democratic Party is racist today.  I would submit that I have made no such argument here tonight.  For anyone listening fairly, my argument was that the party of slavery prior to the Civil War metamorphosed into the party of racism after the Civil War.  And this racism carried well into the 20th century.  In fact, when we talk about things like the Klan, it's always amusing to me.  Well, what about David Duke?  This is the precise type of counterexample intended to mislead.  Because if you fairly were to say, let me really look at the topic, let me make a list of all ",

            "text": "Klux Klan leaders, every Grand Dragon and Grand Clegal, going back to the 1870s to now, and let's just put an R or a D after their name, 99% of them would be Democrats.  That's a fact.  The idea of David Duke is a false flag intended to camouflage attention and prevent a legitimate generalization from being made.  Now, so the Democratic Party isn't the party of racism because of what happened before slavery.  The Democratic Party self-consciously embraced racism after slavery.  Lyndon Johnson, this is a very good example, because Lyndon Johnson is supposed to be a metaphor for the whole Democratic Party.  Yeah, he was kind of a racist in his old Texas country boy days, the narrative goes, but then he became a marvelous, morally enlightened person and championed the Civil Rights Act.  I would submit that if you read anything about Lyndon Johnson, you will see that this is a flat-out lie.  The fact of the matter is that Lyndon Johnson was routinely using the N-word after the Civil Rights Act.  And there is multiple examples of this from Robert Caro, from Doris Kearns Goodwin, from Lyndon Johnson's own driver.  This is corroborated, it's attested, it's indisputable, and yet it is pushed under the rug by progressive historians who need the fake narrative.  The fake narrative is the narrative of conversion.  There was no conversion.  Lyndon Johnson, once a bigot, always a bigot.  So now a more interesting question emerges.  Why would a bigot... promote the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  And I would submit that the reason for that is that the bigot realized, I can't cash in on white racism anymore.  I've got to create a new type of dependent class of people who are now going to have to vote for me and the very people I've been kicking around. ",
