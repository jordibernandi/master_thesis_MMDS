            "text": "First of all, I wanted to be with you on Christmas Day just for a few minutes.  I know that you've got family with you, many of you.  Maybe some of you don't have.  And to wish you the very best Christmas.  Celebrating the life, the birth of Jesus Christ.  And I pray that this Christmas would be the greatest you've ever had.  Now, we're always going to have great Christmases.  But there's been a lot of sadness in a lot of people's lives over this period of time.  And this nation has been through a lot.  You know, you don't even realize, and I say this because I came from Africa, South Africa.  How privileged you are in this country and how privileged we are now to have the freedom that we have to be able to sing songs in the streets, to sing in neighborhoods about the Lord Jesus Christ.  We didn't do that as kids even though we did celebrate Christmas.  Nothing like you do.  Ours was in the heat of summer.  Sometimes it would be over 100 degrees.  I remember my brother and I having these cans of snow and spraying them over the windows and on the tree just so it would look like an American winter.  And I remember one specific Christmas and you must remember I was raised without Jesus and or the understanding of Christ.  Of course, they mentioned his name, but we didn't pray together as a family.  I wasn't taught the principles or the commandments of Jesus.  More the Old Testament.  once in a while when I'd do something wrong, my mother would say that God would punish me because I don't obey my mother and father.  And it was misquoted too.  So I was, we would celebrate Christmas, you know, like heathen really, just because everybody else did.  One specific Christmas.  I remember doing this and being aware of the celebration and wondering, what are people really celebrating this day?  And I went and made a heart, a red heart.  I've never told anybody this.  I made a red heart and I wrote the, I love you, Jesus.  I remember something.  I never went to church.  I didn't even know the hymns.  Even when I became a Christian, I had to learn hymns that each one of you know, even if you were non-Christians.  Amazing Grace, How Sweet the Sound.  I had to learn all those.  I was not acquainted with Christian music.  We didn't have Christian stations.  In fact, in our country, we had one ruling government church.  It was the state church.  It was the Dutch Reformed Church.  And we hated them because of their legalism.  So I really had no idea of this.  All I knew was I had a feeling.  So I made this heart and I colored it in red.  I must have been nine or ten years of age.  And there was a bush in our yard and I went over to the specific bush and it was quite thick.  And I put this red heart right deep down in the middle of it.  And I said, this is my message to you.  If you're out there, I just want you to know I love you.  Now, I didn't understand anything about his sacrifice, really, but I knew he was present.  And the next morning, which was Christmas morning, got up early because everybody was waiting for their gifts and what Santa left and all this.  And I ran out to find this bush and the red heart was gone.  And it made an impact on my life.  it made me think I believe that God took that heart and gave it back to me when I did give my life to him albeit very difficult circumstances because after that I I went on to drugs and most of you know my testimony and ended up in the street dying and calling on that same Jesus.  I believe he kept that one thing I did and gave back to me, gave me the heart of Christ.  So I'm honored to be an American citizen now and to be able to celebrate with you.  I love you.  Thank you for all that you've done for us and my family, for your prayers, for your gifts of love, for your cards, for your words.  I feel like we're a family.  That's why I felt like taking this time just to be with you and to say, I'm with you.  I'm celebrating with you.  We have a wonderful, wonderful God.  I want him to rule over us.  I want you to enter into the new year with a fresh perspective of your future, of life.  I want your families to be saved from the destruction that the enemy is trying to bring upon them.  I want your relationships to be good and to be strong.  I want you to value each other, to see each other In an eternal light.  To see each other the way God sees you.  To love one another.  Like Jesus said.  To love one another.  As he loves you.  These are not just great aspirations.  Great thoughts or ideas.  I just feel like this Christmas.  We can connect.  With Christ in a very big way.  Because I believe we have.  A very very exciting new year.  So from my family to yours, from my team to you, Merry Christmas.  Have a great day.  Enjoy your family.  And we will see you on New Year's Eve.  I love you very much. ",
