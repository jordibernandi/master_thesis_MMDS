I was there recording the whole time.  And I explained who I was.  I said, hey, I'm the camera guy.  And she said, oh, okay, hi.  And then I told her that she is very attractive to me.  She has very nice, compelling eyes.  And she just smiled, and her friends that were there, they were also very ecstatic.  They were just like, oh, shit, wow, okay.  I guess because she was speaking to him about the whole entire interaction or the conversation you guys had.  And I can feel that she was shy, but very, very grateful that I was the guy who was speaking to her and genuinely interested in her.  And I guess in her mind, it manifested for her in real time.  And she was just really immersed in that experience.  So as I'm talking to her, she says stuff like, oh, so where are you from?  Asking me questions.  And we're both reciprocating back and forth.  And I had, in those moments, I was a little in my head.  So I'm like, okay, I just recorded this.  This is very interesting.  But at the same time, relaxing in my body, being very present and saying, hey, listen, did you drink coffee?  She says yes.  Okay, let's go out next week.  She doesn't know when she's going to be free.  So we're going to plan to meet up this weekend coming up, or these weekdays, and it'll be great.  She's super excited.  I can tell just by the look in her eye.  I'm probably the first guy who ever, like, has her on a date.  So, yeah, I can't wait for that experience.  It's going to be great, and just share a human connection.  Spread the love. ",
