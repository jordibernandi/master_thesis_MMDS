So for instance, the points that you had suggested that it was very stereotypical, it's very stereotypical of demonizing the boys.  Yep.  um, to, you know, have all this, you know, sex talk going on and, you know, very nonchalant.  Scoring.  Yes, scoring, all of this kind of language, which, you know, that language was phased out a long time ago.  Then we have, um, the female retelling the story.  She talks about, you know, being that she was drunk, but she's really able to tell the story in some detail.  where she even talks about, you know, asked him to get a condom at least.  So first of all, she's sending mixed messages.  She said in the one breath, I didn't consent.  I said, no, I asked him to stop.  But then she says, I asked him to get a condom at least.  So that's mixed messages again.  We're only hearing her version of events.  And, you know, her friend, yeah, the whole situation seems to be reframed.  So for someone that was quite drunk, she seems to be aware of what's going on.  Now, the other issue that came up, and this is really important, was she claimed in the video that the boy was being aggressive. ",

They're going through a scenario with a young boy where that kind of thing has happened.  The young girl was... putting it on him to engage in sex.  He didn't want to.  I'm not sure if alcohol was included, but he kept saying he didn't want to.  He didn't want to have a girlfriend.  He was very aware that she wanted something more long-term.  He didn't want a long-term relationship.  She persisted.  The words to me were she pestered him.  He gave in.  So, you know, he was coerced, so to speak.  He gave in to having a sexual relationship.  And the next day when he said, you know, you do understand that this is, you know, we're not in here for a long-term relationship.  she has now started against him and I believe she may have even in fact be pressing charges against rape.  The issue with that video that I have is this has been made public.  As you said, six million viewers have seen this video.  Now that particular video might be relating to a particular state in America that has specific laws.  So that's fine.  But that video has been seen by women, from all over the world.
