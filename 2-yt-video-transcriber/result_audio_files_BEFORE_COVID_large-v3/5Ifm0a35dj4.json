Constantly.  They know everything you're doing.  Everything.  Trust me, when Trump went there the first time, they had cameras all up in his room.  They had hoes all up in his room.  Because they, everything the Russians do.  Now, you're not talking about gardening holes.  I'm talking about, well, in a way they're gardening.  I'm talking about, they're doing some plowing.  But anyway, no, I'm talking about the fact that when we were trying to build bombs, the Russians were sitting in rooms trying to figure out how to move an ashtray across the table with their mind.

He's going to find out what you do like, and he's going to serve it to you.  He's going to find out what you don't like, and he's going to threaten you with it.  And between those two things, he's got you between a rock and a hard place. ",
