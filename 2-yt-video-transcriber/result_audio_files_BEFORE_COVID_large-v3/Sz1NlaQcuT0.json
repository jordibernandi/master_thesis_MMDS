This is that cardeen flooring.  that's just as terrible crap.  Almost tweaked my back out here moving a chair because the chair sunk into it.  So you can't slide anything.  Anyway, this is the VR-1 from Hooky.  It's an OC-1, an ocean canoe single person.  vacuum molded S-Glass, Kevlar, and carbon.  And I should be able to take it out in a couple of days.  I've got to charge up my GoPros.  I've got to wait for the wetsuits to show up because it's damn fucking cold in this water.  Then I'm going to go and get used to it paddling up in a small creek over here.  I had to come on out and do this early in the morning, guys, before my dog walk.  Just so I could get it done.  There's all kinds of activity here today.  It's going to be a nice day.  I've got to get in and sand the seat so it'll fit my butt.  Because I'm not sanding my butt to fit the seat.  So anyway, and then set it up and put all the GoPros on and so on.  Basically, you sit in it.  There's controls.  I've got a couple of dry wells.  in here so I can store camera gear and that kind of stuff.  and That's on like more calm paddling And we're gonna Going out, I'll be bringing you adventures as I go paddle along in all of the coastal creeks here and go do steelhead fishing, that kind of thing, and exploring, which I'll get into.  I'm releasing a new website in a couple of days, and it will have some content on it as to what our plans are for the future here, now that I'm starting to get some things straightened out after the cancer.  Anyway, so there it is.  It's from Hooky out of California.  Talk to Jude.  Amazingly, amazing shipping.  I mean, this here is just part of the pile of the... Of the packing material.  There's the rest of it.  But amazing job.  Tremendous delivery guy.  It's shout out to Steve.  He really knows what he's doing.  Huge damn trailer and getting this here way out in the tules where I am.  It was some effort.  Anyway, so I'm just going to throw this up on YouTube and let everybody see the new boat and get on with the rest of my day.  I'll make a more polished, formal version of it after I've got it all rigged up.  Thanks for watching, guys.  And remember, everybody needs a canoe. ",
