            "text": "Hello and welcome back to Redirecting.  There was a story shared with me by NBA player Patrick Patterson.  He comes under fire for calling black women bulldogs.  The interesting thing to me as well is who shared the story with me.  It was a Gentile, a white person shared this story because they want to point out to us the constant and continuous hatred between black men and black women.  It's very sad and unfortunate story.  that others are looking at us in disgust and with that shaking of the head that I talk about from time to time, like this is how you all feel about each other and you're happy and proud to tell the world that this is how you feel.  We as a people ought to be ashamed of ourselves that this is what we put on display because no other race of people does this.  No other race of people does this.  You would be hard pressed to find a bunch of white men on here calling their women dogs and apes and baboons and all of this other stuff.  But black men and black women, we take to social media and we air our disgust.  Now, it's one thing if you're talking about an experience that you've had.  Or if you're talking about a particular case where someone lost their life at the hands of a person and you're speaking on that issue, don't get it twisted.  There's nothing wrong with dealing with our issues in our communities because these things are obvious and the whole world sees.  See, many of us think that if we don't talk about these things, oh, don't talk about the guy who blew the woman's face off.  That's air in our dirty laundry.  It's like, what do you mean air in our dirty laundry?  It was on a major network television show.  So if we don't come against the things that we see happening in our communities, then it's almost like we're being complicit.  The scripture tells us to cry aloud and spare not and lift up our voices like a trumpet in Zion and show our people their transgressions.  So this is why when you see things as well, like the mother who went up to the school marching angry, mad, and she belittled her son in front of the teachers and other people as well.  She called him the N-word and she told him what she was going to do to him if they have to call her up to that school again.  In her mind, she thinks that she was doing something good.  She believes that I'm trying to prove to y'all that I am trying to make my son come here and get an education.  But she did the opposite.  She belittled him.  She used the word that they use against us, the N-word, and all of this, this macho marching that she did in front of people.  And she made him feel so low that she actually accomplished nothing at all.  And I believe her children were taken from her.  You see, now they themselves, they will pull a weapon on your kid like Tamir Rice and take him out of here.  But you better not raise your voice or anything.  And so as a people, black men and black women, we have some serious issues.  But more of what I see more than anything is finger pointing issues.  Now, we know how the Mosai views things.  He expects all of us to repent, but he expects things to start from the top.  And so when we see stories like this, when I say the top, I'm talking about the head.  The man is supposed to be the head of our communities.  But when our heads are going over to greener pastures, as they call it, and saying stuff like he doesn't want any black women because why should he have to deal with a bulldog?  I mean, what is going on here?  No one is giving in.  No one is repenting, but everyone is running for the hills.  The hills would represent running for people of other races.  So I'm going to read some of this article here.  It says Patrick Patterson took a lot of heat online and his comment about black women went viral.  The Los Angeles Clippers seemingly called black women bulldogs in a 2018 Instagram post.  where he gushed about his longtime love, Sarah Nacer, white woman.  He got defensive in the comments section when an individual allegedly asked him, why do so many athletes marry white women?  He wrote, so I should settle for a bulldog and act like I'm happy with my life and preach, keep it in your race to the world as if Dr.  King didn't fight and die for equality, acceptance of all cultures and loving one another and no hate.  So you see how he craftily brought Dr.  King into this and the loving one another aspect.  Well, loving one another of all races, right?  People of all races and cultures.  Well, why not love your own?  Now, It's amazing to me that we are even having this conversation in a time where racial tensions are so high.  Now, he goes on to say, no, thanks.  Continue the 30 year old basketball player that makes you.  that may be your life, but don't want that to be mine or my family.  Color doesn't matter.  Wake up.  Oh, OK.  So he said he doesn't want that to be his family.  In other words, he don't want no black woman as the mother of his children.  Isn't that something?  He says, that may be your life, but don't want that for mine or my family.  Color doesn't matter.  Wake up.  So are you saying that color doesn't matter and wake up meaning black men, go get yourself one too.  Don't get a bulldog.  This is what I mean when I say we are whiting ourselves out.  We as a people are whiting ourselves out and we are okay with doing it.  Okay, it goes on to say, in his original caption, the NBA star penned, In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours.  In all the world, there is no love for you like mine.  Happy anniversary.  Talking to his white woman.  Okay, someone replied, a beautiful one replied, but you don't have to insult a race of women to uplift another race of women.  Is your mom a bulldog?  What about your grandma?  Again, you seem truly in love with your wife, and that's amazing.  Many blessings to us all.  Another commenter said, did you call black women bulldogs?  I mean, marry who you want.  I'm mixed race myself, but am I the only one who caught that?  Another commented, this individual shared similar thoughts, date and marry whosoever you want, but don't you ever in your life refer to black women as bulldogs or any type of animal for that matter.  One more similar comment, nobody cares that you married a white woman.  If that's your preference, cool, but referring to the women of your own race as bulldogs is vile and unnecessary.  Says a lot about your character or lack thereof.  In a post where he posted a clip of the 1991 movie The Five Heartbeats, an angry person told him to stick to your kind, sir.  The person wrote, if you want to date white women and put down black women while doing so, then you are not a part of the community.  No one cares if you love a white woman.  Just don't put us down.  to do so.  Furthermore, stay away from the culture and enjoy there since they love you so much.  Shouldn't you be posting walk the line, Johnny movie clips, not black movie clips made with black women in them.  So you see a lot of people came at him and rightfully so for his comments about black women.  And unfortunately, A lot of black men do feel the need to put down black women when they fall in love with white women.  I saw a post on Facebook that was quite disturbing to me.  And it really shows that we as a people have fallen so low that it's going to take divine intervention to bring us back from this place.  On Facebook that I saw with Serena Williams.  And it's actually a meme and the meme is really disgusting, but it actually proves what black women have to go through trying to get the love of our men.  Now in the meme it has her pointing and then it has that little white cat thing that's been going around where usually they have two white women and some type of caption with that white cat like there's a beef going on.  But in this one, they're using Serena pointing and it says on her side, it says there aren't any good black men left.  No black man wanted me.  And then on the other side where it shows the little white cat, it says, be pleased.  You just wanted to blank a white boy and have a mixed kid.  And so when I see things like that, you know, it was a black man who put that out there.  because they're always saying things like that.  To black women, they're always degrading black women.  They feel that in order to justify their love for Becky, they have to make it appear as though black women are the lowest of the low.  And when you look at the statement, it's very telling.  It says there aren't any good black men left.  No black man wanted me.  Well, look at the number of black men on social media who have called these young women, these tennis stars, they've called them men, they've called them transgenders, they've said all kinds of things, they've called them ugly, they talk about how their bodies are shaped and built and all of that.  But then they want to be upset that these women just go and find a white man.  Now, I'm not endorsing that either, but... How can you belittle and put down black women and make it clear that you don't want them?  Like look at Lapita.  A lot of black men talked about her as well.  Lapita from the Black Panther.  Our men take to the Internet and take to social media and talk about black women so bad and they get upset when black women go and cross over and marry someone white.  Now there's this new competition going on.  Who marries outside of the race more?  And it's very clear who does that.  And so what our men do, many of them will reach back into slavery times when black women were being raped and they actually think that that's a good comparison.  And it's really sad indeed that we are having this conversation again at this time when we need each other most.  But no one wants to repent.  No one wants to accept the blame for anything.  And Everyone is pointing on the other side.  Well, again, the most high, he looks at the head.  The head has got to get things in order.  Now, as for black women, we've got to be a lot less engulfed in society to where we are conforming to what they believe we should be, whether it's how we dress, how we act or whatever.  But we've got to maintain a standard.  First of all, before we can maintain that standard, we've got to return to that standard.  And that standard is righteousness and holiness and purity.  We've got to return to that because we've lost that.  You can't go and conform to the world to try to get the love of our men who have gone wayward, those who would rather be with white women.  We cannot conform to the image of that to please black men.  We've got to pray that the Most High can deliver the minds of some of our men that they may return back to the black woman because I know it's very hurtful to see statements like this constantly coming from our men those who get riches and wealth.  they go out and they marry a white woman and they say that they don't want a black woman and they call us names gorillas apes baboons.  but we are expected to accept their marriages to these women who usually down the line a lot of these women down the line when they are done with this man, they take his money and his wealth and leave him high and dry.  We've seen that story played out all too well as well right before us.  But these men are not acknowledging the fact that these things are happening to them at the hands of these women, but they continue to belittle and degrade black women.  Sad indeed, but this is how we have become as a people.  And it's sad that I had to have a white person to send this story to me because guess what?  Everybody's looking at us.  They see us clowning and fooling as a people.  It's really embarrassing that white people are paying attention so much so that they have to point these stories out to us.  We see them.  We see them, but we don't want to talk about them, though.  Because I continue to see this gender war with our people where the black man, he has made it known to the world that he cannot stand the black woman.  And what I see women doing in response, because we didn't start this war.  What I see women doing in response is saying, okay, no problem.  You don't have to like us.  We'll just go elsewhere.  And so we are in a really rough situation as a people because We have allowed ourselves to get in this stupid mindset and we are not going to help ourselves by whiting our own selves out.  We are the only people who are complicit with hating one another right before the public's eye.  It's almost as if we take pride in it.  When you look at the man.  who I'm speaking about, it looks like he takes pride in the woman that he's with and he owned it.  He's like, hey, yes, I love this woman and you're not going to force me to be in an unhappy situation with a black woman who I consider to be a bulldog just to please you.  You can't tell me that he's never laid eyes on any beautiful black women, but that is the cop-out that many of them use because they are under a spell and it is so sad.  Very, very sad indeed.  But again, we as a people, so messed up in our minds.  We don't see what we're doing to our own selves.  I honestly believe that a lot of black men and women don't give a care about whiting ourselves out.  We don't care if there's no melanated people left on the planet because we despise one another.  It's almost like it's built in now.  And then we lack understanding in things as well.  We don't even see what's happening to us.  No longer is it a slow kill, but it's a rapid kill now at our own hands.  Okay, family, with that, I will say shalom.
