I have a daughter.  I also was once a young lefty with more confidence than knowledge or life experience.  The people coming out of the university indoctrination complex are so thoroughly brainwashed that it would be surprising if there were not at least a few leftists in Congress spouting absolute nonsense.  i try not to overreact but my patience is running short with little jenny from the block and her constant attention seeking i've about had it with hearing her run her mouth about the good hard-working people who are doing their very best to respond to the problem at our border a problem that has been created by leftist politicians both here and in central.
