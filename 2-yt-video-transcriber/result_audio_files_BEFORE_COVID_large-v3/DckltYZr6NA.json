            "end_time": "00:02:02,440",
            "text": "Okay, so here's the deal.  So she completely surprised me.  I was really confident that she wasn't gonna be able to surprise me because I was like, oh, I'll pick up on it.  I'll know when she's like planning the thing and taking us out to a nice place and all of that.  But she had pointed all of these little things that I thought were true because I'm a trusting person, but it turns out, They were lies.  So like she has a friend who I knew was gonna help her with the engagement, but she told me that he was out of town.  So in my head, I was like, oh, he's out of town.  It won't happen during this time period.  And then I feel like there were several other lies as well.  But the main one was that she told me she had like a job interview and that she wanted to take photos for her website afterwards.  So I needed to go meet her at this park after she was done with her interview and we'd take some photos.  And so I was like, okay, I can do that.  And it seems like a very normal Fiona thing.  out of the ordinary and all of the hints I had said that it wasn't going to be happening because like these things weren't lined up.  but then we get there and there's like a huge tree and she had set up stuff behind the tree and I couldn't see it.  and so as we walk around oh yeah for days before this she'd been going like will you like jokingly like she was going to propose but it was always a joke and she was just like doing it in a funny tone.  and so as we walked past the tree she does that again and I was like Fiona come on I know you're not proposing right now.  And then she like shows me like the area behind the tree and I see that there's a little blanket set up and some little fake flowers and champagne glasses and her friend is filming.  and I was like, oh shit, it's actually happening right now.  And it was so cute.  and I was like, oh my God, she actually got me.  Oh my God, I'm not ready for this.  And so we like walked down to the little area and she gave a cute little speech.  She told me afterwards that she like blacked out for it.  It was so precious.  She was like shaking and she gave this really sweet speech about how much she loves me and wants to marry me and stuff.  And yeah, then she got down on one knee and took out the ring and did a little proposal.  It was so cute.  And it actually, it fits really well.  I was worried about it because I have weird bony hands.  But I actually really like it and it's like comfy and fits well.  And like Fiona said earlier, I'm not much of a jewelry person, like I don't generally like the feeling of rings, but I like it a lot.  And I feel like people are gonna comment on this, but I have it on my right hand, just because it's more comfortable for me.  There's no law that says you have to wear it on the left hand, so I'm gonna put it on my right hand.  My left hand is weirdly bony, and it's just hard to get it over the knuckle, and like it rubs against my other fingers the wrong way, and like, I don't know.  I'm just more comfortable with it on my right hand.  So that's what happened.  I thought it was really cute, and it was such a pretty area, it was such a beautiful day.  And then we just got to chill there and like drink sparkling apple cider.  Because I don't drink, so there wasn't like actual champagne, there was just like fancy sparkling apple cider.  And it was really cute and nice, and she actually really surprised me.  As far as wedding stuff goes, we'll let you know in the future at some point.  But until then, we are... betrothed.  And obviously because we're gays we like had a lot of thinking and talking and planning about this before.  Like this wasn't a total surprise.  I wasn't like, oh my god Fiona.  we've never talked about marriage before.  I mean we've been together for like three years now and we've talked about our future together and like we both know that this is what we want.  But even with that it was really sweet and nice and still caught me off guard somehow.  And I know it's all cheesy and romantic stuff but I really like it.  So that's basically everything.  Me and Fiona are engaged now.  And yeah, sorry for the filming setup today, I'm sure the audio quality is not as great.  But I didn't want to make this like a whole video thing, you know?  It's just like, that happened yesterday, and it was really nice and lovely, and I wanted to tell you all about it really quickly, so I figured I'd just do like a quick little phone video.  Because our engagement is for us, it's not for the internet, you know?  But obviously I do want you all to know about it, so here I am.  I'll put some pictures up here on the screen, you can also go to like my Instagram or Twitter to see some of them.  Because obviously Fiona had her friend use like a really fancy camera to take some really nice photos of us.  So we've got some nice fancy photos because obviously that's what Fiona would do.  She's so into photography and stuff.  But yeah, sorry, this video doesn't have like the video of Fiona proposing and all of that because we didn't want it to be all that like YouTube stuff.  We wanted it to be just for us, which I really like.  But also I don't see any harm in just like talking about it in a little video, you know?  Because I want you all to be able to share in this lovely queer love we have.  So I think that's about all I have for you.  I'm gonna put this video out pretty soon after it happened, but Fiona's pretty busy so she might do another video about it a few days from now.  So I'll link her channel in the description and you can go follow that if you wanna see a more detailed video about all her behind-the-scenes stuff.  And in the meantime, you can see more about it on both of our, like, Instagram and Twitters and stuff.  But yeah, just know that I am very happy.  Both of us are really happy and excited and good things are happening.  And I'm just very lucky and fortunate to be where I am right now.  Okay, alright, that's all for now.  I'll see y'all next time.  Bye! ",
