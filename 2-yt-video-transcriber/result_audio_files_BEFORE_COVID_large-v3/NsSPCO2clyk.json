            "text": "The profile picture you see before you is for a channel called Andre Shouldn't Drink.  But I guess Andre knocked back a couple glasses of grandpa's cough syrup yesterday because he decided to have disorderly product news on his podcast.  Like that's going to help him.  Anyways, this gentleman, Andre Shouldn't Drink, does podcasts.  He also narrates videos of body camera footage of other auditors, and he does a fantastic job.  Now, him narrating this video of an auditor called Auditor X, I will put both their links in the description.  Andre shouldn't drink does a great job.  Auditor X does a great job.  Now, what happens here is what happens most times.  Police are trying to extract information from somebody personally.  But the Fifth Amendment tells us we have no obligation to participate in our own prosecution.  So I don't have to say anything to you, Mr.  Officer.  The only time I have to say anything to you is if I'm in a stop-and-ID state and you have satisfied the grounds of Terry v. Ohio, which sets precedence to the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.  So if you could clearly articulate that I committed, am in commission of, or about to commit a crime... And you have proof.  Reasonable suspicion is defined as would a reasonable person with reasonable intelligence decide, come to the conclusion that I committed, I'm about to commit, I've committed or I'm going to commit a crime.  based on the proof the facts not the innuendo not the guesses not the hunches but the facts uh of the case the merits.  now in a non-stopping id state they must have probable cause.  but once they have probable cause that's the threshold.  so let's sit back and watch andre shouldn't drink do his thing and let's watch auditor x do their thing as they both do a fantastic job absolutely fantastic job.  Thank you. ",

            "text": "We are taught that police officers deserve a certain amount of respect for the stressful and occasionally dangerous job they do every day.  ...of some officers in the United States, that respect is becoming more difficult to willingly offer up.  Furthermore, it can be hard not to argue with an officer when they are being threatening or addressing you for doing something that isn't a crime.  Unfortunately, arguing with an officer shouldn't be under the catch-all... charge of disorderly conduct.  If you were not actually committing a crime but were arguing with a police officer and it resulted in arrest, usually the charges of disorderly conduct will be dropped.  The First Amendment technically protects cussing out cops as free speech.  However, you need to be careful because it can turn into a legitimate disorderly conduct charge if the right circumstances are met.  On April 7, 2019, Auditor X, a YouTuber living in Michigan, posted a video of his encounter with two officers of the Battle Creek Police Department.  It is not clear as to why the police had been called in the first place.  The description of the video explains that Auditor X traps diseased feral cats in his community and two women in the neighborhood aren't happy about it.  in the video you see the first officer jordan party approach auditor x and stepping onto his property.  auditor x refuses to answer officer party's questions resulting in officer party walking across the street to question the woman that called.  are you gonna talk or what?  Answer questions.  crime.  Please, please don't come on my property.  Well, I'm here for a call, so I'm going to.  No, you don't have a right to be on my property.  I sure do.  I got a 911 phone call.  That's fine.  Your name and badge number?  1171.  Your name?  Pardee, P-A-R-D-E-E.  Okay, Officer Pardee.  Could you just explain to me what's going on your side of the story?  There's no side of no story.  I'll just go talk to them and see what's going on.  Okay, thank you.  What?  Thank you.  Yeah, sure. ",

            "text": "So there are two opposing terms that are taking place here, public and private.  Auditor X is in public.  He's on a public sidewalk doing a constitutionally protected activity.  He is doing nothing wrong.  The officer cannot expect a private conversation to take place in public.  If you want privacy, you have to create it.  You can't be in public and expect privacy.  Those are competing terms.  They're antonyms.  They're opposites.  You can't be dry and expect to be wet at the same time.  So if you want privacy, you have to go in privacy, officer.  Don't be out here in public and expect privacy.  That's a very, very simple, logical idea.  You can see the officer's man that he got stonewalled.  Now he's emotionally attached, emotionally involved in this situation, and he's throwing out terms like hindering privacy.  Those are subjective charges, ones that you can kind of make up, disturbing the peace.  Who decides what that is?  It's subjective.  It's ambiguous.  It's how well you can present that information, communicate it, write it out in a report.  So I feel like I can almost charge anybody with obstructing if I was a police officer because I'm actually pretty good at communicating.  So this officer, he's angry.  He's butthurt.  I think that's what the kids say these days.  He's butthurt, and he's trying to get down on Officer X. Excuse me, Officer X. Wash my mouth out with soap.  Auditor X. What's your name?  I'm here for a 911 phone call. ",

It's always important to ask an officer for their name and badge number when having an interaction.  Nearly all police departments have policies that require police officers to identify themselves with rank, surname and badge number when in uniform.  The only exception is when an officer is undercover for obvious reasons.  Okay, listen, we're not going to play this game.  Excuse me.  What is your name?  No, I already told you mine.  I'm the lead officer.  No, you're really teetering on the edge right now.  Can I have a supervisor here, please?  What is your name?  No, you can have a supervisor when we're done with our investigation.  What is your name?  Excuse me.  What is your name?  What is your name?  What is your name?  You have no lawful reason to ask me.  I do.  For a 911 phone call that you've been filming all these people going on their property.  Right?  Is that against the law?  Going on other people's property?  Absolutely.  I haven't gone on anybody's property.  You're going to really play this game right now.  What is your name?  Can you supervise here, please?  We'll get a supervisor here when this is done.  Please, get a supervisor here.  No, we're going to handle this right now.  Let's de-escalate this a little bit.  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.  I've stayed on my own property.  I've stayed on my own property.  If you just give me your side of the story and it's legit, I'll say have a nice day.  What is your side of the story?  That's what I'm trying to get.  I don't answer questions.  Okay, so how are you going to prove that you're not doing anything?  Am I being detained?  I'm not going to answer this question a hundred times.  Am I being detained?  I'm already telling you yes right now.  Am I free to go?  No.  I'm not free to go.  Absolutely not.  On what charges?  Can you stay with him?  On what charges?  We're investigating.  That's called an investigative detainment.  Sir, on what charge am I being detained?  It's an investigative detainment.  There's no such thing.  You have to have articulable suspicion of a crime that has been committed.  What crime has been committed?  Trespassing.  Trespassing on what ground?  Tell us what's going on so we can help you.  I don't answer questions.  Okay, well then this is going to be a lot more difficult for you than you want.  It's not going to be difficult for me.  I've done nothing wrong.  You're being live streamed on YouTube right now, by the way.  That's great.  Okay.  See you now. ",

The only people that have raised their voice has been the two officers.  You guys are being disorderly as a matter of fact.  Always ask for anybody's ID.  that's on that scene.  They are public officials.  You are a private citizen.  They are beholden to you.  They are required to give you their ID if they are there on the scene as they are witness in part and parcel to this investigation.  They are detaining him, so he is in custody.  There are two levels of custody, detainment and arrest.  So if you are going to use your police powers on me, you must identify yourself to me once you detain me.  That's just how it goes, Billy the Paperboy.  So Officer Pardee, who's anything but a Pardee, comes back across the street, hands tucked in his pocket like a little boy who's been scolded, and says, I can't really do anything to you.  I was huffing and puffing, but I cannot blow your house down.  I'm going to be on my way now.  And that's it.  Good job, Auditor X. So there you have it.  That's my man.  Andre Shouldn't Drink.  Go subscribe to his channel because he had Disorderly.  He didn't have me, Reagan Peabody, the star of the show, the star of the channel, the reason there's 16,000 subscribers in three months.  God forbid I get a little publicity.  He decided to have Disorderly on.  So Disorderly's on his channel.  If you want to go see it, go ahead.  Andre Shouldn't Drink.  Don't hold that against him that he likes Disorderly.  He doesn't know him.  The guy's a cheap son of a... He hasn't given me a raise in four years.  Literally, I live in a shed out back.
