Now, I've had to pick and choose my battles with this one.  As if I was to respond to all of Shives' criticisms, then this reply would take eons, and as much as I'd like to do that, I actually want to get back to some of my ongoing series, as I've got a bit of housecleaning to do on them.  Given this, I recommend that you watch the whole of Shives' video before watching this response.  This is Shives' Harris assassination, debunked.  Let's start with context, a thing that most of Harris' critics are not very fond of.  Steve Shives was inspired to make his video as a result of witnessing a heated Twitter exchange between Mahadi Hassan and Sam Harris.  Long story short, Hassan, in reference to the Christchurch mosque shootings, published an article in which he accused Harris, among others, of playing a role due to his, and their, anti-Muslim rhetoric.  And Harris responded by sharing a dated article in which he addresses such accusations at length.  I've left a link to Hassan's article, Harris' article, and the Twitter exchange below in case you'd like to know more.  And so, there's the context.  You're up to date.  Now the first reason Shives gives as to why he believes Harris is an arsehole is because Harris treats religions unequally, and, according to Shives, he does so without good reason. ",

People in every tradition can be seen making the same errors, of course, e.g.  relying on faith instead of evidence in matters of great personal and public concern.  But the doctrines and authorities in which they place their faith run the gamut from the quaint to the psychopathic.

Likewise, there's massive support for stoning adulterers, from 21% in Bosnia to 89% in Pakistan.  What's more, a significant amount of those polled believe that wives must always obey their husbands, from 34% to 94%, and there's massive support for making Sharia law, which is law based on the Quran and the Hadith, the law of the land, ranging from 12% in Albania to 99% in Afghanistan, which, to be clear, would mean Muslims claiming jurisdiction over non-Muslims.

However, more to the point, when a significant proportion of a religion's adherents want, for example, homosexuals to be severely punished, and do so explicitly because of their interpretation of their faith, you can't just hand-wave that away.  Doing so helps no one.  But, you know what, for the sake of argument, let's do that, let's hand-wave it away just for shives.  What we're left with is a significant amount of people who want to severely hurt homosexuals, and Harris is simply pointing out that such beliefs are not compatible with, and a threat to, Western Civilization.  The point being, of course, is that even with all interpretations aside, the fact that there's a significant population calling for such atrocities is a serious problem that must be addressed.  And, if the earnest reason the population gives for their belief is Islam, then Islam is what must be addressed.  Now there's many more accusations and comments on the topic of Islam that I'd like to respond to, and perhaps will do upon another time.

What happened was, back in 2014, Harris was interviewed in front of a live audience at George Washington University.  The interview was conducted by Washington Post reporter Michelle Borstein.  At one point, Borstein asked Harris why the atheist community in general, and his own audience in particular, seemed so overwhelmingly male.  Harris initially answered with a joke, saying the problem must be his own lack of sex appeal.  According to Harris, he was approached by a woman at a book signing after the interview who pointed out to him how sexist his answer to that question was.  Harris's response to that woman, according to his own account of it, found in the aforementioned article about the event he published on his blog, was even more sexist and blockheaded than what he'd said on stage.  The woman told Harris that what he'd said was sexist and damaging and warranted an apology, and Harris said to her, you really are determined to be offended, aren't you?  And then she said, no, you're just totally unaware of how sexist you are.  Which is accurate. ",

Shives, and people like him, give a free pass to people who are actually sexist.  For example, the massive percentage of Muslims that believe that wives must always obey their husbands, or that a woman's testimony is only worth half that of a man's.  but he calls Harris sexist and says that he has a history of sexism because he once told a woman who got offended by a light joke that she's a snowflake.

In light of this, Harris said, He continued, Add to this the fact that Harris is forever having his words twisted and misrepresented by people such as Shives, and given that Patreon's Trust and Safety Committee have failed to account for context before, I think his departure from the platform was a wise decision.  And even if I didn't, I wouldn't insist that he must share the views of those who were banned.  Oftentimes, a principle is just a principle, no strings attached, and Harris has shown himself to be principled many times before, such as when he quit Pamburn Philosophy due to Travis not reimbursing cancelled ticket sales.

To conclude, even if we ignore the vast majority of what's just been covered, the fact that Shives calls Harris sexist for simply making a light joke which is predicated on a fair assumption makes Shives an arsehole.  Now, don't get me wrong, Harris is no saint.  He is, like all of us, a pattern-seeking mammalian ape, and as such, he makes mistakes here and there, and he doesn't always do himself favours.
