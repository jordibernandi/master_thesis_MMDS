            "text": "black ram 313 back at it again.  you know why it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session.  today's topic and title is the coming thought apocalypse subtitled why the succubus is becoming more frustrated with the dating scene.  Now things are changing.  Things are changing in the area of modern relationship dynamics.  The Center for Disease Control, the CDC, reports that birth rates are falling all across the country.  Stores, particularly bridal shops, closing their doors going out of business.  i've recently seen in my area a few bridal shops that are empty vacant no activity gated off nothing happening.  it seems as if those white dresses Are not being sold in mass anymore.  Along with the tuxedo.  And now I'm starting to make observations of desperation and frustration.  When it comes to the succubi.  So many single fee fails are discontent with the current dating scene.  Now from time to time I may go look on Bumble or Tinder.  To see what I can get into.  And not too long ago, I talked to a few fee fails off of Bumble and I asked them, how were things going on the site?  And the most common answer that I got was.  And in one particular fee fail, her complaint was that.  And she said that there were no old school men on the site and that she was looking for an old school relationship.  And I'm thinking to myself.  You're not old school yourself.  Old school fee fails no longer exist.  I'm sure her body count was way high.  I bet she couldn't be old school enough to close her legs.  And she went on to say, as well as many others, stating that men just want to come right over to her house or that they invite her to their homes without any previous dates.  One said, how come none of these men want to go on a real date?  Like, take me out to dinner.  Now I'm thinking, nope, ain't nobody trying to feed a thought anymore.  She says that many guys that she meets on the sites have no careers and no real goals.  But this is all that she can attract at this point.  She's post-wall.  And the only dudes that want to wife her up at 35 years old plus are those guys in most cases who are needy.  Guys who need a place to stay.  Now she, at this point, has to pay to play.  Karma, huh?  You reap what you sowed.  Isn't that what you expected in your younger years for someone to pay to play?  Now it is your turn.  Welcome to the apocalypse.  So, you know, this is Black Realm 313.  So I have to give you a list.  list to some of the reasons why she's so frustrated.  but first but not necessarily number one is that I noticed that the succubus is the least desired of all when it comes to various studies.  but I won't get into that.  but going into number one as to the reason why she's more frustrating, as to the reason why there is a coming thought apocalypse.  The apocalypse for thoughts is almost here.  Number one, I've been seeing younger and prettier females on the dating apps.  Now, there was a time where the majority of females on the dating sites were post-war.  Now, young women are becoming a huge majority.  Now, remember, younger females have a huge social circle and most of the time popularity, college events, parties and such.  It seems at the places that she frequents, where she goes, that she's not getting approached often.  I've heard women ask the question as to why men are not approaching them as much.  And I've gone to many venues and on many and to many events in the last few years.  And you do not see guys talking to the fee fails as much as they once did.  Now, my hunch is that men are tired of the attitude, the arrogance of these thoughts.  This and the fact that some females take pride in rejecting guys.  So many dudes are just content with just the eye candy.  Plus, who wants to get me too?  Number two, as to the reason why she's so frustrated.  Younger and pretty fee fails on dating sites are also saying no hookups.  Now, this used to be a post wall statement.  It was a time that older, larger and unattractive succubi were only pursued for the hookup.  Guys typically want relationships with the younger and pretty fee fails.  But now guys only want to hook up with them later.  Is it because they don't see them as relationship material?  But the pretty girls are saying the same things that the unattractive girls are saying.  No hookups.  I wonder why.  Think about it.  Number three.  I've talked to fee fails who say that they only meet broke men who are looking to be taken care of.  Older and younger fee fails are now saying this.  Yeah, some guys see the desperation of the modern fee fail and want to cash in.  It's her turn to pay now.  I want my PlayStation.  I want my Air Force Ones.  I want my games and I want a full refrigerator.  And I'm a kickback while she's at work on the couch and play my game.  And on a weekend, I'll take the car to see my other gal.  Now, I know many guys who are in situations, relationships and have scenarios just like the one I just mentioned.  Welcome to the thought process.  apocalypse number four not only are younger fee fails but older fee fails.  also state that men are mainly looking for hookups.  are guys waking up and seeing that the western fee fail is virtually worthless?  my question to the succubus is what else do you have that anyone would want?  wait what What you say, Shaniqua?  You're in debt.  You only have five bucks in your bank account.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You say you have how many kids?  Three?  Oh, well, check this out, Shaniqua.  I'll just slide through for a minute when the kids go to sleep.  No dates.  Just brief visits to dig out some guts.  Shout out to Stefan Klinkscales.  Number five.  It seems to be more and more single women, single women everywhere.  Every event, venue, location, in every area, in every town.  Groups of single ladies with no man in sight.  Will this get worse?  All the single ladies.  Is this the end of Western dating as we know it?  Number six.  Marriages are occurring far less.  News site PBS.org states that, and I quote, marriage rates are dropping.  The drop in marriages is even more dramatic when the rapid growth in the U.S.  population is taken into account.  In fact, the marriage rate is the lowest in at least 150 years.  End quote.  So we see guys are dropping out and saying no to being a thoughts retirement plan.  Number seven.  Many fee fails are asking what happened to chivalry.  And my question then is what happened to chastity?  Men are not valuing the use vag as they once did, it seems.  opening doors, pulling out chairs for a fee-fail with a body count of more than Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers put together times 20.  It's not a good look for a man to pull out your chair.  Plus, you are strong and independent.  You can open your own door.  I think even some of the simps are realizing that they're being played too.  Think about it.  Number eight.  As to the reason why she's more and more frustrated is that because she's looking for her perception of perfection.  She is delusional.  On a look scale, she's a four and she stands at about five foot four and she wants a dude that's an eight.  on a look scales who stands at about six foot eight.  She thinks a guy like that will be checking for a fee fail like her, not realizing that she's a four.  But the fives, the six, the sevens and the eights and the nines also wants this guy.  So get in line.  Delusional.  Her perceptions of perfection, thinking that she deserves such is one of the reasons why she's becoming more and more frustrated on the dating scene.  Number nine.  I see this phrase all the time.  She says, you ever heard that?  And by real men, she means someone who's going to chase her and give her the romance that she sees in the movies.  Sorry, lady.  You are already hard to want.  So you need to stop playing hard to get and be happy that anybody would even reach out to you to date you.  And another thing.  If you were really gonna delete the app, you would just do it.  You don't need to tell me that you're deleting the app soon.  Maybe that is some type of marketing ploy on her behalf so that you can rush to the rescue and try to sweep her off her feet.  But many guys are not going.  Number 10, as to the reason why the succubus is becoming more frustrated on a dating scene while the thought apocalypse occurring.  number 10 is competition from Caitlin competition from Becky.  yeah I had to mention in Maine Keisha is not the only one with curves anymore and it's a reason why brothers are switching to Caitlin.  the fact is whether we agree with it or not the fact is that Keisha is just played out in 2019 and 2020 and beyond.  She's done.  Finish through.  Nobody wants to date you.  We want Caitlyn, Maria, Maylene.  Sorry, Keisha.  You are out of style now.  We have leveled up.  Number 11. as to the reason why the apocalypse is nearby, why she's so frustrated.  Number 11 is, where can she go, the succubus?  No one wants her as a wife.  I'm starting to hear Fifel say, and I quote, go where you are celebrated.  Shaniqua, where is that?  Oh, you say Jamaica and Haiti.  Hmm.  Yeah, those guys do wanna smash, oh yeah.  And they do wanna marry you, but for your cash, just like Dante in the hood.  So how would this be an upgrade?  They wanna marry you for your resources.  Who's beating down your door to provide for you, Shaniqua?  Huh?  That's right, nobody.  Welcome to the apocalypse.  Now the apocalypse is coming gentlemen.  It's not here quite yet but it's on its way.  We are seeing the beginning stages.  The dating game is changing.  The apocalypse is about to begin.  The game soon just might be over.  Of course, there will be some that will disagree.  But look around you.  Observe your surroundings.  Things are changing.  But for now, for now, the succubus can enjoy her hot girl summers or whatever hot season that she wants for a little while.  For it is just a season.  An awakening is occurring.  The awakening is coming.  Many are deciding to go foreign.  Many are deciding to date out.  Many are deciding to get that passport.  Shout out to hashtag passport gang.  Many are deciding to take their heart and their resources elsewhere, realizing that the world is full of better and abundant dating options.  We talk about the abundance mindset.  The abundance mindset is not limited to your locality, to your city, to your state, or even your country.  We're starting to think globally now.  Many guys are getting their mind right and their money right.  Shout out to the Golden Eleven.  They're getting those things right and they're traveling.  They're seeing other places.  They are truly going where they are celebrated.  They're leaving Keisha, the succubus, the fee fell behind.  And she is sought after nowhere.  Now we are really showing now who really is the prize.  Go over to Germany, Japan.  Go over to Thailand.  Go to Colombia.  Go to Brazil.  Go to Morocco.  They're looking for you.  And that's where we'll be going.
