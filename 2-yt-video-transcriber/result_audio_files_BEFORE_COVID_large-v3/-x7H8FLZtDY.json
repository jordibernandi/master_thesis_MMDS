            "text": "Oh boy, do we have a get woke, go broke.  story for you today.  Cafe charges men 18% gender tax to highlight pay gap.  This story from about a year and a half ago, August 2017.  Lo and behold.  The business is going under, at least according to this website, which apparently is theirs.  This is a really light kind of story.  So it seems as of right now, there's multiple posts made by this company saying they're going out of business.  I also want to be fair and point out just because they're going out of business a year and a half later doesn't mean they're going out of business because they were woke.  Although I kind of think that's the case.  I do have some reviews from TripAdvisor showing the business just sucked.  Maybe there's something that is related to the idea of being a dick, you know, and being woke, right?  Check this out.  Handsome Her is a space by women for women.  House rules.  Rule number one, women have priority seating.  Pretty sure that's illegal in Australia.  Men will be charged an 18% premium to reflect the gender pay gap, which is donated to two women's services.  Pretty sure that's illegal in Australia.  Respect goes both ways.  Respect is universal, but it's earned, not given.  So this was a story.  Let's read through it.  A cafe in Melbourne, Australia is giving its male customers a side of gender equity with their lattes.  At Handsome Her, men are asked to pay an 18% premium to reflect the gender pay gap.  Men earn an average of 17.7% more than women for full-time work in Australia, a government report found.  The difference is roughly the same in the United States.  And what they don't tell you, for anyone who has just for some reason found their way to my YouTube channel and still believes the gender, the wage gap myth, men and women are typically paid the exact same thing for the exact same job.  in our society.  However, women often choose different jobs.  If you want to end the wage gap, the issue isn't that women are being discriminated against, it's that women aren't choosing to work the same jobs as men.  You're not going to compare a male petroleum engineer to a school teacher.  That makes literally no sense.  But that is in fact what they're doing here.  And because male petroleum engineers make substantially more than female school teachers, they want to charge men more money.  Makes no sense.  Petroleum engineer job and many other jobs come with higher pay because of a higher risk.  Men are also, I think, like 80% of on-site job deaths.  With that risk comes reward.  You have to pay someone more money to do a more dangerous job.  Although I will say in America, it seems like being a school teacher is getting more dangerous with all the news of shootings and such.  But anyway, let's read on.  The cafe, which opened its doors for the first time Thursday, is hoping to shine a spotlight on the issue.  Okay, so I'll say this.  If the business opened as a woke business and they failed a year and a half later, then I would say it is an absolutely get woke, go broke story.  simply because you tried starting a woke business, you failed.  Most businesses fail.  This is a fact.  I want to make sure that's fair.  In fact, there are many instances where getting woke works just fine.  Captain Marvel made a ton of money and Admittedly, Captain Marvel was hedged by a bunch of things, like Endgame is coming out in a couple days.  How excited are you for that?  And people were just craving Marvel, so they went to go see it.  I thought Captain Marvel was awful, but I don't want to talk about that.  They said, all we really wanted was to raise awareness and start conversation about the gender gap.  The cafe manager told CNN the voluntary donations are collected during one week every month and given to women's charities.  But it didn't take long for the internet to go crazy over the scheme with some calling Handsome Her's gender text discriminatory.  This person said, discriminating against individuals for the group they belong to, race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity is morally and legally wrong.  Yes, it is a crime.  Well, I don't know if it's a criminal offense, but business, fine or something.  Others implied the cafe would run out of money because it wouldn't attract a wealthy clientele.  I'll give you six-month tops, SJW and sexist women voting with their empty wallets.  What could possibly go wrong?  Some had constructive criticism, calling the idea divisive despite good intentions.  Not a fan.  Whilst appreciate highlighting the issue of pay, creating an us and them is devices.  Flip this and Twitter is in flames.  But Nguyen is unfazed.  Men have their own spaces that we're not allowed into, so why not have that space for women?  Seriously?  In Australia, is that a thing?  Wow, Australia, you're backwards.  You have places where women aren't allowed?  Because that's illegal in the US, basically everywhere.  So wow, that's amazing that that's legal in Australia.  I'm pretty sure it's not, by the way.  No one has declined paying the extra 18%, she said.  In fact, a few customers, men and women, have donated more.  18% is actually not a lot.  Our coffee is $4 and 18% of that is 72 cents.  Indeed, men have come from across town to support the cause, owner Alex O'Brien said in a Facebook post.  We've had men travel across town to visit us and pay the man tax and throw some extra in the donation jar, adding, guys, you're pretty neat.  Well, apparently it wasn't enough because about a year and a half later, you are going out of business.  So there's a post here.  Let me see if, there we go.  I don't want to read that whole thing.  I'll read the first paragraph.  It's been a hectic couple of days.  Who would have thought one little chalkboard would cause it to stir?  Notes from the real world.  Yesterday and today we were jam-packed with customers showing their support.  I had a woman bring her daughters in today, and when she came up to the till and saw our gorgeous vulva stones and period sticker packs, she beamed, thanked us for what we were doing, and said, what a beautiful place to take my daughters.  There's a really weird phenomenon in feminism where a lot of these feminists publicly display their biological functions.  You know, there's like a Instagram photo where it was a woman's underwear stained with period blood.  Facebook took it down and she complained.  they brought it back.  You can also see that women like vulva stones and period stickers.  And it's like, listen, dude, listen, guys have biological functions too.  Could you imagine if you walked into a store that was meant to be like a serious place and they were like penis magnets all over the place?  People would think that's kind of a more sex oriented establishment.  I don't see how it's a feminist thing to put vulva and period things all over the place.  Guys have emissions as well.  Could you imagine?  Like, it's just a really weird thing.  I don't get it.  You don't go to a bar and like guys have like splooging wieners all over the place.  Anyway, let's read on.  In the end.  Nguyen, sorry, said, No one is turned away based on whether they pay extra.  Sometimes it's hard for people to change their minds.  We're not in the business of changing people's minds.  They are welcome to go elsewhere if they don't want to pay a voluntary donation.  So far, Handsome Her has collected a couple hundred dollars for Elizabeth Morgan House Aboriginal Women's Service, and it's definitely fueled a conversation.  But lo and behold... This post from handsomeher.com.au, our last day of trade, is Sunday, the 28th of April, 2019.  However, keep in touch with us via our mailing list or social media to see what we are up to in the future.  Now, you may be saying, Tim, this proves they were woke and they went broke.  However, it may just be that they were assholes because... Well, I'll show this real quick.  They have this pay-as-you-will thing.  they're doing for their last day, and it says, on our final day of trade, we're offering a pay-as-you-feel scheme.  And I highlight this just because this is Handsome Her's Facebook, and it looks like, yeah, it's confirmed, like they're going out of business.  So let me show you this.  Right when you go to Handsome Her, only a couple weeks after this, John P. of Sydney, Australia said, avoid at all costs.  Now, of course, you may be saying, Tim, these reviews are probably angry dudes who are just smearing the business.  And in fact, there are many people saying, why are you discriminating sexism?  And if someone's calling out the sexism, I have to question, is the service really bad or are they just political?  And you can take a look at this guy.  one review.  Well, just one contribution.  It was this store.  I'm not necessarily going to believe that this guy's got six, but however, Mr.  John P has 133 contributions on TripAdvisor and he's given most businesses an excellent rating, or he's given excellent ratings to more businesses than anything else.  In fact, he's given very few terrible ratings.  John P is a level six contributor.  This, and he's visited 307 cities.  This guy seems legit.  So here's what he said.  I was in Melbourne on business recently and a friend of mine recommended this cafe.  What a shame I listened to her.  It took five minutes to get the attention of a waitress who seemed to be more interested in chatting to her friends rather than serving a customer who'd just walked through that door.  I was eventually seated and chose the gnocchi paired with a suggested pinot noir.  The gnocchi arrived and I was bitterly disappointed.  The gnocchi was very undercooked and had a flowery texture.  The mushrooms were burnt and the dish lacked any real flavor.  The only enjoyable part of my meal was the wine.  I left most of my meal on the plate and finished my wine.  When I asked for the bill, the waitress asked if there was a problem with my meal since I'd left most of it on my plate.  When I told her of my dissatisfaction with the meal, she morphed into an aggressive and irate woman who then started dispatching some rather vile language.  Not wanting to cause a scene, I subsequently left the requisite cash on the table, which included a 15% tip, and promptly walked out.  As I was walking past the register on the way out, I could hear the same woman telling the other waitress working with her that I was a vile beast and that I wasn't welcome here again.  I certainly won't be coming back.  One of the worst experiences I've had in quite some time.  I would like to stress once again, it's a level six contributor with, what does he have?  He's at 133 contributions in 307 cities.  Does that make sense?  Well, he's visited 307 cities.  He's got 186 photos.  This guy's legit.  This is a legit contributor.  The photos is like, okay, so this guy actually went there.  So here's what I think.  Maybe getting woke isn't the problem because I've said this time and time again, and I think most people agree.  Real social justice is beautiful thing.  It's a beautiful thing.  When you say, hey, man, I don't want to judge you based on your race.  Most people are going to be like, that's great.  That includes, you know, people of all different ethnic backgrounds and even white people.  No one wants to be attacked for something they can't change.  Real social justice means we will judge people based on the content of their character, the color of their skin, and make sure that we can try to avoid all of these problems.  Throughout history, there has been substantially racist policy and law that's negatively impacted many a people.  And we have done great things to solve these problems.  and make our country more fair to all peoples.  It's fantastic.  Unfortunately, you end up with people like this who are really nasty and mean.  And I'm going to trust this guy because he's a confirmed contributor with a lot of posts and a lot of photos.  I don't think he's a secret conservative who goes on reviewing places and showed up here to smear them.  I think his story is true.  I think it makes sense.  When you consider... that they were being divisive and dickish in the first place.  Perhaps what we really have going on is that there are some people who want power.  They want to push other people down.  They want to puff themselves up.  And these people are mean.  Because the average person who just wants to be left alone to mind their own business is not going to engage in something like this.  And perhaps the reason they went out of business, it's not necessarily because they went woke.  But whatever it is that drives these woke people to be such assholes resulted in their business going under.  And there you have it.  No more business.  Sorry, you're done.  Maybe it's because you're just an asshole.  So while many people like to say get what go broke, sometimes it's not true.  Sometimes it is.  I did, excuse me, do a story a couple of days ago where we found political agendas do negatively impact businesses.  This is from a study done by Purdue University.  So very interesting stuff.  But I think I'd like to conclude with why were people upset with Captain Marvel?  Because Brie Larson is kind of a mean person.  There's this interview recently where she's kind of just like, it's her interactions with the other, with Chris Hemsworth and, uh, You know, and Don Cheadle, I think.  which is awkward.  And so there's been a lot of things where she's come off as kind of just a mean person, and that makes people want to not like you.  When you go on Twitter and say mean, snooty things to people, they're not going to like you.  If you go on Twitter and you're calm and nice, you're apologetic, and you say, I just really would like to have a conversation with you, they'll listen.  And then we can actually have real social justice, not this, this misleading garbage from a mean person.  I'll leave it there.  Next video is coming up at 4 p.m.  on the main channel.  I will see you then.  It's youtube.com slash timcast.  Thank you. ",
