            "text": "What's up, my brothers from another mother?  I want you to picture this.  It's your wedding day.  You've just taken your vows.  Your nuptials are done.  You lift the veil and pucker up to kiss your new bride, yet something tastes salty on her lips.  Well, today's video is about this very topic.  It is about a article that I had posted on our men's community, which was an interesting one, because I wasn't sure if it was real or not.  And the title here says, six male strippers on what really happens at hen parties.  Those of you who don't know, hen party is basically a stag get party.  I think hen is more of like the European, more British term for it.  So let's kind of scroll down here.  You can see six very quick points.  Roughly half of the brides to be at bachelorette parties had sex with me or gave me sexual favors.  C's were sucked.  I can't tell you how many times I had seen a bride to be asking for sex at the end of the night.  Number four, I know a few female strippers and they were amazed at what women would try to get away with because they're women.  Five, I did feel sick a few times seeing how the brides were pressured into trying to cheat.  And I've been flat out abused like I was not a human being by women and women only.  So what I'll do is I usually take these articles and I'll have some interesting feedback in there.  I'm not entirely sure if they're accurate or true, but here's what I got on Twitter.  By the way, if you want to follow me on Twitter, it's just at Rich underscore Cooper.  Well, lo and behold, a male stripper from the 80s says, I banged a lot of brides in front of their friends.  The red pilled me pretty hard.  I can only imagine how women act now.  So there's some truth in this article as well.  Now, I also shared it on my Facebook page.  It's just Entrepreneurs in Cars.  Same article.  There's a bunch of comments here.  I'll find the ones that are relevant.  Here's one.  Tasman says, I was a stripper for four years.  Seen it all.  Could have effed many wives to bees.  My moral backbone stopped me.  This guy over here says that these dancing bears videos are real.  Now, I didn't know what that was until I Googled it.  Somebody said you have to plug that search term into a porn site.  So I'll let you go ahead and do that and find out the answers to that for yourself.  But there's a lot of evidence there as well.  This guy over here says, I used to be a male stripper.  I know what happens.  I linked over here.  This guy over here says, not proud of it, but we used to wait around the venue that held bachelorette parties and male reviews, and we'd be having pints at the bar.  Like clockwork, you'd go out as the party ends and invite as many bridesmaids or brides to be back eight out of 10 times.  You'd.  This guy over here says, I personally know somebody that told me, yes, that happens more than you think.  She's been with a few of them.  This guy over here says a rag newspaper in the UK ran an article about male strippers and they said the exact same thing.  So verified another article as well.  I've seen plenty of women on hendoes and They are like animals.  It's like I've.  obviously I've never been to a stag yet before because I'm a dude and I've been to probably at least a dozen, maybe a dozen and a half stags.  I've never seen anything like what they're describing here.  that happens at these stag parties.  Apparently women are a lot more indiscriminate.  This guy over here says worked as a barman for seven years.  saw a bride-to-be and her future sister-in-law blowing a male stripper together.  Eye-opener.  Gentlemen, here's the thing about the red pill.  It doesn't exist so that men will hate women.  It exists so men won't hate women for what they can never be to them.  So I just wanted to share this article and some of these experiences.  A lot of guys ask me questions that kind of tie into this sort of thing and female nature and behavior.  This was more of a new one to me.  I wasn't expecting so many guys to verify the accuracy of the article.  I wasn't even sure if the article was accurate.  Let me know what your thoughts are or any experiences you might have in the comments below.  I mean, this is a little bit of a big one for me.  I'm usually not surprised by too much these days, but look up Dancing Bear and you'll see exactly what they're talking about.  Anyway, see you guys in the next video.  Peace. ",
