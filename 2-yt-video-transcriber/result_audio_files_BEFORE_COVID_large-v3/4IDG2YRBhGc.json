            "text": "Well, I am really feeling like the little boy in the movie, Preacher's Wife, who says, enough, because this drama with Wendy Williams never seems to freaking end.  Okay, we all should know that Wendy was married to a gentleman named Bert Jerkery.  They apparently started dating in 1992 upon meeting at a New York radio station where they worked together.  But after a year of marriage, they called it quits in 1995.  But it seems there's a bit more information to it that he's discovering and realizing now, especially after, you know, Wendy's bizarre behavior lately.  This is what he's saying.  He had no idea at the time about Wendy Williams alleged drug use.  But in hindsight, he explains a lot.  Burt says that things got strange immediately after they tied the knot.  Then he goes on to say it was very bizarre.  She just turned into a different person.  I don't know what was going on.  I didn't understand a lot of things that she did.  I didn't understand what her motivations were, said Burt's.  He also said it wasn't long before they had a big blowout that caused their relationship to become very strained.  It seems on their wedding day, whereas he realized that the marriage wasn't what he thought.  Because Wendy Williams had a reporter from some magazine and a photographer riding a limo with him from the church.  to the reception.  Oh yes, on their wedding day.  Yeah.  He said he found that to be very bizarre because he felt it should have been a private moment, you know?  Oh, I'm not done yet because he gets a reader.  He also had to say that on their honeymoon in Rio when she insisted on spending the night alone because he didn't want her going out by herself because he was concerned for her safety.  And apparently that led to a huge fight.  But now he thinks it is possible that Winnie Williams wanted to go out alone for a drug-related reason because he knew she was doing drugs at the time, but she kept that away from him, and he assumed that she did.  I mean, he states that he didn't know anything about it because he was seeing strange behavior and behavior that he didn't understand upon looking at it, but now he's looking back at it, and he's like, okay, this could have been the reason why because it's somewhat similar to the way she was acting then.  now what can we deduce from this information?  well for one wendy has admitted on several occasions that she was doing drugs.  around that time she also admitted that this marriage was a bust and that's the reason why she had this phobia against weddings.  oh and you know what's also sweet.  guess what.  guess who divorced who.  you guessed it he divorced her.  he divorced her yes because of her strange behavior And the many times that she had miscarriages.  and I'm telling you, I mean, it was seriously freaking crazy.  And she was sleeping around.  Word on the street, Wendy was a nightmare.  She used to sneak around and smoke weed, smoke whatever.  I mean, she slept with many men and women.  It was crazy.  There's a lot about Wendy's past that a lot of us don't know.  And I know upon looking at her now, it seems like, okay, yeah, whatever.  I mean, the news media is seriously embellishing this story, but these are things that she said out of her mouth.  It's in her memoirs and books.  I mean, she admitted to a lot of these things, but she didn't really go into depth about her ex-husband, I guess because of how it ended.  But, you know, I'm glad that now he's realizing what was going on because he probably had that question mark in his brain like, okay, I'm not sure what the heck going on because apparently the wedding was very, very extravagant.  I mean, her parents, him, whatever, they spent a lot of money on his wedding.  So that's another reason why she had this phobia against wedding because a lot of money went into it.  It is what it is.  I mean, I hope that she gets the help that she deserves because this thing is really getting out of control.  I don't know what the hell is going on with Wendy Williams and I'm so sick of talking about her, but I feel that I should keep delivering her message for whatever reason.  maybe as a lesson learned maybe as an awakening because this is the truth to show and I'm going to always give you guys the truth regardless of what the truth may be.  and there is another truth I need to speak on but I'm not going to speak on it right now.  I'm going to get a little bit more information before I go into depth with that.  but it's big.  it's really really big and I hate doing this but sometimes you just got to take the gloves off and I'll speak to you guys later.
