            "text": "hey everybody welcome back to guns and gadgets your source for second amendment news.  a second video.  today literally just got this sent to me by a viewer.  thank you you know who you are.  i'm going to read you right from an article by my buddy adam kraut who is a second amendment attorney who knows much more about what i'm about to tell you about.  so i'm just going to read from what he has written here and this has to do with the atf.  and they changed their mind on AR pistols and how we're supposed to measure the length of them and when it becomes illegal to put a vertical four grip on them.  So listen up, take two seconds of your time, but if you have an AR pistol you need to listen to this.  So the letter that they released says this, the firearms technology industry services branch has previously determined that stabilizing braces may be assembled on firearms as accessories.  In contrast to stocks on rifles or shotguns, stabilizing braces are merely accessories and not relevant to the classification of a pistol under the statutory definition.  That is, a folding stock on a rifle or shotgun is included in the overall length measurements because the firearm must be designed or redesigned and intended to be fired from the shoulder.  To be so classified, the stock is therefore an essential element in the statutory definition.  So what does this mean?  Based on that ATF letter, they're taking the position now that because a stabilizing brace is not an integral part of the firearm, it is not relevant to the overall length measurement.  Now, a lot of people should be like, oh shit, things just changed.  This interpretation opens up a number of people to potential issues of running afoul of the National Firearms Act, the NFA.  Particularly those who have built an AR or similar style pistol, which have a stabilizing brace and a vertical foregrip.  It seems to be focusing on this vertical foregrip, if you have one.  So Adam goes into the definitions, and I'll have a link to his article here on Recoil Magazine, and he goes into the definitions of what a pistol is and what any other weapon is under the NFA, but this is what it comes down to, okay?  The ATF has taken a position that once a vertical foregrip has been added to the firearm, it is no longer designed to be fired or held with one hand.  Therefore, it's not a pistol.  And it would remove it from that definition of a pistol.  It should be noted.  the ATF previously used this argument in the Ninth Circuit and actually lost on that point.  However, that doesn't mean that if they did it again today that they wouldn't get a different ruling.  Now on top of that, another problem that is here is the ATF has consistently held that the overall average length of 26 inches is the breaking point for concealability.  If the firearm has an overall length of at least 26 inches, it places it into a category of arms that could be considered to be regulated by the NFA depending on other characteristics.  If it has an overall length greater than 26 inches, it could remove it from those classifiers, again, depending on characteristics.  So if it's less than 26, NFA over 26, good to go.  So for this particular example that Adam's using, if the pistol has an overall length greater than 26 inches, it's not generally considered concealable under any other weapon definition of the NFA.  Although the ATF has stated in letters that if there's evidence the firearm was concealed by a person, it could still be considered in any other weapon.  And that adding a foregrip to it, a vertical foregrip to it, It becomes a, quote, firearm since it no longer is designed to be fired when held with one hand.  If the overall length was less than 26 inches and a foregrip were added, it would be classified as any other weapon.  A lot of craziness if you're not into the legal jargon.  If you throw a vertical foregrip on your AR pistol, it is now considered not a pistol because it's not designed to or not meant to fire with one hand.  They also go on to say that makers also create an artificial overall length measurement, pay attention to this, by attaching a folding stabilizing brace.  Such a measurement would be problematic because the firearm could avoid classification as in any other weapon, yet retain the conceivability and remain fully functional.  Measuring a folding or telescoping stabilizing brace would therefore undermine the comprehensive statutory and regulatory design of the GCA and the NFA.  The measurement of a folding or collapsing stabilizing brace in the overall length of a firearm creates an artificial overall length that would permit a maker to avoid classification as an NFA firearm without viable design or legal justification.  So if you have a stabilizing brace, You can't add anything past the buffer tube.  So you can add the buffer tube to that overall length, but nothing after that.  If it folds, you can't count that either.  So the bottom line, according to Adam, is based on the new letter, it is safe to say that the ATF is taking the position that firearms equipped with stabilizing braces need to have their overall length measured with the brace folded, meaning you can't take that extra length.  or to the end of the receiver extension, which is the buffer tube, if the brace is stationary and non-adjustable.  Adding a vertical foregrip to a firearm that has an overall length of less than 26 inches results in the making of any other weapon which is subject to the National Firearms Act.  So if you have an AR pistol or a similar AK pistol and you have a vertical foregrip and you have these folding stocks, you need to reassess your scenario because if you're shorter than the 26 or you have that vertical grip or folding brace, it's an NFA item now.  So I'll have a link in the description to Adam's article here.  It's very frustrating because people were like the AR pistol, This is the fastest growing firearm section out there right now.  So the ATF is like, you know what?  Let's do something about that.  It's frustrating.  Frustrating indeed that they just keep changing the laws based off of a whim or just like that.  So take heed if you have a gun that's in this area.  You need to make sure you have the right stuff.  Otherwise, it's a violation of the NFA.  Tyranny continues.  Hope you understand this.  It's a lot of legal jargon, but please pass this along, especially if you know somebody who has an AR pistol, who has built one in the past.  They need to know this stuff.  It's very important.  So please pass it along.  Until we see each other again, this is JR from Guns and Gadgets.  Be safe, stay vigilant, carry your weapon without a vertical foregrip if it's an AR pistol.  Take care, everybody. ",
