            "text": "So first of all, the title is about the article I'm going to read.  I'm not cheating on my boyfriend.  Are you serious?  You think I could do better than this?  No.  Second of all, Hello and welcome back to the Momo Wearing Eyeliner channel.  Today we will be reading an article by the BBC called, I secretly date people who aren't my boyfriend, but I don't think it's cheating.  Hey, so I know I stole your bike and your TV and $200 out of your wallet, but I don't consider it stealing.  Whom thinks like this?  To whom am I directing my rage?  Sarah, 28.  Sarah?  Nice to meet you, Sarah.  Now cease.  Do you want kids?  Asks the man sitting opposite me.  He's blonde and blue-eyed.  Not my usual type, but still hot.  No matter how well this date goes, I will never see him again.  He's funny and good-looking.  We definitely have chemistry.  But as soon as I leave the bar tonight, I'll block him on all messaging apps, delete his number, and unmatch him from the dating app that we met on.  Wow, that's not completely psychotic and void of empathy at all.  Hey guy that probably struggles finding love like many people do.  I know you and I had great chemistry and everything, but I'm going to block you everywhere with absolutely no explanation and just leave you wondering what the hell you did wrong.  A memory that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life as you lay in bed at night, unable to sleep, thinking about the one that got away.  Teehee!  See, I'm in a relationship, but not with the man I'm on a date with.  Even though I've been in a relationship for six years with a man I see myself having a future with, every so often I go on dates with strangers I meet online.  I'm definitely not the only one doing this.  According to one recent, wide-ranging study by researchers in the Netherlands and USA, between 18% and 25% of users swiping on one of the world's most popular dating apps are actually in a committed relationship.  Okay, first of all, what a black pill.  Second of all, look at all these people cheating on their partners, therefore what I'm doing is not abnormal and not bad is a really sad justification for what you are doing.  It started two years ago when I was 26 and went through a really destabilizing period in my life.  I lost my job as a graphic designer and found out my boyfriend, despite being kind and wonderful in so many ways, was cheating on me.  Oh!  What a twist!  You're both assholes!  The night he confessed, I remember all the air rushing out of my lungs.  For a few minutes, I couldn't move or speak.  I just stared at him.  This wasn't just a relationship.  This was THE relationship.  Okay, this is actually incredibly sad.  This woman was seriously in love with this dude and he just crushed her heart.  Where does he live, Sarah?  I just want to talk.  A few weeks later, I was at a friend's house and she let me scroll through her dating apps.  But after a few weeks, the swiping wasn't enough.  That first app date was a lot of fun.  We ended up going on a bar crawl, doing shots, and dancing until 2am.  At the end of the night, we kissed, but that's as far as it went.  Despite the fact that I had just been on a date with someone else, I felt like I was owed this freedom and didn't see it as cheating.  I knew I'd never sleep with the guy, so I was still upholding a lot of the boundaries that my boyfriend hadn't.  This might be a hot take, but I think emotional cheating is just as bad as regular cheating.  I'm pretty sure that any expert would agree.  This is one of the world's worst ways to handle a partner's infidelity.  But honestly, I didn't care.  Sometimes, I'd feel bad for the guys.  Some of them were obviously looking for something serious, and I was just wasting their time.  I remember one in particular who was really caught up about his ex cheating on him.  We talked about it a lot.  I vaguely told him that I had similar experiences, but I cried all the way home because I felt like I was re-traumatizing him in some way.  Okay, so Sarah's not completely heartless, yet she keeps doing it.  I know punching you in the face hurts, but it makes me feel good.  Shit!  Even now, I don't think what I'm doing is cheating.  Are you sure about that?  So guys, I shit you not, as I'm editing this video, Cosmo just uploaded an article called, I'm cheating on my husband because he refuses to go down on me.  I know it's wrong, but it's the best sex of my life.  What is this?  Okay, back to the video.  I'm aware that I'm betraying his trust, even with the kissing, but I also felt like I couldn't move forward with our relationship unless I was sure that it was still what I wanted.  Ugh, God, so talk to him.  Communicate.  If my boyfriend cheated on me, I wouldn't do some weird-ass revenge behind his back.  I would leave him, because that would be the best revenge.  Of course, I wonder whether this isn't just a sign that my boyfriend and I should break up.  Yes!  Yes!  But I tell myself that maybe it's just a period of experimentation that I needed to go through.  Wrong.  That is absolutely wrong.  Even now, I don't think what I'm doing is cheating.  She's not stopping.  The mad lass is still at it to this day.  The date with the hot blonde guy is the last one I plan to go on for a while.  Maybe the last one ever.  Honestly, after 18 months... 18 months?  Excuse me?  If I found out that he'd been doing the same to me... I would be upset.  If it gets any more serious, say, if we start talking about marriage, I'll tell him about the dates.  Wow, what a bomb to drop.  Sarah, will you marry me?  I've been cheating on you for the past 18 months with several different guys, but sure.  Until then, I'm just going to see this for what it is.  A few fun dates with some fun people.  Nothing to stress over.  For you maybe, but for the guys you've been using for a year and your asshole boyfriend who still thinks you're in a monogamous relationship with him, no.  In conclusion, throw the whole couple out.  What do you guys think?  What do you guys think about this story and this situation?  I thought it's actually way sadder than it was funny.  I'm sorry about that.  Either they need to be in a polyamorous relationship or break up.  Insecurity is a hell of a drug and it can do crazy shit to people.  Try your hardest not to make others suffer in the path of your self-destruction.  And I will see you guys next time.  Oh wait, the bun.  I will see you guys next time.  Front of the world, la la la la la la. ",
