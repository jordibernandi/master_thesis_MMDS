            "text": "What's up everybody, it's your girl.  back for another video.  So, in this video I'm going to talk about toxic masculinity some more.  It's really funny that liberals, feminists, call masculine men toxic.  That it's toxic just to be masculine.  When men were biologically made to be masculine, that's just naturally what men are, just like Women are supposed to be feminine.  Women are supposed to be nurturing and emotional.  That's just the way we're biologically designed.  It's, it's not toxic to be what you're designed biologically to be.  Um, you know, I don't think liberals would like it very much if people were saying it's toxic to be gay.  It's toxic to be transgender.  You know, if you say things like that, they'll call you a racist, sexist, homophobic bigot.  Um, They would call you all of that if you dare say that it's toxic to be a certain skin color, that it's toxic to be, you know, any of those things.  But it's okay to say that it's toxic to be masculine.  You know, men are under attack in this country.  Liberals, feminists are out to attack, sabotage men.  Straight, heterosexual, healthy men.  It's funny that I'll hear a lot of women... like the first thing women will attack men for, like let's say a man is showing signs of being emotional or you know, really not being masculine enough, the first thing women will say is, oh, he must not have any balls.  Oh, he must have a small ding-a-ling.  Or he must be gay.  He must be a faggot.  You know, I'll hear men, I mean, I'll hear women saying things like that about men.  Or you'll hear them say, oh, he don't have no balls.  You know, that's the kind of thing they'll attack men for.  for showing any signs of weakness.  but yet they'll turn around and say masculinity is toxic it makes no sense.  it just shows you how crazy and dumb liberals and feminists are they just they don't make any sense whatsoever.  if masculinity is toxic then femininity is toxic you know.  and calling men toxic for being masculine is really a, you know, it's spitting in the faces of all those brave men out there that fought in World War II and all the other wars and battles that were won by men, okay, the men were getting blown up, watching their friends get blown to bits, coming home with missing arms and legs, with PTSD, you know, that was men, men were being drafted, not women, men, so you're spitting in their faces, the reason you have the rights you have today, the ability to have the dumbass opinions that y'all have is because of men.  Toxic masculinity.  So you can thank them for having For you having, you know, the right to have the opinions that you have.  You know, for the right to make this video.  That's why I have that right.  It's because of toxic masculinity.  You know, toxic masculinity is the reason that we have firefighters that are jumping into burning buildings to save women, children.  You know, toxic masculinity.  Those same firefighters are pulling... All of you liberals out of cars, your mangled up bodies because y'all want to drink and drive and text and drive.  All you reckless, irresponsible, dumbass liberals out there.  So you can thank toxic masculinity for that.  It's just ridiculous and it's really messed up to say that men are toxic just for being masculine.  These little boys that are in school are being attacked.  by teachers and doctors saying they have ADHD and all these mental disorders just because they have more energy than little girls.  Just because they're more active, because they're bursting with testosterone, which is perfectly normal.  And some of them don't catch on as fast as little girls do.  Because some little girls do mature a little bit faster than boys.  Boys tend to be more active and they mature more physically.  than girls do, but that's just the way we were made.  That's just the way we are naturally.  But I wanted to show y'all this real quick.  I thought this was kind of cool.  I picked this up at the gun show that we just had.  This is a PMAG and look what it says.  Toxic masculinity, keeping snowflakes safe since 1775.  And that's lasered on there.  That's not going to come off.  The company that I bought it from is called Brothers LA Arms if any of you are interested.  They customize magazines and rifles and I just thought that was so fitting because it's so true.  Toxic masculinity has been protecting snowflakes.  All you liberals and feminists out there that are complaining that you're oppressed and you know you have it so bad in this country.  It's toxic masculinity that has been protecting you.  You know all you Feminists out there that think you're so oppressed by toxic masculinity, try going your ass to the Middle East.  You know, try going your ass to Pakistan and see how you get treated over there.  How you get slapped around and stoned just for showing your hair.  You know, all you women over here get to act like big slut bag tramps that talk back in a loud mouth and curse every other word.  Y'all get to do that because of toxic masculinity.  You know, y'all don't know anything about oppression.  Okay?  Just like People in the LGBT community don't know anything about oppression because try going your asses to another country where they'll hang you, kill you, stung you, and beat you to death just for being gay, okay?  So toxic masculinity is the reason that all of us have the rights that we have right now.  It's the reason that all of us were even born.  We were all born by a healthy heterosexual father, a straight father.  So you can thank toxic masculinity for your rights, And for you even being alive today.  So give me a thumbs up if you like the video.  Comment below.  And I'll see y'all back on my next video.  Bye. ",
