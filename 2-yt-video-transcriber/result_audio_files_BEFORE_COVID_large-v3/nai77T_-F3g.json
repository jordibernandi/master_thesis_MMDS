            "text": "So look, you know, Kalanovic, right?  He's been known as the man who... Marco.  Right.  Marco has been known as the man who can move markets.  And basically, something that he's been seeing in the markets the past couple of years has really bothered him, which is what happens when trading declines and liquidity falls away?  So liquidity tends to vanish in times of stress.  This is the market structure now.  There's nothing that can be done about this.  And that seems more concerning to an investor, I would think.  And his major point is that these markets have not been tested yet.  You've had flash crashes that happened in the backdrop of a huge economic boom, a really steady economic growth.  So what happens when these algorithmic markets encounter something that's less ideal?  explain how this works mike and why the fed had to engage in a 75 billion dollar repo operation this morning.  Well, basically the money market is sort of the plumbing of the financial system.  Companies and financial corporations need cash overnight or for short periods of time to fund suppliers, to fund their operations, things like that.  They get cash by pledging collateral, in most cases securities, in most cases treasury securities, and then somebody gives them cash and they pay it back the next day with interest.  And that's the money market system.  So the New York Fed stepped in to do its own repo operation.  The difference is they can create cash.  So they took in securities and they lent out cash to provide more liquidity to the system.  And it wasn't a big bailout.  It was a little.  It's just the start.  Remember in 2008, it was all the banks failing.  Right now, it's just a few in the repo market were like, oh, my God, things are falling apart.  And the Fed said, we have to fix this or the next day would be 20%.  Becky, thanks very much.  The Federal Reserve, in another round of liquidity injection, just announced results of its auction this morning, and it was actually oversubscribed.  $75 billion was accepted, but $80 billion was bid.  And now it looks like the Fed took this on and put liquidity in the system.  Seems like it's close to enough, about a $5 billion differential there.  Some traders had told me that if there wasn't enough, the Fed might come in and do another operation.  I didn't hear that from the Fed.  There's other traders expecting it.  But it seems like for the moment, the Fed is at or close to its rate, what it's trying to set.  Neil, let me just ask you one quick thought on what the repo activity means.  Is this something that you kind of look at and say it's OK for the moment?  Yeah, I think so.  This isn't a solvency issue like 2007 was.  This is a technical mistake that the markets desk of the New York Fed made.  They've had some turnover there.  I don't view this as something that's really telling us something about the economy.  This is a technical mistake.  Because there's two things that the central bank has to do.  Move interest rates the right way at the right time and look like it knows what it's doing.  And this undermines the latter.  How low can excess reserves go and still meet the demand?  Some of the markets are saying they have now found out.  And the Fed has always planned when it got to that level.  to add more into the system by selling more, by rather buying more securities, more QE, if you want to put it that way.  But it's not designed to push down rates.  It's designed to hold rates steady.  They may have to start that process.  Cycles always end.  And when they do, there are things to be concerned about.  And I think this is where digital assets can really help because an efficient digital asset can really solve some of the key problems in global liquidity.  The world's got trillions and trillions of dollars tied up in liquidity just to get around how clunky the movement of value is around the world.  If with a really efficient digital asset, something like XRP, and that's what we believe will be the most efficient, you can now reduce trillions and trillions of capital from being tied up.  So you can make those transfers instantly as a bank or as a payment provider or as an enterprise without having to have money pre-positioned all over the world.  We think about using digital assets as a great opportunity to solve the significant problem of trapped capital and pre-funding in the traditional correspondent banking system, which is extremely inefficient with the setup of Nostra and Bostra accounts, and we estimate that up to $10 trillion of trapped capital are being used very inefficiently as a result of this legacy system that we're currently moving money with.  XRP is a decentralized open source asset that was specifically built for the payments use case.  And so it has real utility and value and that is a key differentiator of our digital asset versus other cryptocurrencies.  What we are in today, our payment rails were developed 40 years ago, pre-digital age, pre-internet, pre-everything.  Actually, I find it amazing that I can order a package from Amazon, have it delivered faster than I get a payment from one bank to another.  The fintechs, are leveraging that vacuum, if you will.  They're attacking that vacuum, but they're doing it kind of in, I would call, a Rube Goldberg-ish way.  The consumer thinks the money's moved, but it hasn't.  The money's not in the account.  If it's going through the ACH rails, it could be a three- or four-day event.  A quick follow-up on the cores.  I know you guys have deepened discussions with primarily those three and a host of others.  Rough time frames.  I know you guys have been working to get this system implemented.  What are they telling you roughly in terms of how quickly they could be partners on implementation?  I think this the end of maybe this quarter, beginning of next quarter, they're going to start to light up.  You know, they all have multiple systems.  Right.  So it's been.  it's been tough.  I think FIS has told us they're doing what's called mass enablement.  So I'll use an example in the UK, which is a large value payment system.  It's called RTGS.  The central bankers in the room all oversee similar ones.  What we're doing is we're reforming that so that it is a plug-and-play system, that the innovators that the President spoke of, they can figure out different ways to plug into that system, bypass the banks, have direct access, and then provide more cost-effective services.  I'm not thrilled because, you know, we go up and every time you go up, they want to raise rates again.  And I don't really.  I am not happy about it.  But at the same time, I'm letting them do what they feel is best.  Trump's been setting up the Fed to take the blame for the economic collapse.  Now, Trump is being set up by ex Fed presidents to take the blame.  Ex-Fed president, New York, Bill Dudley, has written an op-ed in Bloomberg which lays out a fall guy case.  The only way we're going to beat him is to impeach him.  That is a terrible thing for this country.  If they're still investigating, will you raise the debt limit?  Will you sign a budget?  We'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  I'm a very capable person.  We're going to see what happens.  I can tell you this.  Let them get this angst out of their belt.  And when it is, we can do things so quick, your head will spin.  Now, what Trump and the patriots are doing, they are building a brand new economic system.  I think we are taking the moral high road by identifying currency manipulation as an unfair trade practice.  It really undermines the principles of free trade.  And it's a natural response to say if you're going to effectively apply a tariff against American goods through currency manipulation, making them more expensive in your own country, then our only recourse is to say, then we're going to have to do something as well.  Unless we call them on it, we can't begin to seek these broader remedies that I think would start to bring about a level international monetary playing field.  And that's fundamental to authentically free trade. ",
