            "text": "Here's hopefully a short synopsis of something that happened this week that I still don't understand.  In office space near a client, a young woman was meeting with her boss.  She was, by my estimation, in her late 20s.  The boss, also a woman, was giving her feedback and reviewing edits she had made on something that this young woman wrote.  They had been speaking in low tones, but their volume got louder toward the end of the conversation because the young woman was getting agitated about a particular edit.  So she wrote some article.  She's getting edits from her boss.  She doesn't like this one edit.  This happens all the time in this world.  The particular edit was correcting the spelling of hamster to hamster.  Now, I'm going to read the spelling.  She spelled it.  The employee spelled it H-A-M-P-S-T-E-R.  Now, that is not what the word is, obviously.  It's hamster, H-A-M-S-T-E-R.  Yes.  Okay.  So, she spelled it hamster, like a hamper where you throw your clothes.  Yeah.  Right?  But hamster, meaning the animal, there's no P in there.  Okay?  Pretty basic.  Right. ",

So spinning in a hamster wheel, H-A-M-P-S-T-E-R.  So the boss is saying, hey, we got to change that to H-A-M-S-T-E-R.  The young woman kept saying, I don't know why you corrected this because I spell it with a P in it.  And the boss said calmly, but that's not how the word is spelled.  There is no P in hamster.  And the young woman replied, but you don't know that.  I learned to spell it with a P and that's how I spell it.  The boss remaining very calm and professional.  Let's go to dictionary.com and look it up together.  Now, again, as the writer points out, this is a woman in her late 20s, not a fifth grader.  The young woman insists she doesn't need to look it up because it's fine to spell it with a P because that's how she wanted to spell it. ",

The boss says, I know edits can be difficult to go over sometimes, especially when you're working on new kinds of things as you grow in your career.  But it's a necessary process and makes us all better at what we do.  Can't handle it better than that, right?  You can't handle this craziness better than that.  Yeah.
