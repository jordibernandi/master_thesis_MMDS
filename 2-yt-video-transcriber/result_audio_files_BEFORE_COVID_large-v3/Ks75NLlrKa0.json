So last week, I did a pretty heated response to Paul and Morgan's video on birth control.  I was genuinely furious that they promoted irresponsible sex sex that could lead to unwanted pregnancies, while simultaneously putting out a livestream where they told outright lies about abortion.  However, for this video I'm going to take a different tone.  One, I'm going to explain the common misconceptions between pro-life and pro-choice people.  Two, I'm going to solve abortion.  This is not a joke, I have it figured out.  I am praying so hard that you guys will soften your hearts and listen to what I have to say.  Three, I'm going to dive into these videos by Paul and Morgan to talk about some abortion, some stuff going on with abortion, and Sarah Therese. ",

            "text": "I think their perspectives are extreme.  But in reality, both movements are quite gray.  Each represents a wide variety of opinion.  For example, some pro-lifers do make exception for rape and the mother's health, while some pro-choicers believe that life begins at conception.  I, as a Christian, believe this myself.  But this, and I'm begging you guys to understand, is the wildest kick of all.  In our movements, we both pro-life and pro-choice do not like abortion, let alone love it.  What I need pro-lifers to understand is that pro-choice is not your enemy.  We want pregnant people to have autonomy and choice, but we want abortion rates to decrease.  That said, number two, let's solve abortion together.  Guys, get excited.  It's actually possible.  I got Dozens of letters from the Goddess Grey community from pro-lifers who actually agree with what I'm about to say.  Pro-life policy makers cause more abortion.  Pro-choice policy makers prevent abortion.  I know this sounds too ironic to be true, but hear me out.  Pro-life policymakers cause more abortion not because they're evil or lying to us, but because they're not educating themselves on what actually prevents abortion.  This is why I got in an Instagram fight with Morgan.  I regret to say I reacted poorly, but she responded to my plea to talk with, I will not be watching your video, neither will Paul.  I understand why you would think we have not done our research, but I have been doing my research on abortion for 10 years.  This sent me into a rage, and not because I don't like Morgan, but because the research that she's telling you guys about is wrong.  And I beg you, if you don't believe me, do the research on your own.  Because what prevents abortion is very simple.  Comprehensive sex education, access to birth control, and resources.  Let's take a real example.  Abortion in the Netherlands was fully legalized in 1984.  Despite being fully legal, the Netherlands has one of the lowest abortion rates in the entire world, fluctuating between 5 to 8 per 1,000.  Why?  Because they have comprehensive sex education, family planning programs, a national public health insurance system, cultural acceptance of sterilization, and wide access to contraception.  On the other end, El Salvador criminalized abortion in 1998, much like Alabama wants to do.  The result, Christians, is nothing to celebrate.  Despite being criminalized, El Salvador has one of the highest abortion rates in the world, 37 per 1,000.  Women consistently die from illegal abortions And pregnant teenagers who commit suicide account for three out of every eight maternal deaths.  Listen to that, Christians.  Teenagers that are pregnant, that are so desperate, they are killing themselves.  If you passed this bill and this was in effect when I got pregnant, I would not be sitting here today because I know I wouldn't have taken my own life.  Be pro-life, but fight your heart out for education, for birth control, and do not let your state teach abstinence-only education.  And unlike Paul and Morgan, thankfully, Sarah agrees with me on this. ",

But again, in both cases, which are rare, surgical removal of the scar tissue can restore fertility.  In conclusion, if you've made it this far, thank you so much.  Don't use this video to fight one another.  If we fight for access, education, and resource, you will only be looking at 5 to 8 abortions for every 1,000 pregnancies.  And then you can yell at those 5 to 8 people all day, every day if you like.  But wouldn't that be great?  Wouldn't that be lovely to see our numbers in America go so low?  I love you guys so much.
