The scientific consensus is clear.  Climate change is real.  Its effects, including changes to rainfall and farmers' growing seasons, sea level rise along our coasts, and exacerbation of conflicts abroad, are a threat to us all.  In fact, our intelligence community and two former secretaries of defense have cited climate change as a root cause and driver of instability and global threats, making it not just a moral imperative, but a national security imperative as well.  I'm curious, in your travels as an activist and as an advocate, have you heard stories or have you engaged with those who are focused on the issues of how climate change and the instability it causes internationally are impacting security issues and how those might impact our future generations.

There are so many people to meet and so many stories to hear, so I can't listen to them all.  But I imagine maybe one of the others have.  It doesn't seem like they have either.
