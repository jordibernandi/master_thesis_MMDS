            "text": "Jonathan from Northfield, Minnesota.  In light of recent discussions within the SBC surrounding the role of women in church, what are your thoughts on women preaching to the gathered church?  Is there room for disagreement in the Baptist faith and message?  Well, that is a question that's being asked by a lot of people, and so I'm glad to speak to the Baptist faith and message, and I was very honored to be serving on the committee that brought the revision.  that included that language in the year 2000. that was later affirmed by the SBC in one of its most decisive actions of my lifetime.  So the Baptist faith and message speaks of the role of pastor, the office of pastor being filled by men.  And it's very clearly a statement that it's men, not women.  One of the interesting questions that comes up is, did the Southern Baptist Convention believe more than that?  Well, certainly.  Almost every church, well, no, I'll say every church in the SPC has to believe more than that.  It has to order itself.  There aren't just pastors, but there are others.  It's also interesting to ask the question, so what did pastor mean here?  It basically means the same thing as elder.  So the very texts that are cited, and you see this because they are cited underneath the article in the Baptist Faith and Message.  You look at the text and you can see what they are, especially from 1 Timothy 3. you can see that this is very clearly referring to the elder.  So the Baptist faith and message just explicitly seeks to create an absolute center of common belief and also to establish a boundary in saying that the office of pastor, the office of elder, is limited to men.  And that doesn't answer every question about what happens here or there, but that's an extremely important denominational statement, a statement of faith, a statement of conviction.  And remember that when that was adopted, quite honestly, there were those who left the Southern Baptist Convention because they believed that women should serve as pastors, as elders.  They should be in the teaching office and should fulfill the teaching function in the church.  And that was one of the major issues that led to groups such as the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Alliance of Baptists, as they were known, leaving the Southern Baptist Convention.  So that's important to know.  It's also important to say that when you're looking at the Baptist faith and message, you're looking at what is intended to be the baseline expectation of all who will participate in the life of the Southern Baptist Convention.  It's a centering document.  Yes, it's also a boundary document.  It's a confession of faith, unashamedly so.  Then the next question is, you speak specifically of women preaching to the gathered church.  Well, here's something else that's important.  There's a context here, and that context includes, for example, the rise of a definition, the need for definition, that produced what was known as the Danvers Statement, a statement of biblical manhood and womanhood.  and also ongoing conversations among Southern Baptists and other evangelicals.  And the clear dividing line is between two groups defined as egalitarians, meaning that there should be no distinction between men and women in the teaching office or the teaching role or anything else, and then complementarianism that says, no, God has established in creation a very clear distinction.  There's equality of status made in the image of God, but a clear distinction between men and women.  and a complementarian relationship.  And God assigns to men specific responsibilities that he specifically does not assign to women.  And, you know, in complementarianism, you might say there have been two different polarities or two different arguments from the very beginning.  And you might say it's kind of a maximal complementarianism and a minimal complementarianism.  But let's just say that you can't be complementarian at all.  if you believe that women and men have no distinct roles within the church as assigned by God on the authority of Scripture as made very clear in the New Testament repeatedly and systematically.  And you can't be a complementarian and believe that a woman can serve in the role of elder.  And here's something very interesting.  I said the role because I think that's really important.  You have some people who are trying to make a distinction between office and function.  And I don't think that's legitimate because the function is the office and the office is the function.  And if anybody knows that, it should be Baptist.  So you have Presbyterians that can.  even, our brothers and sisters and friends who are Presbyterian, they can talk in a way that we can't talk.  And so, well, one of the arguments I've heard some Presbyterians make is, that a woman should be able to do anything that an unordained man can do.  Well, that sounds easy to understand, but the problem for Baptists is that we have no theology of ordination in that sense.  For Baptists, the office is the function and the function is the office.  So, I'm going to let Presbyterians argue amongst themselves about how they're going to deal with that, frankly.  That's not an argument that I think can hold water applied in every situation.  But even so, for Baptists, that's a lot more difficult because we don't separate office and function, and we don't have any kind of not only a sacrament of ordination, we don't even have a requirement of ordination.  Nothing says that a pastor of a church has to be ordained in the Southern Baptist Convention.  There's no such rule at all.  Now, when it comes to what you might call just baseline complementarianism, it seems to me that there has been a consensus from the very beginning that that means that women do not preach to the gathered assembly on the Lord's Day, specifically.  Because that's what the elders, that's what the pastors are assigned to do.  That's what they do, that's what they're assigned to do.  And both in function and in office, that's what they're called to do.  And that's not because we just developed those rules or principles over time.  It's because looking to texts like 1 Corinthians chapter 11 or 1 Timothy chapter 2, 1 Corinthians chapter 14, Titus chapter 2, there are very, very clear statements.  And, I mean, you might say they're excruciatingly clear.  And so I just think, and by the way, if you look at the leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention right now, almost everybody who's in public leadership, in one way or another, they're already very much in public, out front, you know, having made statements to this very effect.  That teaching role, that teaching function, in the Lord's church gathered for worship is limited to men.  And again, that has been a pretty settled conviction among Southern Baptists and among evangelicals. ",
