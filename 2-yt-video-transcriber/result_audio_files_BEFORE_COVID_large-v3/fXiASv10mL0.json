            "text": "People are saying, stop.  You're there to do the nation's business.  Not to tear the nation apart.  The deep state is panicked.  You see, before the Ukrainian hoax, we had the Russian hoax.  And who was behind that?  A number of deep state puppets.  But the head of the snake on that was again the CIA's John Brennan.  He was behind the the Stephen Halpers in the UK, and the Joseph Massouds in Italy, and the Alexander Downers in Australia.  He was the coordinator for all that, and then coordinated that package, a sedition package, a hoax, vapor, and then brought it back to the United States through what's called the Steele dossier, which was vapor-based.  paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and supported by John Brennan and networked by John Brennan.  Brennan and the CIA failed miserably in their sedition of trying to remove President Trump and his administration from power.  So they had to go to Plan B. Plan B of Vapor was the Ukrainian hoax.  And that's failed.  But Sidney Powell hit the nail on the head.  Remember, the underlying foundation of all of this was the illegal surveillance that was occurring through Obama, his administration, run by Brennan, then director of the CIA, and Clapper, director of national intelligence.  And they used parallel platforms where they couldn't be caught, one of which was the hammer.  The illegal surveillance was used to garner information.  But it was also used for something else.  It was also used to get information on anyone and everyone they could and use it as leverage.  Washington,  D.C.,  every political capital of the world, is based on leverage.  So the Ukrainian hoax, vapor, CIA-driven.  Russian hoax, vapor, CIA driven, illegal surveillance, real deal, all run through the CIA.  And remember, the CIA's mandate by the government is not to be involved in domestic affairs.  but international affairs.  Ron Paul recently wrote an article, quote, impeachment or a CIA coup?  A couple statements from that article.  It may appear that the Democratic Party, furious over Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss, is the driving force behind this ongoing attempt to remove Donald Trump from office.  But at every turn, we see the fingerprints of the CIA and its allies in the U.S.  deep state.  He goes on.  Now we hear that the latest trigger for impeachment is a CIA officer assigned to the White House who filed a, quote, whistleblower, end quote, gossip blower, complaint against the president over something he heard from someone else that the president said in the Ukrainian phone call.  As it turns out, the CIA whistleblower, gossip blower, lurking around the White House got the important things wrong.  About 15 things wrong.  As there was no quid pro quo discussed previously, And there was no actual request to investigate Biden or his son.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer once warned Trump that, quote, if you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you, end quote.  It's hard not to ask whether this is a genuine impeachment effort or a CIA coup.  Let's face it.  It doesn't matter how many gossip blowers they bring out.  And the reason is because President Trump trumped him early in the process.  He did something that they never imagined he would do.  He released the unredacted transcript of that phone call, which showed, as Dr.  Paul notes, there was no quid pro quo.  You want to talk about a quid pro quo, just listen to Joe Biden at the globalist confab Council on Foreign Relations when he bragged, yeah, I was there and I gave him six hours to either fire the prosecutor or they wouldn't get their aid.  Right there on video.  That's a quid pro quo.  And remember, we have treaties that we've discussed and I've gone into depth on them on the subscription platforms.  two of which are the countries at question here.  There's a treaty from 1999 with Ukraine and a treaty in 2000 with China between the United States and those countries about us having cooperation and investigating criminality that occurred of our citizens by our citizens in the respective countries.  So it was okay for deep state puppet Robert Mueller to investigate President Trump in England, in the UK, in Italy, in Australia.  And he came up with nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  But when President Trump launches an investigation into what happened in 2016 in possible foreign interference and collusion, That's worthy of impeachment?  Give your head a shake.  Anyone who buys into that, you've never read the Constitution.  And you really don't know what this country was founded upon.  Speaking of not knowing what this country is founded upon and not knowing the Constitution, that deep state puppet, John Brennan, Yeah, the guy who had his pet rats, gossip blowers, fabricate this Ukrainian hoax, who was integral in the Ukrainian, the Russian hoax, and who was integral in the illegal surveillance to get leverage on individuals.  Came up with this the other day.  Former CIA Chief Brennan unblinkingly said, rewrites entire basis of US judicial system in one short sentence.  Quote, this is Brennan.  Now listen to this, listen to this.  This shows the illness of this individual and the illness of the deep state and their movement.  It's evil.  Quote, people are innocent, you know, until alleged crime.  to be involved in some kind of criminal activity, end.  quote.  Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini would be proud of that.  They'd be patting Johnny Brennan on the back saying, yeah, good boy, yeah, that's what it's all about.  The presumption of innocence, this is from Zero Hedge, as a foundation of the U.S.  judicial system has seemingly been under attack since November 8, 2016.  An allegation is made, media runs with the narrative, the seed of possibility of guilt is implanted in the minds of zombie Americans, and the accused is maligned forever.  No court required.  Very simple. ",
