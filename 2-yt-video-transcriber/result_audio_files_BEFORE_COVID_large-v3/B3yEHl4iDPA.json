            "text": "Is Billie Eilish a demoniac?  Well, the short answer is, yeah, she probably is.  Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  I want to apologize.  I'm here at a location that doesn't have very good lighting, so I want to apologize to you, but we're here at the campfire, and a name has come to my attention by the name of Billie Eilish, and she did a A performance at an award ceremony recently got Artist of the Year awards and become very popular over the past three years.  The girl sings, she's got a beautiful voice, she sings pop music today.  And she actually, from what I read, she has a number of sensory issues including Tourette's Syndrome.  And she loves to just kind of be the modern goth look.  She loves to wear clothes that don't really fit her and that kind of stuff.  She loves that style.  She's got all different kinds of hair.  Just really she is a gothic type person.  But she's become wildly popular lately.  Now, this video is not aimed to really attack her.  I have a lot of compassion for her.  I really feel bad for her as far as what's going on in her life and the position that she's in.  I want to say a couple things to you about the music industry and some things that you need to know about this before we can go any further in this discussion.  Number one, I want you to know this.  First of all, these performances that you see.  It is my conviction that these are not entertainment performances.  I believe these are religious ceremonies that are being done right in front of you.  Now, every religion really, whether it be Buddhism, Hinduism, Catholicism, all the major religions of the world have rituals and they have open things that they do in front of all people.  that is kind of like a religious display that they do.  Well, the occult world has the same setup.  They have their open displays.  And the problem is that the occult religion loves to hide in plain view.  They love to hide.  They love to be secret, but kind of in your face at the same time.  It's really kind of a bizarre dynamic, but they love to do that.  And they're very good at it.  They've mastered it through the centuries.  They can be everywhere and nowhere at the same time.  It really is a bizarre work that they're into.  But I do not believe that these songs and these performances, the Super Bowl halftime shows that you see, I don't believe that those are just entertainment venues.  I believe those are religious ceremonies that are being done right in front of your face.  And I have mountains of evidence to prove that, okay?  Number two, I want you to know, the Bible calls Satan the prince of the power of the air.  He also, when Jesus was on the earth, he tempted the Lord Jesus, Satan did.  And he took him to a high mountain and says, I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world.  And what that means is, okay, God is all powerful, but for a time... the devil has his control in this world.  Okay, he controls the media, he controls the music, he controls the entertainment.  And if you see the trends within media, music, entertainment, You can see consistency.  And when you compare God's plan to what's being done in the mainstream media today, you can see there's a dynamic difference.  I mean, they're totally opposite to each other.  And really, Billie Eilish is playing a role in that.  And I believe that her mind is blinded.  2 Corinthians 4, if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost to them.  whom the godless world has blinded?  the minds of them that believe not.  I believe she has perfectly working eyes, but her mind is blinded to the agenda that she's being used to push.  Climate change was the agenda that she was used during her performance of that video music award show.  She was wearing something that said, you know, there's no music on a dead planet.  And so she's being used to promote global warming, which I'm convinced that Global warming is going to be a facet of the one world government that's going to come to be.  And one of the great holdouts of that right now is America.  Thank God for that.  But climate change is going to be a Trojan horse to bring in one world government.  And you can see the popularity of that rising every year.  And anybody, you mark it down, anybody who wholeheartedly gives their life to preventing global warming is not a Christian, and they're not operating under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God.  They're operating under the spirit of this world, the spirit that operates in the children of disobedience.  Go read Ephesians chapter two, you'll see that.  And Billy Elish has that mark.  There's another thing I want you to see, okay, is the nature of Satan.  Many people understand Christ, but I don't think as many people understand the nature of Satan.  He is Lucifer.  He's the light bearer.  2 Corinthians 11 talks about he manifests himself as an angel of light.  He's a do-gooder.  He operates under the guise of good works.  And he's always, he's very deceptive.  Now, kinetically in the Bible, the first mention of Satan was the serpent in Genesis 3.  And the Bible uses the word subtle.  The serpent was more subtle, which means that he's very sneaky.  And I guess one of the best ways I could describe being subtle to you is, is to use the term cloak and dagger, which what that means is that he leads you into one thing, but then he gets you with another.  And that was an old term called cloak and dagger.  Now, in the Garden of Eden, you find that Satan, all he was trying to do initially, he just spoke to Eve, and he says, Yea, hath God said?  Is this really what God wants?  Did God really mean that?  And he caused her to doubt, but really what he was trying to do, he wasn't trying to openly get her to fall into sin.  He was just trying to plant a little seed.  And so he was basically misdirecting her, saying, you know, you can eat that, it's fine.  But he knew that if she ate that, what would happen?  And so Satan is very subtle and he plays the same game today with music.  He gets you to just say, oh man, look at this girl's voice.  She has Tourette's and she has all these things against her, but she can still make these beautiful noises.  Man, let's support her.  Let's get behind her.  Knowing the entire time that this music is filled with anti-God, anti-Christ, demoniac lyrics.  And, you know, you just go watch the video that she did.  She performed a song called All Good Little Girls Go to Hell.  And everybody loved it.  I mean, the girls on stage dancing and there's fire everywhere.  And she's talking about going to hell and everybody just, yeah, yeah, go.  You go, girl.  Yeah.  And these people are literally cheering for over the concept of dying and going to hell.  I don't know how much more sick it can get than that.  I don't know how much more straight-up demonic it can be than that.  But it's subtle because everybody's supporting this handicapped girl.  Oh, she's got so many things against her.  Let's support her in what she's doing.  And it's disgusting that these people are actually cheering over a song about girls going to hell.  the devil standing back there laughing the whole time.  see look what I got them to do.  I got these people to blaspheme God all in the name of positivity.  that's what they're doing.  that little clip that I showed you this entire arena of people were blaspheming the Lord Jesus and they were doing it all in the name of of Billie Eilish and supporting her and being supportive of her as a musician.  That's a very subtle tactic.  Very subtle.  And so you have to be very careful.  See, the thing is, the devil is smarter than you.  He's smarter than those people.  He's been, he's playing a sick game and he's played it for a very long time and he's very good at it.  And you need to understand that.  The last thing I want you to know is that the devil is always going after the kids.  He always is.  Billie Eilish, I believe she's 17.  She's been going at this for three years now.  That means she started her music career probably around 12, 13, 14 years old.  And now, you look at her now.  I mean, the girl's a full-blown demoniac.  17 years of age.  She has all the signs.  I mean, she's running around the stage with her tongue sticking out and dancing and celebrating fire all around her.  She's quoting Luciferian lyrics in her songs.  She's quoting, you know, my Lucifer.  The girl's a demoniac.  She's got a devil on her.  And it scares me.  And really, you know, I'm not bashing her.  I'm not mad at her.  But I feel bad for her.  While the world is showering her with awards and affection and popularity and fame, I'm sitting back here thinking that poor girl, she's lost her soul.  And I do believe the Lord can save her, and I hope that he does.  I hope that somebody can reach her.  I want to be able to give her a gospel tract, tell her about the Lord Jesus and his love for her.  I want that for her.  It would be wonderful if she could come to know the Lord.  I think that would be great.  but there's something about the devil.  He loves to go after the young ones.  The Lord Jesus Christ, when he was on the earth, he grabbed a child, set that child in his lap, and he told his disciples, suffer the little children to come unto me.  Kids need to get saved.  Young children need to get saved.  I don't know when the age that a person gets saved is.  Theologians throw around the term the age of accountability, and I think that's a sound concept, but The truth is people need to get saved as young as they possibly can.  I'm a Baptist.  I don't believe in infant baptism.  I don't believe that there's any power in water.  But I know people who've gotten saved at ages, you know, five and six years old.  People have been saved, you know, below the age of 10.  And I think that's good and right.  I think a kid should be able to hear the gospel, trust Christ, and be translated from darkness into light because if they don't get called out of that darkness, they are susceptible to these end times deceptions.  If Billie Eilish, if somebody had just knocked on her parents' door in Los Angeles and give her a gospel track and tell her how to be saved, she probably wouldn't be in the mess she's in today.  And I think, oh God, what could be done?  What could have been done in her life if somebody had just told her about the Lord and been translated out of that darkness into His marvelous light?  Ladies and gentlemen, the gospel is the answer.  The gospel is what people need.  And the gospel is the power of God to salvation to them.  Oh, Billie, Billie Eilish needs to trust Christ as her Savior.  She needs to.  And I'm going to be praying towards that end.  But this, the devil goes after kids.  He goes after them, and he destroys them.  And that's why we need to reach them.  D.L.  Moody said this.  He said, if I give my life to over and live my life again, I would give my life to be a children's evangelist.  And, um, the same is true.  I mean, you know, you think of the most horrible people throughout history, there was a time when they were kids and they could have been reached.  Matter of fact, people don't know this, but Charles Darwin, the man who wrote the, uh, the, the evolution theory that we all, uh, come to know today, um, the origin of species, uh, Charles Darwin grew up in church.  but apparently never was reached.  I've read that even Karl Marx, the famous communist, Karl Marx grew up in church.  Someone actually has a letter that he actually wrote to his parents about how much he loves the Lord.  But apparently, I guess he just was a false convert.  You know, I walk into Walmarts, and I see these kids... and they got purple hair and they have no character and they're rotten humans, somebody's gonna reach those kids because the devil is working full time.  The devil's working full time trying to ruin their mind and get them into sin.  And the people that we see today that are tattooed and they're in their 20s and they're living these debaucherous, immoral, degenerate lives, You turn the clock back just a decade, they could have been reached with the gospel.  I preached at football camp this year up in Dwight, Illinois, Midwest Christian Boys Football Camp, and I preached at six o'clock in the morning service, and I preached on the rich young ruler, how he had the chance to trust Christ, but he walked away, and we gave an invitation, and 11-year-old black boy walked forward, that service and they trusted Jesus Christ as his Savior.  I saw him I saw the guy work with him I preached the message we gave the invitation and and that one boy came forward and I thought praise the Lord.  he has been translated and spared from being another one of these demoniacs running the roads doing crazy stuff And for that, I praise the Lord.  I want to give my life to that.  I want to do that.  I want to spend my days doing that.  And so, folks, pray for me.  Pray that God would have his hand on me.  Pray that God would use me.  And pray for Billie Eilish.  She's doing weird stuff, man, weird stuff.  And I'm not mad at her.  I feel bad for her.  I really do.  And she needs to get saved.  I like that old song.  I once was lost, but now I'm found.  Was blind, but now I see.  It happened to me.  And it can happen to her too.  So subscribe to our channel, guys.  We love you.  And we'll talk to you again soon.
