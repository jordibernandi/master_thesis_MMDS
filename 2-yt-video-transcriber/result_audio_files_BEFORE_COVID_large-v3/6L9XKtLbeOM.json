            "text": "Shalom Israel, it's your boy Newbreed coming through with another video and welcome to another midday motivational talk.  In this particular video, I got a quite important topic that I would like to discuss with y'all.  I want to talk about how there's a very select few people in this life in this, what they call reality, which is actually a matrix.  I wanna talk about how there's a certain demographic of people who are pretty much like Agent Smith in the matrix.  And I wanna talk about how they were marked since birth.  That's right, they were marked since birth.  Now, some people are like, Bree, what do you mean?  they were marked since birth?  You mean a birthmark?  On the contrary, I'm speaking about a mark that is not visible, a spiritual mark, something that was already given to you before your spirit manifested in a physical realm.  There's a certain amount of people, a select few, that have a mark that sets them apart from the masses.  The Most High God chose certain individuals.  He deemed them fitting for prophecy.  Because you know, in prophecy, the righteous shall awaken the earth.  The truth shall be spread across the four corners of this earth.  So there was a mark given to certain individuals to deem them fitting for that process.  So, you know, you got a lot of people saying, I don't follow man and I don't follow man.  But listen, the most I always operated through man.  So he's going to have his chosen men to lead and to teach.  Women as well.  But, you know, men take a leadership position.  But this mark, set them aside from everyone else.  In this video, I wanna talk about what this mark entails, the trials and tribulations that come with this mark.  I wanna talk about why certain people were marked.  So we're gonna get into various talking points in this video.  Now, first and foremost, This mark is very visible to spiritual entities.  This mark is visible to spiritual entities.  The angelic forces, they can see the mark.  They know that they have to guard and protect these chosen people.  They have assignments.  They're called guardian angels or warrior angels.  Some of them are even ministering angels.  A lot of us brothers and sisters who have the spirit of utterance and knowledge and wisdom, sometimes we don't even know where it comes from.  There's ministering angels that walk among us, whispering in our ears, keep us safe.  That little voice in your head that keep you from doing something that can be a downfall or be detrimental to you.  These ministering angels, they help you with that.  And then you have, also you have demonic forces that can see the mark.  From the beginning, Satan already knew that you had a mark.  He doesn't know much about you.  He just knew that you were different from all the other sheep.  So before you were even born, He was trying to destroy you in the womb.  Some of y'all had to go against all odds, literally.  Some of y'all, your mom was gonna get an abortion and it never happened.  Some of y'all had birth complications.  Some of y'all were born premature.  Some of y'all were not even supposed to be here because the enemy, Satan, knew that you were chosen.  So your very existence in the earthly realm goes against all odds.  He didn't know much about you.  Satan didn't know what you were going to become and what you were here to do.  He just knew that he didn't want to find out.  So he tried to destroy you physically before you can even manifest.  A lot of us early on who were chosen, who were marked, suffered various learning disabilities.  We were given titles.  They tried to denigrate us within the education system with vaccinations, prescription pills to keep our psyches diluted.  We were deemed as hyperactive.  ADD attention deficit disorder.  In actuality, we were creative operating both left and right side of the brain.  We didn't want to be stuck in the confines of a classroom because our minds were vastly above everything that was taking place around us.  The most high was placed the gym within our consciousness.  So these marked individuals could not stray too far from the path.  In a sense of, if you do evil, if you do wrong, you get caught.  If you go against the grain that the Most High set up for you, you suffer conviction.  You suffer more punishment than the average person.  You ask yourself time and time again as you lay up at night, why Lord, can I just be normal?  Why can't I just do what the world is doing?  And these questions continually are asked and you cry out.  You wonder why life gotta be so hard for you.  That's because with this mark, It came an algorithm.  Your life is an algorithm.  With this mark came an algorithm, meaning you will have choices in this life.  You will have alternate endings to how you decide to choose and walk your path.  Some people who are marked, the moment where they veer away from the truth, The moment where they veer away and try to dismiss their calling in life.  They are faced with near-death experiences.  And I can speak from that personally.  Every time they try to veer away from their path that the Most High have chose, they'll suffer car accidents.  They'll suffer anything, a fire, gas leaks.  near death experiences.  And it's used to protect you in actuality.  Because if you don't take the path of the chosen that you were marked with, you might as well be dead.  You might as well be dead.  Because with having this mark comes great responsibility.  And who knows, maybe we chose the mark in the spiritual realm Maybe we just don't remember choosing it.  Or maybe the Most High just decided for you.  But all in all, when you're born into this fleshly realm, no matter what type of obstacles that's put against you, you have to overcome them.  These marked people genuinely suffer the most, especially early off in childhood.  These people are often born with a high sense of anxiety.  These people are often abused.  It could be mentally, physically, emotionally, sex abuse.  These things are done and these people have to literally overcome all of these things.  They continually have to go against all odds every day and stay bold and stay focused and stay fervent.  So, The birthmark, it makes you a target.  It makes you a target for the masses.  Angelic forces protect you when you're doing right.  But there's also a dark side to this because you must be critiqued.  You must become refined as a person because the curse of sin has entered this world.  So everyone needs refinement.  So there are times where these marked people are faced with gang stalking, harassment, neighborhood mobbing.  Various agencies collectively come against that person.  They watch that person.  They tap that person's phone.  They set up something called street theater where all of these people who are demonic can see that mark within you.  And they'll behave a certain way to cause confusion and anxiety within your vessel.  See, we're not dealing with a physical war, although these carnal-minded people are doing things physically, operating in secrecy, using witchcraft.  They do things like put bodily fluids around your property when no one's watching.  They have assessment task force groups where they hire gang members within your neighborhood to watch your license plate, to follow you.  And it's those same gang members that's outside of your stoop, outside of your porch, outside in your neighborhood when you're getting up and you're going to work.  They're watching everything that's going on around you, around your household, around your apartment.  Yeah.  Who better to pay to keep an eye on people with a mark but the people who are right there with them in the same neighborhoods?  So people are paid off to do certain things because these marked people have a place in prophecy.  They create fear within the general public because these people have a voice of reasoning.  They are a threat to the new world powers because they are speaking against the travesty, the tyranny, the mass murder, the deaf culture, the promotion of everything wicked, the promotion of drug use, the promotion of violence, the promotion of hyper-sexualization.  And what end up happening is these people have a mark, therefore they're targeted.  And I'm talking about why else.  do they set up the CIA, which is counter intelligence.  Read between the lines, people.  Why else do they set up the Federal Bureau of Investigation?  Who are they investigating?  Who?  There's nothing new under the sun.  The prophets of the Bible, they were investigated.  They were investigated by the Romans.  If you go to Washington DC right now, you look at the buildings, you got buildings that have high columns and they're Roman buildings.  See, it's nothing new under the sun.  So all of these things that's put in a place, the surveillance, the cameras on every corner, all these things are put in a place to keep a close eye on the general public.  They want to depopulate the world.  But their main concern is killing people mentally, physically.  And how do you kill people mentally and spiritually?  You kill all of the spiritual beings, all of the marked people, all of the people who are the voice of reason.  But never, I repeat, never denounce that mark.  embrace the mark because if you don't you might as well be dead and if you don't stand for anything you fall for anything and it's better that you don't know the truth and remain in ignorance than for you to know that something is horribly wrong and that you have to be a voice of reason.  it's better that you didn't know and to continue to live your life like nothing is wrong.  Because your judgment is gonna be worse.  Marked individuals, you have a higher level of responsibility.  That's the overall message of this video.  You have a higher level of responsibility to the world.  Your job and your purpose is to stay focused.  Teach men to honor the commandments.  You got man's laws and then you got God's laws.  You got man out here nowadays trying to say God don't have no laws.  Couldn't be far from the truth.  So hopefully this video edified you.  It gave you some motivation to get through the day.
