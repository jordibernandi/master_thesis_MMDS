Let's say you're sitting in the family den looking at the laptop or home PC and you're on the internet.  Let's say you want to look at a photo of Kate Upton because she's hot and apparently your cousins had sex with her and you're interested in what that's like.  You're looking at a picture of Kate Upton.  Let's say you click a little bit more.  You're interested in what her boobs look like.  Maybe you can't find pictures of her boobs, but maybe there are pictures of boobs out there.  In fact, there are for sure pictures of boobs out there.  Now you're looking at them.  Now you're cruising.  You've got a taste for it, though.  Let's say you click just a few more times.  Let's say now you're watching pornography.  You're watching two human adults have sex with one another.  You keep clicking.  The algorithm is taking control of you now.  You're seeing lesbian stuff.  You're seeing penetration.  You're seeing double penetration.  You're seeing ropes.  You're seeing epic compilations of ropes.  You're seeing it all.  But let's say you just keep clicking.  Let's say within just a few clicks from seeing a glorious Peter North rope compilation, let's say you're watching forced feminization and hypnosis pornography and you yourself are beginning to become hypnotized and sissified in just basically 10 minutes from getting interested in seeing Kate Upton's boobs.  Imagine you're that child. ",

Chu says this genre is also called forced feminization porn.  Chu says that sissy porn explicitly intends to turn male viewers into transsexuals, in part by instructing them to understand their addiction to the genre as constitutive of their own feminization.  In the paper, Chu interviews one person who writes, about three years ago, I discovered sissy hypno videos.  That's hypno, like short for hypnotism, which in a nutshell are flashing subjective images telling you to wear panties, be girly, and even take hormones.  I became completely obsessed with these videos.  This is where Rod cuts in now.  Now imagine a confused 12-year-old boy, perhaps one experiencing same-sex desires, finding sissy porn on his smartphone and giving himself over to it.  It's only a few clicks away.  Imagine that. ",

I am a millennial, I was raised Catholic, and I first discovered internet porn at a friend's house when I was 12 years old.  When I was in high school and we first got internet access at home, I used it to look for porn when no one was around.  In the first few years, I had pretty typical straight teenage boy interests when it came to porn.  Having been poorly formed in male-female dynamics, however, I was very interested in having power over women, and this led me to search for hypnosis.  Since this was a very small niche back then, I absorbed whatever material I could find within a few months.  This led me to the site of a woman who specialized in hypnotizing men and making them think they were women.  Although the latter part just seemed gross, as I had no interest in being a woman, something about the power exchange appealed to me, even though it never did before.  He goes on, he goes, Just a PSA for the listener.  You cannot be hypnotized into doing anything that you wouldn't otherwise already do.  You can't change someone's fundamental moral core or identity through hypnosis.  Just a warning there.  In case anyone tries to hypnotize you into commit a murder, if in fact you do it, you will be guilty of murder. ",
