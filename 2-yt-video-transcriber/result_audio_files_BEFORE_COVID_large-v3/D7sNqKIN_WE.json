            "text": "Now it's time for everyone's favorite part of the video, the content warning.  This video contains content.  Some of that content is about eating disorders and fatphobia.  Before we get started, let us address the elephant in the room.  I used the wrong guard on my razor, and now my luscious beard has now been reduced.  to the fuzz of a particularly dark peach.  I don't like it.  You don't have to like it.  It's a thing that happened.  We're gonna get through it.  You're gonna have to deal with a bit more double chin today.  That's just all we can do.  Everyone knows I have bad self-confidence.  That's evident from the way that any part of a video or a stream where I don't have a script to stick to, I start stammering and get really self-conscious.  Watch, I'll go off script right now.  Fuck, why did I write this into the video?  I have nothing.  I have nothing to say.  I don't have any jokes.  I thought I would think of something funny in the moment.  I didn't.  And we're back.  I'm also a tinkerer by nature.  I like to find little tips and tricks to make my life easier.  There's some part of me that just assumes that everyone else knows how to live right, and if I learn from them, then I will become better, and my life will be more manageable.  And that makes me very, very susceptible to lifestyle marketing, the association of products and services with the lifestyle the consumer wants to be living.  I eat a lot of protein powder, even though I probably don't need to, because if I'm going to exercise, I want to feel like I'm a good, good exercise boy.  And I'm eating the same thing that fit people eat, so therefore, I must be doing a good job.  Hey, here's a handy tip from me to you.  Mix blueberries into your protein shake, and then you can pretend you're drinking the blue milk from Star Wars, like from that tit alien.  And while that might occasionally get me to make good decisions, it's good that I'm exercising, it's good that I'm drinking the blue tit alien milk, it also feeds into a toxic impulse to optimize my life.  It's good to want to improve yourself, but it's not great to feel like you're not enough right now.  particularly because if you don't deal with the underlying feeling, no amount of self-improvement is going to satisfy you.  And then, when you don't get the feeling you wanted out of the self-improvement, you're likely to backtrack and lose all of your progress.  But imagine, though, that you're in the self-improvement business.  All of your clients come to you with a problem, and you solve it for them, and then they don't need you anymore.  It's not a great business model, is it?  No repeat customers.  Now imagine you could feed into that toxic impulse to make people feel like they're never enough and they need to do more and more to be enough.  Then they'd crash and burn and need you, or someone like you, forever.  Of course, the downfall of this business model is that if people aren't seeing the results they want from whichever service you're providing, they might say, well, fuck this, this guy isn't helping.  And that would be a big risk.  assuming that everyone wasn't constantly rotating between all of the different mutually exclusive solutions to any problem on the market so that each of them got a steady stream of new customers.  Then you'd have to find a way to convince your customer that when they succeed, it's because of your influence, and when they fail, it's because of their own lack of discipline.  Now, it might seem like I'm talking about the weight loss industry specifically at this point.  And I am.  It's hard for me not to think about that in particular, given how deep down the weight loss rabbit hole I am.  But it's also more industries than that.  Financial planning, emotional self-help, health supplements, the food industry, education.  Even parenthood or family life are not safe from these kinds of emotional manipulation.  Oh hey, that reminds me.  Everybody welcome Grumbletum, the folksy woodland critter who feeds on likes, comments, and subscriptions to Thought Slime and Thought Slime videos.  That's what I do with them!  I feed Grumbletum!  With all your likes and comments, all your subscriptions, all your Patreon money.  You don't want... Grumble time to go hungry, do you?  Where was I?  Oh yeah, emotional manipulation.  It might seem counterintuitive to suggest that industries that sell themselves as a way to make you feel better actually require you to feel worse and worse to sustain themselves.  But you already kind of know that, right?  I mean, look at any fashion magazine.  The reason you buy a fashion magazine, aside from whatever entertainment people get out of them, is to learn about fashion trends so you can dress better and, in theory, feel better about yourself.  Or maybe just vicariously enjoy the fashion of stylish people elsewhere in the world.  I don't know.  I don't really buy fashion magazines.  Or know anyone that buys them.  But I know that the purpose of them certainly can't be to feel worse about yourself, you can do that for free!  Just log on to Twitter!  But then when you actually look through a fashion magazine, you see supermodels and celebrities who are already in the top, like, 1% of conventionally attractive people, and they've been airbrushed and photoshopped to hell and back to be impossibly thin, impossibly unblemished, and free of any wrinkles or stretch marks or... wedding rings for some reason!  And you start to think... Wow.  I look like a garbage pail kid in comparison.  Even if you intellectually know that these photos are not realistic, it's hard not to compare yourself to them.  It's hard not to feel bad when you compare yourself to Chris Hemsworth or Rihanna.  And it's a lot harder when they've been carefully photo-manipulated to look even more unattainably attractive.  Stop me if you've heard this one before.  Dave wants to get diesel.  Dave wants to be called Dave the Rock Dave.  So Dave signs up for a gym membership, starts reading a bunch of fitness guides, starts tracking his macros, eating clean, and lifting weights, doing all the stuff you're supposed to do to get jacked and stacked, especially in the back.  For about a month.  And then Dave sinks into a deep depression, eats a bunch of pizza, gives up on getting diesel, and feels like shit about himself.  Then a few months or years go by, and then Dave decides to go through the entire cycle again.  Does that sound familiar to you?  I've done this more times than I can count, personally.  I'm doing it right now, by the way.  I'm really hoping that in a couple of months I don't do the exact same thing, but if history is anything to go by... I probably will.  I don't know.  I can't see the future.  I can't even imagine the future.  I used to.  I used to think about it a lot.  But now, whenever I close my eyes, all I see are stars in the night sky getting closer and closer and closer until I realize those aren't stars.  They're eyeballs.  Hello and welcome to the Eyeball Zone.  Here in the Eyeball Zone we promote Lefty projects using the unlimited and unrivaled power of eyeballs.  Many of you have failed me because you are not following and subscribed to my pal Casey Explosion on Twitch.tv.  Right now she's applying for partnership on Twitch which means she's got to keep her view numbers high.  Casey is one of the most relentlessly positive people I know and I don't think you're going to find very many more welcoming spaces on Twitch than her streams.  And if you listen to her voice without feeling relaxed, you need to go to the hospital right now.  That's twitch.tv.  slash caseyexplosion, nerds.  Hey, you got some kind of small lefty project you want to see featured here on the Eyeball Zone?  Please send me exactly one email with pertinent details like your pronouns at thoughtslimeeditor at gmail dot com.  Why did Dave and I go through this pattern?  Seems pretty obvious to me.  The desire to change ourselves isn't based in a natural, healthy desire to get stronger or be healthier or whatever.  It's motivated by self-disgust.  And that isn't very motivational, for a lot of reasons.  Every day we wake up, feel shitty about ourselves, and try to fix it.  So if we ever feel good about ourselves, our motivation goes away.  But conversely, if we ever feel too bad about ourselves, any attempt at improvement feels pointless and we give up.  It just doesn't work in the long run.  And I guess now is the point when I've got to talk about this.  I've alluded to this in previous videos.  I'm not really comfortable talking about it.  But I am an anorexia survivor.  So far, anyway.  In high school, there was a period where I ate maybe like a couple hundred calories a day, sometimes a single slice of bread, sometimes a single clementine orange.  I dropped down to about 120 pounds, about 30 pounds below my so-called ideal body weight.  Normally, I wore 36-inch pants, and I went down to about 26 to 28-inch pants.  I got so small that I found myself wearing children-sized clothing.  Everybody noticed I'd lost a shit ton of weight, and most people were pretty worried about it, but nobody said anything.  That's not exactly true.  A lot of people said something.  They said, you look great.  Back then, in the early 2000s, the idea of a male eating disorder was kind of laughable.  I later had a professor in university who flat out said that she thought it was impossible for men to have eating disorders.  Now I don't consider myself a man, but that's how everyone saw me at the time.  And so people just kind of shrugged it off when I lost a dangerous amount of weight.  I've gained about 100 to 110 pounds since then, a fact that I am never not aware of, because no matter how much my rational adult brain knows the dangers of anorexia, how easily it could kill me, the vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, liver disease, pancreatitis, seizures, heart attacks, there's still that little voice in the back of my head that tells me I could look like I wanted to look if I just never ate anything.  Sure, I would die eventually, but until I did, I'd be thin.  Now, obviously, that voice is losing that fight at the moment.  I don't tell you this to make you worry that I'm having some sort of relapse or to make you feel bad for me.  I promise you I'm tracking my calories very carefully.  I'm definitely getting enough of not just calories, but every single macro or micronutrient except potassium, which I do got to work on that one.  I'm getting to it.  I'm saying this to illustrate a point.  I'm so unsatisfied with the way that I look that I find it difficult to fight off the urge to fatally restrict my caloric intake.  Such is the feeling of self-disgust that I have internalized from a lifetime of fatphobic media and advertising.  And I don't think anybody sets out to give kids anorexia.  You just want to sell gym memberships so you put a muscly person on the ad for your gym.  Or maybe the focus group who tested your ad said that the girl with the slimmer waistline made them want to buy your jeans more.  Hey, this guy's supposed to be a superhero in this movie, so he's gotta have a superhero physique.  That just makes sense.  Hey, this lady's supposed to be the superhero's love interest.  She's gotta be sexy, or it won't be a good power fantasy for all the 13-year-old boys.  Taken in isolation, none of these things are really all that harmful except definitely the last one, which sucks.  But they snowball on top of one another to the point that people begin to subconsciously associate fatness with shittiness.  If you want to sell soap or some shit, you're not going to show the soap buyers in your commercial living in a small shitty house.  You're going to show them in a large, impeccably maintained McMansion.  If you want to make a TV show about a group of hot 20-somethings making it on their own in New York City, you're not going to show them in the tiny studio apartments that real hot 20-somethings making it on their own in New York City can afford.  You're gonna show them in the coolest and biggest apartment anyone's ever seen, because it just makes for better TV, doesn't it?  And besides, it's easier to fit all the cameras in, so win-win, right?  So you start to associate smaller apartments or worse living conditions or just being poor with shittiness.  So everyone in all mass media is super good-looking, able-bodied, well-off financially, and no matter how socially maladjusted, easily able to pair off in a heteronormative couple with an equally maladjusted person of the opposite sex.  In a media environment like this, it's really easy for marketers to make you feel like shit for just being a normal person, which is exactly where they want you.  Most Americans are overweight.  Most Americans on TV are not.  Most people are middle-range attractive, kind of by definition, but most people on TV are real good-looking.  Everyone on TV is impeccably well-dressed at all times, because they're not buying clothes on a regular person's budget, they're wearing clothes on the wardrobe department's budget.  And even then, they're probably getting free clothes from major brand name outlets, or outright being paid for product placement to put clothes on the actors in the show in the first place.  The purpose of marketing is to make you want to buy something, naturally.  And the only way to make someone buy something is to make them feel like they need it.  People don't have a lot of money, they tend to be judicious about what they spend it on.  Usually, anyway.  It's easy to sell, like, a hamburger, in theory.  This hamburger will taste good.  That's the benefit of this particular hamburger.  That's what we're offering you.  Uh-oh, all of the other hamburgers are saying that they taste good.  What's gonna set our hamburger apart?  Our hamburger is for big, tough boys, not pussies.  You wanna be tough?  Eat the Beef King hamburger only at Hamburger Town, or your wife will leave you for somebody man enough to eat this tough, tough hamburger.  Some products, though, the benefit isn't as clear.  Or sometimes, there's just no benefit at all.  What do you do then?  Stop selling your product?  Work out something that people will want more?  Fuck that.  That's a lot of work.  Just convince them that their life sucks and they can only fix it by buying your shit.  Buy our gum.  Our gum isn't a gum, it's a mood.  And that mood is chill vibes only.  No wonder you're so fucking stressed.  You're not chewing nutritionally inert bits of plasticized matter that slowly release artificial fruit flavor into your mouth over time.  Plus, you probably chewed it when you were a little kid.  Remember how good it felt to be a little kid?  Buy our gum and you can feel that way again.  You'll feel safe.  You'll have time to watch all the cartoons and play all the video games you want.  It's the gum!  It's not the creeping inevitability of the grave.  It's because you're not chewing the gum that we made.  If you weren't stressed, how would someone sell you stress relief?  If you were satisfied with your job, how would anyone sell you career advice?  If you were happy with your body, how would someone sell you a fad diet or ridiculously useless fitness product?  Or a supplement that would do nothing even if it actually contained the substance it claimed to, which it probably won't?  In a media landscape that is funded largely by advertising, it's necessary to keep you miserable at all times, to blast you with constant reminders of the things that suck about you, all of the things you need to improve, and all of the unhealthy cupping mechanisms that ultimately exacerbate those problems, but will make you feel better for like a second.  So you deserve it.  It's a little treat for you.  You know what?  Binge drink that Budweiser if you want.  It's self-care.  That's what self-care is.  It's when you do something bad for yourself because it feels good in the moment.  When you think about it, making unhealthy or reckless choices is kind of healthy and kind of responsible.  So am I saying that you shouldn't ever eat anything unhealthy or you don't need to wear nice clothes or you need to live like an ascetic monk?  No, not really.  I mean, I think we should all try to be conscious of the products we consume, but that's not my point.  My point is that we should try really hard to sort out which things we actually want and which things we think we want because someone told us we'd be worthless without them.  Time for me to go off script again.  This is my favorite part where I get to do all my calls to action.  And I do that off script, and now you know why it's always so terrible.  Before I get started, I would like to say one thing.  I'm going on vacation in a couple weeks.  If you could send in some questions for me, I'm going to do a little Q&A to put up while I'm on vacation.  So send me your questions.  Use the hashtag... Oh, should have thought this through.  Use the hashtag slime question to ask me a question.  Fuck, what am I doing?  Did you know that on Patreon, that's where I get paid?  So that's a good place to go to pay me if you feel so inclined and are so able.  But if you can't, here's another thing you can do is you can subscribe and you can hit the like button.  All of those things feed Grumbletum, the lovely little woodland critter, and he's so hungry.  What are some other things?  Did you know about Scaredy Cats on youtube.com?  slash scaredycatstv?  That's my other YouTube channel where I talk about horror movies.  Just put up a video about The People Under the Stairs.  That's a good little movie.  You'll probably like it if you like this channel.  It's a very anti-capitalist movie.  Also, hey, why don't you check me out on twitch.tv slash thoughtslime where I live stream every Thursday evening at 8 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time. ",
