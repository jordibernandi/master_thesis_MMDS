She was just trying to sneak past.  You know, this is a little girl, but she wasn't so timid when I discovered her, when I saw her coming from behind that pile.  I look back down and just continue peeling my potatoes and she's like, then I hear this, do you need help?  And I was like, no, I'm good, thanks.  She's like, you look like you need help.  Should I call the cops?  And I'm like, no, you don't need to call the cops.  I'm just peeling potatoes.  And then she insisted, you look like you need help.  And I'm like, you need help. ",

But she kept insisting.  And I think she believed the I don't know what kind of connection she has with the cops.  Maybe there's an officer friendly at the local school who has convinced the kids that cops help.  But she had a little cell phone and I told her that I'm fine.  I'm just hanging out.  I'll just be there.  She said that she practically walks through that area every day.  And I was like, I'll just be here today.  You know, I'm trying to assure.  And then at some point, I never recorded any of it.  But at some point I was like, yeah, yeah, I got a YouTube channel.  Just, you know, I just I just make make videos.  You could see on the side of my car that it says Daily Roamer.  And then and she kind of like looks at her phone.  And she's like, yeah, I watch a lot of YouTube videos.  And I'm like, well, this is on the adult part.  You might have a child block for your YouTube.  She's like, I don't see it.  She looked it up.  I was like, I'm Daily Roamer.  She's like, I don't see it.  I'm like, you probably have a child block.  And she's like, I watch adult videos, too.  And then I gave her my name.  I even told her my name, Travis Hines.  You could look that up.  But she was like, I don't believe you have a YouTube.  I don't believe you're a YouTuber.  I don't know what she was looking at when she looked at her phone.  I don't know if she looked up.  Maybe she was looking up 911 or something.  But she told me she didn't believe me.  And yeah, that was that.  And she walked away.  Interaction lasted maybe three to four minutes.  And then she just walked away, walked past.  And then lo and behold, 15 minutes later, the cops arrive. ",

You probably, I mean, when you get the recording, you'll hear her little child voice.  i told her you know hey you know i just i'm just hanging out here for today.  she said she comes here no visiting.  yeah she said that she comes by here every day.  i was i was talking quite a distance.  it's like yelling distance from the end of my car to the end of your car.
