Get eSteam Goddess Of in paperback and Kindle Unlimited today.  Yesterday, karma came to two minstrels.  Well, actually three when we throw in Mussie, Dusty, Jussie Smollett, but three minstrels suffered karma coming to them.  The first of these minstrels to suffer karma was your Steve Harvey with the official announcement that his show had been canceled.  And the second minstrel to wind up dealing with karma was your Lee Daniels.  and your Lee Daniels found out that his minstrel show Empire was being cancelled by the Fox Network and this was a compounded blow because his other minstrel show star had been cancelled previously.  Now, your Steve Harvey is dealing with official karma as related to his career because your Steve Harvey decided that he was going to go Hollywood and abandoned all of the people who worked with him in Chicago, when he took his show from Chicago all the way to California.  Unfortunately, when he decided to go to California and go Hollywood, what he did was change the format of his daytime talk show into some sort of celebrity fest where they were sitting there, all they were doing were plugging products and movies, and that's what people want to see on a late night show, but that's not what people wanted to see on a daytime show.  and as Steve Harvey's ratings plummeted over the last couple of years, there had been an announcement in 2018 that his show was being canceled.  However, his show was moved into a death slot, and it was left to struggle in the ratings, and it was official this week that Steve Harvey's show had been canceled.  And this is karma.  coming back to Steve Harvey, because Steve Harvey... abandoned his audience to go out here and go Hollywood.  and with this going Hollywood he is getting what happens to every guy who goes Hollywood and abandons the very black people who supported him for a larger white audience.  Because if it wasn't for that black audience elevating your Steve Harvey to that position that he came to, he would not have been the superstar that he was.  And this is karma.  coming back to your Steve Harvey, because this was a man who expressed great contempt for the black people who brought him up to that level and showed those black people no respect, And now Hollywood is showing him the door the way they show every black man who thinks that he's arrived the door.  Because when it comes down to Hollywood, a white supremacist institution, they only have use for you as long as you're making money.  And if you can't make any more money for them... then they get rid of you.  Now, the second individual to deal with karma is your Lee Daniels.  And your Lee Daniels has done your Monique incredibly badly over the years.  Now, Monique was the star of one of your Lee Daniels films, Precious.  Your Lee Daniels abandoned your Monique after she received her Oscar and was part of the tri-numerate of individuals, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, who blacklisted Monique and prevented her from being able to get full-time work.  And your Lee Daniels now is suffering karma because both of his shows, Star and that minstrel show Empire, have been canceled by Fox.  Star has been canceled this year and your Empire has been set for its last season.  And that last season could have been prevented, I believe, had it not been for the actions of one mussy, dusty Jussie Smollett, who created a hot mess earlier this year when he decided to stage an incident where he was saying that he was attacked by so-called MAGA supporters on the coldest day of the year.  And your mussy, dusty Jussie Smollett, he staged this stunt because he believed that, no, he wasn't being paid enough on the show Empire, and he did not appreciate the $65,000 an episode he received for appearing on the show.  And like the spoiled brat that your mussy, dusty Jussie Smollett was, he decided to orchestrate fake attack in an effort to try to get the producers of the show to give him a raise.  unfortunately all he did was get everyone fired.  and that's all a result of his marketing stunt.  and because when it comes down to Empire Empire had been struggling in the ratings and it had its lowest ratings in its history when it premiered earlier in late 2018 and when the show went on hiatus it was struggling.  and then your mussy dusty Jussie Smollett came out here pulled this marketing stunt polarized people and then alienated the audience driving people away from the show when it returned in March.  And that led to the show having its lowest ratings ever.  And then Fox, usually a network that doesn't cancel shows until they hit maybe the 12th or 13th season, decided to end Empire because it was clear that the Empire was crumbling as related to Fox.  And the reason why the Empire was crumbling as related to Fox was due to Mussie Dusty Jussie Smollett creating a hot mess for the network.  A mess that led to the show that was already on the bubble becoming a liability for the Fox network.  So your Mussie Dusty Jussie Smollett cost the whole cast of Empire all of their jobs, and he also cost the production crew their jobs as well.  So he cost hundreds of people their jobs, all due to his selfishness, his narcissism, and his inflated ego believing that he was right.  better than everybody else and he deserved more money than everybody else.  now no one is making any money and that's karma.  coming back to lee daniels i believe because had lee daniels done monique right maybe he would not be reaping this bitter harvest right now because when it comes down to both your steve harvey and your lee daniels both of these men are reaping what they sowed later than they sowed greater than they sowed.  And it's clear to me that both of these men are reaping bitter harvest right now because both of these men did not make efforts to do right by black people in the black community.  Your Steve Harvey abandoned all of those black people who supported him in Chicago, seeking out white validation and approval.  And your Lee Daniels abandoned Monique.  a woman who went to him in order to elevate her career, and instead of him trying to keep supporting one of his top performers, he worked to co-conspire to blacklist Monique, and now the Fox network is looking at ways to get him off the air and get his projects off the air, because now that he's not making any more money for the white people, that he seeks validation and approval of, they now have no longer any more use for him.  And your mussy, dusty Jussie Smollett, he's sitting there saying that he's suicidal now, and it's all his own fault that he cost all of those people their jobs, and he cost a television show that could have gone another three or four years uninterrupted on Fox had he not done anything stupid would have remained on the air because when it comes down to the Fox Network they usually don't cancel television shows that are doing okay in the ratings but because of your musty dusty Jussie Smollett making a hot mess.  this is why the empire has crumbled and the Fox Network when it struck back decided to collapse the empire of Lee Daniels on television.
