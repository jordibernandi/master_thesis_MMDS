Now if you'd like to achieve all your goals, hit the subscribe button and I'll show you how to smash it out the park.  Hello friends, I hope this finds you well.  Today I was writing some notes for a video I've really been wanting to make for quite some time.  And that's because it's on one of my favourite topics, throwing yourself out of an aeroplane, with a parachute I should add.  And probably the parachute course is the best course you can do in the British military.  Before I go on, I just wanted to say, some of you may have noticed a teddy bear in the thumbnail for this video.  I just wanted to point out that that's purely Royal Marines humor, okay?  Do not go spreading the word that Royal Marine Commandos carry teddy bears.  Do you get what I'm... Bend and stretch.  Bend.  Let's get that baby working, yeah?  And stretch.  Good.  Now, if you can't afford dumbbells, improvise, yeah?  Maybe a children's toy, anything like that.  You got it?  Good.  Remember, big guns, yeah?  So, parachuting.  So I just set the scene for this parachuting story.  I was on HMS Invincible, the aircraft carrier.  It was based in Pompey, that's Portsmouth, and amongst the ship's crew, which varied from about 1,200 when we were alongside in harbor to, gosh, about 2,600 when we were on operations, when all the aeroplanes were on board and all the mechanics and the pilots.
