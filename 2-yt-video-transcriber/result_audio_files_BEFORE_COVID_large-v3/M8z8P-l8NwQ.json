            "text": "I want to talk about Tuca and Bertie, the animated Netflix show, and how it uses a sex scene to do everything that Fifty Shades wishes it could have done.  But first I'm going to just shove in a super short, lukewarm defense of gratuitous sex scenes because I don't want to give the impression that this is, like, the only correct way to do things.  I have spent a pretty substantial amount of time talking about the Fifty Shades franchise, but in all that time I've not really spent much of it discussing most of the sex scenes beyond acknowledging that they exist.  A big reason for that is that with few exceptions the scenes don't really do anything.  This is not a new criticism, of course.  Plenty of people have pointed out that the Fifty Shades sex scenes largely exist in bubble space.  Things stop, sex happens, things move on.  They are scenes that can be pretty cleanly excised from different markets without having a meaningful impact on the films.  They just don't have a lot of purpose.  Now, this is probably something you've heard before, but let's actually dig into that for a second.  What gives a sex scene purpose?  I'm going to argue, however briefly, a much more permissive interpretation of this.  Purpose is a narrative construct and it exists in that context.  It is characterization, it is world building, it is theme, it is plot, but it's also pacing and aesthetic fulfillment.  Looking good and breaking up the action or drama for a couple minutes as a narrative exhale are a good enough purpose.  Not every scene in every movie needs to be deep to justify its existence.  Fun is an acceptable aesthetic goal.  Where Fifty Shades ends up really falling flat is that the sex scenes are not only isolated from plot and theme and character, they're also repetitive, overly long, not particularly good-looking, and generally unmemorable.  Basically, the nominal value as aesthetic or pacing are undercut by not having a good aesthetic and killing the pacing.  Okay, so let's talk about a sex scene.  that's the complete opposite of all of that.  Tuca and Bertie is a 2019 Netflix original animated sitcom created by illustrator, writer, and cartoonist Lisa Hanawalt.  The series revolves around the titular characters Tuca and Birdie as they navigate the complexities of adulthood.  Tuca is a fun-loving, carefree, directionless catastrophe living off her rich aunt's goodwill while dealing with hidden pain and trauma, and Birdie is a nervous, career-minded data analyst and aspiring baker dealing with hidden pain and trauma.  The scene I want to focus on comes from the third episode, The Deli Guy.  Since her long-term boyfriend Speckle moved in with her, Birdie feels like their sex life has grown routine and uninteresting, which she catastrophizes as the seed of a chain reaction of resentment that will eventually ruin her life.  Parallel to this, Birdie has been developing a sexual interest in Pastry Pete, an authoritative, dominating, older celebrity pastry chef.  To spice things up, she suggests that she and Speckle try something new.  What have you, I don't know, ordered me around?  Speckle suggests a safe word.  Birdie brushes the suggestion off because she wants to look cool and strong, and the roleplay begins.  Maybe something like, bend over, you little tart.  Okay.  At first things are going well, but they quickly take a turn for the worse after Speckle calls Birdie a bad bird, triggering an intensely negative reaction.  As Birdie breaks down, Speckle uses his warm potato safe word to end things and the two of them agree to just go with the usual for the night.  Usual way, usual way.  Now this scene is brilliant.  While this specific interaction never comes up again in the season, the characters never try again or really talk about what it means, the themes underlying this scene form a thesis statement for the season as a whole.  Speckle crosses Birdie's limits, pushes her boundaries, but doesn't do so out of neglect or ballast or ego.  He crosses those lines because he doesn't know they're there, and he doesn't know where Birdie's lines are because Birdie doesn't know where Birdie's lines are.  I didn't think I'd react this way.  What the hell?  And it's important to emphasize that these lines aren't cleanly drawn.  When Speckle calls Birdie a tart and starts spanking her, she's super into it.  What Birdie doesn't understand about herself is that she likes the idea of submission but only in the context of validation and ends up confronting that about herself the hard way.  By accident.  Speckle wants to respect Bertie's boundaries, but he can't do that if she doesn't know what they are.  This, then, is the thesis statement that underpins the season, that we don't often know what our boundaries are until we hit them, whether it be in matters of sex, family, friends, co-living, or any other relationship.  Over the course of the season, all the characters confront this realization that they need to get to know themselves better so that they can actually communicate their wants and needs with the people who love them.  As the season goes on, the stakes of these conflicts escalate.  Tuca needs to confront her history of substance abuse and her toxic relationship with her aunt.  Bertie needs to confront the ways that childhood abuse has echoed through her life.  Speckle comes face to face with the possibility that no matter how much he loves her, his emotional needs, where he wants his life to go, might be incompatible with staying together with Bertie.  The show does a really fantastic job of getting into the chaotic mess of being an adult and the give and take required to navigate relationships where both people are willing participants who have their own complicated wants and needs, where some boundaries are big and obvious and others are really detailed and touchy.  Sometimes between people those needs line up and sometimes they're mutually exclusive and maybe we don't even entirely understand them ourselves.  All of us need to compromise and in turn ask others to compromise.  for us.  Navigating that space between ourselves is not a clean process and may in fact be deeply painful.  There are things we're willing to compromise on because it will make someone else happy and making them happy will make us happier than keeping the thing we compromised.  And there are other lines that we have to ask others to never cross.  Spaces that we have to ask others to give up.  And the worst part is that we may not even know where those lines and spaces are until it's too late and we've stumbled into them by accident.  All of this, Tuca and Birdie manages to touch on in one 90 second sex scene.  And honestly, I don't think you could do the same this efficiently without that aspect, without it being a sex scene, and without the vulnerability that represents.  And that's what I think really makes this scene stand out.  See, while I will defend the gratuitous and trivial for indulging in aesthetic satiation above metaphorical pursuits, this type of interaction, one that doesn't just have sex as the backdrop for things to happen in front of, but uses the dynamics of intimacy for their intrinsic qualities, it is exemplary storytelling.  This is a scene that couldn't exist in another context.  Birdie's relationship with her own sexuality, the frame of power dynamics and the specific boundary of being punished in that space, if you were to de-sex this scene, the meaning would change entirely.  This scene takes on heavy implications in later episodes when Birdie begins working with Pastry Pete who forces her into an uncomfortable situation with clear sexual undertones, a moment that exploits Birdie's own in-confidence in her boundaries, which spirals into Birdie making terrible mistakes that place others in harm's way.  To throw this back to Fifty Shades one last time, taken as a whole, this effectively demonstrates the difference between consenting adults exploring power dynamics and their own wants and needs and abuse.  And it does so in a way that Fifty Shades never really managed to do even when it tried.  At the end of The Deli Guy, Speckle listens to Bertie.  She does want him to be in charge, but in the vein of a Victorian bodice ripper, to sweep her off her feet with big melodramatic declarations, to be adored.  But even this comes back later.  Late in the season, Speckle and Birdie toy with the idea of buying a house and moving out of their one-bedroom apartment.  Birdie at one point has a major meltdown and disappears for several days out of town, during which Speckle can't get a hold of her because she refuses to answer his calls and then loses her phone in a lake.  Speckle then buys a fixer-upper house when a sudden opportunity presents itself.  While he thought that she would be on board with this spontaneous move, the stress of her vanishing and going incommunicado turns it into an argument.  You can't just be your rock all the time.  Sometimes I need you to be my rock!  And I bought a house!  Wait, what?  Speckle needs to confront both Bertie and himself and admit that while he hoped it would make her happy, he wants to move on with his life.  He hopes that she'll come with him, but if she can't, if their needs have diverged, then it'll be sad, but this is what he needs to move forward.  Managing relationships, navigating compromises, it's a lot of work and it's not easy, but as Tuca and Bertie argues, it's worth it.  We need that human contact, we need those support networks, flawed and human as they may be, because we can't make it alone. ",
