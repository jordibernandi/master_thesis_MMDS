            "text": "hi hello everybody welcome to this new video.  my name is Adam and today we're going to be talking about how is being trans in the country I live in which is Canada.  I live in Montreal Quebec.  so this is what I'm gonna be talking about.  I lived in different places all over the world.  to be honest I lived in Algeria which is where I'm from.  I lived in Malaysia.  I stayed in Indonesia as well for quite some time that I know a lot about it and now I'm in Canada.  so I kind of have always somewhere to compare it to like.  you know what i mean.  so we may not have the same like per perspective of it because you know someone that has why.  why?  why i feel like there's a lot of dust going on.  i feel like someone that has grown here lived here their whole life.  this is what they have seen their entire life will always find something to like.  hate about it i guess because you just get bored of it.  but if you lived somewhere that is horrible you're gonna appreciate the you know.  Yeah.  No, I'm not saying that it's, like, extremely, like, perfection, but in my opinion, in my humble opinion, I think Canada is one of the best countries in the world for LGBT rights, mainly because, yes, homophobia, transphobia could exist somewhere.  I haven't really dealt with any.  But then again, I don't know, because I'm passing, and not everyone knows I'm trans.  Like, very rare people know I'm trans in real life.  Not because I'm stealth or anything, I just, like, I don't feel the need to talk about it unless I do.  In that case, you know, there aren't many people around me that know I'm trans.  But, you know, whenever I need to come out, you know, in legal papers dealing with all that stuff, People are actually very understanding.  I just tell them, you know, if you're confused about my legal papers on trans, they're like, oh, okay, good for you.  And they're supportive.  And I'm like, okay, cool.  And I'm not used to that.  And I'm not used to this clothing.  being trans to anybody to begin with, especially legally, because I live somewhere that being trans is kind of, you know, not safe.  So I feel like I'm rambling.  I'm rambling.  I'm not even speaking.  Bref.  I feel like here race plays a big role, like in North America, rather than being trans.  The good thing about living in Canada is that, you know, you feel legally protected fully, you know, when it comes to your rights.  If anybody disrespects you for being trans, there is legal action you could take, as far as I checked last time I checked.  I have not encountered any situation personally for me that was harmful, dangerous, or in any way, not even disrespectful, like not at all, maybe just curiosity to a certain extent, but nothing major.  I have to also say that it depends on where you live in Canada.  So I live in one of Canada's biggest cities, so it's not going to be the same as in like somewhere, you know, on like the countryside, on like the mountains type of things.  it's not gonna be the same way because people here are way more educated on these stuff and you see them everywhere and you get what I mean, you know?  Because I know LGBT people that live outside of Montreal and they tell me like I'm the only one there, you know?  So I'm the only trans visible person out there.  so like people yes give me looks and stuff.  but again the fact that you're legally protected to a certain extent Personally makes me feel very safe, which is one of the reasons why I chose Canada.  I chose Canada because I knew it would be very trans friendly.  I think in my opinion, Canada is way more trans friendly than the US.  That is just my opinion, change my mind.  LA may be better, but like if we compare the countries as a whole, you know?  Also, if you're trans here and you have health insurance, health... If you have your medical... If you have your medical card in Canada, your surgery is gonna be covered, your hormones are gonna be covered.  So... Right?  Honestly, this is one of the topics that really interests me so much.  I feel like I may do something on my personal channel.  that would be like a project I don't know yet I'm just literally sharing random thoughts with you that where I could get different people from different countries in the world to talk about their trans experience and how it is and to compare it because I lived in different places and I was like God like it's just so different.  it's just so different especially people that live in Africa and Asia.  I feel like those need to be given even more platform to speak about their experience.  I don't know, I'll do something.  I don't know what I'll do, but this is the ultimate goal.  Imagine a Netflix show with trans people sharing their experiences.  Wouldn't that be fucking amazing?  I'm just dreaming.  So tell me about your experience.  Where do you come from?  How is it?  Where would you like to live if it wasn't there?  What is the country that you think would be better for you as a trans person?  Thank you for watching and I'll see you later.  Bye. ",
