The main reason they are so underrepresented is that they don't run in the first place.  And that's true, but when women do run, people don't not vote for them just because they're women.  An article in Political Research Quarterly by Kathleen Dolan concluded that when women do run for office, that there is no evidence of any direct, consistent, or substantial impact for gender stereotypes on evaluations of or voting for women candidates.  What matters most to voters is political affiliation, as most people tend to vote down party lines.  But in any election, you should do your research and vote for candidates based on their qualifications and whether their policies align with your values.  Besides, voting for someone based solely on their gender is stupid.  And also sexist. ",

Are you a comedian?  Whether you're a veteran comic or just getting your start, we don't care as long as you're funny.  Just being honest here.  We need people to help spread the word about this very important issue.  But if you're not as hilarious as Margaret Cho, don't waste our time.  Now, if you are funny enough, here's a list of thought starters that the campaign has provided.  For example, 42% of senior-level women say that they don't want to advance professionally because it would require too much of their families to make such a promotion possible.  This is from a 2016 McKinsey & Company report that states that 42% of women don't want to be a top executive because they wouldn't be able to balance family and work commitments.  But what Equality Can't Wait fails to mention is that 42% of men also have the same concern.  So you might want to fix that, Melinda.  Women on average do four hours of unpaid labor a day in the US.  Men?  2.5 hours.  Childcare, cooking, and other household responsibilities often unfairly fall on women's shoulders, which keeps them from participating in the workforce.  Let me get this straight.  Men work two and a half hours around the house on top of the 8.2 hours that they work at their job, while women staying at home only work four hours a day.  Wait, what is the argument here?  Ladies, take the win.  The percentage of women graduating with computing degrees in the U.S.  has fallen in the last three decades, from 37% in 1985 to 19% today.  So this is a very simple fix.  if you want your child to be interested in computer science.  Don't buy them this.  Buy them this.  And iPad's probably fine too. ",

And if you want to follow someone a little less unhinged, go ahead and follow me on Twitter, and I might end up following back.  Might.  The pay gap is so bad right now that the average woman's income is less than a Venice Beach mile.  Let me explain this so-called pay gap.  If you take the average weekly salary of every woman in the United States workforce and compare it to how much men make, you will see that the average median weekly salary is lower for women.  But again, that's just the average.  It doesn't take into account things like different types of jobs, work experience, education, or lifestyle choices.  For example, a 2010 study of single childless urban workers between the ages of 22 and 30 found that women on average made 8% more than men.  So again, this gap has nothing to do with men and women being paid differently for doing the same exact job.  There's a lot of different factors involved.  Do men get paid more than women for the same job?  Yes. ",
