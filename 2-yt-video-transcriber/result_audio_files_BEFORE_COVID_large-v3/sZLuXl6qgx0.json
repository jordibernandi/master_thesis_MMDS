            "text": "So you want to move off grid or you're looking to start a homestead?  Well, there's an annoying little creature coming up here ruining the land in Idaho.  No, we're not talking about Californians.  That's probably just a joke guys.  We're talking about pine beetles.  So today I'm gonna give you guys a tip on buying land.  It's a very important tip.  It's actually about as important tip as you're ever gonna get if you're moving to a land with a wooded area and you're looking for trees if you're looking for forests to start your homestead, to live off-grid, whatever you're planning on doing, this tip is gonna save you a lot of money and a lot of heartache.  You guys, behind me you can see a lot of healthy trees.  They're very small.  I guess they're alive.  As we head out onto the top part of our property, I'm gonna show you guys something that happened to our land, and it's because in forested areas you deal with pine beetles.  Now look at this land behind me.  See all these dead trees right here?  Now, all of those trees were just starting to die when we bought this property just a couple of years ago.  And we knew it.  We knew what it was.  We've dealt with them before.  Just from being around this area, we know what causes this to take place, all of these dead trees.  This is from pine beetles infecting the trees.  They lay their eggs inside the trees.  Their larva goes in the tree and kills the trees.  But they take out large swaths of land at a time.  they multiply and they're extremely hard to stop about.  the only way to stop them is to burn the area and hope you get ahead of them.  we're looking at the part of the top part of our property where the beetles had originated.  it was the only part that was dead in this area.  and what happens is they go after the pine they get in the pine trees and they kill off the pine.  but it was isolated to this area in the first year.  and now they have jumped.  Walk down our neat little forest trail here.  They've jumped.  You can see up there, you can see where the red trees were coming into.  Anywhere you see those red needles, guys, that's a dead tree.  These are all dead trees and they're not going to come back.  They don't need more water.  These guys are completely dead.  The bark is falling off of them.  The needles are falling.  They just shrivel up and die.  So right through there was all the dead trees.  The beetles jumped into these trees.  Now this stuff was all alive last year.  It was not dead.  It was not dead trees.  And now it's gone that way and back there into that forest.  And it's spreading a little bit that way.  You can see a dead tree back there as well.  Now here's the issue with pine beetles is by the time you see the tree is dead, when you see that stuff, they've already jumped in or into the next set of trees.  So you don't see where they're at, which means you gotta think ahead of them and get ahead of them.  And what you have to do is cut down the area and burn it.  If you cut down the area and leave like a slash pile, those beetles will jump from the slash pile and just get into your new trees.  So why is this important?  This is important for a couple of reasons, guys.  One is your land value.  When you buy timbered property, you're generally buying the value of the timber on the land as well as location and other assets that might be on the land.  but you're getting timber value.  So if these trees are worth X amount of dollars in the seller's eyes or the potential harvest in the future are worth X amount of dollars and you pay that and the pine beetles kill it, you're now out that money.  So if you guys go to a property and you see dead trees like this in clusters like these, they're all dead next to each other.  This happens in pines.  They'll jump past the firs, they jump past the larch, they kill the pine.  But if you see this stuff, don't get duped into paying land value or timber value, future value of that timber.  Know that you're getting scammed because that timber's useless, it might look nice, at the time but when you see these pockets it's all going to be gone.  now in the next couple of years this whole area up here is going to be destroyed because of the pine beetles.  Now Shelby and I knew that coming into it we'd actually planned to create pasture and field in this area and with it being thick undergrown jack pine we did not pay a timber value because of that.  there's no value in these trees but that doesn't mean that they won't pretend that there's value in these trees.  a real estate agent will sell you this stuff thinking there's gold growing in those trees.  so don't get duped guys and don't let your real estate agent talk you into the future timber value of trees that could possibly be infected.  Now, I'm not saying that timber value does not exist in land.  There is, and if you have a land with lots of trees that could be potentially harvest in the next couple of years, you know, it's definitely a good deal, but it doesn't take long for this to happen.  As we walk through, you guys can just kind of look over my shoulder.  We're now walking into a big dead patch that wasn't here last year.  So in this last little bit, these pine beetles have come through and just killed all of this stuff.  I'll show you what it looks like so that you guys can identify it.  So here's a tree.  You can see the spotting bark is falling off.  You can see it's just crumbling.  This tree is dead.  It's standing here dead.  There's little pinholes all over in it.  When you chop this stuff up, you actually will get the worms as you're splitting for firewood and stuff.  The little worm larvae will fall off.  Pretty gross looking.  But the chickens all hang out with me when I do wood shopping because they know that there's gonna be plenty of worms while I'm working.  Well, that is what I've got for you today on pine beetles just to kind of give you guys a heads up.  I know a lot of people are moving from out of town to these areas.  if you're coming from the city To the country.  This is probably not something that you thought about thinking of tiny little beetles Killing your killing your trees and it's very common in a lot of these areas, especially up here.  you'll see areas just destroyed by it and generally what they try to do in large land management is they burn it out.  They'll go and burn down all of the trees, do a prescribed burn, controlled burn, and get rid of them and try to burn them out.  Alrighty guys, that is it.  Thank you so much for watching.
