In my experience, the apologist will rattle off the Kalam Cosmological Argument, which I covered recently, and next in the list is often the Ontological Argument.  Now, there are some great videos out there from the likes of Matt Delahunty, Cosmic Skeptic, Rationality Rules, Scott Clifton, TMM, and others, which deal with the original ontological argument as presented by Anselm of Canterbury back in 1078, exposing many of the fallacies it holds.  I've made a playlist that I'll link in the description for those who want to learn more about Anselm's flaws, but today's champion of apologetics philosophy is William Lane Craig, and Craig's version of the ontological argument is a synthesis of more modern takes, worded specifically to avoid some of the more obvious fallacies found in the earlier forms, yet hasn't received the same attention here on YouTube.  So, does Craig's new version hold up, or does it pose a set of new problems?  Let's take a look.  Welcome to Polygia, where a former Christian takes a look at the claims of Christians.

But we've only just begun looking at the problems in premise number three.  Setting aside the logical inconsistency of non-existent possible worlds impacting the properties of something in the actual world, Craig is relying on alternative wording to disguise the fact that his revised argument still suffers from some of the major flaws of prior versions, namely attempting to define something into existence and a big ol' begging the question fallacy.  The third premise states, if a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world.  This is clarified by his earlier description, Perhaps you see the problem here.  Craig has made existence in every possible world part of the definition of maximal greatness.  And so, since this premise outright defines maximally great being as a being that exists, we can substitute a being that exists for maximally great being throughout the proof like so.  And voila, we can rephrase as follows.  Premise one, it is possible that a being that exists exists.  Two, a being that exists exists in some possible world.  3.  If a being that exists exists in some possible world, then it exists in all possible worlds.  4.  If a being that exists exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world.  5.  A being that exists exists in the actual world.  6.  Therefore, a being that exists exists.  When the conclusion of the argument is found in one of the premises of the argument, that is called the fallacy of begging the question.  Existence was smuggled definitionally into the third premise.  This alone should be enough to show that the entire argument is fallacious and more than a little ridiculous.

            "text": "And I don't know that we have a good reason to favor the possibility premise in the case of negative existential claims.  Is it possible that there's a world exactly like this one where the tree that's right outside, where that tree is not there?  It's okay for me to say, yeah, it's possible that there's a possible world just like this one without that tree.  But I think things are different when we talk about negative existentials and God.  Because I think that the sentence, there is no God, is itself a contradiction.  Because God, in the sentence... It defines an idea, right?  And that idea is a maximally great being.  And a maximally great being exists necessarily and therefore exists in all possible worlds.  So for someone to say there is no God is to say the greatest conceivable being, the greatest possible being, the being that exists in all possible worlds does not exist.  And that's just a contradiction. ",

            "text": "I'm sorry, Dr.  Arbor, but all you've done here is to reinforce that you are including existence as part of your definition of maximally great.  And when existence is part of the definition, then you're necessarily begging the question, saying merely a being that exists exists, and demonstrating nothing.  Those are just three demonstrations of why William Lane Craig's ontological argument falls flat on its face, without even touching the subjectivity of great making properties, equivocation fallacies on terms, the category error between concepts and entities, and so much more, all of which you can explore further in the Critique of Anselm's Ontological Argument playlist I've linked below.  I understand that few Christians would claim that the ontological argument is persuasive on its own.  but is mainly useful as an ingredient in a larger cumulative case for God.  But I would appeal to anyone who wants to actually convince a non-theist to stop using it.  Because when it comes to making an argument, it's quality over quantity.  Including bad arguments with good arguments doesn't make the bad ones seem better.  It makes the better arguments seem worse.  Thanks for watching.  Might I suggest you tap on the God Ghost to see my take on William Lane Craig's Kalam Cosmological Argument, or tap on the other one for more insightful Christian claims analysis.  See you there. ",
