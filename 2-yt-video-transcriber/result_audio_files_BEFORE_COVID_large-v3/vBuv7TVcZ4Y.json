            "text": "It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Okay, I have a very simple and straightforward message for Meghan McCain.  Just because you talk in a scornful tone doesn't mean you're right.  She tries to replace substance with like smug condescension and acts like that somehow makes what she's saying more intelligent.  That's her whole trick.  Go back and watch that again.  She does this thing where she puts on this serious face, like, I'm not taking any nonsense face.  And then she's just incredibly smug and condescending and thinks that that makes the substance of what she's saying more serious.  And it's kind of embarrassing to watch.  So let's run through it.  There's so much here.  Um, first of all, the entire panel seems to be against her, and I gotta say, man, she does a wonderful job jousting with them.  I've now watched this three times, and, you know, the first time I wasn't sure, then the second and third time you pick up on finer little points where she really just knows the material much better than they do, and she kind of runs circles around them, and they have nothing but, like... Stale talking points of things they heard that have not been verified or backed up at all with the evidence.  So let's run through it.  first and foremost He's a cyber terrorist.  Cyber terrorists, what does that even mean?  He's beheading people in video games.  Listen no, no, I got a let me be fair.  I The definition of, like, a cyber-terrorist in my mind would be, okay, if somebody gets our nuclear codes and gives them to Al-Qaeda, and, you know, that's the whole thing that they did.  They got our nuclear codes, they turned them over to Al-Qaeda, they did it all through the computer, and that was that.  Yeah, I'd be comfortable calling that person a cyber terrorist, for sure.  Julian Assange did not do that and would never do that.  And he did not put our soldiers or our spies at risk.  That's a nonsense talking point that they're scrambling for anything to attack him with, and that's what they came up with.  And you got to remember, guys, the reason the Trump administration is going after him is specifically because he exposed war crimes of the U.S.  government.  And they briefly touched on that there, but that point really should have been harped away on because it's incredibly important.  That's why they hate him.  That's why they're coming after him, is because he showed our soldiers massacring civilians, laughing at it, and then doing something that's called a double tap, which is circling back around and killing the first responders.  Well, come to find out, it was media people, civilians who were massacred, and then they killed, you know, the first responders as well, who were not terrorists.  And the whole time they're laughing about it and giggling it up, and guess what?  You know who went to prison?  the person who released that video and that information about U.S.  war crimes to Julian Assange, who then released it to the public.  So in other words, Chelsea Manning went to prison.  You know who didn't go to prison?  The people massacring civilians and then laughing about it in the video.  Weird world we live in, huh?  And people like all the hosts on The View there, specifically Meghan McCain, especially Meghan McCain, They think that Julian Assange is the criminal for releasing that video, and Chelsea Manning isn't a hero for releasing that video, and they're defending U.S.  intelligence agencies and the war crimes of our government.  No, no, no.  See, this is why the Pentagon Papers were so important, and Daniel Ellsberg today is viewed as a hero.  Because he exposed the war crimes in Vietnam.  And hindsight is 20-20.  When you put enough time between the war and the action of Daniel Ellsberg, people go, oh yeah, you know, he was kind of right.  I mean, proving that we're napalming and using Agent Orange on innocent villagers and peasants, landless peasants in Vietnam.  Yeah, he's showing that we're doing war crimes and that we should stop doing them.  And now we all go, oh, that guy's a hero.  Well, Chelsea Manning did the same goddamn thing.  It's the exact same thing except change the war.  And still you get Meghan McCain and the idiots on The View because they can't get over that.  Julian Assange released information that showed how deeply corrupt Hillary Clinton is.  They can't get past that, and so now all of a sudden they think he basically deserves to be locked up.  And it's unbelievably pathetic.  So that's the main point.  He exposed war crimes, and that's why the government's going after him.  And then I loved when Pamela Anderson said Hillary Clinton is responsible for Trump.  Well, yeah, first and foremost, because she couldn't beat him, which should have been incredibly easy.  But second of all, yeah, the Pied Piper strategy.  It was the DNC.  It was Hillary Clinton.  They said, let's act like Trump is the best candidate on the Republican side, because in their mind, they thought, oh, that's the easiest path to nomination for us, to victory for us, is if Trump's the nominee, we're definitely going to win.  So let's prop him up, say, oh, yeah, Trump, oh, so serious.  Oh, yeah, he's the one.  He's the one.  And chickens came home to roost at some point on that.  And then, final point is when Meghan McCain, when she says, um... Pamela Anderson goes, well, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, these are heroes.  Chelsea Manning exposed war crimes and then basically put her life on the line and spent time behind bars and was tortured all to give the American public information that we should have seen and should have never been classified in the first place.  Edward Snowden showing everybody, hey, guys, we have this Fourth Amendment thing, which is supposed to protect you from unreasonable search and seizure.  But hey, look at that.  The NSA is spying on all of you.  Taking all of your metadata.  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.  So Pamela Anderson rightly says they're heroes.  And what does Meghan McCain say?  Putin also thinks that.  Dog what?  No, no, no, no, no.  She has nothing but like, she's like an amalgamation of shitty mainstream talking points that she just vomits out in a scornful tone and thinks that she's intelligent when she does it.  Honestly, one of the most embarrassing people on TV, if not the most embarrassing person on TV.  Because she's not even good at this.  Like, it's one thing if you're playing this role of shitty propagandist, but you're good at it?  You're not even good at it.  Listen, you're part of the Lucky Sperm Club.  Your dad is John McCain, and that's the only reason why anybody even knows who you are right now.  And she's just not equipped for this shit, man.  Holy shit.  He's a cyber terrorist.  There, I said it.  She acts like she's saying something, like, edgy.  You're just repeating the establishment fucking bullshit establishment bubble wisdom to protect centers of power in American political life.  That's not edgy.  That's really stupid and dumb and wrong.  But there's nothing worse than that, in my opinion.  It's like... It's one thing to be wrong.  It's another thing to be wrong and smug about it.  And it's another thing to be wrong and smug and like pretend like it's also edgy when it's not edgy.  Like Pamela Anderson is the one taking the edgy position of the truth teller who's like letting everybody know uncomfortable truths like, yeah, no, spies were threatened.  Julian Assange did the right thing by releasing all this information.  Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning are heroes.  But like she repeats like the CIA would pat her on the head like, ooh, thank you, our little puppet.  Thank you for repeating all this stuff.  And she acts like she's edgy.  I'll say it.  He's a cyber terrorist.  Putin would say that, too.  God damn it.  I feel like I need a shower after watching a back and forth including Meghan McCain.  She really needs to reel it in with that like fake serious look and angry scornful tone.  It's so over the top.  It's like you could tell she's not even listening to anything that the person is going to say.  And it's just she's waiting to talk.  That's it.  She's waiting to hear her own voice and repeat her bullshit talking points.  But she's got that look like Like, I'm going to tell you.  You're going to tell me what?  The same bullshit you've been vomiting out for the past two and a half years?  Yeah, we don't want to hear it.  We don't want to hear it because we all know what you're going to say before you even say it.  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  Have an original thought.  She thinks she's like doing good by the memory of her father.  And by the way, she will not hesitate to let you know that.  my dad, my dad, my father, my father.  I don't know if you guys have seen that on Twitter, but there's this viral video that went around of Meghan McCain just nonstop.
