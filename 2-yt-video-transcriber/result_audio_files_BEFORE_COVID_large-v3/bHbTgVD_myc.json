Even though social media has done a lot for me in the past four months of my life, I still feel like it is an evil on the world.  I wouldn't say a necessary evil, even though I benefit from it slightly.  It's still.  there's some darkness, you know.  It's kind of like a wound in the force.  And if I have to give up my ability to use the force to heal it, then I must do so.  Anyway, social media, as we all know it, is here to stay.  That's all there is to it.  There's nothing we can do.  It's sad, really.  Because now that I have some YouTube popularity, people send me cancer in the emails.  I know by the time I'm like 40, I'm gonna have to go for chemotherapy.  I'm like, sorry, sir, you have a new stage 10 cancer.  We've never seen anything like it.  How'd you get it?  I was a YouTuber who watched Twitch Dots.  My God, rush this man into the emergency ward.  He only has moments to live.  Wait a second, his insurance premiums are pretty low.  Get him out of here.  So today, I... Today I watched a really bad Twitch stream.  I can't even remember her name.  She's so horrible.  But let's go to this one first.  This is a chick called Bad Bunny.  I've actually seen some of her streams before.  Eh, they're kind of boring.  They are.  They're real boring. ",

The fact she's popular kinda and is partnered blows my mind cause literally watching her stream is like looking at a pissed off chick at the other side of like Starbucks.  She has this puss on her face.  It's like this constant resting bitch face they call it.  She looks like she always smells something that smells like shit.  She just has that look, you know, like she's just pissed at the world.  You don't even know fucking why.  She's a woman.  She's alright looking.  Why you got that look on your face?  I can understand if you look like Danny DeVito, look angry all day.  Point being, her streams are pretty boring.  She like reads crap off, she watches other people's shit and reacts to it.  Literally, it's the epitome of nothingness.  Gundam, isn't this kind of what you're doing?  I am a culture critic.  And on top of that, I'm fairly funny.  I know my strong points.  I'm built like a woman, but I have a great personality.  He's gay!  So I never really got into the bad bunny chick.  I kind of just looked at her stuff and said, I'm moving on.  Because she kind of looks like a pissed off feminist.  I ain't got time for that.  There's no funny here.  You can't turn this into funny. ",

Now, it's even funnier about this chick when you watch her little video telling people that they're leeching scumbags.  Is the fact she has two ad blockers on her goddamn browser.  Good God almighty, the hypocrisy.  It's just tip.  That's woman 101.  You know that, right?  Hypocrisy is like number two in a woman's arsenal of shit.  You know, number one is lies.  Number two is hypocrisy.  I don't like you talking to your friend because men and women can't be friends.  You'll leave me for her.  You don't leave her for your friend.  She makes a guy friend at her job.  She dumps you for him.  Hypocrisy.  That's a true story.  that happened to me.  Very recently, children.  Alright, the highlight of my life is my P.O.  box.  That's when I feel loved.  And the rest of my life is shit.  Alright, let's get off of me.  These chickens use an air block watching YouTube videos and shit.  It's just like ridiculous.  Twitch streaming, streaming in general, honest to God, for me personally, since I stream on occasion, I don't give a fuck about making money at all when it comes to Twitch streaming.  For me, it's fan service.  You get on there, people watch us live, fucking up, interacting.  You know, sometimes there's some funny shit to share.  There was a stream a little while ago, I can't even use a clip from it, when me, Ziltex, in the chat sat and watched fucking Twitch.  do nothing about porn being streamed on it.  It was a hilarious stream.  Oh, wait a second.  She's got one of those vibrators in her vagina that when you give tips, it vibrates.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, it does.  It's something like that.  Whatever it is.  I've seen it on my free cams.  She does not.  That's pink and it sticks out like all she does.  See?  How dare you question me?  You know, live stuff like that.  Stuff like that is awesome.  Nobody donated and it didn't fucking matter.  We had a couple hundred people in on the fucking lulls.  That's what it's all about for me.  That's what I think it's about for most people.  Though, you know, smaller people.  I think people who are huge only stream to make money because they make so much money.  it ain't even funny.  I bet you, like, if someone calls Ninja and they're like, we'd like you to start a commercial for $10,000.  And then Ninja's like, I don't get out of bed and piss for that kind of money, dude.  It should be about building a community and just having a moment with people and enjoying yourself.  Like, live streaming, in my personal opinion.  But for this chick, it's about one thing.  Money.  Like, literally, this is probably the easiest money she's ever made in her life, and now it's become so normal and commonplace.  She's probably worked into her mind that she deserves this.  She's very talented.  She's very interesting.  And, yeah, that's the thought process, which is a dangerous thought process for any content creator to have, is the second you start believing your own hype.  You know, I can't wait for Ninja to have a scandal, and that motherfucker gonna be running around like R. Kelly.  Wearing a mask on his face like Hamburglar.  Calling himself the artist formerly known as Ninja or some shit.  He's the Pied Piper of Fortnite.  That's what I'm waiting for.  What was the point?  Who the fuck knows?  Yeah, there you go.  Another cute chick on Twitch who basically believes she deserves everything she's gotten when it's all just luck.  The fact that she can sit there and say it to anybody watching her stream.  Well, if you're not donating or subbing, you're leeching.  Leeching what?  You are doing nothing amazing right now.  Nothing interesting.  Nobody's going to remember a stream you've done on their dying day.  Laying in bed.  Mary, come in here.  Mary.  Yes, Kurt.  What's wrong, darling?  Oh, God.  Bad Bunny had such a great stream, didn't she?  Back in 2019 or whatever fucking year it was.  Yes, she did, my love.  The day she told you you were leeching, that was when you proposed to me.  Because you felt you were leeching my life or some shit.  Nothing like that's going to happen.  You know, nobody's going to fucking be dying in their bed and they're going to request for their family to play an old Twitch clip that they saw from the early 2000s.  What we do here is inconsequential bullshit.  We are basically killing time in people's lives.  And you know what?  It's fantastic.  Enjoy it, but don't overthink it.  You're replaceable.  You're not a god among men.  Or women.  Right now, I'm forcing myself to do this even though my voice, my throat is killing me.  Oh, God.  I'm gonna regret this shit later, dude.  You have no idea.  Last but not least, I may as well talk about this most recent Twitch girl I found.  I didn't find.  Someone emailed her to me.  I feel like my head's going to explode because I already know what's coming.  Oh, it's so bad.  I don't know what her name is, to be honest.  I'm not even really going to get her name correct because I don't want to give her any publicity.  Because as famous as she thinks she is, I'm bigger than she is.  It's a really weird complex to like see women like this that have that sort of that, you know, those girls that act like they're celebrities and they're like the greatest thing that's happened in recent times.  And then I look them up and I'm like, technically, from a social media standpoint, I'm far bigger than you are and bigger than you might possibly ever be.  And I still feel like I'm worthless.  There's either something wrong with you or me.  And I'm going to gamble.  It's you because I got my shit together.  I mean, I'm crazy as cat piss, but... Hold on.  Here comes a puppy.  Anyway, this Sev chick is an Instagram model.  So anyway, she now streams on Twitch.  And it is the most boring thing you'll ever see in your life.  I'm not joking.  It is so, so boring.  Oh my fucking Lord Jesus Christ, I'm not even religious and I feel like I need to go to church after this stream.  I actually sat and recorded this for seven whole minutes.  BabyRig, thank you so much for the bits.  I'm gonna stop eating, I'm eating hot food.  Good God, she doesn't even care enough about her stream to make it less pixelated garbage.  This shit looks like a stream from 1998. ",

Now I'm dating this empty, soulless, wretch of a woman.  What have I done to deserve this, God?  Is this because I didn't believe in you?  Is this how petty you are, Lord?  Oh, God.  This chick.  Mother of Jesus.  This is like... This girl is a perfect amalgamation of why nothing you do as a man matters.  You know?  As hard as a man can work, whether you took care of a family or not whether you were a soldier a fireman a pilot it doesn't fucking matter.  you probably don't make as much money as this bitch and she could barely tell you what the fuck the square root of 81 was if you asked her.  no jokes no the lights are on and nobody's home.  My God.  I guess that's probably why she said she released her sex tape at 135 followers, 135k followers, because she's never going to hit that shit.  Oh, God, look at this shit.  Her Instagram is just the usual sort of shit.  Oh, she also said she had a successful YouTube channel.  It had 15k subs and the videos that she has on there.  Oh, Lord, I dare you to sit through them.  And last but not least, if you really gave that much of a crap about her, you could look her up on Twitter, where she has two followers.  Nice work.  I think her bread and butter is fucking, uh... Dude, no.  Tell me no.  Tell me I did not forget to record her Pornhub crap.  It's not like porn, but it's like her twerking so poorly it's not even funny.  You know, like this chick... Ah, goddammit, I gotta go back.  Fuck!  Point being, she starts twerking, and she's so bad at it, she falls over the chair.  It's probably the best thing she ever did, but it's not intentional.  That's probably why it's great.  Okay, do you guys want me to twerk?  Okay.  I mean, she might have shit her pants.  Okay.  You think you're sneaking out a fart because there's some shit escapes?  Don't demonetize me for this.  I'm like a documentarian.  I'm Jacques Cousteau of Twitch.  And all I could think to myself was this broad's whole fucking existence and livelihood is based on how attractive and sexy she's supposed to be.  And she can't even shake her ass correctly.  She doesn't even need to be able to shake her ass correctly to be successful.  Mother of fuck.  I can't anymore.  My throat is dying.  More liquor.  You know, at this point, I should get the hell out of here because my throat just can't take it.  I'm sorry.  That's why the videos have been kind of slow as of late.  Rate, comment, subscribe only.  so I choose to.  If not, to hell with it.  Because you know me, I can't ask anyone to give more shit to me in the age of apathy and all that stuff that I can't really say.  I gotta get out of here.  I'll catch you guys later.
