            "text": "The Bible says, let us make man in our image.  You are the original.  Who is the white man?  He's the man made in our image and after our likeness.  He's a new man on our planet.  Where did he come from?  you don't want to believe it but he came from you you his father you his mother and Moses told him honor your mother and your father that your days may be long.  there wouldn't be no white person if there was no black person because two white people can't produce you.  Two white people can't produce yellow.  So it had to be you to bring brown, yellow, and white on the planet.  That's how color began.  Now the white people are saying, life began in Africa.  Are they saying it?  They're only bearing witness to what Elijah Muhammad taught us that Master Farad revealed to him.  Now, how did the white man come here?  Let's get into the science of this.  Give me my Bible.  Get me the Bible, brother.  Let us make man after our image and likeness.  Okay, let's look at that.  Now, after you make the man, he said in the fifth chapter of Genesis, it says, this is the book of the generations of Adam.  In the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him.  Male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam.  So Adam is not an individual here.  Adam is the beginning of a race of people, male and female.  Now look at this, okay?  You understand this now, right?  Erase this, son, please.  Now, here you have Adam, an Adamic race of people.  It's a new people now with a new wisdom that's going to bring in a new wave of civilization.  Now, you have the Adamic race.  And you have the pre- Adamites.  That means that there were people on the earth before Adam.  And the pre-Adamites is the us out of which Adam came.  And they're called aboriginal.  You look this up.  I mean, this is to get you to do some studying now.  There were pre-Adamites, human beings, on the earth before Adam.  If Adam was only one person, Eve was one person, Cain was one person, Abel was one person, Cain slew Abel, then Cain goes into the land of Nod.  and he finds him a woman in the land of Nardole.  Where she come from?  What family was she a part of?  Aboriginal means from or away from the origin or the beginning.  You are the Aboriginal people of the earth.  You could never be a citizen of the United States.  according to the definition of what an American is.  In Message to the Black Man, written by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, when the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was teaching, they had a House Un-American Activities Commission that was studying us as being un-American.  And the honorable Elijah Muhammad defended us by showing them from their dictionary what an American is.  And if you look at the seal out of which came this E Pluribus Unum, it was all Europeans that started the six or the 13 colonies.  So the old definition of a citizen or an American is from European extraction, not one of the aboriginal people of the earth.  So he didn't bring you here to make you a citizen.  That's why you don't have the rights of a citizen now.  He brought you here to make you a slave.  And now the biggest deceit of all is for him to make you think now.  that he gave you the right to vote and this and that, and you're a citizen now.  Whenever he get ready to show you who you really are, you begin to understand.  Get beat up by the police.  Go to court and see what they tell you, how they make you know who you are.  Go down to Cook County Jail and see our people all lined up in the prison house.  for things they didn't do and for infractions that they did do.  But they have no justice.  You all know what I'm talking about.  So if you're an equal citizen, you should be treated equally to all the other citizens.  You know better than that.  That's the biggest deceit of all, is to deceive you and make you think you're an American.  No, brother and sister, you'll never be an American.  You'll never have the equal rights of the whites of America, not unless you become the power.  All right, let's look at this now.  This Adam started a dysfunctional family.  Have you ever heard The Catholics talk about original sin.  Are there any Catholics in the house?  Don't be bashful.  It's a thank you, brother.  Many times when you listen to them, they say that man is originally sinful.  He has a leaning towards sin.  And the only way man can become perfect is by the intervention of God and the grace of God.  But man is naturally inclined to sin.  Yeah, but what man?  See, you're the original.  You're not naturally inclined to sin.  You are naturally inclined to God.  And if you were in the right environment, you would be more godly than you are, but even in your spirit, as crazy as you are.  You're God-fearing.  I watch these award shows, you know.  A sister come out half-naked with her cross on.  thank you that so glad that I won but giving all honor to the Lord Jesus Christ.  without him I would never be here.  the brother come out bling-blinging and he said yo I'm glad I won these.  you know I'm saying And I thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, you know what I'm saying?  He sure was with me when we won this fight.  His pants hanging down off his backside.  He got gold and diamonds bling-blinging everywhere.  But the first thing that come out of his mouth is God.  You go listen to the whites at the Oscars.  If they say God, it's a miracle.  I want to thank my producers.  I want to thank Joe Shapiro and Harry Schwartz and so and so.  I thank you.  And I want to thank my wife who stood by me all these years.  But what about God?  Well, who the hell is he?  He wasn't in this.  You don't ever hear them praising God like you.  In your madness you praise him.  You know why?  Because you're the people of God.  The real people of God. ",
