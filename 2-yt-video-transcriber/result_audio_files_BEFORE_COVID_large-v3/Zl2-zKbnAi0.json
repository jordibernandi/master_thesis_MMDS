I came here kind of ironically at first, but at the end of the day I thought it was very heartwarming in many regards.  Many probably feel and at least hope that the resurgence and interest in Norse culture works to their benefit because I think that Scandinavian Americans have felt a little bit ignored that their culture is seen as corny and out of fashion.  so I noticed that they're definitely trying to hinge on to the different pop cultural stuff that is going on.

But the thing is, I have so many relatives in Norway, and it's been such a pleasure in my life to go back to Norway as often as I've been, which is almost 30 times.  And my relatives and I have treated us so well over there, and I've developed friendships.  And I have some friendships in Norway even closer than my relatives.  So it's been nice to go over there, to be able to speak the language there, my brother and I, and to mix with the local, just the friends, just the neighbors.  And we still have lifelong friendships going on to this day.  So it is very important to me about my Norwegian heritage.  I'm very proud to be an American, but my Norwegian heritage is very important to me.  It's been a very big influence in my life.  And I'm very proud of both cultures.  Very proud of both cultures. ",

Norwegian-American or American-Norwegian, American first, but I'm one part Vestland and three parts S\u00f8rland.  and when I was 11 my parents put me in a rose smiling class with my grandparents and I enjoyed it and then I didn't do anything else with it until I was about 15 when my father started making hopches, clocks and cordon of cabinets and said we're in business.  I do commission work, I do all sorts of styles, I put stuff on the internet because I feel it's very important for people to have a connection with where they came from.  We're very fortunate in the fact that we have that connection.  In fact, the bunad that I'm wearing right now is a replica of my great-grandmother's bunad from Cisnes, outside of Bergen.  And my grandmother was the one who made it for me when I was in my early 20s.  My children also wear bunads.  But I think being American, it's sometimes strange to think People back in the old country will say, well, why do you still have this connection?  Well, it's important for us to have that connection because we need to know where we came from in order to appreciate where we are here, but also appreciate where our grandparents or our great-grandparents came from and their heritage.  It's part of what makes America wonderful is that you have this background that all kind of ties together.  And there's so many similarities.  It doesn't matter if you're Norwegian or if you're... Chinese or if you're a Muslim or wherever.  we all have similar paths that brought us here.  but what makes us so strong and what ties us is to know where we came from.  so to have this background and to share it is very important to me and because the only way art forms live is if you share it.  so that's kind of what I do and that's kind of my process right now is not only do am I fortunate enough to do it as a partial living but I am fortunate enough to share it with others.
