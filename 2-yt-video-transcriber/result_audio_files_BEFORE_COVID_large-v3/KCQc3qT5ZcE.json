            "text": "Black Ram 313 back at it again.  You know why?  It's because this is therapeutic, man.  Back again for another video, hence another therapy session.  Today's topic and title proper is why it's better when she leaves you.  Jumping right into the subject matter at hand.  Here we go.  Now most of us have been through it.  Yes, that dreaded but inevitable breakup.  Relationships, good or bad, must always come to an end at some point.  We know that she will always leave you at some point.  As the old saying goes, you never know when she's gonna go.  But this is fine.  Let her go.  She prides herself on her ability to leave one guy for another.  Yeah, girl.  I had to leave him.  This makes her feel good, strong and powerful.  Oftentimes, this is what she means by strength, her ability to go from one to the next called the carousel.  She believes this is indicative of strength.  Yes, being a thought in her mind is considered being strong.  But good for her.  Let her go.  But guess what?  When she leaves, it's even better for you.  Relationships are always great in the beginning, but although you can be content once the excitement of the newness of the relationship wanes, she cannot.  She needs a new thrill.  And again, that's fine.  It's the nature of the creature.  Accept this, men.  She has to go.  She can't help herself.  It's not you.  It's all on her.  She desires as many experiences in her lifetime with as many different men as possible.  Now, let's be real.  This is therapy.  And what's the number one rule in therapy?  Of course, there is no lying in therapy.  Therefore, when she leaves, if you've had feelings for her, it's probably going to hurt or in the least be a disappointment.  But I guarantee that in time it will get easier and easier to be without her.  until one day she's just a distant memory of the past with no pain or emotions attached to the thought of her.  So be glad when she goes.  An old saying goes and says when she leaves.  Help her pack her bags.  Statement made by Iceberg Slim.  Again, be glad when she goes.  Why you say, how you say.  Well, this wouldn't be a Black Ram video without a list.  So here are a few reasons why it's a good thing when she leaves you.  So here we go.  Number one.  She most likely was a burden and most are even a burden when she provided an amount of service.  I'm sure she nagged and complained about something.  I'm sure she was a distraction of some sort.  So you don't have to experience such again, at least from her.  A burden is lifted because nine times out of 10 in your relationship, she is burdening you in some way, shape or form.  Number two, as to the reason why it's a good thing when she leaves is because she was a time waster.  She most likely wanted to spend your time by doing things which you have no interest in.  Watching whatever types of housewives here, whatever type of housewife there.  Wasting your time by begging you to watch a romantic movie with her that you could care less about.  You can now find more constructive and creative things to do with your time.  Focus more on yourself, your personal goals.  Get a new hobby.  More time for personal development and peace.  More time for your particular interest.  Time is the most valuable thing you have.  So now you can use it in more constructive ways.  Once she leaves, she hits the door.  Let the doorknob hit you where the dog should have bit you.  Number three as to the reason why it's better when she leaves is that now you can have more energy.  That's right.  She is by nature the succubus and energy vampire.  Consuming every drop of your life force on her thoughts and ideas.  You're listening to her nonsense in typical succubus fashion.  I'm sure she can talk or has talked all day about completely nothing at all.  Having a lack of substance in her speaking and in her thoughts.  You can now conserve and redirect the energy that she consumed into something else.  Put that energy into you.  Again, she was an energy vampire.  You no longer have her pulling that life force out of you.  Number four.  So the reason why it's better when she leaves is that there are no more worries.  Once she leaves you, you don't ever have to think or worry about her leaving you again.  It's done.  No more concern about her life.  No more concern about her comings or goings.  No more worries about her hurt feelings about this or that.  No more arguments.  No more issues.  No more discussions.  Eventually, she will be completely put out of your mind.  Number five.  She wasn't yours in the first place.  It was just your turn.  And now it's the next guy's turn.  She wasn't really with you as an owner for a lifetime.  but she was a short-term rental by her choice, not yours.  She belongs to the city, to the community.  Almost everyone gets a turn.  This is how she prefers it.  She wants to be free.  She wants to be liberated.  She wants to be independent.  Let that dirty bird fly.  And last and not least, number six, the reason as to why it is better To see her going.  Than when you saw her coming.  Is the new woman.  That's right.  The new woman.  Now is the opportunity.  To start something fresh.  And something new.  Ain't no.  Blank like new.  Blank if you know what I mean.  Finish that in the comment section.  But put a different.  Expletive in there.  Now.  You have the opportunity to take what you have learned from the previous relationships and make the next one better.  Correct your mistakes and create a better relationship than the last one.  One that can possibly be more enjoyable.  In my experience, every time one woman is left, the next was always better.  Even if only slightly.  No.  is good say it with me new is good out with the old in with the new.  a new face a new smell a new body a new relationship.  embrace the new.  you now have room for such.  So rejoice and be glad when she leaves.  Most of the time, the next relationship will be an improvement over the last.  Look forward to the new adventure with the new woman.  For me personally, I'll be giving some lucky girl, some lucky gal, a chance to be with a hell of a stud like myself.  So this is even good for the new lady.  For the introspective man, our life should always improve.  So when your woman leaves you, that's an opportunity for an upgrade.  So again, be glad when she goes.  Don't call her back.  Have the strength and the fortitude to replace instead of chase and get one that's even better.  like the video subscribe to the channel.  hit that notification button so that you will not miss a black ram 313 video.  have a second channel black ram for vengeance In the description box.
