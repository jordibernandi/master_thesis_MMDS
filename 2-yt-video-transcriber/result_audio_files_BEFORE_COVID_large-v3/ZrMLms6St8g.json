I guess I'm not totally sure what I think in retrospect about this, except what I'll say in defense of it is I don't know what else I could have done behind.  It was that, like, I just kind of doggedly pointed out the false presupposition every single time, which meant that, you know, which meant that nine times out of ten, I had to talk over him to, like, you know, say what I thought was the false premise, you know, because the second I didn't give him a yes or no, he started, like, trying to talk again or ask the next question or castigate me for not giving the yes or no answer.
