He concluded that President Trump may have obstructed the investigation, but he couldn't bring charges because it's Congress's responsibility to hold the president accountable.  Now, Congress wants Mueller to testify about President Trump's obstruction, but the president is against it.  Congress and the American people.  Gotta know whether or not their president's a crook.
