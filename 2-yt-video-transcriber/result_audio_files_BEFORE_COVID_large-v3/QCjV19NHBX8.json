            "text": "Hello.  I wanted to make sure that you are aware of a really neat video that is out there.  Yes, I'm in the video, but there are also some other amazing people.  in this video and it's on Ash Hardell's YouTube channel.  If you haven't heard of Ash, Ash is a very well-known non-binary YouTuber.  So this is somebody whose channel you definitely need to follow.  I'm going to make sure I put links to their channel as well as this video I'm going to talk to you about.  But I guess this was a collaboration, which a lot of people have asked me in the past, like, are you ever going to collaborate?  With Ash Hardell.  So I was really excited when it finally happened.  Basically, Ash put out kind of a call a few months ago asking if there are people who are non-binary and over the age of 30, I think, who would like to maybe... be a part of a video.  And I didn't see that Ash posted that, but a bunch of people wrote down my name as an idea of somebody to contact.  And so since then, Ash and I have become kind of friends through the process, which is really cool.  But the video, back to the video, it's called It's Not Just a Phase, The Experiences of Non-Binary Folks Ages 30 to 70.  I'm 45, and so I'm the second oldest person in the video, I think.  Jeffrey Marsh.  Nope, Jeffrey Marsh was born on 7-7-77.  I remember that.  And so I'm older than Jeffrey Marsh.  Kate Bornstein is the person who's 70 years old in the video.  But anyway, this video is amazing.  It has, I just checked, it has over 100,000 views and right now 1,387 comments on it.  There are so many people of all ages who watched this video who found it to be really, really helpful.  And like I said, I'm just one of the people who's highlighted in the video.  I'm going to tell you who else is in this.  Vesper is a black, queer, non-binary, asexual vlogger and blogger, also known as Queer as Cat on Tumblr and YouTube.  Renee Yoxen is a queer, non-binary, and disabled singer, songwriter, and pianist.  Jeffrey Marsh was the first openly non-binary activist to appear on national television.  Kate Bornstein, since 1989, trans trailblazer.  And Jess, who has worked with human services field with vulnerable youth and families for 14 years, who also educates about gender and sexuality, diversity and inclusion.  And Pidgin, Pidgin Pangones has staked out a place at the fore of debates on intersectionality, excuse me, intersexuality and otherness, producing informational videos that go viral on BuzzFeed, writing for Everyday Feminism, and appearing on the cover of National Geographic Gender Revolution Special Issue.  Something in particular that was really cool about this video is that Kate Bornstein is somebody who I admire for some time.  Kate is okay with the use of she, her pronouns.  Kate actually said any pronoun is fine with her.  But Kate wrote a book called My Gender Workbook, and there's also a follow-up to it.  And that is the original workbook.  when it comes to exploring your gender identity.  My book, You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery, is something I wrote later.  And I wrote a message to Kate on Twitter back before I wrote the book to ask kind of like for her blessing to make sure like she thought it was a good idea I was writing this book, especially because she already had written one.  And she said she thought that'd be fantastic and encouraged me to do it.  So To have Kate, like we didn't obviously like meet each other in the video, but it was really neat to be a part of a project with Kate.  Great to work with Ash through this project as well.  And I really wish I could meet the other people.  Maybe I will one day meet the other folks who are in this video.  So I really encourage you to watch it.  Like I said, it ended up just having this effect on a lot of people.  that I think was really, really surprising to all of us who were a part of making it.  So I'll put the link in the notes and be sure to check it out. ",
