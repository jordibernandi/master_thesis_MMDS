They don't realize that this is actually happening like every day.  So we do our best to give you just raw evidence, local footage, and there's no hype.  It's just showing you the evidence.  Well, biblical evidence, what the Bible talks about, it talks about this season of calamity, and there's this huge, huge escalation.  It's got absolutely nothing to do with, oh, because we don't have cameras anymore.  We show you the scientific graphs, showing you how much this has increased.  We show you the evidence, and we just show you what the Bible says as well.  So yeah, take a look at the other, definitely have a look at the other videos.  Just quickly, so if you've missed it, we've just done a food mission, and with great, great success, we've helped over 200 people.  So yeah, we won't tell you too much, but take a look at that food mission.  It's so encouraging, very uplifting.  And all the viewers chipped in.  It's a wonderful, wonderful thing to see.  So take a look at that video. ",
