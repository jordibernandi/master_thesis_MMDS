In the aftermath of several of these scandals, many men out here have adapted to the Me Too witch hunt and they have been minimizing their interactions with women and going out of their way to avoid women in places like bars, nightclubs, and restaurants in an effort to protect themselves from an allegation of sexual harassment and sexual assault.  And because these white women see that they no longer have opportunities in the job market and the dating scene as related to men, this has them very upset, like in the case of Sheryl Sandberg, who tried to shame men for walking away from white women, and it didn't work.  And now many of those white women now are backpedaling by making statements like one in several articles where they stated regret for forcing Senator Al Franken to resign his seat in the US Senate.  And one woman retracted her statements allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  So in two cases we are seeing white women backpedaling and in several other cases of allegations against prominent white men we have seen their cases come up where they found out that these white women lied.  and many of these women again now are backpedaling on this Me Too movement and they're trying to put distance between themselves and the Me Too movement because now most of these white women know that their access to the job market is now being closed off because white men are no longer hiring white women.  And white men are no longer promoting white women out of fear of themselves having to deal with an allegation of sexual harassment and sexual assault.  And unfortunately, as a result of the Bill Cosby sexual assault conviction, which changed the standard of law, here in America from innocent until proven guilty and due process under the law to the standard of trust and believe, men have wound up changing the way they deal with women in the workplace and the dating scene.  And now white women are suffering as a result.  And many of them, after an attempt to try to shame white men like Sheryl Sandberg, one of the executives of Facebook tried to do, backfired.  Now we are starting to see these white women backpedaling on this Me Too movement.  And what they're doing is doing it in secret and quietly, but most black women aren't aware of the big picture of white women and this Me Too movement.  And because most sisters aren't aware of what's going on with this Me Too movement, They're believing that the Me Too movement is going full steam because they're caught up in the rhetoric that women like Tanara Burke are preaching on college campuses.  to young black girls.  and they're not seeing that this rhetoric is only being preached by black women and not by white women who see the bigger picture.  So many of these black women out here, they're getting caught up in this rhetoric of Me Too and not seeing that the Me Too movement is overall changing with this white woman who saw that the end result for her was a loss and it could lead to an even greater loss for black women who still get caught up in the rhetoric the me too movement.  because the black women who get caught up in the rhetoric of the me too movement they are still believing that the mission of me too was about stopping sexual harassment and sexual assault of women.  however the original mission of the me too movement was to destroy the reputations and careers of prominent black men and and to demonize prominent black men so that they would not have a legacy for other black people to look up to.  That was the original mission of the Me Too movement, and the original plan for the Me Too movement was to go after prominent black men.  Unfortunately, because your Roger Ailes got caught up in a sexual harassment scandal with Gretchen Carlson, he paid her $20 million in a settlement and that triggered the hypergamy in most of these white women, and that's what led to them going on this witch hunt, making allegations against white men, because they believed they would get some sort of payday at the expense of these white men that they laid down with on the casting couch, that they were side pieces to, and they were out here having extramarital affairs with, like your Harvey Weinstein.  So these women thought they were going to get a payday by revising history to make themselves out to be victims.  Unfortunately, what happened was these white men have now adapted, and they have started to minimize their contact with women in the workplace and the dating scene.  And that has cut off opportunities for white women to get access to white men's resources.  And because that has cut off their access to white men's resources, this is why white women are quietly and discreetly abandoning the Me Too movement and looking to get away from the Me Too movement.  And what they want to do after abandoning the Me Too movement is make it into a movement that goes after black men.  And what they want to do is at the end of everything, make the black woman be the scapegoat for everything failing.  So most black women who are caught up in their feelings about so-called no good black men, they don't see the big picture about this Me Too movement.  And what they want to do is make black men the face of the Me Too movement.  And then after the black men, are destroyed and the Me Too movement doesn't really do anything for anyone.  They want to make black women the fall girl of the Me Too movement and say it was all black women's fault.  So the ultimate goal here is to make the black woman the villain of the picture as related to the Me Too movement.  And your Tanara Burke is too caught up in the attention she has received and too caught up in the so-called opportunity to make money, to see how she's being exploited and how she's putting a tarnish on the image of black women.  She doesn't see what's going on with this Me Too movement, nor does she see the big picture of eventually them trying to make the black woman, the fall girl, Because again, Me Too was originally founded by Tanara Burke, a black woman.  What they want to do is now that the movement isn't working out for them, they want to take that movement and turn it into something where they can make the black woman look like the fall girl, make the black woman look like the bad guy, and make the black woman look like the villain of the picture.  When in actuality, it was white women who were the villain of the picture themselves.  and it was white women who were the ones who orchestrated this witch hunt to destroy the lives and reputations of prominent men, and it was white women who went out of their way to go out and make these allegations to destroy numerous prominent white men, and now that it's backfired on them, and now that they're dealing with a backlash, what they want to do is have everybody pointing the finger at the black woman, have everybody seeing the black woman as the bad guy, and then have everybody saying that it's all the black woman's fault, when in actuality, it was white supremacists behind the scenes who wanted to use this movement to go after Bill Cosby in the beginning to destroy his reputation, and it was white men who wanted to use this movement to further demonize prominent black men.  So often when it comes down to this Me Too movement, they want to keep black women on the Me Too train.  So when it wrecks and falls completely apart, they all can point the finger at the black woman and make her the scapegoat for the failure of this Me Too movement when it had nothing to do with black women.  And we can see that clearly from what's happening to actress Afton Williamson, a black sister out here who was sexually harassed and sexually assaulted on the set of her show, The Rookie.  If that case doesn't prove to anyone, Me Too does not mean you, black woman.  I don't know what to tell you because here we have a young black sister out here who was on this show.  She was sexually harassed.  She was sexually assaulted on this show, allegedly.  And this woman got absolutely no support from many of the big-time faces of the Me Too movement, like your Tanara Burke, like your Rose McGowan, like your Asia Argento, or many of these other white women who have said, oh, that they were so gung-ho about stopping sexual harassment and sexual assault.  Here is a case which actually has some merit as related to this mission of Me Too, which was supposed to be about stopping sexual harassment and sexual assault done to Afton William, a beautiful black sister.  But yet, no one in the Me Too movement has made any sort of statement regarding this case or came out to advocate about this case.  Nothing but silence as related to this Me Too movement in an actual case of, I believe, sexual harassment and sexual assault.  Because when I look at Afton Williams's actions, they speak louder than her words.  And the discreet way she is handling things shows me that this has the ring of truth.  But when it comes down to your Me Too movement, these women were disingenuous from day one because this was a cash grab for older actresses, former side pieces, and casting couch women.  And they weren't about stopping any sort of sexual harassment and sexual assault.  because If these women were out there talking about stopping this, then why did this happen to Afton Williamson on the set of The Rookie?  And why wasn't anything done to protect her?  Again, showing that Me Too did not mean you, black woman.  And that's why you need to get off this Me Too train and let it wreck for these white women because they were the one who started this Me Too train down the road.  And the whole thing is they want to make you the scapegoat so that they can slip away and say it wasn't their fault.  It was the black woman's fault.  And what you need to do is get away from this Me Too movement.  Because if these white women are backpedaling from this Me Too movement, then you need to get off this train before it wrecks.  And you need to get off it because they're trying to make you the villain of this story.  And they're trying to put a further tarnish on the image of black women.
