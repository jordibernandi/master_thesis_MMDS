            "text": "And a lot of the arguments that business coaches would use for why it's okay to make a lot of money, if that's what you want to do, were starting to make me a little bit uncomfortable.  Part one, backstory.  Glasgow, 2009.  An 18 year old angry little vegan edgelord starts writing a book.  It's about corporate dystopia and graffiti artists.  That book becomes State of Flux.  Also Banksy was really big back then.  And this was like long before we canceled him.  So I did four years of uni.  I got my degree in philosophy, specializing in ethics because we all know how much everyone loves a moral philosopher.  And when I graduated, I knew that I wanted to just write books.  So I didn't look for a graduate job.  I got the first job I could find in hospitality in the service industry.  And I hoped that it would give me time to write.  And I worked as a coffee server for a lot of different feudal lords over the years.  And all through that, I was writing.  And I also started making videos for YouTube.  I also had some pretty bad times with my mental health.  And once I realized that work had given me first depression and then debilitating anxiety to the tune of not one but two trips to accident and emergency, And constant panic attacks just from getting the bus to work, not even at work.  I realised that I maybe couldn't survive being a barista that much longer.  And so I had a dream.  I had a dream that I would be able to replace zero hour contracts and numb feet with a salaried white collar office job.  As I was applying for all these corporate marketing jobs, I did sometimes think about what 18 year old me would think of that.  she would hate me but at the same time she'd never had to financially support herself fucking snowflake.  I chased my dream for a while and I could not for the life of me get one of those cushy office jobs that I so coveted.  and there's no way of knowing of course what factors went into each individual rejection that I got.  Was it because the job market's just tough and competitive, especially for millennials with no experience?  Or was it that I am a dumb piece of shit and I deserve to be poor?  Like, this isn't the kind of post-interview feedback that most employers are willing to give.  So I continued to do what I was doing, juggling a ton of different part-time things, really precarious barista work, one ridiculously exploitative marketing internship, one four-hour-a-week social media job, and coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee.  And all through that, I was doing a... what do the kids call it?  I was doing a side hustle, so I was writing and making videos, and eventually I started selling things to other writers.  First, my book, How to Book, turned up the heat a little bit, And then my product, the plot embryo, but on a piece of paper.  And then I started selling people phone calls where I yelled at them about theme.  And then I started asking for money from people who would be sad if I died and stopped making videos.  And before I knew it, the combination of all those things had become my entire job.  I was sitting in a boiling pot of, oh shit, I'm a hashtag girl boss, hashtag entrepreneur.  Part two.  Entrepreneurial content.  My work as a self-employed something has been the majority of my work for a handful of years now.  And if you don't count a few months of coffee shifts in between my Creative Scotland funding and launching my Patreon, I've been full-time self-employed running my own business for one or two years now.  And do you want to know what I did as a barista turned entrepreneur living under the poverty line?  I started consuming all the business content for free that I could get my hands on.  I was eating business advice for breakfast, digital course strategy for lunch and YouTube content marketing for dinner.  One thing you'll learn if you study business and marketing online is that there are some real creeps doing some real sleazy shit out there.  Many years ago, I was listening to a business podcast by a guy called David Siteman Garland, who's this big online marketing business guy.  And he was talking about how to attract the right customers and clients.  And he was saying that you don't want to attract people with a scarcity mindset because they're never going to buy from you.  So you want to attract people with an abundance mindset, people who are, who aren't afraid to invest in themselves, in their learning and their development and making more money.  Yeah.  In theory, that makes sense, right?  You don't want to attract people to your business who are never going to buy from you.  But look, Dave, If you want to say market to rich people, then just say that, man.  Like, you can cloak it in this language of money mindset all you want, but the fact is that people's material circumstances affect or even determines their mindset about money.  People in poverty have a scarcity mindset because their resources and money are literally scarce.  They're not making it up.  They're not crazy.  They're not imagining it.  They literally don't have everything they need to survive and to thrive.  And yeah, let's praise people for having an abundance mindset, AKA having grown up with enough money that they've never had to worry about their survival or their resources running out.  Bam!  Nailed it.  Fuck you, Dave.  So he was basically saying market to rich people or to people who started to think like rich people.  So I switched off the podcast and I went and took a shower and I tried to scrub the idea of scarcity mindset off my body.  But I continued to consume business advice and content over the years, and I just started avoiding anything like that, which kind of made me feel gross.  But this idea of money mindset didn't go away.  It actually started showing up in lots of other people's content as well, in much more subtle ways, in ways that actually sounded quite reasonable, and ways that I actually started agreeing with and taking on board.  Part three, money mindset.  I actually do believe in the power of mindset, in the power of beliefs.  It's the core tenet of the plot embryo and I use that structure for all of my story creation, it's what I teach to writers, but I also think that structure applies to how people grow and flourish in real life.  Character development and self-development both come from changes in belief, from Realising and ridding ourselves of false beliefs about ourselves or about the world that are holding us back and replacing those with truths about the world or about ourselves, which can help us navigate unfamiliar situations and flourish.  I really do believe that changing your mindset can change your life.  And all this entrepreneurial business content that I was taking in was telling me that if I wanted to make money, I had to change my negative associations and beliefs about money because they were holding me back.  Here are the types of unhelpful money mindsets that people would bring up.  Money is the root of all evil.  Marketing is just lying for money.  Marketing isn't lying.  It's actually getting your product in front of the people who need it the most.  So it's actually a public service.  It's unfair to charge a lot for our work.  Only greedy people have lots of money.  And because you're not greedy, you'll never have a lot of money.  The rich are lizard people and we should eat them.  And yeah, sure, you can see how these sorts of beliefs would start to affect you as a business owner.  I mean, they would affect everyone.  But when you're in employment, your ability to negotiate for your pay is like pretty limited.  Whereas when you're a business owner, you literally decide the value of your work.  And sure, you can see how if you feel like you don't have enough money and you want to make more, but you have this subconscious belief that money is evil on some level, then that's going to result in a kind of subconscious self-sabotage where it's going to push you to make decisions which actually stop you from achieving what you want, which is more money.  And obviously it's not evil to have enough money to survive or even to be comfortable.  And I can directly see how some of these negative money mindsets have directly affected my own life and business.  If I think that me and my work are worth a teaspoon of dog shit, and I charge people a teaspoon of dog shit, then I end up with a teaspoon of dog shit.  And it's pretty well documented at this point that women and other marginalised groups are much more likely to measure the value of their work in teaspoons of dog shit, and straight white cis men are much more likely to measure the value of their work in, say, solid gold dicks.  Case in point, I was so uncomfortable with the idea of charging money for my work in the beginning that I released my first ever non-fiction book, Pay What You Want, and so tons of people downloaded it for free before I even set a $1 minimum price.  But I also wanted to be paid in solid gold dicks, so I started trying to change my beliefs about money.  Part four.  Things get uncomfortable.  There are lots of different ways to change your mindset and beliefs.  Life experiences that you have will change your mindset.  You can do it consciously through practice and repetition and affirmations, things like that.  And there's this little thing that we like to call reason, logic, arguments, persuasion, and a lot of the arguments that business coaches would use for why It's okay to make a lot of money if that's what you want to do.  It's okay.  We're starting to make me a little bit uncomfortable.  And I couldn't really put my finger on why.  I felt like I had to accept these arguments.  After all, these people were making money and I wasn't, and I wanted to be, so they had to be right, right?  And it seemed like if I didn't take their advice, my business would fail.  My only tangible alternative to that was to go back to being a barista.  And I knew that either I couldn't physically survive that or I really didn't want to do it.  It was one of those two things.  But still, I kept struggling with the ethics of changing my beliefs about money.  on the one hand, really wanted more money, and on the other hand, I really wanted to stick Jeff Bezos into an extra large Amazon, actually not extra large, medium to small Amazon cardboard box and just have him pee into bottles for the rest of his life.  So, you know, cognitive dissonance was happening.  Was the only way to make more money the same reasoning and tactics that rich people used?  Was it okay to use those tactics even if I was just doing it to get myself above the poverty line, to find some stability, to meet my basic needs?  And then what happened once I got there?  Like if I continued to use them after that?  What happened if I started making more money than I actually knew I needed?  At what point did I become one of those bad people I didn't like?  Was the only thing holding me back from financial stability or even success really my mindset?  What about the economy?  What about bad working conditions?  What about zero-hour contracts and stagnating wages?  My mindset wasn't going to change any of those things.  So was my poverty my fault or not?  part 5. and then I met the goddess Peter fucking coffin.  I watched their very important documentary on self-help which is a fucking masterpiece and you should fucking watch it bitch.  if you found anything that I spoke about in this video interesting at all then you will definitely get a lot out of that video so I do recommend checking it out.  it will be in the description below.  Peter was hitting on exactly why I was so uncomfortable training my brain into this new money mindset.  Because every one of these entrepreneurs was making the same underlying assumption in every video, in every podcast, in every blog post.  Unspoken, underneath the surface, but ironclad.  They seemed like they were saying, this is how to succeed in life.  This is how to get what you want.  But what they were actually saying is, This is how to succeed under capitalism.  And that is our only option, you fucking idiot.  And this was a game changer for me.  This was an epiphany.  This was a revelation.  It was a moment.  And being able to separate the techniques, the mindset shifts, the success formulas, the business blueprints from that underlying assumption was key.  Now, every time I come across a piece of business advice saying you gotta do X, I'd be able to preface it in my head with, when living under the hellscape of capitalism, do X. It allowed me to separate my beliefs and ideas about the capitalist system that we live under.  It's bad and you shouldn't do it.  And what I have to do to survive under it for now.  Charge decent fucking money for your labour, you doofus.  And there's no real answer to the question of do I need to run a business to survive under capitalism at the moment.  Sure, to me right now, it feels like my only viable option, but I've no way of objectively verifying that.  I tried to break into other kinds of work, into white collar work, and it felt like it was never really going to happen for me.  But you could just as easily tell me that I didn't try hard enough, or I didn't try for long enough, that I should have just kept trying.  And believe me, members of my family have made those sentiments clear to me.  And for me, stressful, precarious work as a business owner with zero savings and zero buffer is still preferable to stressful, precarious work as a barista with basically no enforced working rights and doing that all for someone else.  So for now, I am a business owner.  I brand myself.  I do content marketing.  I strategise.  I actively try to sell things to make money.  I try to sell things to you, in fact.  And I try to do that as best I can in our current trash system without using business tactics that make me want to throw up in my mouth.  And I'm anti-capitalist.  And here's your ad hominem low blow of the day.  I don't think you need to look further than the avatars of capitalism in 2019.  Trump, Theresa May, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos.  to see that it's a swamp of steaming garbage that will suck us all under if we let it.  I don't think you have to look further than that, but if you do want to look further than that, I have linked a bunch of videos for you in the description below.  And these two interests, being a business owner, being an anti-capitalist, they are in conflict.  If we dismantle capitalism, my business goes with it.  And the idea of relinquishing something that I've put so much of my heart and soul and my labour into is complicated.  And if I was making enough money from my business that I was substantially better off than the average person, I'm sure the emotions around that would be even more complicated.  But I'm ready to give it up.  What I and all of us would gain from an alternative to capitalism cannot be compared to my business.  Literally created under the pressure to survive.  I'm living off my business right now, and I'm going to continue to sell things and to build on that for as long as I have to.  the second that we get off our asses long enough to dismantle our current capitalist dystopia which we can do if we feel like it we can actually do that.  i will be very happy to burn my business with it and that my friends is how i became an anti-capitalist business owner.  to be to.  You fucked it just at the end, Rachel!  On the finish line!  I'm gonna alienate the entire... Right, time for a cake break.  ...online business community.  That's cool.  That's what I like to do.  But look, Dave!  Dave!  Listen!  Maybe if you could just remember the rest of the line, that would be great.  Hashtag work it, girl.  Hashtag let's get this bread.  Hashtag if you can dream it, you can be it.  There's nothing in this cup, Rachel.  It's a prop.  You just tried to drink out of a prop.  Link to a bunch of descriptions in the video below.  Oh my god, why is this so hard?  It's also a real mug.  It doesn't just exist to be a prop.  Yes!  Okay, now we just need a booty.  Fuck you!  First time I get this line right.  There's a fucking siren.  Oh, she's gonna sneeze!  Oh, just fucking sneeze!  This is like ASMR.  Oh, you piece of shit!  Capitalism is bad.  What a funny situation to happen.  And maybe we should not.  We will do our best to reframe.  It's never going to quite be the same, is it?  Just let me hold you.  Yeah, your microphone.  Oh, honey.  Oh, look, I'm up close.  Hello. ",
