            "text": "I like to read a poem that I did for a sister who took her child to a crack house and left her child.  Poem for some women, huh?  I'm all right, I say, I'm all right.  What you're looking at, I say, I'm all right.  Doing okay, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm still writing, producing on the radio.  Who I fooling, I'm a little ill now, just got a little Jones, Jones, Jones habit, habit.  Took my seven-year-old to the crack house with me.  on Thursday, beautiful girl, prettiest little girl her mama done ever seen, took her so she understand why I late sometimes with her breakfast, dinner, bedtime meetings, bedtime love, wanted her to know how hard it is for me, you know, a single woman out here on her own, you know, so I took her to the crack house where this man, this dog, this former friend of mine lived, wouldn't give me no crack, no action, Even when I opened my thighs to give him some again for the umpteenth time, he said no.  All the while, looking at my baby, my pretty little baby, and he said, I want her.  I need a virgin.  Your pussy's too loose.  You had so much traffic up your pussy, you could park a truck up there and still have room for something else.  And he laughed.  This long laugh and I looked at him and the stuff he was holding in his hand.  You know I couldn't remember my baby's name.  He held the stuff out to me and I couldn't remember her birthday.  I couldn't remember my daughter's face and I cried as I walked out that door.  What's her name?  Puddin' Tang.  Ask me again, I'll tell you the same thing.  Couldn't even hear her screaming my name as she tore into her pretty little panties.  Prettiest little girl you done ever seen.  Prettiest little mama's baby you done ever seen.  Bought my baby this pretty little leather jacket off the street when I went to pick her up on Sunday.  Seven days later, walked right up to the house, opened the door, saw her sitting on the floor.  She said, Mama.  Where you been?  Mama, I call for you.  Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, they hurt me something bad.  I want to go home, Mama.  Mama's little baby loves shortening, shortening.  Mama's little baby loves shortening bread.  Put on the jacket, put on the jacket.  Mama's little baby loves shortening bread.  When we got home, she wouldn't talk to me.  She just sat and stared, wouldn't watch the TV When I turned it on, when we got home She just stared at me with her eyes Dog-like, just sat and looked at me with her eyes Till I had to get out of there, you know My baby ran away from home last week.  My sweet little short and bread ran away from home last night.  And I dreamed she was dead.  Dreamed she was surrounded by panthers who tossed her back and forth, nibbling and biting and tearing her up.  My little short and bread ran away from home last week.  Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo.  I see you and you and you and you. ",
