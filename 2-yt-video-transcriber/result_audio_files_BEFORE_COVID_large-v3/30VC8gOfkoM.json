THAT IS WHAT REALLY CATAPULTED ME INTO THIS PROGRAM.  MY FRIEND SAW ME IN EL PASO, I WAS DEPRESSED.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE ALL OF THIS HAPPENED TO ME.  IT HAPPENED SO QUICK.  I WAS WAY UP HERE, CLOUD NINE, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN.  IT CAME CRASHING DOWN AND IT WAS ALL OVER FOR ME.

I'm like, dude, I'm in no position to talk to any kids.  Nobody wants to hear from me.  I was so down and out, seriously.  Yeah.  Well, turned out that I started, he bugged me.  He was bugging me every day.  I was like, what is with this dude?  He was a thorn in your side.  Yeah, I was like, what is with this guy?  The kids, the kids.  He's all, come on, man, just come talk to the kids.  It'll make you feel better.  I'm like, I don't want to feel better.  I was just that bad.  AND HE GOES, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
