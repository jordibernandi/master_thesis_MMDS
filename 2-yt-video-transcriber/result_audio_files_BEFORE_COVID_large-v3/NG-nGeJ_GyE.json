            "text": "And so that's the larger picture that I'm hearing.  I live in Mill Valley, California, one of the most liberal communities in the country.  And when I go to slam poetry events here in Mill Valley, the same thing coming from the boys and attacks on males and men and boys as having male privilege and male power coming from the females.  It reaches... only applause.  Those are the people who win the slam poetry contest.  What's happening here is that everything males have done to sacrifice themselves, to be willing to be willing to be warriors, to be willing to earn money, to be willing to take the hazardous jobs, what I call the glass cellar occupations, the garbage collectors, the jobs that are constantly driving the night shifts, the jobs that are the dirty jobs, the unpleasant jobs are almost all held by males.  And the additional money we make to get what I call the death professions bonus has been turned against our fathers.  And instead of saying, thank you for making these sacrifices so that you'd earn more money to support the family, we have turned it on its head and said, this reflects discrimination in your favor.  The fact that you earn more money as opposed to understanding that the road to high pay is a toll road.  You get high pay because you're willing to serve somebody else, another, a boss, a company better, not to serve yourself better.  You're willing to forfeit your personal power in order to gain more income power to protect your families.  Instead of thanking our fathers and our grandfathers for these sacrifices, feminists have gone ahead and focused on this as being more male privilege and male power.  So that has left an entire culture of women good and men bad, women victims, men perpetrators, and it's left a contradictory message.  On the one hand we hear, I am woman, I am strong.  And then the other hand we hear, I am woman, I've been wronged. ",

            "text": "What's that about?  It is about a double standard, and it's about a sort of socially deep understanding that when we think of a woman taking advantage of a male, we think of the male who's a teenager really wanting it anyway, whereas we think of the female who's a teenager as being raped.  We live in a culture where that type of double standard exists.  And the punishment for the male is he's seen as a predator, a rapist.  Even if that girl is 17 and the male is 21, he can often be seen as a rapist.  Because the statutory rape division line is usually around 18 in most states.  This is part of our double standard.  And so we talk about equality on the one hand, And we talk of, I am woman, I am strong.  And with the hashtag me too movement, I am very glad there was a hashtag me too movement.  If the hashtag me too movement was the beginning of a complex process, meaning that if women stood up and said, here's what's bothering me about the way many men behave, then men say, here is what's bothering me about the dating process, about the sexuality process, about that.  I live in a culture which says sex is dirty and then says, oh, by the way, guys, you're expected to initiate the dirt.  And if you do it too quickly, you're a date rapist or a sexual harasser.  And if you don't do it quickly enough, you're a wimp.  And if you don't do it quickly enough, we'll never know that you're even interested in us.  You won't get the woman you want.  And by the way, We really go out most of the time with the guys that do take the risks, but each guy that takes that risk is risking the possibility of being prosecuted or persecuted for that.  This does not mean that the males have it all right.  A lot of men way overreach their bounds.  But they need to be met with women who say, no, it's not okay.  I'm not interested in being sexual with you.  Not women who go to the house of famous and successful men that have bad reputations and then use their power to get their power increased like a Harvey Weinstein type of thing going four years later.  with relationships with Harvey Weinstein, and then getting all the advantages that Harvey Weinstein can bring to a female who is sexual with him, and then having the complaint and the monologue be one way, it's a dialogue.

And until she discovers how he handles nose, which is one of the reasons why women say no, even when they are interested, because they want to find out how a man handles nose.  Because if a man handles nose badly, that gives them a signal to get out.  And if the man knows well, that gives them a signal and permission to go to that next level.  So there's a purpose for the man initiating and the woman saying no for a while, backing off.  And there's lots of purposes.  That's just one of them.  But the point there is, if we're going to change that dynamic between men and women, that entire tango needs to be changed.  And when that entire tango needs to be changed, we need to hear how women are hurt.  and hear how men are hurt.  When I hear the fact that it's not just women that are hurt this way and men that are hurt that way, it is some women hurt this way and some women feel the opposite of that.  And there's some men that feel this way and some men that feel the opposite of that.  The women's movement has been not just a sexist movement, it's been a movement that has not acknowledged conservative women nearly enough.  So the feminist movement.  It has not been a movement about the way conservative women feel, about the way Christian women feel.  What we need is every part of the male-female movement to be willing to represent the feminist perspective and more conservative women's perspectives, liberal men's perspectives and more conservative men's perspectives.  No movement on gender can be a balanced, loving movement unless it represents all four of those perspectives.  what we have done to this point in history is take a magnifying glass to women's experience of powerlessness and women's experience of male ",
