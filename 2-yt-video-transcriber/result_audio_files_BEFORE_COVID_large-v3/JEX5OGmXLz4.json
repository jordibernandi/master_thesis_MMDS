The entire British elite, during this whole completely contrived, fabricated, absurd and obscene assault on this alleged Labour anti-Semitism, of which there's exactly zero evidence, zero.  Yeah, there are some fringe members of Labour who play into anti-Semitic views. ",

The British elites could not have gotten away with calling Corbyn anti-Semite unless they had the support, the visible support, of all the leading Jewish organizations.  You have to remember that during the summer, all three major British publications, for the first time in British Jewish history, they all took out a common editorial denouncing Corbyn as an anti-Semite and saying that we're now standing on the verge of another Holocaust.  They are the enablers of this concerted conspiracy by the whole of British elite society to destroy Jeremy Corbyn. ",
