            "text": "Hello, Bezel T3.  That was Pastrix Kim Chastain of United Presbyterian Church of Binghamton, New York, asking the congregation to recite a highly modified immigrant... No, no, not the Immigrant Song, but the Immigrant Apostles' Creed.  Never heard of it.  The PCUSA, which is Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, is a lot like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates.  You never know what you're going to get.  Now, we'll get back to Kim Chastain in a bit.  But first, a little personal history.  I am currently a member of the PCA, Presbyterian Church in America, a historic confessional denomination that for the most part actually takes the Bible seriously.  But I was brought up in the PCUSA, which for the most part does not.  My mother was hired as the soprano soloist of Hollywood Presbyterian Church's Cathedral Choir just after I was born in 1958.  I grew up there, beginning in the nursery, and then as a child watching flannel graph Bible stories, all the way up to an adult, and even being ordained as a deacon and then an elder.  I remained a member until 1997 or so, when then pastor of 25 years, Lloyd Ogilvy, moved on to be the chaplain of the U.S.  Senate.  Now, he recently died in June of this year, and I went to his memorial service just over a week ago at Hollywood Presbyterian Church.  He was a celebrity of sorts, having had his own TV program called Let God Love You.  I did a review of one of his old sermons that I was actually present for.  I'll put a link to it in the info section if interested.  I never got to know Pastor Lloyd very well, nor he me, and so I went to the service more out of curiosity and for reasons of nostalgia than anything else.  I was struck, though, at part of the memorial service that was called Preaching of the Word.  However, the current chaplain of the U.S.  Senate, Barry Black, and a Roman Catholic priest by the name of Lloyd Torgerson, spent their time piling accolades on Lloyd more than anything, even approximating the preaching of God's word.  The closest thing to the preaching of the gospel was the singing of the hymn, All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name.  But at least there was that.  There was also the postlude.  Hollywood Presbyterian Church has a killer organ.  Well, Jonathan, I don't think all people watch me.  I don't know.  Oh, Bach's Toccata in F major from Symphony No.  5.  Man, there are notes in that piece that will make your old silver fillings come loose.  Now, the reason I bring up all this history and why I left the PCUSA long ago is that the PCUSA leadership and some of the churches within the denomination can no longer be called true churches at all, but are what I would classify as synagogues of Satan.  The United Presbyterian Church of Binghamton, New York is one such example.  And I don't say that lightly, nor do I say it with any kind of ill will towards the leadership or the congregation.  Before we get to the main issue that compels me to say just what I said, I want to give you a taste of the preaching you will get at United Presbyterian.  Best I can tell, this is the beginning of her message. ",

            "text": "How dare they is right.  You know, there are some glaring problems with having a 15 foot tall pagan idol in the front and center of a church that claims to be Christian.  Not the least of which are those pesky first and second commandments that God gave to his people through Moses.  You know, you shall have no other gods before me and you shall not make for yourselves an idol of any kind to worship them.  Now, I understand that this was not a Sunday worship service per se, and that the first two commandments don't directly apply.  But at the very least, the leadership of United Presbyterian is guilty of a gross lack of godly discernment, as well as ignoring Paul's admonition to the church in Thessalonica when he wrote, \"'Test everything, hold fast to what is good, abstain from every form, or even every appearance of  evil.'\".  You know, it's almost like United Presbyterian wanted to be outrageous.  They wanted controversy.  And what they wanted, they got.  Now, Pastrix Chastain of United Presbyterian, well, she decided to defend her decision to place a 15-foot-high four-faced idol on the chancel during the Luma Festival in a post on the church's website.  Here are some of the things that she writes.  Okay, she writes this.  The Westminster Catechisms are part of the Confessions of Historic Presbyterianism.  And it says in the first few lines that the chief purpose of humanity is to glorify God and enjoy God forever.  Now, that's true enough.  She goes on.  In other places, it spells out, among other things, that either everything is sacred by God's grace or nothing is sacred apart from the love of God.  Of course, she doesn't point out where it says that in the catechisms.  Now, using the Westminster Catechisms to defend her position is laughable.  She would do well to look at Question 109 of the Westminster Larger Catechism, which asks, What are the sins forbidden in the Second Commandment?  And here's just a few of them.  There's a litany, but here's just a few.  the sins forbidden in the second commandment are the making of any representation of feigned deities all superstitious devices sacrilege all neglect contempt hindering and opposing the worship and ordinances which god has appointed.  Now, I want to be clear.  I believe the Westminster Standards, that's the Catechisms and the Confession, are really good summaries of what the Bible teaches, if you actually believe the Bible to be God's revealed Word.  Each of the abuses that we just mentioned, and the many more that are there, have proof texts from Scripture.  Just look up the Westminster Larger Catechism on the internet, if you're interested.  She goes on to say, Hello!  It's a pagan idol!  And plain old Christian prudence and discretion should never have allowed that ghastly-looking thing anywhere near the church.  And then she says this, Contemplation of an idol in a so-called Christian church?  I mean, you've got to be kidding me, right?  See, you can understand why the PCUSA is dying a slow, painful death.  It began long ago when Princeton Seminary began its liberal leanings and the abandoning of the authority of Scripture, and next the ordination of women to the pulpit, and then the ordination of homosexuals, and now in 2019, a 15-foot-tall laser-lit God of War in the center of the sanctuary.  It's a dadgum man-centered free-for-all.  And speaking of Presbyterian seminaries, take a look at this. ",

So special that they decided to have a chapel service where a special time of confession of sin was directed to plants.  This is from Union's Twitter account.  They wrote, Today, in chapel, we confess to plants.  Together, we held our grief, joy, regret, hope, guilt, and sorrow in prayer, offering them our confessions, to the beings, the plants, who sustain us, but whose gift we too often fail to honor.  This is all wrong.  Now that's an understatement.  Okay, first of all, according to the Bible, plants are not beings.  They have no mind or will or emotions in the way that God and angels and human beings do.  And second, we're taught by Scripture to confess our sins first to God and then to each other.  Psalm 51, Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving devotion, according to your great compassion.  Blot out my transgressions.  Wash me clean from iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.  And then James chapter 5, Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another.  You know, all of this stuff, the social justice moralizing being passed off as preaching, the idol in church, the teaching seminary students to confess their sins to plants.  You know, it reminds me of 1 Kings chapter 18 when Ahab saw Elijah the prophet.  And Ahab says to him, And he answered him, I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father's house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals.  And Elijah came near to all the people and said, How long will you go on limping between two different opinions?  If the Lord is God, follow him.  But if Baal, follow him.  You know, it's as true today as it was then.  We either follow God by trusting in his beloved son Jesus, the Christ, for the forgiveness of sins, obey his commands, and lay hold of his promises, or we can go off and offer ourselves to the dead idols of our own making that cannot hear us nor save us.  Whether a pagan idol in a church or praying to plants during a chapel service, it's all sheer folly and very much like the man in Isaiah 44.  We read there, he's talking about trees that he's grown up and he's chopped down.  And it says there, half of it he burns in the fire.  Over the half he eats meat, he roasts it and is satisfied.  He also warms himself and says, ah, I'm warm for I've seen the fire.  The rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, and falls down and worships it.  And he prays to it and says, deliver me, for you are my god.  So sad.  What we need is pastors and churches that are willing to glorify God by preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and proclaim that there is salvation in no one else.  Friends, find a church that Paul could write to with the same words he wrote to the Thessalonians.  They're out there, even if you've got to travel a little farther to get to them.  1.  Thessalonians 1, 8-10, \"'For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place.  your faith towards God has gone forth, so that we have nothing more to  say.'\".  For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he has raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.  You know, I was just ready to render this video and put it up on YouTube when I realized that I had given you only bad examples of seminaries.  And I wanted to give you at least one good one because they're out there.  This one is Westminster Seminary, California.  It's in Escondido.  And it is solid and it is biblical.  And what I want you to do, if you're at all interested, is go to this website and look at their classes.  Look at their curriculum.  Look at the classes that they offer.  And then go to Union Seminary and see what kind of classes they offer.  It should speak volumes.  Give it a try. ",
