            "text": "This is why I also, that's my last provocation, I'm already attacked in Europe, I like this Greta Thunberg, and I ask her why, because she's I think the best example of toxic masculinity that I can, if you read the exact definition of toxic masculinity, instead of dialogue, you act aggressively and so on, she is it.  Did you notice how Greta changed her image?  Till Two, three months ago, she was the innocent girl who is just telling the emperor is naked.  Now, she has this ironic, almost demoniac smile and so on.  I think I like women who are like this.  She is not a man.  She has a specifically feminine aggressivity, which is, I think, important today.  Because why do our media like so much the feminine approach?  It's part of today's politics and ideology where oppression has to be masked as \u2013 how should I call it?  \u2013 medical advice, you know, we should understand.  if you are a criminal, you should get psychological advice, therapeutic approach and women fit here wonderfully.  A friend of mine in France did an analysis how to deal with youthful crime and so on.  They prefer women.  They do the same state oppression but in this feminine understanding way and so on and so on.  So no, I think if anything in politics This is now to annoy my friends, Democrats.  We need more brutal protest.  Not for physical protest.  But what I like about Greta Thunberg is her point is not, oh, I go to Congress, let's dialogue a little bit.  No.  Her message is, you don't listen to me, I am right.  No debate.  No debating.  And I think this is the only way to approach what I consider the truly big problems today, like ecology.  No, sorry, we shouldn't debate one degree Celsius or Fahrenheit or two or three.  The same is for me with digital control, which is the real horror today.  Like how we are already controlled, what is the process.  We should raise the temperature here in a nonviolent way, but large-scale protests and so on and so on.  I talk too much, please. ",
