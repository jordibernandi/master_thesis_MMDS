All people are welcome to have a debate discussion with a person if they agree and give consent to it.  The discussions can either take place over the phone or some form of audio video, you know, phone chat such as Skype, Facebook, or in person on camera, you know, no messaging type of debates or discussions in a format of messaging.  Do note by me.  allowing biblical discussions to take place on my channel doesn't mean I'm a part of any other religion or organization.  You know, this is an idea in which, you know, came to mind for people to do, you know, in reference to having a platform for biblical discussions versus, you know, gossip or nonsense over social media.  Of course, I'm not allowing just anybody, you know, but those who have some type of biblical knowledge and debating skill.  if anyone is interested feel free to contact me on my email at a boxer tony harvin gmail.com.  b-o-x-e-r-t-o-n-y h-a-r-v-i-n at gmail.com or you could shoot me out a text message to my phone two zero one six six seven nine five two four.  please text now if you happen to be you know having a back and forth, you know, over the YouTube comments with somebody, Facebook, Instagram, you know, or just in general outside, wherever, you know, on social media or outside of social media, you know, come bring it to the platform, to the forefront, to the public where, you know, you and that person have a, you know, a respectful debate.  You know, me personally, I enjoy and find biblical discussions very interesting.  of course i may disagree or agree with whoever but to me in general it's just very interesting to hear and listen to where people's minds and thoughts are pertaining to the holy scriptures.  you know the first episode should be out either today or tomorrow.  you know i'm not going to say who but the topic is on is jesus christ god.  now i'm concluding.
