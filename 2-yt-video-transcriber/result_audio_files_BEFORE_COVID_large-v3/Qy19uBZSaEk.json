            "text": "And the cities about them in like manner, right?  Give it them, give it themselves over to fornication.  Because if Sodom and Gomorrah, this was happening too.  Men wanted to twerk.  Men wanted to be with men.  Men thought money loved God.  And what about it?  And what about it?  Genesis 19, 24.  We're going to find out what about it.  We're going to find out.  We're going to find out.  What are we doing?  Genesis 19, 24.  Read the Bible.  Go ahead.  Genesis 19, 24.  You say God don't hate nobody?  You say God don't hate nobody?  I got it.  Let's listen to it.  Let's listen to it.  Let's listen to it.  Give me the mic.  Let me talk.  Let me talk.  I'm listening to it.  So you're telling me, and this is me talking to you as a man and a man, hard as fuck.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  The same way.  That straight men circumvent adultery, conceal, they can lie, they can go against what God says in the Bible.  You're saying that my sin of homosexuality is bigger than the sin of adultery?  Wait, wait, wait.  That's on the same commandments.  Adultery is on the same commandments.  Yes, I do understand that God says that.  Back up, back up, back up.  Let him talk.  Let the man talk.  We give him respect.  Let the man talk.  I do understand that in the Bible, God does have so shame upon people being homosexual, but you gotta also come to the fact that there's other sins that are out there that everyone is doing.  Yeah, I might be gay, but it's... I mean honest.  it feels like you're just getting on y'all.  No, no, no.  Let the man talk.  Give the man respect.  It feels like he's disrespecting one community and not an entire thing.  Because like in the Bible, I go to church every Sunday.  I go to church every Sunday.  Let the man talk.  Let the man talk.  I know that for a fact.  The same people that's out there permitting dogs, same people that's out there stealing, same people that's out there disrespecting their parents.  That's the same commandment, right?  The same people that's out here.  Tell them to stay in order because I'm giving you respect.  Oh, yeah, no.  Tell them to stay in order.  I'm giving you respect.  No.  All of us want.  So I feel as though, yes, I do that same thing in my house my mom does.  Can I explain now?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm listening to you.  All right.  First and foremost, we're not here to single you out.  Okay.  Because I told that, the sister over there, the big one right over there, I told her if she don't put some clothes on, God is going to judge her.  That's not respect.  I mean, I let you talk.  I let you talk, right?  I let you talk.  I let you talk.  Brother, you gotta let me talk now.  I let you speak.  We don't... If you continue walking on homosexuality, according to the Bible, God is going to judge you.  If I'm going to put on a kippah sermon, where are the fringes?  Like, I taught the brother right here with his wife.  God is going to judge him.  We're not sending you out.  We're setting up against all wickedness.  Now, you just made a statement.  I want to answer that question.  You said God doesn't hate nobody.  He don't.  He don't, right?  Are you sure you believe that?  Yes, I'm sure, brother.  God, listen, listen.  Do you believe that?  Listen, Jesus died on the cross for everybody's sake.  I want to answer it.  Not just yours.  I want to answer it, brother.  Brother, come on, brother.  Have respect.  Let me answer the question.  Please answer the question.  Go ahead.  You said God doesn't hate nobody.  Let's get out the mic.  Let's get out the Holy Bible.  Psalm 12 verse 6 please.  The book of Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 6 right?  For the most high hated what?  For the most high hated what?  For the most high hated God.  hated we sinners.  Hey what?  Sinners.  Hey what?  Sinners.  Hey what?  Sinners.  Hey what?  Sinners!  Sinners!  Sinners!  God hates sinners.  Now, a sinner is somebody who continues walking in these things.  You probably didn't know what you were doing was wrong.  I'm going to let you talk.  I'm going to let you talk.  You probably didn't know what you were doing was wrong.  But now that you know better, what you got to do?  I'm going to let you talk.  You got to answer.  What you got to do when you know something's wrong?  You repent and do what?  And you do better, right?  Now, I'm going to let you have the floor now.  I'm talking too long.  I'm going to let you have the floor next.  Can I show you the law of the Bible?  Now, before you show me, tell me what passage of the Bible you're getting this from.  Are you getting this from the Old Testament?  Old Testament.  Go to the New Testament.  Go to the New Testament after Jesus died on the cross for everybody's sins.  Thank God she's the blood of Jesus for everybody's body.  You don't mind?  And yours.  Because I know you sin.  You can't lie to me and say you ain't sin.  Nobody's sinless right now until we're in the kingdom.  Now, you said that I can't prove what I'm about to show you in the New Testament, right?  Let me prove it.  1 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 9, for my beloved brother.  1 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 9.  With power in the spirit, brother.  Read.  Know ye not that the unrighteous.  That the what?  That the unrighteous.  That the what?  That the unrighteous.  I gave the brother respect.  Let the brother give me respect too.  My brother.  Read it again for the brother.  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Read.  Be not deceived.  Don't be deceived.  Read.  Neither fornicators.  Now, fornication is any unlawful sexual act, right?  Read.  No adulterers!  Adulterers worshipping other gods!  No adulterers!  No adulterers.  women sleeping around breaking the bank and covering it with their husbands!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effeminate!  No effem.  That's out of the New Testament.  If you continue doing this, you're not going to enter the kingdom.  If you're feminine and abusing yourself, it's homosexuality in playground.  Don't help it.  If you continue doing this, that's breaking God's commandments.  You're not going to enter the kingdom.  Do you want to enter the kingdom?  How do you enter the kingdom?  Go right ahead.  Go right ahead.  All right.  So we want to single you out.  We don't want to single you out.  I feel like you got to look at it from this, from our point of view.  You got a group of gay men, okay?  Gay men.  We're in Miami.  We're not fully covering our bodies.  It's hot as hell outside.  It's about 90 degrees outside.  No, it's a scripture.  You know what I mean?  So I do know.  I know what I do.  But that's what I just said.  And I get that y'all are defeated in your religion.  I just said that.  No person without the strong.  God is strong.  We have become from a different point of view and different perspectives.  And my thing is, I was right to you.  Instead of making a big old scene about it, if you think that we're doing it wrong, okay.  But you don't got to see it and make us look horrible about ourselves and put down other people.  Because you don't got to put down other people.  It's love.  We all gotta love each other.  Let me finish.  We're in an era where, again, people like you and me, we're dying because we hate each other.  We're supposed to be in love.  We're supposed to be one.  We're supposed to love each other.  We're supposed to respect each other.  We're supposed to be one as college people.  We see all these white people here.  They don't care about this.  We sit here going back and forth, making a fool out of ourselves.  I want to ask you a question.  You said we're supposed to love each other, right?  You probably, in your eyes, you feel like we are showing love, right?  I'm not saying that you are.  Now, what is love?  I may have a definition of love that's contrary to the definition of love to you.  I may think Robin Jarvis is love, because it's showing my bank account love, right?  You may think showing your mother and father love, that's the only love, and this and that, right?  And I don't think that.  So we got to go to see what God says.  love is, right?  We believe in the Bible, right?  Now, let's see what God says.  2 John chapter 1 verse 6.  2 John chapter 1 verse 6.  And this is love.  This is love out of the Bible.  That we walk after his commandments.  That we walk after his commandments.  Right?  This is the commandment that he has not heard from the beginning.  Because we heard this from the creation of Genesis.  You have to keep God's commandments if you love him.  We are here to show you love by telling you if you continue walking in sin.  You're going to die.  God is going to judge.  But before you get to say something, I got to pass the mic, brother.  All right?  I got to pass the mic.  Shout out to the nation of Israel.  To Moses, I bless us.  And have mercy on us on the last day. ",
