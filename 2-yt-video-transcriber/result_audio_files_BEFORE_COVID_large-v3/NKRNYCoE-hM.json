            "text": "First of all, okay, I was over there looking for the girl, Brian Lane, and he, like, parks when he sees me.  I'm like, okay, cool.  And I come out, he parks again.  And then I go that way, and he's still parked back there, coming around this way.  And then I'm like, that's weird.  And then he comes and parks right here and sits on the car again.  I'm like, okay, I'm calling this out because that's just weird.  What are you doing?  So when he was just sitting on the car and I identify him, well, I asked him to identify him.  He's like, no.  I'm like, actually, you have to tell me.  So I was getting irritated.  And then he was like, then he told me his name, but he had his ID and never, like, showed me.  But still, he said no the first time.  So that's why I'm arresting him.  He wants a sergeant, but who's coming?  So, I don't know.  What's the, uh, the tow, because it's just in the roadway?  Well, I guess I don't have to deal with it.  I'm searching anyways.  I said... I'm sorry, let me calm down real quick.  You're good.  He just pissed me off.  So he was basically just, like, following you?  No, he wasn't following me.  He was on Bryan Lane.  Can you just stop the parking?  Yeah.  Just kept, every time he saw me, he just parked.  So that's why I called it out.  It's a suspicious vehicle.  I'm like, I'm going to stop this because it's being weird.  Okay.  I should be good.  I don't mean to be disrespectful to you, but you came off as super disrespectful.  Yeah, because I'm going through something right now, and I'm looking for somebody.  And I was trying to avoid you so I don't have to do this with you.  And I still had to do it with you.  I mean, to be honest, it would have been easier if you would have just given me your name.  I did.  No, you didn't.  The first time you said that, you said no.  Yes, it does.  The first time you said that, you said no.  I knew his name, Tom.  Yeah, that's why he wants his son.  He wants to afford us.  I knew that name did sound familiar.  Yeah, and you could tell by the way he was acting.  Yeah.  So that's why he was doing that, was so that you'd pull him over just like this email says.  Do you have a phone number?  It's in his car.  Yeah, it's in his car.  He wants it.  so bad, don't give it to him.  Oh, yeah, he's definitely not getting it.  It's going to continue to stay in his car.  But, no, I'm not going to tow the vehicle.  Were you arresting him or trying to take it?  Yes, I am arresting him for failing to identify himself.  I mean, I shouldn't have to ask you five times.  Yeah.  I only asked him that many times because I was waiting on you.  Yeah, that's... I did say 1918, though, but... I was kind of far from it.  I canceled... Oh, you were?  Well, I was watching the summer.  I canceled him because I thought he was... I think it's at 32.  Well, his diesel's legally parked.  I'm not going to tow it.  I'm not going to tow it.  All right.  I'm sorry.  You said you're following this one?  All right.  Negative.  I'm pulling up 23 now.  Did you still want to speak to the sergeant?  Did you still want to speak to the sergeant?  No, you did what you had to do, right?  I did.  I'm done with it.  So, no?  I would like to speak to one.  I'm trying to figure out why I'm going to jail when I identified myself.  I mean, if you try to say I didn't identify myself, then I could do for you.  I mean, just do what you got to do, ma'am.  I apologize to you.  The sergeant is on his way.  Did you still need to speak to him?  Ma'am, if that helps my case, if it doesn't, then I don't know the charge. ",
