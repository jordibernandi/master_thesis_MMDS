            "text": "Good evening, brethren.  This is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, I want to give all praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  I also want to acknowledge the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  I also want to acknowledge Yehawah Shai.  I pray that the Most High blesses this lesson and gives us some more understanding of the things that have happened in the past, things that are happening currently, and the things that are soon to come on the Earth.  I was coming home and I saw a video talking about how these oil tankers that were attacked in Saudi Arabia were done by the Iranians and how the United States has been making threats that if Iran or any of its proxies did anything that the United States would return you know, enforce and attack the Iranian regime.  Pretty much all just starting up World War III.  So the pretext for whatever they needed as far as justification for their actions seems to be unfolding on a daily basis.  But I wanted to make this video because we know that everything repeats itself and you're seeing history repeat itself again.  It might be a little bit different than what many people seem to think, but the most high is the one who gives blessings and he's the one that takes them away.  And sometimes the people who have the blessing currently are the last ones to figure out that their blessing has been taken away from them.  Now, I know that Esau and many of the Edomites feel that they're going to be on top and ruling forever.  And that they're never going to have to pay for their atrocities anymore.  But we all know that that's not so because the Most High has put it in many books that what you do will come back to you.  But the whole thing as far as realizing that your blessing has been taken away from you, sometimes the person that that blessing was given to is the last ones to realize that that blessing is no more.  That happened to us over here on this continent.  When the Europeans or the Spanish arrived, the Spanish were just running through our country, destroying people left and right, not because they were so powerful, but because the Most High had given his blessing to these nations.  And many of our caciques or kings of the different tribes of the natives that were here, didn't realize that they had lost their blessing.  And Mosai had taken away their power and given it or translated it to another.  And there was a couple stories like that.  I'm going to be getting into my book.  I've been doing a lot of studying and I'm already ready to make a couple videos, but I wanted to make this one because I see what's happening and Mosai put it on my heart to make a quick video today.  And As the Spanish were just going through our lands and just destroying our people and taking their gold and silver and their women and the children and enslaving people, this is a small, quick little story about how our people were the last to know that the blessing had been taken away.  So here's a little example.  It says, Fear of the great white conqueror and his savage dogs now had spread throughout the Isthmus.  And as the Spaniards proceeded on their toilsome journey toward the Mar del Norte, other caciques hastened to deliver up their gold before the conqueror could unleash his dogs.  So many of our people had realized that they had lost the blessing and the covering of the Most High and decided just to bow down to the Spaniards.  But some of our people didn't get that message.  But when Balboa and his men approached the province of the cacique Tabunama, that powerful and greatly feared leader defiantly boasted that he would drag the invaders by the hair of their heads and cast them into the river.  Balboa responded by attacking Tabunama's village in the dead of night and seizing the cacique with all his family.  and a number of his vassals.  Balboa ordered that the miserable cacique be bound hand and foot and either cast to the hounds or be himself dragged by the hare and cast into the river.  Humiliated and terrified, the once formidable chieftain promised Balboa all the gold he possessed and ever would possess during his lifetime.  At last, Balboa released Tabunama and sealed with him a most advantageous treaty of peace.  He left the province with much gold, a number of new slaves, one of the cacique's sons to be trained as an interpreter, and for good measure, Tabunama's seraglio of 80 select and beautiful women.  So he took all those things from him and also took his harem of 80 beautiful women because he hadn't got the message yet.  the cacique here still thought that he had the blessing, that he still had the sword and that the Most High was still on his side and covering him.  But he found out real quick that that blessing had been given over to Esau and the other nations and that they had the blessing of the Most High to come here and destroy.  Our people take over our lands, put us into slavery, and to take our resources.  So that happened to us.  So now fast forward a few hundred years.  Now we're coming to the time when Esau's blessing is now slowly being taken from him.  And many Edomites are starting to realize, well, some are realizing, some are not.  Some are going to be riding this wave all the way to the end, thinking they're always going to be on top.  But the Most High is making it clear that those times are just about over.  So like I said, there's nothing new under the sun.  Our leaders, our great leaders, thought the Most High was with them when he translated power to another.  Now the Most High is about to do the same thing.  And when Esau was given his blessing, He couldn't wait to use his blessing.  When he was given the sword and we were given over to him, he just looked for any opportunity to use his sword and his dogs against our people.  Even to the point where they were required to read a declaration to the people that they were going to be taken over as vassals and that they were going to lose their land to the king and they had to be subject to the king.  And if they didn't, then they would be killed.  The men would be killed.  The women would be taken prisoner and raped.  And the children would be taken as slaves as well.  And they would lose their land.  But, of course, they read this in Spanish, which the natives didn't understand.  And they read it miles away from their homes.  Why did they do these kinds of things?  Because Esau was in such a hurry to use his blessings.  that he didn't want any excuse not to be able to use it.  He didn't want to give the natives a chance to bow down and accept their punishment.  He wanted to use his sword.  And that's something that he's always wanted to do.  Okay?  So he read it where no one could hear it, so then he would be justified to use his blessing.  And to show you how things don't change, even later on with the atomic weapons, the atomic bomb, Remember how I told you Esau gets his blessing and is so quick to want to use it.  Like he gets a brand new toy and can't wait to use it.  Let me read this about the nuclear bomb.  The first atomic bombs was detonated on July 16th, 1945 in the Trinity test at the Alamogordo bombing and gunnery range in New Mexico.  Then, okay, look how quick Esau is to use it.  As soon as he found out he got his new toy, What did he do with it?  Atomic bombs were then used on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, respectively, killing about 210,000 people.  So he pretty much waited a few weeks to use this new devastating weapon.  Because that's what Esau does.  He looks for any reason to be able to use his blessing.  But if you haven't noticed... There's been a lot more of a pause lately because I think that Esau realizes that his time and his blessing is wavering.  He's been going to different countries and making a lot of threats, but then nothing happens.  He goes into different countries now and he makes these threats.  Before, Esau wouldn't think twice about using his weapons.  But now these other nations have been blessed with weapons as well.  Because the Most High is now taking, he's peeling that power away from the Edomites.  And now they're kind of questioning, is the Most High still with us?  Does he still, is he still giving us that sword to be able to use to subdue the whole world?  And that's kind of like why I picked this picture right now.  Esau's loving his sword, but that power is being taken away.  So like I said before, he was quick to to try to use it.  But now, with these events that are happening, we're going to see real quick if the Most High is still with Esau, or if now he's taken his power and translated it over to another.  We know that the Most High is turning his face back to his people and giving us knowledge and understanding of who we are, where we came from, And eventually he's going to empower his people once again.  So as you look at these stories that are going on daily, and you start to see how the nation, well, the nations are crumbling.  As we rise, the other nations are going to fall.  That's just the way the Most High has set this up.  So like I said, there's no new thing under the sun.  We had the blessing.  We lost it.  He gave the blessing to the other nations.  They will lose it.  At the end, the Most High is going to restore his people.  So I'm going to read one quick scripture real quick from the rest of Esther, from the Apocrypha.  It says, And the nations were those that were assembled to destroy the name of the Jews.  And my nation is this Israel, which cried to the Most High, and were saved.  For the Lord hath delivered us from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs and great wonders, which have not been done among the Gentiles.  Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the Gentiles.  And these two lots came at that hour.  and time, and day of judgment before God among all nations.  So God remembered his people and justified his inheritance.  Those are the times that we're moving into.  All praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  Ignorance to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Ignorance to Yehawashai.  Stay prayed up, Israel.  Shalom. ",
