            "text": "Thank you.  If you remember our coverage of the yellow vest movement ... began late last year when of course the mainstream media ... was not talking about it.  and we're telling you this is ... something major.  this is something that is going to ... continue on.  this is something that's going to ... spur the European spring.  and now just after last week ... after the 18th week of mass demonstrations not just in ... we are seeing it go to one of its craziest most insane ... points to talk about this and a lot more.  we have.  Bob.  Bob is ... one of our official sources.  he's anonymous because ... there's a lot of reprisals against the yellow vest ... movement because again he wants it to be a movement ... that no one speaks for.  but he does talk to a lot of the ... organizers.  he is there on the ground he is there in ... and he has a lot of on the ground information that has been very solid and very good and of course gives you a perspective that you're not going to get anywhere else.  and what bob has been telling me has been absolutely fascinating because i don't know if you know i know this bob but i get bob's not your real name it's just an anonymous name that we're saying here.  i've been watching some western tv and again the last thing that happened After this crazy very violent I think the most ... violent ever 18th week protest.  the mainstream ... media in America mentioned it for 2 minutes maybe at Max ... and I was like oh yeah there's some French people ... protesting about fuel.  and of course that's not even.  that's ... That's not even any of the story.  And that's why I wanted to talk to you and get everything.  Of course, this video is probably going to go longer than 10 minutes.  The first part is going to be on our main channel.  The longer part is going to be on our backup channel.  But Bob, first of all, wow, the 18th week was really insane.  Where is this movement right now?  Because it's definitely not going away like many people want it to. ",

            "text": "Yeah, there's been a militarization of the conflict and it's going wilder right now.  uh the the interior ministry which what you could call the homeland security in the united states the interior ministry is now is now calling for the deployment of the sentinel, which is troops, military troops surrounding the next Yellow Vest protest.  So it is now allowed through the urgency state laws that were enabled, I think it was a couple of months ago, because of the terrorist attacks.  And these emergency laws enable the utilization of military personnel on the streets, which was supposedly to prevent terrorist attacks.  But now they are going to be used for yellow vest protests.  Is this like martial law?  No, it's not martial law.  But that's the tricky thing.  In France, because of these laws, you don't need martial law to bring these military personnel on the ground to protect certain institutions.  That's what they say, but you don't protect institutions with military personnel.  if it's a social demonstration.  or any demonstration that is coming from a social uproar in the country.  So the word terrorist is now being used many times on TV shows.  describing last Saturday's revolt on the Champs Elysees. ",

They have their own rhetoric to say that it's a terrorist... They don't say terrorist attack, but they say it's a... I mean, they're sleeping... It's a war on semantics.  They're saying terrorists is an attack on institutions that can cause death.  But there were no deaths, actually.  And it's also, I mean, you could see the images, all this fire.  Of course, no one is defending this, but it was only attacking buildings or shops or symbols like, you know, this restaurant that is called, I don't remember the name again now. ",

There was also a building and there was allegedly a child and a mother trapped that were screaming in the fire that started from the bank.  I mean, there's also been a huge discussion.  And I want to bring this up because when I'm at the Yellow Vest Movement, there's a big faction of people who are very peaceful, who are saying, stop attacking the police, who are there to mediate stuff.  And then there's another element that it seems like the police are letting get away with more violent crime.  And the police seem to be attacking those peaceful people more, which I wanted to bring up to you because that's kind of my understanding of it.  Am I right or am I wrong?

I would say yes, because you don't become a violent person from one day to the other.  It's not happening like this.  The people who are really protesting with violence, they have done this in the past.  And there's a few elements of people who became violent because of the repression, the police that was using also a lot of these weapons like the flashball and so on.  I mean, you can imagine 20 people. ",

It's a repression.  It's a militarized repression.  And these people usually didn't have any weapon in their hands.  Some of them probably, I don't know, less than 10 people were injured, were actually violent.  But the majority of them were not.  I mean, 2,000 people were injured.  and some of them really hard.  On the other side, you have something which is also a form of violence, which is that 20 police officers took their own lives since the beginning of this year, in 2019.  If you want to have a comparison, there were only 36, I mean, only, it's not the right word, actually, but there were 36 people of them who... took their life last year.  So if you compare these two numbers, it's a crazy number for 2019.  It's not directly because of this Yellow Vest protest, because many of the policemen are actually for this protest, but not the violent protest.  But they have no means to do their work.  They are being pressured on a daily basis.  Sometimes they have to pee on the ground.  I mean, they have to pee in their pants because they have no pause during the day.  They have no protection. ",

And, you know, you could just see it on their faces because, again... every week this is 19 weeks of huge huge protest ... everywhere hundreds of thousands if not millions of ... people and then they have to guard that area.  but I want to ... bring up with you because there always has been this ... kind of two different factions within the yellow ... vest movement.  one is the violent one is the nonviolent ... and and you know depending on what happens sometimes the ... police usually the police from what I have seen start the ... Start the aggression.  Start the violence.  From everything I've seen.  From everything I've seen personally, myself.  And you have to ask yourself, is there something to when peaceful protesters are being attacked and the violent protesters are being let go and pretty much allowed to do what they want?  Because that's what some people are saying is happening.  The police are mainly attacking peaceful protesters, but when it comes to the violent elements, they want those to happen since they make people not like the yellow vest.  There's even police officers running around with hammers, which is absolutely terrifying.  What's your take on it, and where's the dichotomy between the violent and the nonviolent factions?  now, because it sways so much within the yellow vest movement? ",

They think it can bend the reality towards their own control on the policies.  But in overall, it's a very tricky question because you have to understand that some policemen can actually lose their, I mean, can explode and just uh... through.  the pressure can be uh... very violent.  but some of them actually were fighting.  there was an infighting in the police.  i mean you.  you have another image which is very interesting.
