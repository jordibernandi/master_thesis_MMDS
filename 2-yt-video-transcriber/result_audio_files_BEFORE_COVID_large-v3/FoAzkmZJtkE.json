We wanted to make sure to come back to Dallas just because this was the last place that Pastor Steve had planned to come and to hug the necks and shake the hands of our Dallas family.  The Back to Fellowship Conference will be Saturday, June the 1st, 2019, at the Dallas Marriott Suites Medical Center, 2493 North Stevens Freeway, from 1 p.m.  to 4 p.m To register for the conference, go to stephendarbyministries.com.  We hope to see you there. ",
