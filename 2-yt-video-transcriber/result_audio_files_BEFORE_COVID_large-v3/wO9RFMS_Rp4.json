What's your name, sir?  What is your name?  What crime do you suspect me of committing?  Well, they want to trespass for you, which they have the right to do.  Right.  So I don't need to get my name.  I'm trying to talk to you.  All right.  First of all, I don't want to talk, though.  They need your identification.  No.  For the form.  Yes, they do.  No, they told me to leave.  I left by law.  I left.  You can warn me.  I need your information to put in my system of trust.  No, I'm not.  What crime do you suspect me of committing?  Trespassing.  And I'm asking for your information so I can write it to my system.  What crime?  Articulated crime.  Trespassing from the train station.  Okay, they told me to leave and I left.  So what crime did I commit?  Absolutely not.  901.151 states different.  Give me your name, please.  Florida Pinnacle states different.  I'm asking for your name.  Okay.  Name and date of birth, sir.  I'm not giving you my name.  What is your name and date of birth?  51.  What's the name of your badge number?  Don't give it to them.  You have to.  No, I'll get you mine.  I'm the primary officer.  Okay, so why are they here?  Because they're my backup.  Okay, I need their names.  In case you violate my rights, I need to know who to contact.  And I'm not giving it.  They asked me to leave.  They asked me to leave, and I left.  Okay, so you don't need my information.  So you don't need... No, I'm not giving them my information.  Florida Penal Code 901- See this?  Florida Penal Code states that I don't care.  It states that you need to provide- First, you need to warn me what you're doing now, and I'm not on there.  I have nothing to do with this.  Good!  So I'm not, you can't force me to give them- Hold on, let me talk.  You can't force me to give my ID without breaking the law.  Well, when the police officer asks for identification- That's not what Florida Penal Code 901-151 states.  It states suspicion of a crime, a body committed a crime, or a half committed a crime.  You can pat me, but you can't search me.  I do not agree to any illegal searches or seizures.  That's fine.  They're going to start you now.  That's great.  Okay, good.  Am I being detained?  Well, right now, yes, you are.  For what crime?  For trespassing.  Okay.  I'm not trespassing.  I'm talking to you.  Okay.  I need the sergeant, please.  The sergeant is coming, sir.  Thank you.  And so you told them not to identify to a citizen, right?  You're dealing with me.  I'm the primary.  But they're here.  No, they have nothing to do with it.  They respond to the dispatch.  First of all, why are you so loud?  Back up a little bit.  I'm right here.  Okay, but back up a little bit.  Because you're right next to me.  No, you walked up to me.  Okay, I'm going to step a step back.  I'm going to take a step back.  Now, am I being detained?  Yes, you're still being detained for questions.  What took place on the train?  Since I'm being detained, then at this point, I'd like to assert my fifth amendment privilege.  Oh, my God.  What took place on the train that they didn't want to trespass on you?  That's what we're asking.  I don't know.  Investigate them.  I did.  I already talked to her.  But I want your side of the story.  I don't have a side.  There's two sides of the story, right?  I don't have a side.  I don't answer questions, buddy.  You don't answer questions?  No.  Okay, but you have to provide an ID.  No, I don't.  For an investigation, yes, you do.  Suspicion of a crime or body committed a crime or have committed a crime.  Not on 1.151.  I'm an activist.  And you know I don't have to give you my information.  I see.  You know I don't have to give you my information.  So all that.  First of all, you have to put your name for the form.  No, I don't.  No, they asked me to leave and I left.  I know the law.  I'm very well versed in the law.  They told me to leave and I left.  So that's my warning.  I'm very versed in the law.  They want to put you in a system.  so when we have to deal with you again, if we do, it's already there, sir.  Then that's when you get it.  If I break the law, that's when you get it.  No, we put it now.  I don't like giving my name to the government for nothing.  How do you get checks?  For pay, something like that.  I said for nothing.  For nothing, but for anything, right?  I don't like giving my information to the government just randomly.  Stop yelling at me.  I can yell.  I can talk.  freedom of speech.  I'm asking you to stop yelling at me.  Do you feel threatened?  I kind of do.  Okay, then you can go.  I can't go, honestly.  You can go.  Believe me, I wish I could.  Okay.  It would be a resolve issue.  Where's the sergeant?  I want to talk to the sergeant.  Call the sergeant.  He's coming to talk to you.  Because I'm being illegally detained right now.  Are you really?  Have you provided your name and your information?  I don't have to, and you know that.  That's why I'm not in cuffs.  That's why you're not taking me to... I'm not giving them my information.  It's not my headache, dude.  Okay.  Then why are you still here?  I'm trying to help them get the information they need.  Okay.  And I'm putting you in a system myself for a contact.  And you don't want to do that.  No.  You want to elevate it to somewhere else?  I'm not elevating it.  You're going to elevate it.  All you have to do is follow the law.  I am following the law.  No, you're going to follow 901.151.  Follow penal code 901.151.  Follow penal code 901.151.  You know what that states, right?  What crime have I committed?  well you were causing a disturbance.  i didn't call the disturbance they did.  they asked me to leave and i got up.  i followed their rules.  okay but no that's not how the law works.  you're not in my law like okay so why are you trying to force me to give them my information when i don't have to.  She can just put a good citizen.  Good citizen?  Did you say good citizen?  Good citizen.  Okay.  So when the police get involved, I can identify you for purposes?  No.  Yes.  Not unless you suspect me of committing a crime.  Well, I can suspect you of creating a disturbance on a train.  No.  Yes, I can.  You can.  I didn't.  According to me, I didn't.  So their word is more powerful than mine?  You wouldn't tell me the story.  I actually wouldn't.  I'm telling you now, I didn't create a disturbance.  I'm telling you now, I didn't create... There's no explaining.  Explain.  I don't... Okay, the explanation is, the explanation is, I did not cause a disturbance.  The explanation is, they asked me, they asked me, they asked me to get off the train.  I complied.  Why did they actually get off the train?  Because they don't like the shoes I wear.  That wasn't important to them?  You were playing loud music.  They lied to you.  Okay, so I'm asking you to explain that to them.  Yeah, they don't like the shoes I'm wearing.  So that's the reason they didn't like the shoes you were wearing.  They didn't like your black Reeboks that you were wearing.  and that had them put you off the train as a conductor as well?  Right.  So if I take a sworn statement from both of them, they're fine?  You can do what you want to do.  They can lie on a sworn statement.  Okay.  Here's the starting.  You can talk to them.  You want to start?  We're good.  We're good.  You want to talk to them?  I shake your hand, Sergeant.  So you're not going to shake my hand, Sergeant?  You're not going to shake?
