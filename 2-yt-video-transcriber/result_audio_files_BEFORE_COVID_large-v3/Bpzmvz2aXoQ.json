I don't need your Trojan horse federal mandate to do something I already have the option to do.  So kick rocks.  First comes universal background checks.  Then when it does nothing because criminals buy their guns illegally, they'll say, well, we need a registry to enforce it.  Then when the registry doesn't work, because like we all know and have been studying and proven time and time again that criminals get their guns illegally, they'll say, well, that didn't work either.  So now we're just gonna have to turn in all your guns and we're gonna use the registry to get them because we know exactly where they are.  Congratulations.

You're literally proving the point I made about universal background checks.  You can't do it without a national gun registry.

Okay, Kamala, didn't know we could do that, thanks.  I wanna see the Kim Kardashian ass that she pulled the staff from because I hope she's not literally saying that 90% of all guns associated with a crime are sold by 5% of the gun dealers in this country.  What are you, having a stroke?  That's ridiculous.  How can 5% of 130,000 gun dealers be responsible for 90% of the guns that are involved in crimes?  Yes, there are corrupt license dealers that the ATF has proven have been only 8% of the majority.  So I don't know exactly what she's talking about.  But then again, I don't think she does either.  Real quick before you go, I want to talk about the guide I put together titled, If I Could Carry Only One Gun.  In this guide, I talk about which gun that would be and the reasons why.
