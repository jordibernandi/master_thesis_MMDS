            "text": "Outbreaks of measles have once again been prominent in the headlines.  From January 1st to February 21st, 159 cases of measles have been confirmed in 10 states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.  In 2018, 372 people with measles were reported from 25 states and the District of Columbia.  Most cases have been unvaccinated.  Measles outbreaks have been and continue to be a constant threat to the health of the American people.  With more than 50 cases of measles now confirmed in Washington state, there is a new push to change vaccination requirements.  Washington is currently one of 17 states that allow parents to refuse vaccines for philosophical reasons.  As Carter Evans reports, that could change.  Well, the World Health Organization states that in 2019, one of the top 10 threats is vaccine hesitancy.  Once declared eradicated in the United States, measles outbreaks are rattling regions of the country again this year.  There have been more than 200 confirmed cases in just the past few months, and many are in the Pacific Northwest, which prompted a state of emergency in Washington state.  It's also led to renewed concerns about pockets of unvaccinated children there and across the country.  Mandatory immunization of children would be the equivalent of communism.  Ashley, all the people rallying here oppose House Bill 3063 currently being heard in the legislature that would remove some of Oregon's vaccine exemptions.  As you can see behind me, a couple hundred people turned out, a lot of parents and their young children holding signs saying, protect our medical freedom and no on HB 3063.  Oregonians for Medical Freedom argues vaccine injury and adverse reactions affect thousands of families in Oregon.  Today, they're trying to raise awareness and encourage who they call victims of vaccine injury to share personal stories with legislators. ",

            "text": "Yet it is wrong to say that there are no risks to vaccines.  Even the government admits that children are sometimes injured by vaccines.  Since 1988, over $4 billion has been paid out from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.  Despite the government admitting to and paying $4 billion for vaccine injuries, no informed consent is used or required when you vaccinate your child.  This may be the only medical procedure in today's medical world where an informed consent is not required.  Now, proponents of mandatory government vaccination argue that parents who refuse to vaccinate their children risk spreading these disease to the immunocompromised community.  There doesn't seem to be enough evidence of this happening to be recorded as a statistic, but it could happen.  But if the fear of this is valid, are we to find that next we'll be mandating flu vaccines?  Between 12 and 56,000 people die from the flu or are said to die from the flu in America.  And there's estimated to be a few hundred from measles.  So I would guess that those who want to mandate measles will be after us on the flu next.  Yet the current science only allows for educated guessing when it comes to the flu vaccine.  Each year before that year's flu vaccine or strain is known, the scientists put their best guess into that year's vaccine.  Some years it's completely wrong.  We vaccinate for the wrong strain of flu vaccine.  Yet five states already mandate flu vaccines.  Is it really appropriate to mandate a vaccine that more often than not vaccinates for the wrong flu strain?  As we contemplate forcing parents to choose this or that vaccine, I think it's important to remember that force is not consistent with the American story, nor is force consistent with the liberty our forefathers sought when they came to America.  I don't think you have to have one or the other, though.  I'm not here to say don't vaccinate your kids.  If this hearing is for persuasion, I'm all for the persuasion.  I vaccinated myself.  I vaccinated my kids.  For myself and my children, I believe that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks, but I still do not favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security. ",

Today's comments come as Metro Vancouver is in the midst of a measles outbreak with 12 confirmed cases and more expected to follow.  When her now three-year-old son Reed was 14 and a half months old, Jennifer Petit thought he had come down with a cold.  Four or five days into it, he tried to stand up at the table and fell.  And then by the end of the night, he was completely paralyzed from the neck down.  So they took him to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with pneumonia.  But when they got back home, his symptoms worsened.  His cry was off.  He wasn't making tears.  He was sleeping a lot.  And it really literally felt like I was watching him die.  They returned to the hospital.  two to three days before they actually were able to diagnose it.  The diagnosis, acute flaccid myelitis, a mysterious, paralyzing illness that affects the nervous system, causing the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak.  The CDC says the number of cases are continuing to grow.  We have now confirmed 90 cases in 27 states, and there are an additional 162 cases that are awaiting confirmation or are under investigation.  The CDC says it's still not clear what is causing some children to lose the ability to move their face, neck, back, arms, or legs.  Acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, is a very serious but also a very rare condition.  Since 2014, when we first started tracking this phenomenon, we've observed that, on average, Less than one in a million children are affected by this condition.  Today, Reed can scoot on the floor, but must use a wheelchair to get around.  Reed's mom says doctors have told her Reed won't grow out of AFM, but should continue to improve, though they don't know by how much.  Nobody really knows.  I mean, there really is no prognosis for these specific kids.  Marina Hutchinson, the Associated Press. ",

The Democratic concern and the reason they liked.  what the president had to say on that front today is that, you know, they worry Republicans will go ahead and pass this one narrow bill and then say that they've done something, they've tackled the issue and move on.  And Democrats would rather try to hold them to some of these bigger promises that the president made, but that Republicans are still on the fence about.  Well, as you mentioned, the president sided with Democrats on many issues.  Do Republicans know what type of bill the president would be willing to sign at this point?  Not necessarily, because he has been known to change his mind before.  He has sort of publicly mulled over, for example, this notion of raising the purchasing age from 18 to 21 when it comes to semi-automatic weapons.  He's not hard and fast on that.  He could be talked out of it.  He's talked about arming teachers, but he hasn't said exactly what he would want to see on that front either.  So this is still a work in progress.  And what Democrats are watching to see is whether he stays with them on some of these issues.  They have seen situations in the past where he has sided with Democrats on issues like immigration and gotten such blowback from his base that he backed away from those positions a couple of days later.  It is very biblical to enforce the law.  That is actually repeated a number of times throughout the Bible.  But the separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close, and these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade, and the president is simply enforcing them.
