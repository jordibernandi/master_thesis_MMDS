            "text": "Trump.  What?  Trump.  Guys, welcome back to another episode of Atlas Survival Shelters and part two of I wore my MAGA hat through California airports.  Now guys, part three is going to be hilarious and it's going to show you that I can be a hypocrite because I'm going to wear an Obama 44 shirt hat.  and And this hat right here doesn't say make America great again, it says make Obama president again.  So I'm going to fool some damn people when I get on the plane.  But guys, these videos are made to be lighthearted, to give you a laugh and help make your day a little better.  But what it's not to do is to get some of the jerks that are in LA to get them pissed off.  You are going to see some violent jerk-offs in this freaking video here that go off on me.  And all I can say is, Los Angeles, you got some real winners here.  You know what?  It's really sad.  But guys, I hope you enjoyed part two.  I'll see you at the end.  guys guess where i'm at today lax airport los angeles california.  well we're gonna try to make it part two that i wore my mega hat to california airports and guess what i'm gonna pour it on by doing this.  that's right i wore my truck 45 shirt too.  that's a piss awesome liberal shit.  so guys i hope you enjoy this video.  i'll see you at the end.  All right, so those girls are watching part one video and that girl over there says I look like who?  Al Bundy.  I look like Al Bundy?  i'm not going to take that as a compliment.  i would take that as a compliment.  that show was popular back in the day.  oh god for you guys who do not know southwest airlines has open seating.  you can sit anywhere you want.  there's no assigned seating so i'm going to try to keep that seat right there empty with this.  Well, I made it to Dallas from LAX.  Let's see if I can get through the airport next.  Well, I made it to Dallas Love Field Airport.  Wait, where are we at?  Dallas Love Field?  Well, I made it to Dallas Love Field Airport without anybody killing me, but the lady behind me sure got the spikes on, don't she?  Don't run into me.  I think he likes my jacket.  Okay.  You know, when you come to Texas, you're kind of safe anyway.  So, guys, I'll see you on the next flight.  Great hat.  You like my hat?  What do y'all think?  Oh, it's a fine hat.  It's a fine hat.  So that's the hat I'm wearing, okay?  Didn't even have to say nothing.  They said it to me all on their own.  They're fly.  We got a nice flight attendant.  We got two pilots, too, this time.  Last time we only had one and a half.  One and a half.  This Southwest flight's going to be full because this nice lady sitting next to me, she likes my mega hat apparently.  I love it.  You love it?  Do you really?  I really do.  All right.  You see?  There's more mega hat lovers out there than people who hate it.  And the ones who hate it are so mean and nasty.  They're just so unhappy.  We made it to Los Angeles without anybody killing us, so our friend over here.  Hi, guys.  Let's make the American great again.  Well, that's a good closing statement, so we'll try to get out of LAX.  Well, I made it to LAX.  Y'all was stuck back there like three little pigs, right?  Huh?  Huh?  It was tough.  Y'all were tight squeezed in there, weren't you?  I tell you what, I felt them kicking around back there.  And that little fat neck ahead of me called me a shithead.  He goes, you're a piece of shit.  Yeah, that's what he said.  He said, you're a piece of shit for wearing Make America Great Again hat.  So anyway, guys, I hope you enjoyed this leg of the fight.  Well, I made it to LAX without anybody saying anything, but right here was where that lady with the green hair said, uh... You know how many children have died in the custody of Donald Trump, Savage?  But nobody did it today, and... Luckily, there ain't nobody behind me to kill me today.  So anyway, I'm just going to head out, grab me an Uber, and get to the hotel.  Well, we're on another leg of a flight.  We're flying from L.A.  to Calgary, Canada.  And I've got an aisle seat as that girl over there took my window.  Right, we robbed Calgary.  Nothing exciting, though.  All right, guys, so I'm on my next flight.  I'm going from Calgary to Regina.  Anybody on this flight for Trump?  Oh, crud.  They were supposed to yell yes.  When I'm watching a video of a guy watching a video of me.  So that's I wore my MAGA hat in California part one.  Y'all gonna watch it too?  Okay.  Damn Canadians will never fight back when you want them to.

We're going to America.  Are you?  I'm going to come back and I'm going to sell Make Canada Great Again hats.  I'm going to make a killing.  You'll buy two?  Alright.  Where are you all from?  We're from Winnipeg.  Winnipeg?  How about Make Canada Great Again?  Huh?  You can join the Make America Great Again movement.  We're in the line to go to the USA.  Get out of Canada.  Go back to America where we make it great again, huh?  Hey, I'm going to make Canada great again and bring them back here and sell them.  Do you want to order a couple now?  How much?  About 20 bucks.  It'll be worth it.  I don't know what the hell she said.  All right, guys.  Well, we made it back to the USA from Canada without anybody killing me with my MAGA hat on.  Now we just got to get to the airport and home and we're good.  Girl's digging my YouTube video right now.  I'm just chatting.  Are you?  All right.  Hey, make America great again, right?

They're not liberal enough sometimes, I swear.  I think this girl's trying to pick me up here, huh?  Okay, she likes my MAGA hat, so hey, there are some benefits to a MAGA hat now.  She actually got my YouTube channel number there.  Make America great again.  I'm on the elevator full of a bunch of Trump fans, so we're at LAX.  Huh?  No?  No.  So why are you shooting the finger at me?  Huh?  Why are you shooting the finger at me?  You don't like my hat?  What's the problem?  You.  Me?  All right.  You're the first one to say anything.  Have a good one.  Huh?  Have a good one.  All right.  Well, we arrived in Edmonton, and nothing dramatic on this one, except I got two empty seats.  The only reason I got them, because I saw three empty seats in a row, and I said, I'm taking one of them.  that's what i did.  so i'll see you guys in the airport.  guys i'm in edmonton canada so i made it here without anybody killing me as well.  so let's see how i do.  but i gotta go catch my next flight.  so i'm in uh edmonton canada and what?  what do you have to say about mega?  I don't know why you would wear a hat like that, actually, out of public.  Donald Trump is a male chauvinist pig, and you should actually be ashamed.  There's no way we need to have that garbage brought into Canada.  So you can go back to wherever you came from.  Oh, my God.  Okay, y'all saw that.  I wasn't expecting that.  We're glad I got rid of all them skin diseases I got.  Oh, oh, uh-oh.  Uh-oh, poor lady.  I'm next to a lady who's not a snowflake here in Canada.  So what do you think of our truck in your Trudeau?  Well, I could probably see a lot of things.  Okay, well, that's a compliment.  Okay, well, I'll try it.  All California government screwed up the Uber and Lyft system.  Used to be like a three, four minute wait.  Now you've got to wait hours in line to catch your cab or your Uber.  This has started today, October 29, 2019.  But look at these freaking lines over there.  I mean, it's hours of wait now to get a taxi or an Uber out of this freaking airport.  This is crazy.  Wow.  Typical Lyft cars in California have screwed this up too.  changing the uber and lyft system to where they can't pick you up at the airport.  they drop you off they give you a number and then you wait in freaking lines a mile long Trump what Trump?  why would you say that Trump hater?  huh yeah yeah then you hate America too huh.  well you're gonna be on YouTube buddy.  I got 1.5 million viewers.  you want to give us your name.  Yeah, the guy that your mom.  Get the out of my face, bitch.  Anyway, what an asshole.  There's plenty of them out there, that's for sure.  So guys, I hope you enjoyed that video.  It's fun making these videos.  And I do enjoy wearing my MAGA hat and getting all the thumbs up.  And I don't mind the opposite side having an opinion because we are all Americans and we should all love each other.  But guys, make sure you tuned in and watch me.  do Make Obama president again in my Obama 44 shirt hat because this is going to be fun.  So guys, as always, make sure you like and subscribe.
