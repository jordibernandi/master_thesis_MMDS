            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  Perhaps the most impressive case of a saint whose body was found to be incorrupt after he died is Saint Charbel Maclouf, okay?  Lebanese hermit, a holy man of God, part of the Maronite Church, Maronite Rite of the Catholic Church.  He died in 1898.  And after he died, for 45 days, people noticed lights over the place where he was buried.  Tons of people saw this, including unbelievers.  And so what they did is three months after he was buried, they assumed his body to kind of check out what was going on.  his body was found to be incorrupt and so they put his body in a kind of a coffin with a glass top and for 27 years people could come and visit and see the incorrupt body of Saint Charbel.  now what's so important about the example of Saint Charbel is His body and the phenomena was medically and scientifically examined repeatedly.  For example, in this article from CatholicTradition.org, it says the testimony of Dr.  George Shukrela, one of the most famous doctors of Lebanon, who examined the body 34 times over a period of 17 years.  So this is an example of one doctor who examined this phenomena 34 times over a period of 17 years.  And there was other doctors who examined the phenomena as well.  And there's documents written about their findings.  He says, I even consulted good doctors in Beirut and in Europe during my numerous voyages.  No one was able to explain the fact to me.  And he goes on to say, my personal opinion based upon study and experience is that the body is conserved by a supernatural power.  Now, part of the phenomena with Saint Charbel is that his incorrupt body would kind of sweat a kind of a blood-like substance, more of a clear type serum.  And it was so much so that they had to change the garments that the incorrupt body was wearing twice a week.  And they would use this, they would press claws against his body, and there was many cures and healings through his intercession.  Now you all remember, I hope you know, 2 Kings chapter 13, they were burying a man, a band of marauding Moabites came, they were afraid, so they threw the man's dead body into the tomb of Elisha.  and it says when the man came into contact with the body of Elisha he came back to life and stood up on his feet.  And this is one example from the Bible of the mystery of what we call sacred relics.  Do I understand this?  No.  It has to do with the theology of the body, the dignity of the whole human person, not just the soul.  I'm not going to get into big speech about this.  Anyways, when they began the process of investigating for the beatification of St.  Charbel, the church said you need to rebury his body so that later it can be exhumed according to the whatever the policies of the Vatican.  so they buried his body.  and then many years later in 1950 they found again this liquid coming out of the stone out of the wall behind which Charbel was buried.  and So they took his body out to see what was going on, why there was this flow.  And it turns out that he was continuing to exude this liquid.  And there was a lot of miracles at the time, especially in 1950 when this happened.  And then finally the body was officially exhumed.  I think it was 1952.  Found to be... perfectly incorrupt.  And again, there was a whole commission there to investigate.  They couldn't explain it.  He was beatified.  And then in 1906, it says here, Father Joseph Mafus, the postulator of the cause, certified that in 1965, the body of St.  Charbel was still preserved intact with no alteration.  In 1976, he again witnessed the opening of the grave.  This time the body was completely decomposed.  Only the skeleton remained of the great saint.  Now, some people don't understand, like, well, why would the saint only remain incorrupt for a number of years and then return to dust?  Two reasons, I think.  One is, it's kind of like when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.  Lazarus came back to life, but eventually he would have grown old and died like everyone else.  And So too, you know, when Jesus heals someone, eventually the person dies.  And so I think it's a sign to us that yes, every one of us is going to return to dust one day.  But it doesn't mean that life is over.  As Jesus promised us, he will raise us up on the last day.  And Saint Charbel is a wonderful sign of the resurrection of the body that we proclaim in the Apostles' Creed.  Viva Christore! ",
