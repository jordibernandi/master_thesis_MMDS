            "text": "Today I'm going to be speaking to you about what Jesus, what Yeshua wrote on the ground.  when the Pharisees came to Yeshua on the Mount of Olives, confronted Him and asked Him, this woman was caught in adultery.  Moses and the Torah says she must be stoned.  What do you say?  We'll find out what the context is and what Yeshua really wrote on the ground and what it means.  In order for us to fully understand this, we're going to have a look at the context of when this happened on the Mount of Olives.  It happened the day after the Great Eighth Day.  What is the Great Eighth Day?  That is the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles, Sukkot.  We read this in the book of John, Yohanan, chapter 7, verses 37 and 38.  On the last and greatest day of the festival, Yeshua stood up and said in a loud voice, Let anyone who is thirsty come and drink.  Whoever believes in me, as the scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from him.  So Yeshua proclaims this on the last great day of the Feast of Tabernacles.  And the day after, this is when the Pharisees confronted him.  And we read this in the book of John chapter eight, verses three and five.  And the scribes and the Pharisees, they brought unto him a woman taken in adultery.  And they said unto him, Master, this woman was taken in the very act of adultery.  Now Moses and the Torah command us that she must be stoned.  What do you say?  Yesterday you proclaimed yourself to be the Messiah.  You proclaimed yourself to be the fountain of living waters.  Now we're bringing you a woman a day after, and according to the law, the Torah of Moses, she needs to be stoned.  What do you say?  And Yeshua answers them with the word of God.  The Bible says that the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword.  Yeshua never argued with the Pharisees.  He never argued with Satan. ",

            "text": "And this is exactly how he responds to these Pharisees that confront him on the Mount of Olives the day after he proclaimed himself to be the fountain of living waters.  And he answers them with Moses, with the Torah.  They asked him about the Torah and he answers them with the Torah.  And here's what he answers them.  In Leviticus 20, verse 10, it says that if a man commits adultery with another woman, then the adulteress and the adulterer have to be there.  Now, the Pharisees, they only brought the woman.  So where is the man?  So already according to the Torah of Moses, they were wrong.  That's why they didn't have anything to answer him.  And then if we remember, he continues and he writes something on the ground and they keep on asking him and finally he answers them and he says, you without the sin, throw the first stone.  He was quoting from Deuteronomy chapter 19, verse 16 and 18, that if you bear false witness against your brother, What you have wanted to be done to him shall be done to you.  You, without the sin, throw the first stone.  He was quoting direct from the Torah, and the Pharisees knew what he was quoting from.  We see that Yeshua is writing something on the ground, and the Pharisees are looking at him, and it's almost, if you read your Bible, it's almost like he's ignoring them, but he's not.  He's writing something on the ground.  Now, in order to understand this, What he wrote on the ground, we must understand that everything in the Old Testament is a shadow of the new.  If Yeshua wrote something on the ground, it must be very important.  In order to understand and even find it in the Bible, we need to know the context.  And the context is that the day after the Feast of Tabernacle, when he proclaimed himself to be the fountain of living waters, that is when the Pharisees brought the woman to him on the Mount of Olives and said, this woman was caught in a very act of adultery.  Moses and the Torah, the law, say she needs to be stoned.  What do you say?  And he answers them from the Torah.  and then he writes something on the ground.  We find what he wrote on the ground in the book of Jeremiah, chapter 17, verses 13.  O Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they shall depart from me, and they shall be written on the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.  We understand what Yeshua wrote on the ground.  They have forsaken the fountain of living water.  He also proclaims himself deity over here in the book of Jeremiah.  We see the deity of Yeshua the Messiah that he's got.  So now we understand what Yeshua wrote on the ground.  Either we're going to be written in the Lamb's book of life and spend eternity with Yeshua, or those who reject the fountain of living water will be written on the earth.  And it's really a message for those who don't believe in Yeshua to come into faith now because the Bible is true.  And everything in the Old Testament is a shadow of the new.  And for those who believe in Yeshua to wake up and be prepared for His second coming because time is short.  If you remember, the Bible says, you without the sin, throw the first stone.  They began to leave one by one ashamed.  And that's exactly what it says in Jeremiah 17. that they leave one by one ashamed because they have forsaken the fountain of living waters. ",
