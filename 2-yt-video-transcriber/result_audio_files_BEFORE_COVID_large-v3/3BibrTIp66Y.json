Not simply due to the topic, but the seemingly unfeeling nature of the presenter.  The video comes from the Catholic podcast channel Wretched and is titled, though part of me can't quite believe that I'm saying this, How to Spank a Traumatized Child.  And I can't stress the content warning on this one enough.  If domestic abuse or violence against children is something that you find triggering, then please click away from this video.  My goal here is to educate as to the inherently abusive nature of Christianity.  I have no desire to cause anyone any undue harm in watching the following materials.  So with that stated, play the video. ",

Can you direct me to any resources, written or wretched, that can help us understand how to discipline a 7 to 12-year-old that have unfortunately gone through any type of trauma, abuse, or abuse earlier in their life?  I am really glad you're asking the question, Joe, because this is a tough one.  I suspect, I think that Joe and his wife are fostering kids.  They're maybe thinking about adopting kids.  And they want to be biblical.  They want to discipline the kids.  But here's the problem.  When a kid is traumatized, we think, and rightly so, that if we spank a child, the child is going to separate from us.  And that is indeed a consideration. ",

            "text": "If your main concern when physically hurting a child at any level, because that's what corporal punishment is, is how they will likely distance themselves from you, then you're not fit to be a parent or talk on the topic.  Corporal punishment is fundamentally abusive and cannot be administrated in any correct way to avoid said abuse.  And that's the sick irony here.  You pretend as if corporal punishment is something that can be considered as separate to abuse.  But it isn't.  It never has been.  It never will be.  Now I'd argue that whoever sent this letter in, given the context and understanding lended to said words by Todd Friel, should have any children currently under their guardianship taken away and should be barred from all forms of adoption or fostering.  Not because of some arbitrary quality of their persons, but because they are displaying the desire to adopt, only to actively abuse said children.  When you beat a child, you teach them two things.  First of all, you teach them that physical violence can be loving.  Second, you teach them that said violence is an effective means of controlling people.  It's a small step from physically hurting a child to teach them a lesson, to them physically hurting their future partner to teach them a lesson.  Nothing good has ever come from child abuse. ",

            "text": "Remember, traumatized kids, whether you want to call it RAD or not, reactive attachment disorder, there's also failure to thrive, post-traumatic, I think they're calling it infantile post-traumatic stress disorder.  Kids who were put up for adoption, they were in foster homes, they were mistreated and abused, they were traumatized as a child.  And they don't trust adults.  They don't bond to adults because they fear.  if they do that, then those people can break their heart the way that it was shattered into a million pieces when they were in a crib.  That is the core of the issue.  That a child who has been abused... is hoping, longing, wanting mommy and daddy to answer their cries, to hold and to snuggle and to console and to soothe and to feed and to change.  They're longing, longing, longing for it.  It doesn't happen.  And they are absolutely devastated.  Now, innately, they think, if I desire that type of relationship again, I'm going to experience the same pain again.  They cannot articulate this.  When you ask one of these kids who has RAD, what do you think?  I don't know.  And they don't.  Why do you do that?  I don't know.  And they don't.  They don't know.  They can't articulate it.  Maybe years later they can.  There is hope.  I saw the story again of a young lady.  She was wicked awful.  Woo!  If I recall the details, she was a foster kid, and this girl was just flat out.  Today she's a nurse, and she's trying to help our AD kids.  there's hope, but it is very difficult because of the bonding issue.  They fear, profoundly fear that if I desire to be loved again, consider the implications for that.  If I desire to be loved again, I'm going to feel that pain again.  So the last thing I'm going to do is desire to be loved.  So what does this child do?  They seek to do everything to separate themselves from their new adoptive parents, their foster parents.  and they will destruct, they will disrupt, they will do anything necessary to push them away.  They do not want that parenting bond because they're horrified of it.  Enter the Christian parent.  They want to be biblical and do what the Bible says without caveats.  There are no caveats in the Bible.  The corporal punishment is, I should say, corporal discipline is a more precise word, is biblical, and it's replete throughout the Proverbs, and there's no caveat that says, unless, of course, this.

            "text": "Actually, the Bible is very clear that capital punishment is the proper punishment.  Leviticus chapter 20 verse 9 reads as quote, A sentiment repeated in Proverbs.  chapter 20 verse 20 with the poetic flair in quote, If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.  End quote.  But just in case that left any doubt, we have Jesus himself apparently speaking in Matthew chapter 15 verses 4 to 11, which read as quote, \"'For God said, Honor your father and mother, and anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to  death.'.  But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is devoted to God, they are not to honor their father or mother with  it?'.  Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.  You hypocrites!  Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you.  These people honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.  They worship me in vain.  Their teachings are merely human rules.  Jesus called the crowd to him and said, Listen and understand, what goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles  them.\".  End quote.  So you're not only trying to trivialise your support of child abuse by changing corporal punishment to corporal discipline, softening the term for the listener, but you've already chosen to ignore the fact that the Bible very clearly lays out capital punishment for troubled children, whilst fighting adamantly for corporal punishment.  So if you've already ignored one part, why not ignore the other part?  It seems a little selective to stick by one whilst pretending the other doesn't exist.  It seems to suggest that deep down you lack the desire or conviction to stand with Biblical teaching, instead you want to use religion as an excuse to abuse children.  Which is fucking sick.  I don't get how else to describe it.  So, sick will have to do for now.  But trust me, it's going to get a whole lot worse as the video progresses. ",

            "text": "So you have the challenge, Joe, or you if you have adopted or foster a child, to rightly initiate corporal discipline.  Now, there are some things to be remembered here when you're dealing with the adopted kid or the foster kid.  If you spank them, they are like, oh good, I'm safe from them.  Why would they get that impression?  Is it because of the paddle or is it because of the paddler?  And I would suggest to you.  it's the latter.  If you're not applying discipline, which is discipleship, lovingly, calmly, rightly, and never in anger, They aren't going to get that sense that you're being cruel to them and that they are successfully disrupting the potential bond between the two of you.  They won't get that if you're doing it rightly.  So the only advice that I'm aware of, I haven't seen anybody that's written anything on this.  I suspect I might be.  Maybe I've got a bunch of stuff in the queue, but I would like to get to this someday.  I'm not aware of anything.  that is out there that deals with this issue in any helpful sort of way in enduring and understanding it.  So I can't recommend anything, but I recommend this.  Set up the rules for your corporal discipline.  Explain it to your foster or adopted children lovingly, Here's why we're doing this.  Here are the lines.  Don't let them be arbitrary.  One day it's this, the next day it's that.  Stick to your own rules, explain it to them in advance, and then carrying it out when you are calm and not furious.  If you do it in anger, if you don't do it lovingly, then you are indeed giving the child exactly what they're looking for, and that is separation from you.  But if you love on them, hold them, hug them, Maybe cry with them, although a lot of RAD kids won't cry.  They don't feel the pain sometimes.  But if you are sensitive and loving in that instance, then you've got to do what the Bible says you've got to do.  Just follow the rules. ",

            "text": "There's no such thing as a loving way to beat your child.  And this is a problem at the very core of the Christian doctrine, the idea that violence can be an act of love towards the victim.  It can't.  It doesn't matter whether it's eternal torture, caning a child, or giving your wife a black eye.  These are all fundamental symptoms of the same warped perspective of love.  Abuse is not love, and it's sick of you to even suggest that.  All you will do by pretending that your violence is love is create future abusers.  There is no excuse for this.  The destructive impact that this will have on any child, let alone a child with prior history of abuse, is massive, and I know what's coming, oh well, I grew up with corporal punishment and it never did me any harm.  You forgot the fact that you think beating a child is okay.  This is why sexual and domestic violence is so rampant.  It's beaten into us, rather literally in some cases, that this is a normal avenue for love.  It's not, it's sick, it's wrong, and all of those involved need to face prosecution.  This show has 184,000 subscribers, and its host is openly promoting child abuse, and no one's calling him out on it. ",

            "text": "And by the way, quite honestly, those rules apply even if your child isn't adopted.  That's just the way you've got to do it.  You've got to do it that way.  Now, there's some people who've got even more unique challenges.  If you've got a child who has special needs, well, now what do you do?  Well, it needs to be communicated at that level where they can understand it.  But even then, some sort of corporal discipline should be happening.  Please keep in mind, for some kids it's more than others.  And I do believe, and this is a careful biblical counseling consideration, sometimes We can look at a situation and consider extenuating circumstances to potentially moderate our response.  For instance, your child is very, very, very sensitive and gets very distraught and sometimes angry if they see violent things.  Okay, so your kid comes home from school and he's being really naughty.  What's up, son?  Well, it turns out that during the day in one of their classes, as far too many teachers do these days, they show them movies.  So they showed the kid Saving Private Ryan and it agitated him.  Now he comes home and he's sinning all over the place because of it.  What do you do?  Well, it depends on what your rules are in advance, but the sin is still his.  And yet you go, but I understand why.  And it can moderate your response to that.  And the same thing is true with a special needs child.  You can moderate your response because it could be their organic problem and challenge that is causing that.  Nevertheless, they're still responsible for it.  So moderate, think about the correct response, do it lovingly without yelling, no matter what sort of child you have.  Doesn't matter, IQ or otherwise, behavioral issue or otherwise, be super loving about it.  And remember, some of them, it doesn't take much.  It could just be a scowl, frankly, that wilts them.  and apply it biblically and lovingly because it is commanded and it is a part, not of discipline per se, but discipleship.  You don't do your kid a favor when you never do that. ",

What can I say to that outside of reiterating my utter disgust at the fact that people like this not only exist, but they're incredibly popular in Christian circles?  Todd is not only warping the definition of love to include physical violence, but is willing to do mental backflips to shirk God's responsibility if they do exist.  Oh yes, it's the disabled child's sin, ignoring the fact that according to the Christian doctrine, their disability is entirely God's decision.  So any impact this has on their behaviour is by proxy God's choice.  And I honestly don't know what's worse here, the fact that they support corporal punishment, or the fact that they're remaining incredibly vague about what it encompasses.  He's very clearly taking active steps to avoid noting what corporal punishment is.  It's physically harming someone in order to try and teach them a lesson, very often via beating.  But there are also other means to do so, each one more abhorrent than the last.  We've had countless children die as a result of so-called biblical parenting.  And this man is supporting the system which allows for that.  Sure, he says moderate, don't do it out of anger, he says do it out of love.  But who decides what is moderate and what isn't?  Who decides what's anger and what's self-righteousness?  Who decides what is love and what's abuse?  The vagueness in his talking points not only prevents a detailed critique, it jeopardises the child of every Christian parent listening in.  So how do you properly beat your child?  Don't.  How do you properly beat your previously abused or disabled child?  Don't you fucking dare.  And there's not a whole lot more I can say on the matter, to be honest.  Though, what do you guys think?  Should people forwarding corporal punishment be held responsible for the dead children at their door?  Is there anything that I missed that you picked up on?
