If I may, Mr.  Chairman, on Senator Schatz's question of you, Mr.  Attorney General, I'm really surprised by the answer because the Supreme Court did uphold the law, the ACA, and now the Attorney General is saying we will not defend it regardless.  It seems to me that that's a problem, that if something is duly passed and upheld as legal that the Attorney General has a duty to defend it. ",

And Chief Justice Roberts' opinion said that it can be upheld as a tax, even though it couldn't otherwise be upheld.  But for finding it a tax, you would have had five votes against it.  Once the penalty was removed, the financial penalty was removed, that provision could no longer be justified as a tax, which means that it would have to fall.  So the mandate fell.  mandate, in my opinion, I don't think it's even a close question, the mandate was unconstitutional because it can no longer be upheld as a tax.  Then the question becomes if the mandate falls even though there was no penalty attached to it, what's its impact on the rest of the statute?  Four of the justices in the NFIB felt that the whole statute had to fall.  So, as I said before you arrived, Senator, At the end of the day, I felt that this was a defensible legal position to take.
