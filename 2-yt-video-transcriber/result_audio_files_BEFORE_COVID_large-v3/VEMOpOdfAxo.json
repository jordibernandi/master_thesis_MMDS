            "text": "Liberals.  Liberals.  Liberals.  Liberals.  Liberals.  Man, frig these guys.  Always doing the most annoying and useless stuff.  What the frig is this?  You have a donor or a day fund me?  What's your name?  Uh, my name is Peter Dennis.  And why'd you donate to the Peacemaker fund me?  I just thought this was a delicious idea.  I mean... Let them eat cake, you know?  This is just beautiful.  This is democracy in action.  I love it.  Thank you.  Thank you so much and thank you for donating.  Why are you doing that?  The world is on fire.  You're making cakes to give to the oligarchs that are against the already useless thing that you want?  You're not going to give the cakes to the oligarchs that you like?  You're giving them to the ones that you don't like?  The ones that are going to... so easy to be mad at them.  They're so frustrating.  How is it possible to be so pleased with yourself when your protest is just to make cake for your millionaire enemies?  Oh, thanks, sir.  I couldn't afford a $10 sheet cake.  That's going to make me reconsider whether that one war criminal is allowed to testify against that other war criminal.  The goals and methods of liberals are clearly counter to those of us on the left.  They don't want to destroy capitalism.  They want to reform it.  They don't believe in direct action.  They believe in appealing to the state, and in some cases, capital directly, to fix problems on their behalf.  You don't go out and feed the homeless.  That's a band-aid solution.  That's not going to fix anything.  You urge city council to set aside some funds to create an exploratory committee to make a scientific and evidence-based solution to homelessness without addressing its root cause of poverty so that policymakers can ignore your suggestions and nothing changes, but you did waste a lot of time and money and energy.  That's how you get things done.  kids.  But are liberals the enemy of the left?  I do not think that they are.  Now let me be very, very transparent about one thing though.  Liberalism is absolutely an enemy of the left.  Liberalism is not a person, it's a philosophy.  That's the thing that sucks.  I don't think that the people who believe it, at least not all of them, are our enemies.  The majority of them are part of the working class that we hope to liberate.  This might seem like a pointless distinction.  Stick with me.  There's a confusing logic that a lot of leftists seem to hold.  Sorry, you know what?  That's a little too vague.  I should say, a lot of leftists who exclusively exist on Twitter seem to hold.  You know exactly the type of asshole I'm talking about.  People with usernames like Mock No Tits, whose avatar is some Nazi meme.  they've MS-painted to have the YPG flag in the background.  Weirdos who base the majority of their political outlook on a mod they installed in Hearts of Iron IV.  That type of person.  According to these extremely online left-lords, the bourgeois state and capital spend an enormous amount of resources to brainwash people into accepting capitalism, imperialism, and white settler colonialism, silencing or criminalizing any voices that present an alternative.  But also, anyone who doesn't innately recognize the evils of those systems is bad and a deficient person.  Now, I agree with the first part.  Obviously.  I've discussed in the past how liberalism limits people's imagination to the narrow confines of what capital decides are the allowable political positions.  Sherlock Gnomes Chomsky did it way better than me, and has been doing it for a long time.  Take it away, Chompo! ",

            "text": "To start with, they're two different groups.  We can get into more detail.  But at the first level of approximation, there's two targets for propaganda.  One is what's sometimes called the political class.  There's maybe 20% of the population, which is relatively educated, more or less articulate.  They play some kind of role in decision-making.  They're supposed to sort of participate in social life, either as... managers or cultural managers like say teachers writers and so on.  they're supposed to vote.  they're supposed to play some role in the way economic and political and cultural life goes on.  now their consent is crucial.  one group that has to be deeply indoctrinated.  then there's maybe eighty percent of the population whose main function is to follow orders and not to think, you know, and not to pay attention to anything.  And they're the ones who usually pay the cost. ",

            "text": "But I don't think that falling into the liberal mind prison is a sign of moral deficiency or bad critical thinking skills so much as it's a sign of the effectiveness of the conditioning that the state and capital use.  It's very tempting to look at libs doing lib shit and see how naive and embarrassing it is and conclude that they must not be as smart as I am.  I believe the good smart things.  I must be better than they are.  Which, you know, starts to get into some dangerous territory.  I don't think you can dismantle authority and hierarchy, and also believe in your own superiority.  I don't think that leftists are smarter or better than non-leftists, as much as we like to feel like we are sometimes, and as much as we like to act like we are sometimes.  Imagine thinking one person is superior to another when all of us are just insects on this dung heap we call a universe.  A fungus.  Rot to be cleansed by the gaze of distant eyeballs.  Hello and welcome to the Eyeball Zone.  Here in the Eyeball Zone, we signal boost small leftist projects, trapping them for all eternity in a prison of their own making.  If you're going to talk to liberals about socialism, you're going to hear the same thing over and over.  Communism killed 100 million people.  Communists killed 200 million people.  Communists killed a million billion people.  Communists killed everybody that has ever lived or will ever live.  Vicky1999 has you covered.  Her video, The Real Death Toll of Communism, and its companion piece, The Real Death Toll of Capitalism, goes into some of the creative math that was used to arrive at all sorts of bogus-ass numbers.  Especially the 100 million figure that the Black Book of Communism pushed.  That book is bad.  A lot of the data and arguments in this video are indispensable when addressing these talking points, and the video makes no apologetics for the actual crimes of so-called socialist governments.  Do you have a project you'd like to see featured here in the Eyeball Zone?  Send me no more than one email with the word eyeball somewhere in the subject line.  Please include pertinent details, like your pronoun, and maybe you will find yourself consumed by eyeballs.  Hey, raise your hand if you, at some point, were a liberal.  What happened?  Did you just get smarter?  Did you become a more caring person and immediately reassess your entire worldview?  Did you intuit all of your current politics?  Did you sit down one day and say to yourself, you know, now that I think about it, labor is entitled to the full value of that which it creates.  I doubt it.  I think what's more likely is you read something, or you watched something, or you had a conversation with somebody and that changed your mind.  Maybe some of you were already primed for that type of conversion from bad work experiences or having experienced poverty at some point in your life, but at some point you needed somebody else to walk you through why exactly that was happening to you and what we ought to do about it.  Socialists aren't born, we're converted.  It is a testament to the power of our ideas that despite centuries of demonization, despite a hostile and pervasive mass media working to undermine us, despite an education system designed from the ground up to produce docile and obedient workers, our ideas remain popular.  But liberal ideas, which don't face those obstacles and are instead strengthened by those things, are understandably far more popular.  It's a lot easier to get someone to agree with you if they've had a lifetime of conditioning to accept your position.  Who are you going to believe?  The lifetime of teachers, professors, and news broadcasters saying one thing?  The people I will collectively refer to as the TED Talk class?  Or the guy on YouTube who rambles about the evils of the bourgeoisie without being able to spell the word bourgeoisie?  Who seems more credible?  Are you going to risk listening to the communoids when everybody tells you, hey, if you let those guys take control, they're going to starve everybody and we're all going to have to wear ugly gray jumpsuits.  They're so dangerous, we can't let you go to the doctor anymore because that might be socialism.  We're simply not sure.  If you're starving now, though, that's your fault.  The government can't help people get food.  That would be socialism, which causes people to starve.  You have to starve to prevent starvation.  100 million people.  And all of those socialist countries are so poor.  They're no poor non-socialist countries, and it has nothing to do with any third party coming along, blockading, bombing, or sanctioning those countries into oblivion.  It's because they don't have freedom, which is a measure of GDP per capita, meaning that Qatar has the most freedom and Burundi has the least, and is therefore the most socialist.  We're fighting an uphill battle.  We're fighting an uphill battle, and we are vastly outnumbered.  I don't care what poll you're going to pull out of your pants.  that shows the people are warming up to the idea of socialism or whatever.  Who the fuck knows what people being polled think socialism even is anymore?  When everything from single-payer healthcare to food stamps to gender-neutral washrooms to fire departments is being labeled as socialist, it's going to appeal to a wider range of people than those who are on board with revolution.  Show me a poll that asks people, hey, should the workers rise up and seize the means of production from the owning class and distribute what they produce freely to all who need it?  And I'm going to guess you're going to see a much lower number.  I don't say this to discourage you.  I think that socialism has definitely gotten more popular in the past 10 years.  I think that the stigma of calling oneself socialist has more or less evaporated, thanks in no small part to Bernard Hussein Sanders, who often claims to be a socialist despite, you know, Thank you.
