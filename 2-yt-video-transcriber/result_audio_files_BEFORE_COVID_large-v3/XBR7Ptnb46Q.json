            "text": "What's happening fam?  LAR movement still moving.  Book is entitled Lessons from a Non-Custodial Father at Amazon, Kindle, and CreateSpace.  Link will be in the description box below as usual.  Go get it.  PayPal link.  They also asked me to put it up, so I put it up.  Thanks everybody for supporting.  But this video though, this video is entitled Gabrielle Union and Dwayne Wade's son.  So, you know, they got in the news where Gabrielle Union supports Dwayne Wade's son at Miami Pride.  I got an issue with this.  Ain't my family, really ain't my business.  I'm using this as a proxy.  Here's a problem.  Number one, that's not your son.  That's your stepson.  That's not your son.  Um, because, because how people do things in this society, I would not be shocked if this was done without their actual mother's knowledge.  And she just found out, uh, social media that's on that side because this is how people operate.  I could be wrong but this I know people operate.  but the reason I say that is because of this one thing.  if I'm not mistaken his son is 11. when an 11 year old is coming out 11 year old boy is just coming out all of a sudden just so how long has he been what he's been this way since he was six seven eight nine or ten like you know because it the way i think.  Because I remember, you know, Dwyane Wade, you know, and the NBA be dressing out, they be dressing all funny.  He was wearing the same clothes Gabrielle Union was wearing.  So I got to, you know, do you realize?  it makes me think that in some ways she was kind of pushing the kids towards a gay lifestyle?  Because He's 11.  Like what do you want?  Like at nine years old, eight, nine years old.  Daddy, I want to have a boyfriend when I grow up.  Like I'm, I'm, I don't just saying, just saying it just don't add up to me.  The other thing is because that's, that parade is really for adults.  See, if your stepmama brings you to something that's considered pride and you're a child and the pride parade is actually for adults.  She better not have never said one word about R. Kelly.  Not one.  now the other thing i have an issue with this is what happens is i doubt i could be wrong but i doubt that she had a child or two kids now.  Ah, but let's see if her kids wind up, her biological kids wind up at the Pride parade at 11.  Let's just, let's just see.  See how that one works.  You know, time will tell.  Just don't see it though.  You know, which is part of the issue.  that I'm like, you know, and even if I'm completely wrong on everything I'm saying, you don't take your stepchild out and use your celebrity to put them out there.  Like, like take them out of the closet publicly as a child.  You don't, that's bad taste.  Even if that's what the young boy wanted to do that.  Look, if you want to go.  First of all, I wouldn't have took no kid to no damn pride parade.  Miami Pride, whatever the hell it was.  I wouldn't have took no kid.  Period.  That's just bad parenting.  I'm sorry.  But at the same time, I wouldn't have took it publicly.  and I'm looking at this article that the way way was in Toronto at a game when they did this so either he was in on it he knew or it was one in situations where he's a celebrity You know, and he just had to just eat that one and make it look, you know, okay on television.  You know, but they said, you know, he said he wished he was there.  But it's weird to say, you know, your dad's going to work and I'm going to take you to the pride parade.  See, that don't, you know.  it don't make sense and this is a major problem in society because I know there's the stories of the ways ex-wife being crazy and you know those stories.  she lived up to some of that.  but this right here If five, ten years from now, her and Gabrielle Union get to a fight and she beat the bricks off of Gabrielle Union, it's going to be because of this stuff.  Because... That's probably not what she would have done.  And she's his mother.  You know?  That's disrespectful to their mother.  You know?  Like... You made a unilateral decision with a child.  that's not really yours.  You know, it's yours as a stepchild.  I get that.  But that whole process don't even seem right.  Dad's not there.  Mom's not there.  Stepmom takes you there.  And then post it in his national news.  Now, here's my, just, just, just, just, just.  Let's reverse this.  You know, ladies, if you're in there.  If you had a boyfriend, if you had a husband.  And you had children prior to you getting married.  And you're 11 year old.  You go to work and your husband takes your 11-year-old to the pride parade and posts it and it goes viral nationally.  And your ex-husband finds out via the news.  Now, would you have an issue with your husband doing that with his stepchild?  And would your ex-husband have an issue with your current husband doing that with his stepchild at 11 years old?  Because what it's going to allude to is this.  Wait, wait, wait.  What exactly are y'all teaching these kids about sexuality in the household?  to have them at 11 be at the proper rate?  What exactly has been going on here?  Because... Somebody's gonna ask this question.  Are you wait wait?  Have you been grooming these kids?  See this is why I don't like Some of this androgynous culture Because that's what it's about.  this is really about grooming Boys to be girls and girls to be boys, you know, it's normal.  and No, it's not.  Like we're built differently.  We think differently.  We have different purposes.  You know, we're not built to be the opposite.  We're built to be what we are.  So, you know, the issue is like, what are you, what is it?  What kind of goal are you accomplishing?  And because they're black boys, This is, you know, is this part of feminism?  Is this what y'all want to do now?  You know, I want men to think and be like girls.  That's what we're doing.  I'm just asking.  Like, because this don't look right.  Just in my opinion.  I'm out.
