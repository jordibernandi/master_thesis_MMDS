And my friend was absolutely convinced that the Bible teaches there was no rain before the flood.  That would mean that there's no rainbows before the flood either.  First of all, let's start with.  where does this idea come from?  Is there a verse in scripture that might give us this idea? ",

And we go to Genesis 2, though, it talks about how God watered the garden with a mist.  If you actually look at the original Hebrew, they got two words for liquid precipitation, ed and matar.  One means relatively large drops of water falling from the sky, what we would call rain.  The other is what we would call mist, tiny drops of water.  But guess what?  You get a rainbow with both.  If you've got a fog or a mist or just tiny drops of water, you'll get a rainbow just as effectively as you will if you've got big drops of water coming from the sky. ",

It's not necessarily saying that this applied to the entire planet.  It's focusing on the earth of the Garden of Eden.  And I believe that the location of the Garden of Eden is probably somewhere in the southeastern portion of what is now the Persian Gulf.  That's a place where you don't get rain like you do in coastal British Columbia.  But you do get fog, you do get mist.  And it also talks about water coming up from below, the underground aquifers.  That's all there in the text.  But my point is you're gonna get rainbows either way.  Moreover, there's another biblical principle.  What you see in Genesis chapter 9, God tells Noah, when you see the rainbow, this will be a sign of the covenant agreement between the two of us.  And what you notice in all the rest of the covenant agreements that God makes with humanity, he always appeals to something known in the natural realm to sign the covenant agreement, which would imply that Noah must have been familiar with the rainbows before the flood, not just after ",

Another good biblical text to go is Job 37 and Job 38, because there it speaks in detail about the water cycle that God set up for the earth.  and mentions, in terms of liquid precipitation, it's going to be rain and mist and fog.  So it's basically making a point.  there are different kinds of liquid precipitation, just like there are different kinds of frozen precipitation, you know, the snow and the frost and the hail. ",

We can actually see fossilized raindrops that date back more than two billion years.  So that tells us that rain's been falling throughout the whole history, or at least most of the history of the Earth.
