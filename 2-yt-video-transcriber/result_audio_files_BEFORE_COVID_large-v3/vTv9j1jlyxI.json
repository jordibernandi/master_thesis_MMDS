            "text": "All right there everyone, the Trump campaign forces Jimmy Kimmel to retract his using a long disproven lie for cheap laughs on his show.

All right, everyone, Jimmy Kimmel was in the news again, but not for anything exceptional.  Of course he wouldn't be.  No, instead the late night show host was actually forced to retract and apologize for lying to his audience this past Monday night.  Kimmel went on another one of his anti-Trump screeds, which is typical for him in late night television in general, which we'll get into in a moment.  And what he did is he actually told his audience a blatant and fallacious lie about President Trump.  Take a look. ",

Now, President Trump was reportedly golfing when they went in.  The raid started at 3.30 p.m According to his schedule, Trump was playing golf at his course in Northern Virginia Saturday until a little after 3.  Didn't make it back to the White House until 4.18.  But here's my bet on that.  I don't know, but there's no way the military told him what day this raid was happening, right?  Because he immediately would have tweeted, guess what's going on? ",

            "text": "I mean... Now the beauty of the Trump campaign is that they don't let left wing liberals who let's just say are not the best custodians of truth.  The Trump campaign does not let left wing liberals like Kimmel get away with this, okay?  So the campaign fired off a tweet demanding that Kimmel retract what was a proven blatant lie.  Apparently Kimmel was unaware that this lie was spread over the weekend by the White House photographer for former President Barack Obama.  Kimmel apparently got the misinformation from a Twitter post from the former White House photographer Peter Souza, who implied that the photo of Trump at the White House Situation Room during the raid had been staged for cheap publicity.  But obviously, unbeknownst to Kimmel, Souza had to later publish a retraction of his own And so the Trump campaign fired off a tweet taking Jimmy Kimmel to task.  Campaign communications director Tim Murdoch wrote, trying for a cheap laugh, Jimmy Kimmel Live last night repeated the long disproven lie that the president was golfing during the al-Baghdadi raid, a Twitter live pushed by Obama photographer Peter Souza.  And this, of course, prompted a number of supportive responses on Twitter, such as this one.  Jimmy should retract and correct his entire show.  It's not even entertaining.  None of the late night shows are anymore.  It's sad.  They used to give us a good laugh back when they were actually comical.  They've turned into nothing more than political shit shows.  No thank you.  Okay, or this one.  He isn't a comedian, but a propagandist.  Shame.  Well done, Dumpling88, right?  Whoever you are, that was very perceptive.  Jimmy Kimmel is not fundamentally a comedian.  He is fundamentally a left-wing activist disguised as a comedian.  And he's not that funny.  I can't remember ever laughing at anything he's ever said, except out of sheer mockery or embarrassment.  So The good news is that Kimmel was in fact forced to retract what he said and apologize on Wednesday night's show, that very few people watch.  We'll get into that in a minute.  But on Wednesday Night Show, I mean, he nevertheless admitted that he was wrong, and he hereby officially retracted and corrected his statement.  But then in typical Libby fashion, which media outlets, by the way, like Newsweek, the neo-Marxist propaganda machines like Newsweek, They celebrated and cheered Kimmel on as he went on to demand that Trump apologize for what Kimmel called a weird detailed lie that President Trump supposedly said to Kimmel.  And by the way, in logic, that's called a two-coke way.  A two-coke way was- I'm wrong, but so are you.  You did it too.  You did the same thing.  It's the language of children, right?  Which is what Kimmel is.  Thank you, Don Rickles.  He's an obnoxious child who couldn't argue his way out of a paper bag, hence why he's a leftist liberal.  And he went on to accuse Trump of telling thousands upon thousands of lies, which of course is mere hyperbole.  But then again, what is truth to a leftist?  Now, besides the fact that if I were Jimmy Kimmel, I wouldn't be holding my breath for President Trump's apology.  I think Kimmel is the last person Trump is going to apologize to.  But besides that, it's no secret that late night television ratings have been tanking.  over the last several years, right?  Even CNN, the clown news network has had to admit that.  Even CNN has had to admit that nobody watches late night television anymore.  They actually had an article that lamented the fact that even though the late night TV hosts are rightly roasting Donald Trump through this whole impeachment fiasco, or even though they're producing some really good material of supposed comedic value.  Nobody's watching.  A simple fact of the matter is the article makes clear that viewership for late night television has plummeted, particularly among the 18 to 49 year old demographic that's so coveted by advertisers.  So whether we're talking about Kimmel or Colbert or Jimmy Fallon of The Tonight Show, I mean, I know Jimmy Fallon is, you know, He's the most bearable of the three, but for heaven's sake, how far The Tonight Show has fallen from the once late great Johnny Carson.  I mean, ugh.  But let me give you a sense of just how bad things are for these late night clowns, okay?  As for the opening of this season, 2019, Kimmel's viewership is down 16% from where it was last year.  Okay, 16%.  It's even worse for Stephen Colbert.  This disgustingly obnoxious left-wing loon.  Colbert's viewership is down 30%.  So you got Kimmel down 16%.  You got Colbert down 30%.  Fallon, I mean, he's dropped a disastrous 33% compared to last year in the key 18 to 49-year-old demographics.  And this year's ratings drop for all the late night shows is actually part of a pattern of falling ratings from the previous year.  Every single one of the three late night shows experienced comparable declining viewership in 2018.  Gang, it gets even worse.  You ready for this?  Right now, as I speak, late night viewership for ABC, NBC, and CBS combined is barely breaking 6 million viewers, okay?  I'll say that again.  Late night viewership for ABC, CBS, and NBC combined is barely breaking 6 mil.  It's more like 4 or 5 mil.  Colbert gets about 2 million a night.  Kimmel and Fallon, they break a million a night.  Now, just to give you a sense of how far things have plummeted, right, for late night television, Jay Leno himself could score 6 million viewers in a single evening.  No problem.  No problem.  And before Leno, the late great Johnny Carson, right?  Johnny Carson alone could score 9 million viewers on a single night.  In fact, as I said, 20 million people watched his Tonight Show.  farewell.  I was one of them.  So things are so bad now that the total combination of all three late night shows, the total combination of viewership is basically what Jay Leno could get in a single night, right?  Or Carson.  But You know, no matter how bad they've plummeted in 2018, 2019, all signs suggest they're just going to continue to plummet.  They may not even be getting a million viewers in a few years.  And when all is said and done, I knew I'd get that.  They only have themselves to blame.  The dramatic drop in viewership is because of the radical partisanization.  I'm not speaking today.  Partisanization of all three networks.  Johnny Carson used to be able to make fun of both parties.  But again, in good fun, in tasteful and whimsical ways.  Look at what they're doing now.  They've all taken sides of one side of the political divide, right?  The highly liberal, cosmopolitan, urbanite side.  And so all three late night hosts now are all competing with each other in order to see how much of that single left wing elitist liberal cosmopolitan demographic they can get.  And it's just caused their shows to absolutely fall apart when it comes to the quality of their comedy and their cultural commentary.  It's just banal and predictable and obnoxiously woke.  So I, for one, am glad the Trump campaign fought back against Jimmy Kimmel in particular, and the really rather boring blas\u00e9 routines that pass for comedy on his show.  But regardless of whether he retracted it or not, his show's days are numbered.  Kimmel is but the latest example of the old adage that never fails to come true.  Get woke, go broke.
