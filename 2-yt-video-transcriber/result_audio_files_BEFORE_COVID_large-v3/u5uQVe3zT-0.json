            "text": "I think the relationship has been very good.  That's what I will say.  Oh, you really want me to discuss that now?  I do.  Everything is on the table.  Mr.  President, do you have any concerns about the Labor Secretary's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case?  I really don't know too much about it.  I know he's done a great job as Labor Secretary, and that seems like a long time ago.  But I know he's been a fantastic Labor Secretary.  That's all I can really tell you about it.  That's all I know about it.  What about the charges against Bob Kraft?  He's a friend of yours.  Well, it's very sad.  I was very surprised to see it.  He's proclaimed his innocence totally, but I'm very surprised to see it.  Have you spoken to Bill Barr about the release of the Mueller report?  Have you spoken to him about that?  No, I have not.  You've said nothing to him about it?  I have not.  Do you expect to?  At some point, I guess I'll be talking about it.  But you know the nice part?  There was no collusion.  There was no obstruction.  There was no anything.  So that's the nice part.  There was no phone calls, no nothing.  We have a \u2014 I won a race.  You know why I won the race?  Because I was a better candidate than she was and had nothing to do with Russia.  And everybody knows it's a hoax.  It's one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on this country.  So I look forward to seeing the report.  If it's an honest report, it will say that.  If it's not an honest report, it won't.  Yeah, go ahead.  You've been at this and your teams have been at this trade deal for a long time.  Yeah, well, it's not a long time.  when you consider it's probably the biggest deal ever made.  It seems like it's getting close to the finish line.  At this point, can you boil it all down?  Do you believe it's more likely that a deal does happen or a deal doesn't happen?  Well, I think I can speak for the United States.  The question is an interesting one.  Is it more likely that a deal happens or doesn't happen?  Speaking for the United States, I would say it's probably more likely that a deal does happen.  But that doesn't mean it's going to happen.  Speaking for China, if you'd like to answer that question, you can.  But I would say that it's more likely that a deal will happen.  The fact that they're staying \u2014 and this is a very high delegation.  This is a man who is revered all throughout China as the vice premier.  So the fact that they're willing to stay for quite a bit longer period, doubling up the time, that means something.  I think there's a good chance that it happens.  Go ahead.  Would you like to answer that?  Wait.  Would you like to answer that question?  So from China, we believe it is that.  You have to speak louder.  I'm sorry.  From China, we believe that it is very likely that it will happen, and we hope that ultimately we'll have a deal.  And the Chinese side is ready to make our utmost effort.  I think we both feel that way.  I think we both feel that there's a very good chance that the deal will happen.  Mr.  President, on troops in Syria, why are you reversing course?  The President I'm not reversing course.  I have done something that nobody else has been able to do.  In another short period of time, like hours, you'll be hearing hours and days.  You'll be hearing about the caliphate.  It's 100 percent defeated.  Nobody has been able to say that.  That doesn't mean there aren't some very bad people walking around.  strapping on bombs and all of these things, but we've done a job that nobody else has been able to do.  I heard Lindsey Graham this morning congratulating me on having defeated the caliphate.  And, frankly, I'm getting a lot of congratulations.  At the same time, we can leave a small force, along with others, in the force, whether it's NATO troops or whoever it might be, so that it doesn't start up again.  And I'm okay.  It's a very small, tiny fraction of the people we have.  And a lot of people like that idea, and I'm open to ideas.  But the 2,500 people that we've had there will be going to different parts of the world.  They may be going over to Iraq, where we have a very powerful base.  a base that cost billions of dollars to build, frankly, and that we'll be using.  But we have had tremendous success in defeating the caliphate, and now everybody is admitting.  I did more in the last three or four weeks than people have done in years, and it's been very successful.  But we want to make sure it stays that way.  Yes, please.  The Press.  Thank you.  Tech transfers, going back to the trade deal.  The Press.  I'm afraid that you haven't made a whole lot of progress on the tech transfers.  The President Do you want to talk about the transfer tech?  The Press.  Does that still have to be done?  The President.  Yeah, I'll let Bob answer that.  Go ahead, Bob.  The President.  The answer is yes.  It's one of the structural issues.  It has to be done properly.  And we've made a lot of progress on it.  But whoever told you we weren't just didn't know what they were talking about.  Mr.  President, why haven't you condemned the North Carolina election fraud?  This is a big story.  The Republican candidate is calling for a new election.  Why have you not condemned that, given you condemn other kinds of fraud?  Well, I condemn any election fraud.  And when I look at what's happened in California with the votes, when I look at what happened, as you know, there was just a case where they found a million fraudulent votes.  When I look at what's happened in Texas, excuse me, excuse me.  When I look at what's happened in Texas, when I look at that catastrophe that took place in Florida, where the Republican candidates kept getting less and less and less and less.  Unfortunately, Rick Scott and Ron ended up winning their election, but it was disgraceful what happened there.  So I look at a lot of different places all over the country.  I condemn any voter fraud of any kind, whether it's Democrat or Republican.  But when you look at some of the things that happened in California in particular, when you look at what's happened in Texas with all of those votes that they recently found were not exactly properly done.  I condemn all of it.  And that includes North Carolina, if anything.  You know, I guess they're going to be doing a final report, but I'd like to see the final report.  But any form of election fraud, I condemn.  Mr.  President, when do you want to have that meeting with President Xi?  And do you expect to have that in Mar-a-Lago?  Probably at Mar-a-Lago, probably fairly soon, during the month of March.  Bob, do you have a date?  Steve, do you have a date?  We're planning it with your schedule, Mr.  President.  Okay, so we have two schedules, and we'll be planning that with the schedule.  Do you have any concerns about Michael Cohen's testimony before Congress?  No, no, no.  Mr.  President, are you still considering... Lawyer-client, but, you know, he's taking his own chances.  What do you think, Sam, with Huawei and ZTE?  Would you still consider a ban?  The President.  Well, ZTE paid a big fine of $1.2 billion, which nobody has ever even heard of before.  And we want everybody to compete.  And I guess it will be somewhat of a subject that we're talking about here, Bob.  We'll be talking about it.  We may or may not include that in this deal.  The Press Include what?  The President The Huawei and ZTE.  Would you drop criminal charges against Huawei as part of this statement?  The President.  We're going to be discussing all of that during the course of the next couple of weeks.  And we'll be talking to the U.S.  attorneys.  We'll be talking to the Attorney General.  But we'll be making that decision.  Right now, it's not something that we're discussing.  Do you think that congressional Republicans will stick with you on your emergency declaration and vote against it?  Oh, I think they'll stick, yeah.  Everybody knows we need border security.  We need a wall.  I think it's a very bad subject for the Democrats.  We need a wall.  We've apprehended more people than we have in many, many years.  Apprehended meaning we've gotten.  With a wall, we wouldn't even have to apprehend them if we had the proper structure.  It's costing us a lot of money with the military.  We have a lot of military there.  We have tremendous border control and border security there.  We have \u2014 I'll tell you what, the people of border security, people of ICE, the law enforcement, generally speaking, have done an incredible job at the border.  We have caravans heading up, and we're able to head out the caravans.  We've done a great job.  But if we had the wall, it would be much easier.  And, frankly, it would be a job that would be perfecto, and it would cost, actually, ultimately, a lot less money.  We don't think that's a resolution.  Thank you.  What?  A question from China Daily.  You tweeted yesterday that the U.S.  will not block out currently more advanced technology in terms of 5G, 6G.  What do you mean?  Well, I'd like to have all companies be able to compete.  I don't want to artificially block people out based on excuses or based on security.  I don't want to have a security problem.  Wait.  I'm talking about everybody, really, including what I'm talking about everybody.  I don't want to use artificial blocking.  We want to have great 5G.  Ultimately, that's going to morph into 6G, and probably 6G will be obsolete in about two months.  the way it's going, you know, the way that whole world moves.  But 60 at some point in the future will be obsolete.  But I want to have competition with China, fair competition.  I don't want to block out anybody if we can help it.  Now, if there's going to be a security reason or something, then we have no choice.  But that is one of the things we'll be discussing today.  We want to have open competition.  We've always done very well in open competition.  Go ahead.  The Press.  Mr.  President, your officials mentioned that there was a deal on currency.  Can you explain to us what that was?  Mr.  Well, we'll let you know at the appropriate time.  But we have a deal on currency and currency manipulation.  Yes.  The Press Will you definitively veto that resolution that was introduced today that would block your national emergency if it passes?  Mr.  On the wall?  The Press.  Yes.  Mr.  Will I veto it?  One hundred percent.  One hundred percent.  And I don't think it survives a veto.  We have too many smart people that want border security, so I can't imagine it could survive a veto.  But I will veto it, yes.  The Press.  Just to continue, last year you had or the U.S.  assistance to Pakistan because Pakistan is coming home?  The President No, I stopped paying Pakistan the $1.3 billion that we were paying them.  In the meantime, we may set up some meetings with Pakistan.  Pakistan was taking very strong advantage of the United States under other presidents, and we were paying Pakistan $1.3 billion a year.  I ended that payment to Pakistan because they weren't helping us.  In a way that they should have and honestly we've had.  we've developed a much better relationship with Pakistan over the last Short period of time than we had but I did.  I ended the payment.  We were paying Pakistan 1.3 billion dollars a year.  I ended that about nine months ago.  A lot of people don't know that but I ended it nine months ago.  But what are you talking about?  What are you trying to refer to?  Yeah, I have to speak up.  I can't hear you.  That's right.  No, it's a terrible thing going on right now between Pakistan and India.  It's a very, very bad situation, and it's a very dangerous situation between the two countries.  And we would like to see it stop.  A lot of people were just killed.  And we want to see it stopped.  We're very much involved in that, yes, if that's what you're referring to.  The Press.  No, India is looking at something very strong.  I mean, India just lost almost 50 people.  and with an attack, so I can understand that also.  But we're talking, and a lot of people are talking, but it is a very, very delicate balance going on.  Right now, there's a lot of problems between India and Pakistan because of what just happened.  In Kashmir.  Are you talking about Kashmir?  Yeah.  In Kashmir, it's very dangerous.  Yes, please.  The Press.  Mr.  President, on Huawei, sir, just one quick follow-up.  Are you planning an executive order on Huawei?  Well, we're not doing anything right now.  We may or may not put that in the trade agreement.  We may be discussing it, but we'd only do that in conjunction with the Attorney General of the United States, because that is a matter that is outside of what we're doing.  So we do that with the Attorney General, if we do anything.  And I guess there's a question as to whether or not that's being included in the agreement.  Yeah, go ahead.  Mr.  President, we haven't gotten your response yet to Amazon pulling out of of New York City, your home city?  The President.  I think it's a big loss for New York City.  I think it's a big loss.  I think it's if you look at the deal, the deal was not a great deal from the standpoint of.  they could have made a better deal than that, a much better deal.  But still, I think it's a loss for New York City.  And the three billion dollars wasn't a check.  It was a form of taxes over a period of time that now they'll never see because, you know, they were.  they were going to take in a lot of jobs.  They were going to take in a lot of taxes.  So I think it's a big loss for New New York City.  It's the kind of thinking that our country is going to on the left, on the radical left.  But ultimately, it's not good for jobs and it's not good for the economy.  But I think it was a big loss for New York City.  I come from New York City.  I love New York City.  I think it was a big loss for New York City.  Yes, sir.  I'm actually getting a very final briefing and a very complete briefing in about two hours.  Do you have any thoughts on this matter?  I think it's a shame.  Yeah, I think it's a very sad thing when a thing like that happens.  And I've expressed that, but I'm actually getting a very complete briefing in about two hours.  Do you think that you bear any responsibility for moderating your language when it comes to that?  No, I don't.  I think my language is very nice.  Is the President online today?  From China.  From China.  The trade conflict has been one year, not negotiations going on.  So what's your \u2014 what do you think?  The President Who are you with in China?  People's Daily China, this paper.  The President People's Daily?  The President Yeah.  And then, what do you think?  Is the cooperation still a good solution?  The President Great cooperation.  We have great cooperation both ways with China.  And a lot of good things are happening.  I mean, I think you see that.  So many people every day, they are going to make a deal.  They aren't going to make a deal.  They don't know.  They have no idea.  It's fake news.  You know, it's one of those things.  Do they have fake news in China?  I think so.  But... It's a question.  Are they going to make a deal?  Aren't they?  I think we have a very good chance of making a deal.  But both parties want to make it a meaningful deal.  We don't want to make a deal.  that doesn't.  I can speak for the vice premier.  I can speak for President Xi.  I can speak for myself.  Both parties want to make this a real deal.  We want to make it a meaningful deal, not a deal that's done and doesn't mean anything.  We want to make this a deal that's going to last for many, many years and a deal that's going to be good for both countries.  But we want to make it meaningful.  Now, with that being said, China has the advantage of having many years of tremendous success at the expense of the United States.  So they understand that.  And I never blamed China for that.  I blamed our past leaders.  Our leaders have done a lousy job.  with trade.  Our country lost $800 billion last year with trade, generally.  $800 billion.  So the Vice Premier understands that.  So this same agreement should have been made 20 years ago, not now.  Because for 20 years, the United States has been really taken advantage of.  And I'm not blaming China.  We should have done the same thing to them.  But we didn't do that.  We had presidents that didn't do their job.  You want to know the truth?  We had presidents that did not do their job.  Yeah, go ahead.  Will the MOUs be a long-term deal?  How long would your MOU stay?  I think the MOU is going to be very short-term.  No, we expect to go into it.  I don't like MOUs because they don't mean anything.  To me, they don't mean anything.  I think you're better off just going into a document.  I was never a fan of an MOU.  An MOU is a contract.  It's the way trade agreements are generally used.  People refer to it like it's a term sheet.  It's not a term sheet.  It's an actual contract between the two parties.  A memorandum of understanding is a binding agreement between the two people.  And that's what we're talking about.  It's detailed.  It covers everything in great detail.  It's just called a memorandum of understanding.  It's a legal term.  It's a contract.  And would you agree that that would be a very long-term deal, sir?  Yes.  Contracts last while they last.  There's no term.  They last while they last.  Mr.  President, on North Korea... By the way, I disagree.  I think that a memorandum of understanding is not... a contract to the extent that we want.  We're gonna have, we're doing a memorandum of understanding that will be put into a final contract, I assume.  But to me, the final contract is really the thing, Bob, and I think you mean that too, is really the thing.  that means something.  A memorandum of understanding is exactly that.  It's a memorandum of what our understanding is.  But to me, the contract is... The real question is, Bob, so we do a memorandum of understanding, which, frankly, you could do or not do.  I don't care if you do it or not.  To me, it doesn't mean very much.  But if you do a memorandum, how long will it take to put that into a final binding contract?  What?  From now on, we're not using the word memorandum.  We're going to use the term trade agreement, all right?  No more.  We'll never use the term.  We'll have the same document.  It's going to be called a trade agreement.  We're never going to use MOU again.  Are they going to put that into another agreement?  Well, what we'll have will be a trade agreement.  If we have to cross, we have major hurdles.  I don't want to put the cart and bugger away.  Assuming you decide on an agreement, it'll be signed by the two people.  It'll be a trade agreement between the United States and China.  Good, good.  I like that much better.  I like that term much better.  Do you agree with that?  I wouldn't go into a memorandum.  I would go right into a trade agreement.  Either you're going to make a deal or you're not.  To have these other agreements as a minute.  Because they're not... That meaningful, in my opinion.  But anyway, I like that much better.  The Press.  Mr.  President, what do you think needs to be done after your meeting with Lynne Patton on Rancho?  The President On what?  The Press.  You had a meeting with Lynne Patton from the New York City Housing Authority?  The President Yeah, Lynne Patton is great.  And I can tell you, the New York City Housing Authority, the mayor of New York, has done a terrible job with public housing.  We're trying to help them, but the mayor of the city of New York has done a terrible job with respect to public housing.  We're getting reports back, and it's a disgrace how badly New York City handles its public housing.  Go ahead.  Well, I think he has to learn how to run New York City before he starts running the country, because he hasn't done a very good job.  Including, by the way, with Amazon.  One more career.  Your own administration officials say that Kim Jong-un has not actually decided yet whether he wants to denuclearize.  So how can you meet with him if he doesn't even want to get the gold?  We have had such a great relationship, and China has helped us a lot with North Korea and with Kim Jong-un since I got to office.  If I were not elected president, you would have been in a war with North Korea.  We now have a situation where the relationships are good, where there's been no nuclear testing, no missiles, no rockets.  We got our hostages back.  We have many of the remains back and coming back rapidly.  The remains of our great warriors from many, many years ago, and the families are so thrilled and so happy.  We've had a great relationship.  The Singapore was a tremendous success.  Only the fake news likes to portray it otherwise.  We would have gone, we would have been, we would have literally been in a war with North Korea, in my opinion, had I not been elected.  Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll see how it goes.  I think it'll be successful.  You know, I don't know anything about the situation.  When did he announce that?  I have not seen it.  He hasn't told me anything.  So we'll have to take a look.  I haven't spoken to him in a long time.  I haven't spoken.  I have not been involved. ",
