            "text": "Hello, Tina Spaulding Trance Channel here today.  I have been guided to do a video today but before I go to channeling I'd just like to let you know that we have two days remaining on our lifetime subscription special.  We have created a channeling Jesus community on a platform called Mighty Networks and the reason I've done that is Facebook wanted me to use facial recognition software.  And of course, there's censorship, lots of ads, data mining going on on Facebook and YouTube.  So I was guided to create a community that is like a combination of YouTube and Facebook.  So there's a community dialogue just like there is on Facebook.  You can post photos, videos, and all of my videos are archived there.  We have almost 700 videos, almost 100 of which have not been viewed by the public.  Those are the live streaming videos that I do every two weeks.  So with your subscription, you'll have access to a tremendous amount of new material and you'll be able to meet like-minded people in a community that is not mining your data, not censoring, not bombarding you with ads.  So the link for that is going to be in the description below.  So please do check it out.  The offer ends midnight on January 31st.  It will not be repeated.  It is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  We wanted to do that to get people joined up and we have over 600 people in the community now.  It's very vibrant already even though it's only been a month in the making and that is very, very exciting.  Lots of very, very interesting communications and conversations happening.  A lot of people are feeling safe enough in that environment to share a lot of personal stuff, including me.  So maybe I will see you in the community.  Once again, it's in the link in the description box below will take you to the page that describes everything that you would receive with your subscription.  And at the bottom of that page, there is a monthly sign up button or the once in a lifetime that will end in a couple of days.  So go check it out.  Now, I have been asked to do a video today, so I'm going to chat.  You are blessed beings indeed.  I am that one that you know as Jesus and today we would like to speak about some of the fear mongering that is going on in your math media systems.  What we want you to understand is that there is an endless cycle of fear mongering because when you are in fear you are easily managed.  When you are in fear you will get sick.  When you are in fear you will see yourself as powerless and you will become very, very, we will say, unable to affect that which is completely affectable.  We want you to know that you can change anything in this world, including your susceptibility to sickness.  So we are going to address the fear-mongering that is going on around this quote-unquote new virus.  What's happening here is you are being shepherded towards a solution that has already been prepared.  You have been given lots of fear mongering about vaccines and anti-vaxxers and diseases that are making a resurgence which is not so.  We want you to understand that you are being primed to be sold a vaccine.  This is what's going on here.  You have had a lot of pro-vaccine propaganda coming across your screens without anybody having a scientific and open debate with those beings who fear for the safety of the children in your society because of the chemicals and poisons that are being injected into them.  So what you have for many beings is a one-sided propaganda wave that has been active for a year or so now.  What's happening here today with this new coronavirus, it's not new at all.  It has been manufactured, modified, patented even.  So this is not a surprise.  This is an intentional push to get a vaccine approved.  What many of you do not understand about the system that approves your vaccines is that vaccines are not given the same safety tests and preambles and double-blind placebo tests that other drugs are given.  And even those drugs that are given those tests often end up being lethal.  You are witnessing many, many tens of thousands of beings being hurt by FDA approved chemicals.  What we want you to understand is that it is up to you to stand in your power.  It is up to you to understand how sickness accesses you.  Sickness accesses you through your fears.  Sickness accesses you through your negative beliefs, through your untrue beliefs and ideas.  When you are in fear, when you are feeling as if you have no power, when you are depressed, when you are angry, when you are afraid, when you are judgmental, your frequency goes down and there are access points in your energy field because you are not functioning at the frequency of love.  You are designed to function at the frequency of love.  That is what your guidance system is calibrated to.  It is the invisible umbilical cord that you have been God given to let you know when you are on track for your journey home.  This is not about death.  This is about living a full and happy life.  You have been given a guidance system that immediately tells you when you have stepped off the path to light and love.  And so for those of you that are fearful of this new virus, you are in fact being massaged and manipulated down the frequency scale so that you are more likely to get sick.  Not only that, you are being taught that you are vulnerable.  You are being taught that science is going to save you.  You must look at the health and well-being of your society.  You are getting sicker and sicker.  Your children are suffering more and more from diseases that are inexplicable.  What's happening is that the industrialization and monetization of your healthcare system, the chemicalization of your world is beginning to show.  Your bodies are suffering.  Your minds are suffering from manipulation and propaganda.  What we want to coax you towards is understanding that you are sacred beings connected to an impeccable guidance system.  You do not have to pay for anything if you do not want to.  Our Dear One has set up a system of community and shared information that is by payment, but it is not necessary if you do not want to join it.  You can, in fact, educate yourself in any way you wish.  But we would rather you did not educate yourself from the mass media systems.  Educate yourself from the real science.  Go behind the headlines and find out what's really going on.  The community that we have created with our dear one is designed to support those beings who want to chat and communicate and talk about spiritual matters without having an influx from other less than loving systems.  What the new community platform has that this platform does not have is a guarantee that it will not be censored.  There may even be words used in this video that will require it to be removed.  So if you are watching this video and you have been fortunate enough to see it as soon as it's released, we would like you to make note.  If it disappears, this gives you an idea of why we are creating a community that is off this site.  Some of you may be mad that your free material has gone.  We will continue to post on a semi-regular basis because we are here to help you wake up.  We do not want to hide these teachings from anyone.  But if you are feeling a bit alone, if you are feeling a bit under the weather, if you are feeling as if There are not many people around you that are like you.  You may want to consider joining the Channeling Jesus community.  I work through many channels in many different forms at this time.  The information that I am bringing forth is for all beings.  Some of you, however, feel unsafe in these exposed and controlled formats.  And so this community has been designed for those of you that are feeling as if you are not safe out here in the sites of YouTube and the sites of Facebook.  We are here to let you know that you have tremendous creative power.  If you hook into the mass media systems that are marketing fear, that power that you possess can be used against you.  It can be turned against you because you do not realize how strong you are.  Your fear, your focus, your intention is creative and it will create in your bodies.  It will create in your lives.  It will create in your communities.  We want to encourage all of you to see yourself as strong, to see yourself as connected, to see yourself as a being of light, for that is what you are, a being of light and love.  Do not let the news shows tell you otherwise.  They are fear-mongering on purpose.  There is a capitalistic reason behind it.  Do not fall for their propaganda.  But stand strong in your connection to the divine.  Stand strong in your love and caring for Mother Nature.  And stand strong in a community with your brothers and sisters, knowing that there are many of you that are as powerful as each other.  And if you gather together with love and light as your goal, you can change anything.  I am that one that you know as Jesus.  And I will speak to you again soon.  Now, don't be afraid.  I love you all.  Thanks very much.  And I'll see you soon.  Bye-bye. ",
