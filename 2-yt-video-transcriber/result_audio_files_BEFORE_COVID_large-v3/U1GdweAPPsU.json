            "text": "I fought to build Honey Badger Radio into a bargaining chip for this moment.  The International Conference on Men's Issues in Chicago this year, August 16th, 17th, and 18th, almost didn't happen.  The fatal near miss occurred just after we'd secured a friendly venue after a lot of false starts, including one hotel that originally agreed to host us, but then got word from corporate and was told that we were a reputational risk.  I think you've heard those terms quite a bit in the last few months.  But we finally found a venue and a hotel who looked past problems with harassment that we've had, you know, being harassed, and violent threats that we'd received, the International Conference on Men's Issues had received in the past, and said, come on in.  You're welcome here.  I just pitched a completely re-envisioned ICMI, an ICMI that opens itself up to the greater community of the culture war and shows them that men's issues are not just important to men, but to our civilization.  When we forget how much sacrifice we ask of men to maintain society, we lay the foundation for self-destructive narratives.  like society oppresses women.  And those self-destructive narratives are used as weapons by pirates.  to hijack education, government, media, gaming, comics, animation, and the list goes on and on.  When civilization stalls, the looting begins.  Karen spent days trying to convince previous ICMI hosts that my idea was worth the gamble and things were looking good.  Then Patreon and We all heard this story.  Patreon axed Sargon from its service, and all hell broke loose.  I was looking at a contract that, when signed, would put me on the hook for about the same amount that the Badger Cave... is worth.  And that's just the contract with the venue.  All told, this conference will cost more than double what the Badger Cave is worth.  In other words, I could lose everything I'd painstakingly built up over the years.  And it wasn't just me in the balance.  It was Brian and Lindsay and Ed and my husband.  It was all the people we've helped and our patrons in the community that we've built together.  With our monthly income in flux because of the Patreon debacle, that idea got really scary really fast.  For me, Honey Badger Radio is the one really visible thing that I got right in my life.  It's how I've made myself of use to the men's issues community.  It's not just my income.  It's really the one thing that I can say that I achieved.  Not just a learning experience, but something to be proud of.  And I could lose all of that if we don't sell enough tickets, if we don't convince enough people to invest in this contract and the ICMI.  Imagine waking up and there's no Honey Badger Radio.  That's quite a lot of pressure.  Particularly after coming off of a long, long, arduous legal battle that ended in defeat and my subsequent struggles with depression and suicide as a result.  So there I was, staring at the dotted line.  If I sign, I could lose everything.  Everything I've built up over the past five years.  Karen tried to jar me out of my paralysis.  She told me we'd be fine.  If necessary, everyone could get other jobs.  It's just money.  She emphasized how important this contract was, how everyone else involved in the ICMI was relying on us, how hard it had been to convince them of this radical new idea and get a venue on board.  But what she said wasn't the reason I signed.  Tacking.  It's one of the greatest innovations in sailing.  To be able to move forward when the wind is against you.  Opened up the seas in a way never before possible.  And don't worry, this relates.  Because that's what we do.  We men's rights activists and men's issues enthusiasts.  We tack into the wind.  And no one else can.  No one else knows how.  This narrative that our society has embraced, the narrative that society itself oppresses women, our society is trumpeting it from all of its institutions of truth, media, academia, government, all of them embracing the idea that society itself oppresses women.  This narrative is suicidal.  It's the narrative of a society in a spiral of self-loathing, self-destruction.  Think about it.  Everyone loves women.  Everyone thinks they're wonderful.  Most people think that providing and protecting for women in saving them from suffering is where it's at.  All of us agree that women should be cherished and valued.  Companies can even profit hugely off of just saying that they advocate for protecting women from domestic violence and mental illness, and the really, really big one, breast cancer.  Even men's rights advocates don't want to stop compassion for women.  They just want to add compassion for men.  So when society's overwhelming gender narrative is society itself oppresses women, that's a society that has decided it doesn't want to exist anymore because it set itself against one of the most primal human instincts, protecting women.  What is the inevitable result of that?  It's suicide.  It's a suicidal narrative.  So the real question isn't what's going to happen?  What's going to happen is so obvious.  it's painful.  Society will eventually crumble under the weight of its own chosen self-destruction.  Some people like to hang.  Some people like to suffocate.  Some people like to drown, some people like to jump off heights, some people like to use guns.  Our society has chosen feminism.  The real question is why has it chosen this narrative?  And the answer is that it can't tack into the wind.  The prevailing wind right now is female exclusive victimhood.  The result is what I like to call the negative sum game.  If something is seen to affect 50 women, we care, particularly if we believe it affects them because they are women.  But if we add in 50 male victims, we don't double our compassion for the 100 victims, nor do we have it and split it between the male and the female victims.  we lose all compassion for all victims completely.  when male victims are visible people stop being motivated to do anything.  we stop caring about female victims too and i came to this realization after many many arguments with feminists saying to me that i was apologizing for for example for rape because i was saying well men could be as much as half of the victims of rape.  well you just don't think it's that important then because when you add in the male victims you stop for them.  you're actually making the issue less important.  But if we ignore half the data, we never solve any of these problems.  Therefore, anyone stuck in the negative-sum mindset would rather appear to be helping women than actually stop women from suffering.  Deeply ironic, though that may be.  Society needs to fill its sails.  with the narrative of female oppression, even if men and astoundingly women are sacrificed to the goddess of that particular gale.  So society is stuck going wherever that wind takes them, and that wind is sucking them into a self-destructive narrative that will leave them dashed on jagged rock.  No amount of lighthouses shouting at YouTube audiences will stop it, because no one can tack into the wind except us.  we can acknowledge male victims and still care not to the exclusion of female victims but to the inclusion of male victims for men's rights activists.  if there are fifty female victims of problem and fifty male victims we don't lose our motivation or have our compassion.  we double it and anyone who sails who sailed knows that tacking isn't truly sailing against the wind.  it's using sail and keel to negotiate the wind creating counterbalancing forces so that going forward is the easiest way for the boat to go.  It just requires skill and perseverance and strength of mind.  It's not magic.  But it is our greatest selling point as men's rights activists.  We tack into the wind.  We're motivated by something more than just saving women.  We're motivated by loving all people and wanting to help everyone who suffers, regardless of gender.  We are for recognizing all of the data and ending these social ills, not just exploiting them for fun and profit.  Right now we have companies opening their doors to us and saying, come on in.  I can't know for sure why, But our current venues know what we've dealt with in the past.  They know our history.  They know what we stand for.  And they're saying, you're welcome here.  That's huge.  Maybe it's because they see the writing on the wall, if not consciously, then perhaps intuitively.  Maybe they're tired of the hideous amount of conflict and misery that this suicidal social narrative is creating.  But they're doing it.  They're giving us our big break.  To mix my metaphors, they're inviting us rookies to the big league, and they're saying, show us what you got.  I knew, even before Honey Badger Radio was a glimmer of a thought, that the men's rights movement would never appeal to media.  The suicidal narrative gives them too much power to manipulate reality.  We'd also never appeal to government, because the suicidal narrative is their excuse to slump into a lazy tyranny and take away everyone's rights.  in order to save women from men and having rights.  and i thought we might have a chance with the legal system since it's based on something even far more ancient than the government.  but those hopes were dashed after receiving the judgment that i did in august of last year.  And we'll never convince academia, because there is nothing more stubborn and impossible to move than an academic who knows he's wrong.  But what we can appeal to is Main Street.  Not Wall Street, because they make bank off of carefully nurturing and exploiting women's insecurities, and no narrative induces more insecurity in women than the one in which society oppresses them.  no main street.  the small to medium-sized business community.  they are capable of huge change.  they are actually our real economic driver and to be frank they don't need government big business media or academia.  all of these institutions need them.  and that's whose footing the bill for all of those institutions.  They got Trump elected, they made Brexit a thing, and they can do more.  They can end this nonsense, shake off the government, academia, and media narrative like a dog fleet shaking off fleas.  They just need to know how to tack into the wind.  They need to see something new and vibrant and passionate, expanding the horizon of human possibility, and they need to see a community willing to build, to put its money where its mouth is.  they want to see us tack into the wind.  they may not know they want to see it yet but they need to because it will give them the hope that they can do it too.  and as our society slumps into its suicidal death spiral and the misery machine pumps out its toxic payload that hope could be worth a whole hell of a lot in the future.  this is our moment.  we need to swing for the bleachers.  We need to show them what we got.  We need to show them that we are motivated to build.  I'm not even close to the strongest person in the world, or even in my town.  Despite that, I've fought a panic disorder, depression.  I've built up a balance sheet, an asset base.  I fought to claw out a physical space for us.  The Badger Cave.  i fought to build honey badger radio into a bargaining chip for this moment.  i got this door open for you.  i am ready to lose it all.  i am willing to gamble honey badger radio away on a single question.  will you listening to me now pick up a shovel and start to build?  will you storm this open door?  will you fill this hotel to the rafters with the most polite and respectful guests they have ever had.  unlike the lawsuit the success of this convention rests entirely on your shoulders, those of you listening to me now.  But if you don't, don't ever complain that no one cares about men's issues because you didn't either when it mattered.  If we can't win justice, we will have to build it.  This is our moment to show the world that we are ready to build something great.  It's our moment to show the world that they are not stuck with the winds of fate, that they can fight against them like we do.  and chart our own path.  They're watching, the businesses who've given us this break and the businesses who've refused and said we were a quote-unquote reputational risk to your suicidal narrative.  They're all watching.  For so long, the men's rights movement has sought to appeal to others, the media to report fairly, to academia to tell the truth.  Good luck with that.  to government to care about their issues.  Now it's time for us to step up to the plate and realize our hope doesn't lie with them.  Their hope lies with us.  We're not a community of victims.  We are a community of people ready to fight, ready to build, ready to love one another in the fiercest sense of the word, ready to tack against the wind.  Join me in supporting the International Conference on Men's Issues.  Support till it hurts.  Support till it scares you.  And then support some more.  Like I did.  It's scary for me to risk so much.  But I believe in you.  And that's why I'm willing to do it.  Let's do it.  Let's make ICMI 2019 a success.  And if you're ready to put men's rights on the map, go to www.feedthebadger.com and select the ICMI 2019 speaker sponsor and trick it drive.  If you can't attend... You now have more options to make ICMI 2019 the biggest and bestest men's rights event ever.  And if you need a bit more information on what options you have for support, click there.  And I'll give you a rundown.  This is where it matters, folks.  This is our chance to make a real difference in challenging the narrative that's hamstringing efforts to bring attention to men's issues, build services for men, and harming men's mental health.  As well as, you know, the narrative that society is currently using to blow its own brains out.  I've been pretty devastated by the legal judgment and I know lots of you have as well.  It's crushing.  But the ICMI is a way that we can build the justice we want to see.  We have a company willing to enter into a large contract with a men's rights group.  if we can build a business model based around recognizing these issues we can make real progress.  i can't emphasize this enough.  this is a critical moment for our movement.  every movement worth its salt had to marshal its own economic resources and prove its clout the Montgomery bus boycott, the civil rights movement, the gay dollar for the gay liberation movement.  And the truth is we're not victims.  We're builders, and we always have been.  So let's build.  And finally, if you want to continue to fund the grand experiment that is Honey Badger Radio, fund us building an asset base so we can do things like Risk It All, signing huge contracts with businesses to gain legitimacy for the men's rights movement in the business community, then go to www.feedthebadger and sign up for a monthly subscription.  That is www.feedthebadger.com.  We build it up, we gamble it, win big, and maybe one day the stakes on the other side of the table will be the world itself.  I look forward to that day.  Oh, and I guess I still owe you an explanation.  I told you why I was willing to risk Honey Badger Radio to host the International Conference on Men's Issues in 2019.  I didn't tell you why I chose to host it.  Next time, I'll tell you that.  And we'll do a venue reveal.  So stay posted.  Same Badger channel, probably not the same Badger time.  And thank you all for your kind attention. ",
