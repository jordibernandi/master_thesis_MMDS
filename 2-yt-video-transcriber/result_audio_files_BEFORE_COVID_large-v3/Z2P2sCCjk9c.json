            "text": "Hey guys, it's your old pal Senable here, and today I'm making a video on things that you probably didn't know about Frederick Nietzsche.  Frederick Nietzsche?  Weren't that that one atheist who said something about God being dead?  You know what?  That's all I care about.  All I care about is that he was an atheist.  Now I'm gonna demonize him as a boogeyman because I don't care about any of the other stuff he said other than the fact that he was an atheist.  Oh my god, Nietzsche.  I love Nietzsche.  I love him because even though he barely ever talked about politics and the only time he ever talked about politics was to critique socialism, an ideology that's already disliked by the vast majority of the world, I still like to pretend that he was this political philosopher who had so much political insight.  Nietzsche forever.  I love Nietzsche.  He's like Marx but not a cuck.  Everyone likes to read about his works instead of reading his works and misinterpret it to fit their own agendas.  So the first fact I'd like to share about Nietzsche is how eccentric his day-to-day diet was.  Nietzsche ate A beefsteak for breakfast.  And then for the rest of the day, he just ate various types of fruit.  Aw, yeah!  Beefsteak for breakfast!  I love this guy already!  Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  What, he was a philosopher or something?  He must have been a nerd!  I don't feel secure in the fact that I'm a man unless I'm shooting something!  So, the next fact I'd like to share about Nietzsche relates to his mustache.  Now, Nietzsche is known for first saying, God is dead, and for also first saying, what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.  But what he's also known for is his long, curly mustache, which has basically become a symbol of him and his philosophy.  Apparently, Nietzsche's mustache actually scared off women.  which was one of the many reasons, along with his romantic incompetence, that he never got a girlfriend, he never married, and consequently, he never had children.  So, the next quite awkward fact I'd like to share about Frederick Nietzsche was that, I believe it was in 1872, he sent a letter to his mother saying that he understands if his mother never wants to talk to him again because he committed a crime so heinous that he believed it was unforgivable.  His crime was getting drunk.  Now, this would already be awkward enough if I wasn't pretty sure that Mama Nicho was drinking while she was pregnant, so I don't think she was offended in the slightest.  Nietzsche's ghost, please don't send me from heaven, you're my favorite philosopher.  So, the next bit of information I'd like to share about Nietzsche is that despite Nietzsche being known for his very militant and very hardcore atheism, It actually is possible that he was actually a devout Christian, and whenever he brought up the subject of religion and why it was a bad thing, specifically Christianity as works, it's believed that he may, may, it's very unlikely, but he may have been satirizing atheism and was actually a devout Christian.  The final fact I'd like to share about Friedrich Nietzsche is that despite having a bit of a reputation as a racist, nationalist, and anti-Semite, all three of those are untrue.  Nietzsche actually hated nationalism and anti-Semitism, saying that they were just ways people tried to fill a void in their hearts.  and he hated the two ideologies.  It was only until his mental collapse and paralyzation in 1889 that his sister Elizabeth, who was a nationalist, German supremacist, and anti-Semite, began editing Nietzsche's books and publishing them with her new translations in which she defended nationalism, defended German supremacy, and defended anti-Semitism.  And then the books went to a young man, I don't think his name will ring a bell, named Adolf Hitler.  who came across the books and used them as an intellectual excuse to rise to power and kill a bunch of Jews and kill a bunch of Poles and kill a bunch of Jehovah's Witnesses and kill a bunch of blacks, kill a bunch of gays, kill a bunch of the chronically ill, kill a bunch of prisoners of war.  Anyways, that was my new video.  I hope you guys enjoyed it, and I hope you have a nice weekend. ",
