But today, I wanted to talk about something a little bit different something that I have not talked about in a really long time.  in fact I've actually made a couple videos in recent weeks about fractional gold stacking but I have not showed off this little one gram gold bar in months maybe even over a year.  at this point.  I have not talked about this in a very long time so I wanted to show it off talk about it a little bit.  give you my thoughts give you my opinions and I encourage everyone watching right now to head on down in the comments and let me know what you think of 1 gram or 2 gram, 2.5 gram gold bars as opposed to maybe 1 tenth of an ounce, half ounce, or quarter ounce, or a solid 1 ounce piece of gold.  Let me know in the comments.  But this right here was my very first time picking up a little piece of gold.  And you might be wondering why I have it in the airtight the way that I do.  My original plan was to get... six two four six.  i was gonna fill up a little square a rectangular airtight capsule with six one gram gold bars and i changed my mind right after i received this one gram gold bar.  now i want to make it very clear that there's absolutely nothing wrong with stacking grams of gold.  There's nothing wrong with this little one gram gold bar.  There's nothing wrong with stacking gold on a micro level as opposed to a fractional level or one ounce, two ounce, three ounce increments.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  It's all personal preference.  However, the biggest downsides to this little one gram gold bar, was the hefty premium I paid on it.  Now the reason I paid the premium and didn't think twice about it was because I had only been stacking precious metals for a couple of weeks.  This was like the third time I ever converted my dollars into precious metals.  I had never done it before.  I was brand new to stacking And this was like my second or third or something like that order on Atmex.  I didn't know any better.  To be honest, I really didn't even know or understand what the premiums were like.  The way I saw it at the time was I was like, okay, an ounce of gold, 31 grams.  So it might be cheaper in theory.  short-term thinking, to get one gram gold bars.  And over time, if I accumulate 31 of these little ones, that's an ounce of gold.  And that's absolutely the truth.  That is cheaper short-term as opposed to spending maybe a couple hundred dollars or a full solid 1400 bucks on a one ounce gold coin.  It is cheaper to do it this way.  This only cost me about 45, 50 bucks.  That's a whole lot cheaper than dropping a couple hundred dollars on something that's a little bit bigger.  Come to find out, the smaller the piece of gold is, the higher the premium's going to be.  So it would have been a whole lot smarter to just hold off and pick up a one-tenth of an ounce gold coin in a few weeks, but I figured I would do it this way.  Now there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing it this way, it's just gonna cost more money long term.  When I first got started stacking, I believe I was thinking a little bit too much on the short term.  I was focusing on that as opposed to what's gonna make the most sense, what's going to save me the most amount of money long term, which is why I no longer get grams of gold, one tenth of an ounce coins and up.  Notice how I said coins.  I'm not getting rounds, I'm not getting bars.  I get government minted coins and that goes for silver as well.  I think it's a whole lot more recognizable.  I think it's more trustworthy.  Definitely has a higher level of notoriety.  It just makes a little bit more sense to me.  Now like I said before, it's all personal preference.  It was a rookie mistake for me to not do as much research as I could have done, but getting one gram gold bars is in no way, shape, or form a mistake.  I do not regret this.  This was not a bad quote-unquote investment.  I know gold's not an investment, but just for the sake of trying to get my point across.  This was not something that I look back at and be like, oh, why did I do that?  That was such a horrible decision.  No, there was nothing wrong with it.  I just spent a couple more dollars than I probably needed to.  So I want to share that with you, and I wanted to get your thoughts on stacking gold on a very micro level.  What are your thoughts?  What are your opinions?  Have you ever done it before?  Do you currently do it?  Do you plan on doing it in the future?  Sure, it'll save you a little bit of money short term, but long term, by the time... I stacked 31 of these.  You know how many dollars I would have put into that?  Far more than I would have if I just picked up a straight up one ounce gold coin or rounder bar.  Because of the hefty premium that I'm paying at each one multiplied by 31, that's hundreds of dollars more than you would need to spend.  or convert, I should say.  So I would like to know your thoughts.  I would like to know your opinions.  It's a little basic, generic, secondary market.  Gold bar.  Let me see if I can get it to focus.  Here we go.  One gram, four nines fine, pure gold.  And ever since then, I decided I'm no longer going to do that.  But I do still want to get small pieces of gold just because I feel like they're easier to part ways with.  Sure, I can go get a one ounce gold maple leaf.  But what happens if I only wanna sell half an ounce of gold?  I'm not gonna melt down a government minted coin, split it up.  I'm not gonna do that.  So, like I said before, it's all personal preference.  in my opinion and from my perspective based off of the goals that i have for myself it makes more sense to stack gold on a fractional level and by that i mean one tenth of an ounce one quarter ounce and half ounce government minted gold coins.  that's what i like to do.  to be frank i don't really give a crap.  if you think that's a horrible horrendous idea You'd be surprised.  the names I've been called in the comment section because of what I decide to do with my own money.  So if you're one of those people who are beet red, angry, foaming at the mouth right now, worry about your own money.  And as for everybody else, I hope you enjoyed the video.
