            "text": "More rate cuts to harm our property sector.  Let's have a look.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I'm Florian Heiser, Stein of Coffee in Hand, and I hope you're having a relaxing Saturday.  I thought I'd read this article and discuss it with you from news.com.  Now, it's from billionaire Ray Dalio's perspective about future rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia and how they could harm our property market.  Now, if you're not familiar with Ray, here he is.  He is a well-known, well-known, I was looking him up, he's a billionaire.  Billionaire, philanthropist, investor.  He made his first investment, I think when he was 12 or 13 years of age, into an airline company.  that was promptly, I think, 300 bucks.  Was promptly bought up by another and he tripled his investment.  So that was the start of his career.  So I would say that he has very good lived experience.  And we really should listen to the warnings that he says to us.  Because the last time we looked at this, I did a previous video about the interest rate cuts we have here in Australia.  And I'll link to that above.  You can have a look at that.  Just comparing it to the position put forward by the governor of our Reserve Bank, it really did not scream of any confidence at all in our economy.  So let's have a look.  Billionaire Ray Dalio claims more RBA cuts could harm the property market.  A billionaire hedge fund founder claims further interest rate cuts from the RBA could cause further pain for Australia's housing market.  Now, it doesn't seem too surprising to me, particularly when our interest rates are so low.  I mean, they're bloody insane.  That's how they are.  A Buena hedge fund founder has weighed in on the Australian property market, and the news isn't good.  Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio will visit Australia later this year for the Son Harts and Mines Investment Leaders Conference.  That might be good to go to.  Speaking with several media outlets ahead of the event, Mr Dalio warned that further interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia could worsen our property mini-bubble.  Notice how... Is that just the bubble that we're having now?  All of Australia is considered a mini-bubble.  This month, the RBA made the historic move of cutting interest rates to an all-time low of 1.25%, ending weeks of frenzied speculation.  On June 4th, RBA Governor Philip Lowe revealed the cash rate would be slashed by 25 basis points from a previous low of 1.5%, the first time the official cash rate has been cut in almost three years.  years okay.  so that's the first time they've cut our cash rate.  let's have a look at just a few things.  let's discuss you know unemployment rate the last figures i had it's trending up.  it's trending up which isn't a good sign.  our inflation rate let's look at that here in australia it was a zero in the march quarter zero.  what's that tell you about confidence?  so i'll turn that on twice.  our gdp growth rate is trending down as well from december.  how many quarters do we have to have negative growth rate to have a recession?  then look at you know property prices.  predictions that they're just most of them with a few exceptions i think it's just hobart and canberra are predicted to go down.  so I'm not surprised.  They're trying to pull every trick they can to keep the housing and the property sector just stimulated.  enough and enough investment and people pushing money into there.  They're trying to do everything they can.  But many Australian economists predict this is just the first of several cuts heading our way.  With the second 25 basis point reduction believed to be on the cards as soon as August, while others claim it could be slashed by 0.5 within months.  Wow.  That's... I mean it doesn't really yell of any confidence at all.  You need to look, watch my video.  I actually read through his statement here and the economy is performing reasonable.  It's a reasonable economy that doesn't scream of confidence, does it?  And these cuts, they will put everyone on edge.  Consumer confidence will go down.  People will cut their spending.  let me know if in the comments if you're watching guys does.  is this going to encourage you to spend?  i think one person previous video said yeah now all my all my bills and everything's accounted for it'll be a bit more playing money for me but everyone else So, but in an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Mr.  Dalio said our property market was at risk due to global and national debit cycles.  Because interest rates have come down steadily, there's been a pretty steady rise in debt, particularly related to property debt, Mr.  Dalio said.  Australia, like many other countries, is coming to the end of a long-term debt cycle.  Mm-hmm.  The world is coming to the end of a long-term debt cycle because when central banks can't lower interest rates, they have to try to print money.  Well, yes, there you go.  There you go.  And that's been hinted at by the RBA, by our governor as well.  What happens when they print money, guys?  What happens when they print money?  Hmm, I wonder.  I wonder.  More money sounds good.  Yeah, sure.  But it decreases the value of everything you have.  So a lot of people are suggesting to go into, invest into minerals as a hedge for it.  and i will i plan to to you know squirrel away a bit of money and uh make a how-to video of how to actually do that.  different processes but we'll see.  we'll see.  i'll ask some help for some viewers and i'll put something together in the future.  so when they print money and buy financial assets it drives up financial asset prices.  he said that when interest rates inched towards the zero mark it left central banks with little firepower to tackle an economic downturn.  realestate.com.au.  chief economist narrator coinsby said interest rate cuts could indicate rising unemployment which in turn would seriously affect the property market.  i agree that further interest rate cuts could end the little bit of a boom we've been having now.  so as a little as a reflex But I think the potential reason why interest rates could be cut is because we have rising unemployment.  Well, yes, no, you're right.  But I don't know if that's going to help.  On the other hand, an interest rate cut like the one we had in June does provide a bit of a boost at this stage when unemployment is very low.  Unemployment is very low, but underemployment, underemployment, I think it's remained steady.  Yeah, if they look at unemployed, if you're considered underemployed, I want to see the underemployed figure.  I don't trust it now with Uber and the gig economy.  But if interest rates come about because unemployment is rising rapidly, that is a massive problem for property.  People can typically absorb a rate rise by cutting spending in other areas.  But when people lose jobs, that's when we start to see stress in the housing market.  Ms.  Coinsby said people were less likely to buy property during uncertain times.  Well, that's what all this is saying to me.  That's what this constant rate, boom, boom, boom, changes in uncertainty.  I'm quite happy that we managed to get a conservative government in power because that will not be as uncertain, but I still think we're headed for tough times.  I still think Australia, we need a market correction.  The longer you put off a correction, the greater the pressure builds up and the greater the explosion.  So that's a metaphor, guys.  If we see a lot of rate cuts, people may worry they could lose their jobs and be forced to sell.  Alternatively, they may not want to take on debt in an environment where they feel uncertain, she said.  Well, in my tiny little sphere of the economy, I'm getting more and more phone calls for people wanting work and resumes.  Spontaneous applications, they call them now.  spontaneous applications appear appearing more and more and i got a tiny little firm.  you know they find me from a website so it's funny.  they always are really excited to want to work for heiser which is which is funny.  meanwhile comparison site finder.com.au's rba cash rate survey has revealed economist views on the likelihood of a second rate cut in july.  of the 40 experts and economists paul 68 predicted an easing of the cash rate on july 2nd.  Nearly three-quarters of experts expect the bottom of the cycle to reach 0.75% or lower, while almost a third believe the cash rate will reach 0.5%.  Wow.  That's exciting times we live in, isn't it, guys?  Deloitte Access Economics' Chris Richardson told News.com that a degree of risk had been removed from the housing market by cutting interest rates and better banking regulations.  And because much of the uncertainty caused by the looming federal election has now abated.  Yes, true.  But I think where are they going to mention the lack of consumer confidence brought about by Opel, brought about by Spencer Street, brought about by La Crosse, brought about by mascot towers.  I would say that's a huge, huge uncertainty that's dwelling in everyone's mind.  How many people would never buy an apartment, at least in Sydney?  So property in Australia is overvalued, but it's less overvalued than it was, Mr.  Richardson said.  I don't know, people trying to sell a one-bedroom apartment near the airport in Sydney on ex-swamp ground or industrial ground.  think that's overvalued.  i think should be 200 grand not 750. property prices are still silly yes but not as much sure.  don't worry they'll print more money.  it'll all work out in the end.  and he said the push and chop between china and the us regarding trade was a concern but that it actually benefited australian econ economically in the short term.  The push and shove between our main political ally, the US, and our main economic partner, China, is indeed worrying for Australia.  But the good news for Australia is that China has responded by throwing stimulus at the construction sector which has pushed iron ore prices, for example, to a five-year high.  Now, let's have a look here at, for those of you that aren't aware, this is my favorite website, the Observatory of Economic Complexity.  And this is looking at Australia here.  And you can see, you can see here, iron ore of our export is 20%.  of australia's exports 20 of our entire exports.  we look here at our um trade balance.  yep now these are all the different countries and i'll just move it up so it doesn't cover my picture that we're trading with.  this is where our trade.  all of our trade goes to 35 is to china and 3.5 is to united states.  now this is a great website if you just want to get an understanding of what all these things are.  you know where all the hippies are worried about.  they want to get rid of call.  they want to get rid of iron ore.  they want to you know decimate our industry our export industry because they want to save the planet.  and you know if you look at how much china is actually importing of call and how little of it comes from australia and it's just insane.  It just shows you they don't actually, for their whole global opinions, they don't actually have a global perspective on these type of things.  So yes, what I'll do is I'll bring this title up again.  You saw it before, guys.  The Observatory of Economic Complexity, if you're interested in having a look, because I encourage you to become familiar with it.  because it's really good.  it helps helps you get a better understanding what people are talking about here and thinking about the big picture that a lot of the hippies tend to miss out when they're sitting on their canoes on the story bridge in river trying to end a mine.  yep that's it probably causing more damage to the economy and environment by delaying people for the hours and peak hour.  but we can't think like that.  so the broader point is that there is a big gap between where our political and economic loyalty lies, and the trade war between the US and China could be at risk, could be a risk, but not currently because of, because of as today, it's pushed a little bit extra money into the Australian economy.  So the trade war between the, well, let's see, renegotiating the trade agreements between the US and China is proving economically beneficial to Australia.  So Trump's been good for us.  Is that what you're saying in this article, Kerry?  So this is written by, was it by Kerry or Alexis?  Alexis Kerry for news.com.au.  I think it gives an interesting perspective.  Ray Dalio, he's an interesting character.  Learn a bit more about him and his past.  When your wealth is measured in billions, I think maybe we should listen to or maybe think about your suggestions regarding the economy.  because um you might know what you're doing anyway guys that's uh that's me for today.  please like share and subscribe ding the bell to see my daily updates.  if you were watching the live stream yesterday uh which i had to cut short to go do a. you know a Late night dad chemist run.  Odilia is fine.  I think we've got a tummy bug going through all the kids.  So the first one that had it, she's 100% now and is running around being a little terror.
