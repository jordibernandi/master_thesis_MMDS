            "text": "Many of you might know that recently, just prior to April 1st, Tinder had stated that they would introduce a height verification feature on their app.  As it turned out, it was an April Fool's joke, as they revealed later, but I think the fact that they announced this in the first place has some interesting implications for the online meat market or dating scene as we're want to call it now.  the height verification was essentially one related to being six feet tall.  for people outside of the united states that's approximately one hundred and eighty three centimeters and this isn't anything new.  we all know that heterosexual females like tall men or men that are taller than they are preferably six feet or above.  there are tons of data on this topic.  so for example that in certain dating apps men who state that they are six foot two or taller receive some incredibly high percentage sometimes sixty seventy percent more responses than men who are five foot seven or five foot eight.  nothing new under the sun, we also understand the evolutionary bias and basis of this.  It makes perfect sense.  But what I really want to do is take the time to examine some of the underlying reasons why this stunt was pulled.  Let's look at the first one.  They can get away with it.  And by get away with it, I mean, is this not the most blatant form of gynocentrism we can see?  Well, it almost is.  It's only a small fraction of men in the United States, approximately 15%, that are over 6 feet tall.  But the idea here is that we've progressed incrementally or perhaps rapidly to the point where People can make such outlandish jokes and get away with it without any problem.  I've seen other instances of this, less joking, the Gillette commercial where men were denigrated.  But in this case, it's just saying, look at all you fools who don't meet X criterion, and the criterion in this case being a criterion demanded by women, and it's not a problem.  They're not really penalized for it.  I want you gentlemen, for the purposes of discussion, to imagine what the outcome would have been in the event that Tinder, for some bizarre reason, stated we require weight verification on the part of females or hair length verification.  We all know that the trumpets of justice would have been sounded and everyone would have been up in arms and horrified by this.  It's obvious that there's been a double standard for quite some time.  But I would argue in this Tinder April Fool's joke that it really has reached the height of absurdity, no pun intended, because you clearly could never, ever get away with the reverse.  And even though there were some quote-unquote thoughtful responses in the forums of news articles and people blogging and logging about it, very few of these pointed out to the blatant hypocrisy on display here.  Again, if there had been weight verification requirements, Everyone would have been up in arms.  Now, I want to add a second point to this, and that is quite simply that a lot of this has to do with just plain market dynamics and economics.  The people that profit the most from Tinder, and let's be honest what Tinder is, it's a fuck app.  Yes, some people find quote-unquote meaningful relationships through Tinder, and yes, perhaps some people even find long-term partnerships through Tinder.  But they are the small, if not tiny, minority here.  The vast majority of people use Tinder as a fuck-app.  The very basis of it is predicated on the most primal of human instincts, looking at people's pictures and swiping left or right, depending on how the person looks.  Therefore, it's pretty obvious.  And in this market... We have to apply the Pareto principle of 80-20, and it's probably a little skewed, as in not exactly 80-20, but I think it's very safe to say that in this case, the vast majority of the quote-unquote successful people on Tinder are females.  And the successful men are a vanishingly small fraction.  And by that I mean the majority of people using it on a consistent basis, reaping results and gaining rewards from interacting with Tinder.  So let's say it's about 80%, maybe 70%.  Still a large majority who are women who are successful in the sense that they have intercourse, which is what they sought to do.  It's not that women don't want to have casual sex, as some people still claim.  It's just that countless repetition of casual sex tends to tarnish their reputation and their prospects for quote-unquote marriage and long-term relationships.  This is a tired old topic.  You all know the deal there.  The cock carousel, right?  But women are more successful, and they're effectively the larger clients there.  Now, even if it's the case that men, say, were to pay more into making use of the application, you still have the majority of people there being women.  And so it's only natural that Tinder, inasmuch as it wants the app to be as viable as possible, would make a joke that appeals to its major demographic, which is females.  So I think those are the two most salient points here to be made.  However, beyond that, and this is speculation on my part, I think there are other potential consequences and implications down the line.  I think we're going to see a world where increasingly men simply don't engage in the online context with women because of the prohibitive nature of those interactions.  it might have been a joke sure but we all know that famed expression that famed saying which goes as follows there's always a little bit of truth contained in every lie and i think this is a perfect example of that.  i've made videos in the past talking about how the mean of people And mostly the mean of men are being squeezed out of the circles of social accessibility and social mobility.  And this is a great example of quite blatantly in the form of a joke, albeit, but still quite blatantly saying, look, you don't have access to this feature.  most men do not fall within that height category and therefore by definition are either within the mean or below the mean or much closer to the mean if slightly above it.  so i think these predictions that i had made in the past are slowly but surely coming true and this april fool's joke was a great indication and manifestation of that showing the world and men, A, what people can get away with in terms of their sloganeering, to say, we're going to add a height verification, B, how far things have come to the point where you can essentially make these proclamations without any penalty or punishment, and the social costs that one would normally incur or might have incurred at an earlier age are not there.  However, reversed, it's quite obvious there would have been weight requirements, hair length requirements, things of that nature.  And C, the idea that the basic guy, the average man, is increasingly being squeezed out ever more rapidly from the game.  Now, this may have the consequence that men who feel squeezed out just don't bother.  It's a very difficult and sensitive topic in MGTOW circles, and by no means can anyone ever say that MGTOW is uniform or a monolith in terms of the men who comprise it, which is to say, of course, that some men who go MGTOW, not many of them, have been wildly successful with women.  some on the opposite end have had no success.  and then every stripe and spot in between.  after years of surveying the mgtow population it seems to me to be the most probable account of most mgtows somewhere in the middle perhaps average.  and if that's so it just might be the case that in the future we'll see even more men leaving behind the dating scene in general but specifically online dating.  as to the best of my knowledge most mctow minded men have done deciding to quote unquote go their own way because the options just aren't there and as much as they are available the cost benefit isn't there either.  or as barbarossa famously said many many aeons ago the juice just isn't worth the squeeze.  and to reiterate my original point as much as this tinder april fool's joke was a joke.  every lie and consequently every joke contains a hint of truth i think because otherwise it wouldn't be effective.  Why was this, for example, so effective?  It was effective because it was based on a very real requirement, a reality that women constantly express that they have a height preference in men.  The average male, and increasingly the above average male, is going to get squeezed out ever more quickly, ever more rapidly, and this is a perfect sign of the times.  If you're below a certain height threshold, you're out of it.  And on a final point concerning this issue, it seems to me the plethora of articles we used to see, say, in the mid-ish 2000s, early 2010s of where have all the good men gone, that has largely stopped.  You don't see too much of it anymore because the quote-unquote problem is so overt and so obvious.  that no one really wants to speak of it, because to speak of it would acknowledge that the problem might be without solution, at least as current technology in society stands.  What that problem is, is things like the 80-20 rule, runaway hypergamy on the part of women, and such things.  And that's not something you can solve overnight, possibly even long term, given the current trajectory of human civilization.  Anyway, I wanted to weigh in on this because I think this whole Tinder's April Fool's joke was very prophetic, very confirming of things I've stated in the past, and very illustrative of our times, which is to say things have definitely gotten worse.  I'm reasonably certain that 10 years ago this would not have been possible.  Anyway, as always, thanks for tuning in, and if I'm still alive, I will check you out later.
