Well, as we already know, the trade departments only managed to sign eight of them.  But Newsnight has discovered that even those eight deals the trade departments managed to get over the line are not quite as comprehensive as advertised.  Our economics editor, Ben Chu, is here.  Just talk us through that, Ben.  Why not? ",

But if we left the EU with no deal, we would not benefit from those, which is why the government's made it one of its priorities to try and roll over these deals.  So we will continue to benefit from these arrangements, no matter what.  Liam Fox a couple of years ago said this would be a pretty easy job.  He predicted that there would be 40 of these deals all lined up to be rolled over by tomorrow.  In fact, as you mentioned, we know there's only going to be about eight ready by tomorrow.  But Newsnight has further bad news because we've been digging into these eight deals along with a group called the UK Trade Policy Observatory.  And we've discovered... ",

            "text": "Well, the most important concept to get into mind is the rules of origin.  Now, this is a picture of trade agreements whereby the stipulation is to benefit from zero tariffs, the inputs have to be from that country which is doing the exporting.  So let's think about this in the context of the UK-Switzerland trade deal, which has been rolled over.  So it's fine for the UK to export to Switzerland tariff-free.  But a problem arises if that importer in Switzerland decides he wants to re-export that UK good to somewhere else in the EU.  Now, that could run into tariff walls.  Why is that?  Well, it's because it's got UK inputs.  The EU does not, would not, have a trade agreement with the UK.  Right.  Therefore, the tariffs would be applicable.  And the danger is that the Swiss importing company could decide, well, we're not going to source our inputs from the UK anymore because those goods were going to face tariffs when we re-export them.  There is another feature of this analysis, though, Emily.  It's called mutual recognition agreements.  The EU-Swiss agreement had 20 of these mutual recognition agreements.  This is about standards, certification,  etc.,  But the UK Swiss one only has three of them.  And some quite important areas are left out, such as medical devices and building materials.  So, again, the threat is that UK companies which export those kind of things to Switzerland could have to fill out a lot of forms, be quite time-consuming, quite costly. ",
