            "text": "Out.  Hello everyone and welcome to The Vortex, where lies and falsehoods are trapped and exposed.  I'm Michael Voris coming to you from Rome, where in the midst of the controversial Amazon Synod, we're also chasing down other unrelated stories as well.  Each day we will bring you an update on the Synod proceedings, but as we said, there's much more to report from Rome than just the Synod.  One of those stories, which has just been dropped by the Catholic media world, is the ongoing scandal involving the finances of the Papal Foundation.  Church Middleton has learned exclusively that board members of the foundation and the overall membership have been lied to by members of the U.S.  hierarchy about a certain $25 million.  Here's the background first.  Last year, soon after the news of McCarrick broke and grabbed headlines all over the world, it came out that the charitable organization, the Papal Foundation, had been manipulated by McCarrick in part to send a $25 million grant to the Vatican.  Directly involved in McCarrick's plotting was Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the point man in getting the board of directors to approve the loan.  The money was supposedly earmarked for, here, the IDI Hospital in Rome.  IDI stands for the Immaculate Dermatological Institute here in Rome.  Owing to the church's long-standing presence and involvement in charitable work here in Italy, it is not uncommon at all for the Vatican to have deep involvement with hospitals all over the country.  The problem with IDIs that has been scandal-plagued for years, massively in debt, hundreds of millions of euros, staring bankruptcy right in the face.  There was a time recently when it was so heavily in red that employees were not being paid, and they actually held a strike in the hospital's parking lot demanding their paychecks.  So when McCarrick and Wuerl approached the board of directors of the Papal Foundation in the U.S.  to fork over $25 million, many of them balked, concerned that money they had all personally put up to assist the Pope's personal charities was being misspent.
