And right now, this is an opinion piece from Washington Post.  Tulsi Gabbard's Syria record shows why she can't be president.  So again, this goes back to the narrative of Tulsi Gabbard, Representative Tulsi Gabbard meeting up with President Bashir al-Assad.  So the article starts off like this.  Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard talks about her trip, January 2017 trip to Syria when she was Bashir al-Assad, toured Aleppo after it had been reduced to rubble by the Assad regime and interviewed Syrian civilians there.  and the regime-approved opposition, who unanimously told her Assad was a better option for Syria than the terrorists.  But Gabbard never talks about her other trip to the Turkish-Syrian border with a group of lawmakers in June 2015, when she met the Assadic opposition leaders, victims of Assad's barrel bombs, and members of the volunteer rescue brigade known as the White Helmets.

And so all these people, these world leaders in the United States, from Reagan to Obama to Bush, they meet with these questionable world leaders.  And the thing is, no one says, oh, that was really bad for you to do that, or why did you do that in the first place?  First, those meetings were arranged.  Representative Tulsi Gabbard went to Syria on a fact-finding mission.  Fact-finding mission.  At no point during that entire trip when it was being planned, was there any mention or plan to meet or have a sit-down meeting with Assad.  That was never in the plan.  It just happened when it happened.  And Representative Tulsi Gabbard, because she is not only that a service member in the Hawaiian National Guard, but also sits on various boards in regards to foreign policy, she had to go there and figure out what is the main cause of this civil war.  And she met with the leader of Syria, which is something that every representative in the United States Congress and Senate knows.  should be prepared to do.  if you're going to go to another foreign country there's a very good chance that you are going to meet with the executive leader of said country representative tulsi gabbard didn't do anything wrong.  but the article goes on to this.  it starts saying that how tulsi gabbard is an assad apologist and how she is a supporter of russia and how her candidacy should not be taken seriously because she has significant chance of being present, but because her narrative on Syria is deeply incorrect, immoral, and un-American, if it were adopted by her party and the country, it would lead the United States down a serious, perilous moral and strategic path.  So in other words, Washington Post in its opinion piece is basically saying that Tulsi Gabbard shouldn't sit down with any world leader, nor should we try and make any kind of peace agreements with any countries.

What they're saying directly to the writers is, hey, if you're on the Foreign Affairs Committee, you work in foreign affairs, you're visiting a country to meet with the people to figure out whether or not it's right to bomb or declare war on a country or not.  you shouldn't meet with the leader if they reach out to you.  And if we are to believe, and again, if we are to believe that Assad is this pure dictator who is evil at his heart that likes chowing down on children every morning, that seems like if you're by yourself in Syria, maybe the kind of guy that you don't say no to when he's asked for a meeting on one hand.  But again, that's not the reality either way.  Any way you spin this, Assad going \u2013 go back to that.  Joe Rogan experience with Barry Weiss when she said, oh, she's a toady for Assad.  She doesn't even know the definition of toady.  This is nothing more than a situation of groupthink repetition that the people that say that, oh, she's an Assad apologist, never \u2013 thought of it themselves.  In every case that a regular person says that, they heard it from someone else.  There's no one that said that, because if that was the case, then many people would be saying the exact same thing about Nancy Pelosi.  And again, I'll say what I said in the earlier show, I thought we cared about our veterans.

Washington Post, because let's face it, they like neoliberal establishment candidates.  They mentioned Kamala Harris at least three times in this article on how Harris was telling Anderson Cooper that Representative Tulsi Gabbard is just defending Assad.  But in fact, Tulsi Gabbard is not defending Assad.  Tulsi Gabbard went there to get information about what was causing the civil war.  And let's face it, Assad and the Syrian government was also trying to back away from the petrol dollar.  And there's a lot of oil and there's a key pipeline area that can be built through Syria and could benefit the United States only if said government was removed and only if said government was no longer allied to Russia.  Because let's face it, Syria, as it currently stands, is allied to Russia, and the United States and a lot of the fossil fuel industries that are associated with the United States want to make profit.  They want to make money, and they want to make sure that it's easy for them to make money.  One of the main reasons why we're in all these wars overseas, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Syria, in Libya, and even in Yemen too, is because we want to control the petrol.  We want to control our control over the oil.  We want to make sure that there are governments put in place that will do our bidding so that every other country in that region uses the petrodollar.
