            "text": "We've gotten through three chapters of the Bible.  Time for some murder.  But first, a lovemaking scene.  Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.  She said, With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.  Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.  Now Abel kept flocks and Cain worked the soil.  Damn!  Cain got this romantic love story.  They made love and made him.  Abel got nothing.  He is obviously the Bible's first accident.  Also, usually, writers save the sex scenes for later in the book.  But the Bible practically opens up with it.  See?  Genesis does refer to a Big Bang.  Sorry, I'll shut this channel down.  I wonder what they did with the fig leaves.  Like, did they just move them aside?  Did they get new ones?  Why did Eve say, with the help of the Lord, she had a baby?  What did God have to do with it?  He didn't poof Cain into existence like he did with Adam.  And how's that for a childhood for Cain and Abel?  They were born and then they got put to work.  In the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.  and abel also brought an offering fat portions from some of the first-born of his flock.  the lord looked with favor on abel and his offering but on cain and his offering he did not look with favor.  so cain was very angry and his face was downcast.  They always loved the younger child more.  At least God is relatable here.  I mean, he gets a gift of fruit and he's furious.  He wants the meat.  Give him the good stuff.  God won't be satisfied until he has a slaughtered baby animal in his mouth.  Then the Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry?  Why is your face downcast?  If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?  But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door.  It desires to have you, but you must rule over it.  Why is he even asking, why are you angry?  He's God.  He knows the answer.  It doesn't even take God to answer the question.  Cain gave God a gift and God rejected it.  I'd be upset, too.  And God's message here is very confusing.  What's a sin, anyway?  I mean, so far, the only sin we really know about is eating the wrong fruit, a pineapple.  But slaughtering animals is apparently okay.  You can't avoid a sin if you're not told which sins are sins.  Now Cain said to his brother Abel, Let's go out to the field.  While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.  Whoa!  Plot twist!  Also, lazy writing.  I mean, come on, people.  Show.  Don't tell.  who had premeditated murder in the pool for God's first human death.  I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say Cain did not rule over sin.  He had one job.  He failed.  Actually, wait, I take that back.  God hasn't actually said murder is a sin yet, which means that's perfectly fine.  So far, eating from the wrong tree is bad.  Murder.  We'll get to it eventually.  And think about the motive for this murder.  Cain is jealous that God loves Abel's gift more than his.  That's it!  Sky Daddy showed more affection to somebody else.  By that logic, it's a miracle that we don't live in a world full of only-childs.  How awkward would it have been if Abel prayed right before he was killed?  God, I just gave you an offering.  Help me out here?  No?  Nothing?  I'm just getting stabbed now?  That's it.  I'm an atheist.  Then the Lord said to Cain, Where is your brother Abel?  I don't know, he replied.  Am I my brother's keeper?  Why does God keep losing people?  You know, it's one thing when God ignores starving children in poor countries.  I mean, there are billions of people in the world.  He can't keep track of everyone.  But right now, he only has four people to watch.  And he's apparently not paying attention to the kids, which any parent would tell you is just chaos waiting to happen.  And yes, Cain has to be his brother's keeper.  No one else in this story seems to take any responsibility.  By the way, Cain just lied to God by saying he doesn't know where Abel is.  Why didn't God just strike him down then and there?  The Lord said, What have you done?  Listen, your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.  Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.  When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you.  You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.  And with that, we have the first biblical layoff.  I kind of want Cain to say, So what if I can't grow anything?  I'll just eat from one of your trees.  Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is more than I can bear.  Today you are driving me from the land and I will be hidden from your presence.  I will be a restless wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me.  You just stabbed someone.  And God's punishment was saying, you don't have to work anymore.  That's a pretty sweet punishment.  Stop acting like your life is over.  You're free now.  Go find new work.  Maybe you can get hired as a guard in the Garden of Eden since people just take fruit anytime they want.  Also, why is Cain afraid of death?  Who else is wandering the Earth just waiting to murder him?  We haven't met any other characters, much less potential murderers.  The only people who could murder him at this point are his parents.  And being a restless wanderer on Earth isn't really a big deal considering all of Earth at this point is like Eden and the land right around it.  You're moving over to the next subdivision, okay?  Calm down.  But the Lord said to him, Not so.  Anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.  Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill  him.\".  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  God was just carrying around this immortality mark and didn't even offer it to Abel?  That mother... And again, what's with the justice system here?  Kill your brother, lose your job.  Kill a killer?  Something seven times worse.  Why seven?  That is so arbitrary.  And what punishment is seven times worse than whatever you would get for murder?  It's also illogical.  God says Cain's killer would suffer seven times as much as he did, but Cain arguably didn't suffer.  Seven times zero... Either God is pulling a fast one over Cain, or God can't do basic math.  Even if someone pops up, how would they know what the mark stands for?  Does it say something on it?  What's gonna happen if they stab him?  Is it like a shield?  Do they get some sort of electrical shock?  Is it an invisibility cloak?  I mean, someone explain how God works his magic.  So Cain went out from the Lord's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.  Cain made love to his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch.  Cain was then building a city and he named it after his son Enoch.  That's it?  They made love again?  Genesis is like the least kinky book in the Bible.  And wait a minute!  Back up!  Wife?  What wife?  Where did this wife come from?  Adam and Eve had two sons and one just gotten married and the writers are just glossing over where she came from?  What if she's a sister?  That's a weird plot hole.  This is either incest or there are people alive that Eve didn't give birth to.  Which means she's not Eve, the mother of all creation.  Take your pick.  There are no good options.  And did you hear how Cain went out of God's presence when he went to Nod?  There's no God in Nod.  Which means God isn't everywhere.  Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of God?  To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.  Lamech married two women, one named Ada and the other Zillah.  Ada gave birth to Jabal.  He was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.  Okay, for your sake, I'll skip over commentary on the genealogy.  I just want to know where all these women are coming from.  And notice how they just quickly ran over how Lamech married two women at once.  Polygamy?  A-okay in the Bible.  And we're told Jabal gave birth to people who lived in tents and raised livestock.  But I would love to know what the alternatives were.  What other jobs and homes were available to them?  His brother's name was Jubal.  He was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.  Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron.  Tubal-Cain's sister was Naama.  Tubal-Cain?  Already with the hyphenated names.  Damn biblical hipsters.  Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Zillah, listen to me.  Wives of Lamech, hear my words.  I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.  If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.  He's speaking in the third person while complaining to his wives?  Who wrote this?  Who's he killing anyway?  Don't these people have anything else to do?  And 77 times the punishment?  Who made these rules?  77 times zero.  Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.  Seth also had a son, and he named him Enos.  At that time, people began to call on the name of the Lord.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We have to talk about the family dynamics here.  You don't tell the third child he's the replacement for the dead middle child.  That's traumatic.  And weird.  And disrespectful, too, since it totally ignores Seth's individuality.  And how old are Adam and Eve at this point?  We just went through the bloodline for like a dozen generations, and Adam and Eve are still banging?  I mean, good for them.  Also, ew.  Also, how?  In the next chapter, we're gonna see that Adam is 130 years old when Seth is born.  I don't have a comment about that.  I just want you to picture it, because I had to.  Moral of the story?  God loves murder.  God's creations love murder.  There's no punishment for murder.  And Adam and Eve were taking their fig leaves off.  well past the age everything would have been working.  Now that's a miracle. ",
