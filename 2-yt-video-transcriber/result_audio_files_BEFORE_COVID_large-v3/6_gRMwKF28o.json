            "text": "A couple weekends ago I had an encounter with a street preacher at the Seal Beach Pier.  I posted briefly about it on Facebook, and some folks there wished I'd either had a video or wondered if I could take a minute to provide some detail.  So I'm going to try to recreate that conversation here to the best of my recollection.  But I'll have to play both parts as I'm pressed for time and all of my actor friends are busy.  It all began when he told me that I was either playing for God's team or the devil's.  He tried to hand me some literature, and I told him I play for the other team.  Let's pick it up there.  Sweet.  What, you play for Satan?  Well, I'm an atheist activist.  Does that count?  Oh, you're one of those people who think that everything just came from nothing.  So that car, that building, how did those come about?  I'm guessing people made them?  Okay, so who made the sky?  Who made the ocean behind me?  I don't know, and neither do you.  Yes, I do.  I know because the evidence is all around us.  Oh, you have evidence because I'm all about the evidence.  I do.  Everything around us is evidence of God's glory.  Oh, well, that's great because I've been looking for some Christian to give me the evidence I need.  Maybe you can do that.  Yeah, maybe I can.  Okay, so you believe in the Bible, right?  You believe it's the Word of God?  Yes, sir, I do.  Okay, so in the book of John, chapter 14, Jesus tells his followers that they will do greater works than he did, okay?  Specifically, Jesus says that there are certain signs that will follow his true believers, like handling serpents and drinking any kind of poison without being harmed.  I've actually done that.  You've done what?  I've been bitten by a poisonous snake and nothing happened.  You have?  Yeah.  Well, that's awesome because you already know it works.  Exactly.  So then what I'd like you to do is just do that or something like that in a controlled setting so that we can find out that it works.  If you don't want to get bit by a snake again, I understand that, you could raise the dead or cure someone's blindness.  The Bible says you should be able to do all of those things.  Ah, yes it does, but the Bible needs to be interpreted.  Well, how else would you interpret that?  Some things aren't to be taken literally.  You mean like Jesus rising from the dead?  No, that happened literally.  Okay, so how do you know that that literally happened but being bitten by snakes?  Wait, you said you got bit by a poisonous snake and nothing happened, so obviously that one's literal, right?  Let's just do that.  Well, I think that would be tempting God.  No, Jesus said you'd be able to do these things.  And Mark it says that these are literally signs that will follow those that believe.  Take up serpents, drink any deadly drink, heal the sick.  Yes, but the Bible also says that a wicked and adulterous generation seeks signs.  So you believe Jesus was wicked for telling his followers that these are the signs that will accompany his true believers?  No, I didn't say that Jesus was wicked.  I'm not saying that.  You know, the Bible also says a prophet who says something and then that thing doesn't come to pass is a false prophet.  So if you can't do these things, either you're not a true follower of Jesus or Jesus was a false prophet.  I mean, Jesus said nothing will be impossible to you if you have the faith of a mustard seed.  I don't even know how we would go about doing something like you're suggesting.  Well, I'm actually connected up with an organization that'll handle all of it, and they'll give you a million dollars if you can actually do something supernatural.  Just think of how many people you could help with that money.  I mean, that'll buy a lot of pamphlets, right?  A million dollars.  Right.  Like, I'm going to believe that for a second.  Well, you don't have to.  I'm not asking you to have faith.  I'll arrange all of it and then prove it to you before you get snakebit again.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Why do you hate God so much?  Well, for the same reason you hate Vishnu or Allah or the Mormon God.  I don't hate any of them.  You don't believe in them.  No, I don't, so?  And I don't believe in your God, but I don't hate him.  I just think he's evil.  Wait, you think that the God who came down here and died for your sins is evil.  well any being who creates evil is by definition evil.  right.  in isaiah god literally says i create evil.  can you think of anything more evil than that?  god had to create evil to test us?  no he didn't.  god knew who would end up in heaven so he could have just created heaven and the people who would end up there.  god knows everything right.  yeah God knows.  He does, yeah.  But he also knew who would end up being tortured forever in hell, and he still created them anyway.  Would you do that?  Look, I don't pretend to know how God works, okay?  I don't know how he does what he does.  Well, he does evil because he is evil.  He commits genocide.  He orders people to commit genocide.  He told the Hebrews to kill young women who couldn't show evidence of virtue on their wedding night.  When he knew that a young woman's hymen could break prior to intercourse, that's just evil, isn't it?  You know what?  There's no way you don't believe in God.  I mean, there's no way you can hate someone this much and not believe that they exist.  Well, I don't believe that you're a believer, because if you were, you would show me the signs Jesus said you'd be able to show me.  You know, Jesus didn't condemn Thomas for not believing until he saw for himself, and God has been proving himself with signs and miracles forever.  But God wants you to have faith.  So then why did Jesus raise people from the dead and heal the sick?  I mean, the disciples didn't need faith, right?  Jesus just proved to them who he was with signs and miracles.  Why can't he do that now?  Why can't you do that?  Miracles still happen every day, my friend.  Okay, so then do the miracles Jesus said you'd be able to do as a true believer.  He said nothing would be impossible for you, and you just said that he's doing miracles every day.  Yeah, but you don't understand.  You need to believe first.  Then God will reveal himself to you.  I did.  I used to be a believer, but I never saw these signs and I couldn't do them myself.  Oh, right.  I don't believe for a second you were ever a believer.  So what?  Now you're accusing me of lying?  That doesn't sound very Christ-like.  You know what, sir?  You may not believe it, but I know that Jesus loves you.  So you have a good day.  He loves me so much he created evil and hell so that he could torture me forever.  You have a good day.  He left after our conversation.  I don't know why.  When this actually happened, a small crowd had gathered, and when I finally broke eye contact with my new friend, those folks all had big smiles on their faces.  I guess no one really likes people standing around and trying to get others to believe in the evil being they worship.  Who knew, right?  Hopefully you enjoyed that as much as I did when it actually happened.  Thanks for watching.  We'll see you next time on Mr.  Peace Theater. ",
