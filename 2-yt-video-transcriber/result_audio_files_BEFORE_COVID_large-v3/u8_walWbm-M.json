            "text": "Look, there's the Black Holocaust.  I knew it was prophecy.  A thousand times worse than the Jewish atrocities.  Uneven playing field, there'll never be a fair score.  Because in 1619, that's when they declared war.  We the 12 tribes, the ones that the promise reaches.  Yes.  He wrestled with an angel, and the Mosai and the angel changed his name to Israel, meaning princess power, meaning he has power with God.  Jacob means supplanter.  Israel means you have power with God because Mosai has power.  Like, you're most likely from the tribe of Judah, right?  You're a Negro, right?  So according to the blessing that he gave our tribe, the Mosai hears you.  Mosai hears your parents.  Mosai hears Judah.  So our names mean something.  That's why they took them away from us.  That's why you don't have your Hebraic name that we come from.  You have some white Caucasian name that they made up.  Because your name means something.  So, you got a question?  I never knew about religion, even though I grew up in church.  I was in faith and worship, and I was teaching in the college.  And all I heard was, now I'm talking to my mom.  I'm saying, Mom, it's true.  I have to correct you on one thing about speaking in tongues.  What do you mean by speaking in tongues?  Well, I'm going to work because I'm going to work.  I love it.  I love it.  And for him to do whatever I was doing for the most part, he was hurt.  So sometimes I agree with how y'all preach and stuff, but it's still a certain way that you have to come to the people.  You know what I'm saying?  Because, you know, we all got a college, but it's a certain way.  Sometimes y'all come with what's important.  You know what I'm saying?  And God is the God of love.  But he's not a, he's a God of balance, too.  Yeah, and we, and I want to say, too, we don't.  But, okay, okay, we're done with Satan.  We're done with him.  You free?  It's a mindset.  Yeah, I'm free to mind.  I'm wealthy.  Hold on, you free?  I'm wealthy.  Can you leave America without getting a passport or anything?  I mean, that don't mean, I mean, if I want to leave, I'm like.  No, you're free.  I mean, if I want to, I mean, if I, if I say, God, give it away, well, I can leave America without a passport.  So you're, you're from the top of Judah then, right?  Yeah.  So what you know, so what are you going to do about it?  Well, what I'm going to do about it, I'm going to do, like I just told y'all my testimony.  My testimony was not, it wasn't in a church.  It was through direct prayer.  You know what I'm saying?  I never knew this until I grew up in the church.  But I never knew what I was doing.  Give me Deuteronomy 12.  Do you know how to reach?  I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say this.  Do you actually, even though you're talking about this guy, do you know your God?  See, I know my God.  I know how to worship my God.  Okay.  Are you just speaking out the word?  Do you know how to pray?  Well, the Bible says, the Bible has a specific way of saying, you know him.  Do you keep the commandments?  I know him.  I know him.  I knew him to pray.  You know what I'm saying?  God said, ain't no man righteous.  We only righteous to him.  Ain't no man righteous.  We all in sin.  We were born in sin.  Ain't no man righteous.  Only through him.  Read that scripture.  You ain't even righteous.  You probably did all the hell.  You done did all the hell in the world.  I'm just saying.  You're not righteous.  Ain't no man righteous.  No man is righteous.  This is the book of 1 John chapter 3 verse 4.  Whosoever committed sin?  This is the book of 1 John chapter 2 verse 3.  And hereby we do know that we know him and we keep his commandments.  Who ain't committing no sins?  Look, God said we only write this for you.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, sis.  Let me tell y'all.  I have committed sins.  Sis, sis.  talking to me okay no no no you have to listen.  you we having a conversation.  you've been talking.  you gotta let me talk too.  okay go ahead raise my hand if you have me up for anything.  that's not the thing okay are you?  okay?  we're not saying how you've ever said.  i'm actually Sis, sis, sis, sis, you've said a lot since you've been up here, right?  Do y'all want to hear me say the poor thing?  Do y'all want to hear me say the poor thing?  I'm going to tell you right now, that brother, he don't want to hear you.  Now, I don't mind hearing you, but here's the problem.  You just came up here.  We got a lot.  We're reading the Bible.  I'm reading the Word of God.  Is the Word of God the truth?  Is the Word of God the truth?  Do you know that?  What's his name?  You speak in tongues, right?  What's his name?  What's his name?  What's his name?  What's the name of God?  What's the name of God?  What's the name of God?  I hear more of that every day.  What's the name of God?  Do you know God's name?  Listen, I'm not Judah.  I'm Levi.  I'm Levi.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm the child of Moses.  And this is the praise and sipping.  You better watch out.  You know God?  What's this say right here?  What's this say right here?  What's this say right here?  Okay, many are called.  Few are chosen.  I'm chosen, baby.  I'm chosen.  I'm chosen.  All right?  I'm chosen.  Proverbs 9 and 13.  See, the Bible.  Let me tell you something about the Bible.  You said I'm not called.  You said I'm not called.  All right?  Now you changed it.  That's me, the Bible.  Remember what God said.  Read it.  This is the book of Proverbs 29, verse 13.  A famous woman is clever.  She is simple.  She is simple.  She is simple and knoweth nothing.  And foolish women and screamers.  She is simple and no with nothing.  She is simple and no with nothing.  She is loud.  She is loud.  This is a bigger paragraph.  Chapter 7 and verse 11.  She is loud and stubborn.  She is loud and stubborn.  She is loud and stubborn.  Her feet abided not in her house, nor is she with them, nor in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.  So she caught him and kissed him.  And with an impudent face, said unto him, I have peace offerings with me.  Now I gotta be a demon to come against these beggars, and I gotta go try to catch a beggar who's less dirty, who's not in the spirit of the most high.  That's all that is.  The Bible, see, that's the problem.  She's talking about she's the truth, but as soon as the Bible comes out, she's got a problem.  Why?  Because she's not the truth.  She's not the truth.  Isaiah 8 and 20.  It's the problem with these people, man.  Alright?  My people are so emotional.  See, I speak to God.  What was his name?  If you know him so good, she could have told me anything.  She could have made up a name, right?  And that could be who's talking to her.  I don't know.  She didn't even have enough thought to just make her name up because she don't know the Mosai God, right?  She know the Mosai God name right here on this staff in the language that he spoke to his people to, right?  But she didn't know that was standing right in front of her, you know?  This is the book of Isaiah, chapter 8, verse 20.  To the law and to the testimony.  To the law and to the testimony.  Read on.  And they speak not according to his word.  It is because there is no light in them.  That's right.  There's just no light in her, man.  That's why she was speaking against the Bible.  That's why she had such a problem with the Bible.  There's simply no light in that system, man.  And if she would have just listened and had a decent dialogue and let the brother elaborate to her, we could have showed her what the light is through the spirit of power.  We could have showed that.  But she don't want to hear the light.  Right?  Because she would rather remain in darkness and in filthiness.  Give me Isaiah 59 and 20 real quick.  Right?  Because that's what she don't understand.  She don't want to talk about, ain't no man righteous.  Ain't no man righteous.  Right?  But Jesus, right?  But what did Jesus Christ come to do?  You call Jesus Christ your high and shy black man.  What did he come to do?  This is the book of Isaiah, chapter 59, verse 20.  And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob.  You see that?  So we're supposed to be becoming righteous, because Christ is only coming to brothers who are striving for righteousness.  It's to them that are turning from transgression in David.  So those amongst the twelve tribes of Israel that are turning away from wickedness and turning to righteousness, turning to the law, such commandments, and faith, and who the world calls Christ, Yahushua, to only those people is Christ coming.  Point blank period, right?  To nobody else.  So she wants to come out here and talk about ain't nobody righteous.  Well, you better be turning to righteousness.  You better be striving for righteousness.  See, people want to use that excuse, ain't nobody righteous, as an excuse in a cult to be wicked in sin.  And that's the problem, man.  Anybody who touches us touches the apple of God's eyes.  So you hate God to enslave his people?  You guys Christian?  We Israelites.  What are you, Christian?  Yeah, don't worry about it.  What do you mean don't worry?  How are you going to ask me a question?  I can't ask you one?  Because I just see what you guys was doing.  It's okay.  I'm not trying to engage you anymore.  Oh, so you're going to go to the... No, it's okay.  You know what I'm saying?  It's okay.  We don't have to belittle white people.  I've seen what you guys did to the white people, right?  I've seen what you guys did to the white people, right?  I've seen what you guys did to the white people, right?  I've seen what you guys did to the white people, right?  I've seen what you guys did to the white people, right?  I've seen what you guys did to the white people, right?  What does that mean?  So did they leave?  No, no, I'm asking you, what does that mean?  What did Jesus Christ say?  Did Jesus say that?  Did Jesus say that?  Did I say I was the judge of that?  I'm reading the Bible, and this is what Jesus Christ said, so I believe it.  I believe you.  It depends on who's coming up.  First off, can you explain to me what that verse is?  You've asked me three questions before you've answered one of my questions.  You do realize that, right?  You do realize that, right?  You know you don't treat white people like this, right?  You don't.  You don't.  You don't.  Read it again.  Let's see if we can explain this to us.  Read it.  First lie.  If any man have an ear, let him hear.  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.  What does that mean?  Hey, let me see, let me see.  I'm asking you, I'm asking you.  Can you tell me what it means?  Let me see you split a seat with that rock.  I bet you can't even know seat with that rock.  I bet you can't even know seat with that rock.  You can't even know my phone.  You can't even know my phone.  You can't even know my phone.  That's right!  You can't even split.  no sin.  Hey, hey, sis, sis, sis, get some better brothers before you come out here talking to me.  All right.  Listen, listen.  Listen, listen.  Can you explain this Bible verse to me?  Can you explain?  No, no.  As soon as you explain the Bible verse to me.  You've asked me my first question before you've answered one of my questions.  Explain this verse to me.  All right, so who's going to take me?  No, no, no.  I'm asking you to explain it.  Explain it.  That's it.  Explain it.  It's simple as that.  Okay, so what does it mean?  What you mean?  It's simple as that.  Read it again.  No, tell me what it means.  It's simple as said.  Tell me what it means.  It's simple as said.  I'm too simple to understand it, so tell me what it means.  Listen, it's not up to you to take anybody into captivity.  I didn't say it was.  All right, so what do you say?  So who said it was?  So what do you say?  He that liveth in captivity.  I said Jesus Christ is going to come back to enslave people because that's what it says in the Bible.  All right, so what are you doing?  What are you saying?  If you preaching that, what is it?  Hold on.  Here's my question.  Here's my question.  Hold on.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  It's okay.  Don't worry about it.  Okay.  Do you believe that?  Do you believe that?  Do you believe it?  Yes.  Do you believe Jesus Christ is coming to enslave white people?  No.  So what does that base mean?  That's why I'm asking what does it mean?  All white people.  All right.  Which white person do you see out here?  All right.  James 21.  James 21.  All right.  All right.  Matter of fact.  Bring it out.  You guys are perverting the word of God.  Let's hear it now.  Here's the thing.  I read the word of God.  You haven't.  You haven't read it.  Read the Bible verse out.  This proves what we say.  Please.  You are perverting the word of God.  You are perverting the word of God.  See, this is what Christianity does.  This is what white Jesus does.  It makes Negroes like you weak.  It makes you weak.  It makes you not a real person.  You're weak.  Read it.  John 21 and 19.  God made that person weak for his children.  Now read this.  Listen to this.  Read it.  God raised up his iniquity for his truth.  You just said all the white people are having a slow death.  Hold on.  You got to listen to this, man.  You got to listen to this, man.  You're not listening to the Bible because you hate the Bible and you hate the word of God, but you love white people.  You're a clone.  And you're weak.  And you're everything that's wrong with the black man on the mountain today.  Everything.  And that super ass sister that went back, she's everything that's wrong with the black woman today, man.  Right?  Gonna talk about, can I take my ride and split a seat?  Alright?  You can't split an inch.  What's wrong with you?  Our people are out of their damn minds out here, man.  All for what?  All for the sake of what?  Loving white people.  This is crazy.  We want to come out here.  We want to teach our people about their greatness and what we need to do to please God.  And everyone just wants to come and argue with us because we don't love white people.  Right.  I mean, it's amazing to me, man.  That proves how sick a group of people are.  When all they want to do is talk about loving white people.  Right.  When we're telling them what they need to do to get in the good graces of God, which is keep the law, such commandments, and faith in Christ.  That simple.  Wait.  Jeremiah 2 and 25.  Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst.  But thou saidest, there is no hope.  Our people say there's no hope.  Our people are in a hopeless state.  But why are we hopeless?  Here's why.  Really?  No, for I have loved strangers.  I have what?  Loved strangers.  Because we love white people so much, that's why we're hopeless.  We have to stop loving them.  What's to love about these hideous beasts?  Can somebody explain?  I would love for someone to elaborate what's to love about people who have raped, robbed, been murdered, and enslaved and extorted their people for half a millennia.  What is to love about these people?  Please elaborate.  Read on.  For I love strangers, and after them will I go.  After what?  After them will I go.  We want to follow in the doctrines and the examples that they set for us as opposed to what is written in the book of God.  All these people who have come and put that cape on, that sister and that brother, that mistaken brother, were people who refused and talked over the word of God, yet proclaimed themselves to be believers in God.  That's how wild this is out here, man.  But God is true.  The Most High, Yahawa, is true, and every man is alive that saved the Most High.  Right?  Sharee.  Sirach 6 and 13.  Separate thyself from thine enemies.  That's what time it is, man.  We're in a time of separation.  Ideological, philosophical, spiritual separation.  We are.  Separate thyself from thine enemies and take heed of thy friends.  Yeah.  We even got to watch because you got to sell us amongst our people.  But with that, man, we're getting ready to go over here at the HRI camp, man.  We're going to give all praise out of the glory to Yahweh.  We're going to sing Yahweh's song.  Let's say Shalom.  Shalom. ",
