            "text": "Watchmen is the best series that I have ever watched.  And that's saying a lot, because I've seen Los Similadores.  Seriously, the show is both technically and narratively near perfect.  The writing is great.  I can't imagine that its look and feel could have been any better.  The soundtrack flawlessly fits every scene.  The acting and casting are completely on point and even little details like the transitions were often so well done that I found myself rewinding just to see them again.  Oh yeah, by the way, spoiler warning for everything!  It does start out kind of slow and might even be a bit confusing in the first couple of episodes especially for fans of the comic or the film who might be left wondering just what the relation is.  But it's so intriguing that you just can't help but continue watching.  And boy, are you rewarded for it.  Everything about this show was perfectly planned.  The way that it gradually explains itself, expands on seemingly minor details from earlier episodes, and introduces elements from the comic as it goes on, is so satisfying to watch.  It's like a never-ending stream of holy shit sort of moments.  And not the sort that many other franchises and adaptations painfully force either.  Where it's like, hey, this character you like?  Yep, they're in this.  We'll be taking 80% of the box office hits this year, thanks.  All of it makes perfect sense.  The narrative benefits from every little tie-in that there is.  Like the Hooded Justice origin story?  The way they explain that he wears a hood and a noose because he almost got lynched?  I love it.  The show even explicitly rejects the opportunity to bring one of the surviving main characters back.  Because, you know, there's just not any real reason to.  What a novel idea.  Normally these days you'd expect them to show up in the final boss fight and do their cool special move against the big bad and help save the day, or at the very least telepathically communicate with the main character when it looks like they're down and out and inspire them to get up and continue the fight.  But no, Watchmen's just like, nah, he's in jail and he never shows up.  Sorry, have Lube Man instead.  The show also tackles some important contemporary political themes, and really takes the kid's gloves off in many respects.  I mean, it starts off during the Tulsa Massacre, where white supremacists destroyed a black town and massacred its residents because they couldn't bear to see black people succeeding, an event that I'm sure most viewers didn't even know happened before watching the series.  And the main antagonists are white supremacists who replace clan hordes with Rorschach masks.  Straight up saying to the audience, yeah, so you were never actually supposed to like the violent far-right extremist character.  Which needed to be said pretty badly, considering that people like noted professional idiot Ted Cruz count Rorschach among their personal heroes.  There's also literally this exchange which is just amazing.  Because the scales have tipped way too far.  And it is extremely difficult to be a white man in America.  God, this series makes all the right people incredibly mad for all the right reasons.  It rules.  But at the same time, the protagonists themselves are cops who raid poor communities and brutalize their inhabitants, brutally torture people during interrogations, and who conceal their identities.  Despite there being some degree of racial justice in this world, with extensive reparations being paid for slavery and historical atrocities, and despite there apparently being literal world peace, there's still no real economic justice, still no class-based justice.  It's just as capitalist as ever.  Everyone's fate is still decided by the lot they inherit, their utility to capital, and simple dumb luck.  The US president essentially for life is a Democrat, and Democrats control both houses.  They've had a mandate to do whatever they want for decades.  Yet the country they create is still very similar to the USA of today.  All the same hierarchies are still intact.  Billionaires still control everything, cops are even less accountable and somehow even more violent despite being disarmed, and black people now have better opportunities to get rich and oppress the hell out of poor people, just like other rich people do.  Oh, and they've colonized Vietnam, which is barely even touched on beyond some platitudes here and there.  It's a great critique of the limits of neoliberal-style wokeness, of the fact that you can't have real intersectionality without also considering class and colonial legacies.  At the end of the show, it's even revealed that the white supremacists were being played by a tech billionaire with a messiah complex who's been the real big bad all along.  Then this hundred-year-old white supremacist sect is just unceremoniously disintegrated in an instant.  Then the billionaire antagonist is killed in much the same way, and even the other quote-unquote good billionaire is just knocked out by a guy with a wrench.  It straight up says, And all of that is why I was so disappointed to find that the creator is actually an enlightened centrist who made this scathing critique on the limits of neoliberalism entirely by accident.  Yep, that's right.  I was fortunate enough to have never seen any of Damon Lindelof's shows before this one.  Jealous, aren't you?  So I wasn't familiar with his previous work nor his political leanings until after I'd watched it all, when I saw this tweet by Canadian journalist Andr\u00e9 Damis.  He was referring to an interview after the show's finale, in which Lindelof says that, in the world he created, white supremacism still cannot be defeated.  The fight against white supremacism is going to be a battle that goes on until the end of time, unfortunately.  I'd like to be more pie in the sky, but if I learned anything through the experience of writing the show and reading all the things that I've been reading, it's the insidiousness of white supremacy.  I don't think that I ever would have even put it in the show if I felt like we were going to try to convince the audience that it could be defeated.  Okay, so this is a guy who created a show where, in the final 30 minutes or so, a powerful secret society of white supremacists is not only shown to be nothing compared to the billionaires who really run the world, but in which they are all literally disintegrated to death in a split second.  Oh, and also the staunchly anti-racist black female protagonist becomes an all-powerful god.  Yet even in this world that he himself created, he still somehow cannot imagine the end of white supremacism.  He thinks it'll be around until the end of time.  This is of course total nonsense.  White supremacism isn't something natural.  It's a human invention that's only about 400 years old.  If humans created this idea, then humans can also work to dismantle it completely.  Lindelof's words here reveal a lot about liberal centrist ideology.  Liberals look at the world around them and see nothing below the surface.  They don't ask questions about how the structures that underpin society actually came to be, and whether they could be replaced with something better.  For them it's all simply the natural order, just the way things are and always will be.  Since white supremacy has been around for a long time, since its adherents currently have political power, that means it can never be defeated.  not even by a literal anti-racist god, who could just teleport every white supremacist in the world into space whenever she wants.  The implications of this are dire.  Firstly, because this means that, for the liberal, white supremacism is natural.  An incredibly dangerous thing to believe, because it's in line with the thinking of white supremacists themselves.  and secondly for neoliberals especially capitalism and the political systems that uphold it are not just like white supremacy mere centuries-old constructs but rather timeless immutable parts of the world itself.  Despite what his show screams at the viewer, Lindelof does not actually believe that a better world is possible.  In fact, he seems incapable of even imagining one at all.  If we take this a bit further, ignoring the indisputable fact that the author died in 1980 in a traffic accident, and analyze the series more through Lindelof's own lens, then this already bleak, unimaginative ideology looks even bleaker and less imaginative.  It also makes the show seem significantly dumber than it would have if you'd just lived your life blissfully ignorant of what its creator has to say about it.  Ah, what could have been?  Damn you, Andre!  You see, our buddy Damon seems to think that the world he created is not so much a critique of neoliberalism as it is of a lack of balance.  Meaning a lack of balance between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.  Warning!  Enlightened centrism incoming.  Liberals get two things wildly wrong, in my opinion, as an unabashed liberal.  One is we spend way too much time wagging our fingers.  The second is we don't know when to stop regulating.  Regulation is important.  It's necessary.  But that's what the people on the right legitimately fear.  So when does it stop?  What is it to be 30 years into a liberal regime?  That felt like low-hanging fruit that is too delicious not to grab at.  It's going to be imperfect.  You need a two-party system in order to achieve some level of balance.  It doesn't mean that I'm not wildly progressive, but if you said to me, how do you feel about a Senate that is divided 70-30, I'd say that's no bueno.  That's not going to be representative of America.  Yep, apparently the thing that had fixed the world that he created is not fundamental change to the economic status quo, but more Republicans in the Senate.  Okay, well, let's take a look at the world of the show and ask what in it exactly is not aligned with the morally bankrupt values of the Republican Party?  Just what is this over-regulation that Lindelof talks about?  There's not really that much.  Like, sure, Republicans would definitely hate reparations for slavery and racial violence, no doubt about that.  But you know, that's really the only big contention that they'd have with Robert Redford's USA.  The rest is relatively minor.  There's the long content warnings on TV, which are just a straw man of what Lindelof thinks people want, because literally no one in history has ever asked for anything beyond warnings that are a few seconds long, and also they already exist.  There's also the second scene in the very first episode, where we learn that cops have to ask for permission to unlock and use their guns.  And the cop, who is black, is murdered by a white supremacist as a result.  This was easily the worst scene in the entire show.  Bad enough that I kind of wanted to stop watching, though I'm glad I didn't.  Its messaging is just incredibly dumb.  Like what?  If cops didn't have free use of their guns, then they'd be killed by white supremacists?  Wow, galaxy brain.  That's obviously the complete opposite of reality, where American cops use their guns willy-nilly to murder people, many of them black, for basically whatever reason they feel like.  Oh, and also, in real life, there's kind of lots of white supremacists in the police force?  In another interview, Lindelof makes a clear reference to this scene, saying that taking everyone's guns away would be really bad in practice.  There's already plenty of countries where beat cops don't actually carry guns at all.  It's not some pie-in-the-sky thing that only some 30 year long literal dystopia could possibly implement.  Also, there's a huge leap from disarming the police to taking everyone's guns away.  The police are not everyone.  But yes, Republicans would want cops to be as well armed as possible, as unaccountable as possible, as racist as possible, and to oppress the poor as much as possible.  The police depicted in the show only really do two of those things.  Outside of that stuff though, Republicans would be mostly fine with this America.  Especially since they'd be getting paid by the incredibly powerful billionaires that are shown to be manipulating the world as they please.  So the question then is, how would having a balance between the Democrats and the Republicans somehow make this world any better?  Would not having reparations make things better?  Would white supremacists having open representation in government, rather than just having secret white supremacists in government, make things better?  Would cops being more racist and even more brutal than they are today make things better?  Yeah, no buddy, no.  Conservatives love the rich, hate the poor, love colonialism, love police brutality, all that sort of thing.  The only fundamental differences would be the lack of reparations in a more overtly racist government and state security apparatus.  Lindelof seems to believe that he's created a USA that's very, very different.  But since most of the same socioeconomic power relations continue intact, All he's done is given us a glimpse into a marginally less racist America with some flimsy reforms that a conservative government could and would easily destroy in like the first year of its term Apparently this society that is at its core still very similar to the actual current USA has gone too far and needs more conservatism to balance it out.  In the passage I quoted earlier, he even specifically said that if 70% of elected representatives shared similar politics, that would be, I quote, I repeat, because it really needs to be emphasized, people voted for that 70% liberal Senate to represent them in this world.  Now, I don't think that electoral systems and the capitalism can possibly be fair at all.  But that's beyond the point because the US electoral system is rigged to heavily favor the GOP over the Democrats.  So a 70% Democratic majority, especially in the Senate, where all states have equal representation that doesn't account for population, would be an even bigger rejection of the GOP than the percentage already implies.  So apparently conservatism and liberalism both deserve equal 50-50 representation.  just by right?  Who cares if people overwhelmingly vote to reject conservatism?  Who cares if Republicans are well known for harboring and apologizing for the same white supremacists that the show explicitly denounces?  There's really no better indictment of liberalism.  Even in Damon Lindelof's wildest dreams, with years of unopposed governance by adherents of his ideology, he can still only imagine a world so disappointing that it comes off as a leftist critique of neoliberalism.  And his solution to this failure is not to look beyond the American two-party mainstream, but instead to outright reject democracy and pray that the fucking Republicans save us.  Even in a liberal's wildest dreams, they're compromising with people who hate every fiber of their being.  Ah, it's so painful.  But for me, Watchmen, despite Lindelof having such a crappy interpretation of the thing that he himself created, ends on a note that very much implies that a better world is possible.  that white supremacism can be defeated that people of color would play a pivotal role in its demise and even that white people can be good and worthy allies in the fight against it.  that those who hold real power regardless of how righteous and superior they believe themselves to be are just as fragile as anyone else.  and if they can be brought down then the system that they uphold can be brought down too.  and that neoliberalism even with no obstacles before it even helped along by the blood sacrifice of 3 million people and the clandestine help of shadowy figures with limitless resources could not meaningfully improve the world.  While the series doesn't quite go as far as offering an alternative, I'd like to suggest one myself.  Perhaps, rather than the laughable suggestion that more Republicans are the answer, look towards the left.  No, not liberalism.  Not even progressivism.  The actual left.  socialism because socialists can imagine an infinitely better world and we are never going to stop fighting for it.  in conclusion the most compelling reason to completely ignore authorial intent is that most authors are painfully dumb.
