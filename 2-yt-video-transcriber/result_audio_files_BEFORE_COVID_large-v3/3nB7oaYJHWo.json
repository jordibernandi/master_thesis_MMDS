Let's take a look and see how that turned out.  The final vote was 57 no and 43 voting present, with literally zero senators voting yes.  Literally not a single senator voted for it, not even a Democrat.  In fact, three Democrats voted against it, and the rest just voted present, not saying that they were for or against it.  By far the best arguments against the Green New Deal before the votes came from Senator Mike Lee of Utah. ",

This is, of course, a picture of former President Ronald Reagan naturally firing a machine gun while riding on the back of a dinosaur.  You'll notice a couple of important features here.  First of all, the rocket launcher strapped to President Reagan's back.  And then the stirring, unmistakable patriotism of the velociraptor holding up a tattered American flag, a symbol of all it means to be an American.  Now, critics might quibble with this depiction of the climactic battle of the Cold War because, while awesome, in real life.  there was no climactic battle.  There was no battle with or without velociraptors.  The Cold War, as we all know, was won without firing a shot.  But that quibble actually serves our purposes here today, Mr.  President, because this image has as much to do with overcoming communism in the 20th century as the Green New Deal has to do with overcoming climate change in the 21st.

Wrong again, lady.  As a United States taxpayer myself, I'd say that that was money well spent.
