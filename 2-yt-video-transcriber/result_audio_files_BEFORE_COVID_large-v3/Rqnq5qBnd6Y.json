He was here, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Far away, far away Far away.  You see, he has put me far.  Far away, far away.  I was inside a war So many times I could have died before.  I cried for help, I was denied the door.  All I wanted was to take flight and soar.  I was lost in the dark.  I didn't know what to do.  Never seen the light before Like a baby cup crying for a father just to help.  I heard Messiah roar Far away, far away, far away.  You see, He has put me far Far away, far away.  Never wanna forget how far you brought me.  Don't wanna forget how far you brought me.  How could I forget how far you brought me?  Why would I forget?  Like Joseph in the well Life was a living hell In depression.  I will dwell Until you came and broke the cell.  Jesus, far away, far away.  You see, he has brought me far Far away, far away. ",
