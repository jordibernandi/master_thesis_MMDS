            "text": "Rocky is a really sweet guy.  He's one of my first clients that I had when I came to this office, so I've known him for 11 years now.  He's very involved with his church group, and he loves to sing.  He really is a special guy, and it breaks my heart to know that he's on death row for something I believe he did not do.  Rocky Myers is accused of murdering a woman who lived across the street from him.  The person who committed the murder banged on the door late night and distressed.  And before a door is opened, He tells the people, I've been in a car accident, I'm bleeding, I need to call my family.  If my next door neighbor comes to my house and says, I need to use the phone because I need to call my family, my first thought is going to be, there's something weird about this.  Why don't you just go across the street to your own house? ",
