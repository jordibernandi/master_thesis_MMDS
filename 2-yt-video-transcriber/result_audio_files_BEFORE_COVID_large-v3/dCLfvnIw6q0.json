            "text": "So I've spent a lot of time talking about incels, and I've talked about Stacey, and I've talked about betas, and I've talked about thoughts, but I've never really sat and pondered the idea of a femcela, have I?  That being a female incelibate, or involuntary celibate.  Now I know, I know, I know what a lot of people are going to write, probably just looking at the title of this video, and that is that women cannot be involuntarily celibate.  And while I mostly agree with that, and hell, even the women themselves seem to particularly understand that concept, you'll see in a second, I still want to ponder this thought.  I still want to talk about them, because I don't really know if they actually have a problem or if they don't have a problem, you know?  And that's kind of what I want to ponder upon, you know, with this video in particular.  So, with all manners of this discussion, whenever I talk about incels, I always say this.  I think incel is a stupid fucking word.  I think You cannot involuntarily, voluntarily abstain from sex.  It is stupid.  It's a contradiction on itself.  I don't like using the word incel.  However, I understand that people understand it colloquially, so I'm going to use it.  I don't think it's a nice word.  I don't think it's a good word.  I think it's dumb.  But I understand that people understand it, so I'll use it.  I always start every conversation off with incels with that because I don't want anyone to think that I honestly think that this is a reasonable term to use, but whatever.  So moving forward, and we're talking about female involuntary celibates or fem cells, my friends.  They're actually a rather interesting group of individuals because especially \u2013 I found a lot of them on Reddit.  What's actually very particular about a lot of fem cells is the fact that they say and use the same exact terminology as incels but without any understanding of how totally different dating is between men and women.  It doesn't seem like they fully grasp the scope.  of what incels are saying or why incels use the words they use and how like they don't apply to women when you apply them.  you know um and how sometimes i think incels are are rather wrong about most of their ideology in the first place.  so i think incels are really wrong but um it is interesting to to see um just how similar they are and yet how much disdain they are between them.  you know it is.  it is also another funny thing you know and we'll talk about it you know briefly as the video goes on.  But one thing I want to kind of focus on in this video is kind of my thoughts on femme cells in general and just kind of how hilarious I find them to be because like incels, they place a huge focus on the idea or the concept of lookism.  And that's basically, I might have to make a whole video on this, but that's basically the idea that you are discriminated against based on the way you look.  And of course that sounds like racism at first, but it's not really.  Racism can be a part of lookism.  But it's more specifically like your bone structure and your face.  It's more how you're attractive to the opposite sex rather than like your skin color or your race or your genetics or anything of that variety.  You know, where as racism, like it's, you know, you don't like black people, whereas with lookism is you don't like ugly people, you know.  And I can see that, especially for women.  Especially I can see how a woman would put a lot of stock on her face, like, at first glance or, like, at first, like, experience in life.  Because you can see that pretty women get a pretty easy deal in life, you know.  Being an attractive woman puts life on easy mode.  Not only in your career path, not only can you, like, sleep your way up to the top.  Like, that's your extreme way of looking at it.  Or you can just get favored because people like being around you, people like looking at you.  I think there have been lots of studies that even attractive children get more attention in classrooms.  I can certainly see that in any variety from their peers and even from older teachers.  Not really that I'm saying they're pedophilic or anything like that.  That's kind of not really what I meant.  Well, at least I hope that's not what that study was saying.  Anyhow, my point being is that I can see that being attractive as a person is just going to put life on easy mode, male or female.  So I understand kind of the basic gist of the idea.  The only problem I find with lickism is that it's only as powerful... You know what?  I'll save that for that video.  But the more important thing that I really want to discuss is that as femcels, I find it to be particularly unreasonable to put the same amount of stock on the way they look as if men only care about Stacey's.  Because that's what they love to say.  Femcels seem to have two credences of what they believe about men.  And like incels, they have this wide, huge, just frame of reference of men.  It's oftentimes just this nasty, negative thing.  And hilariously, they still, they hate, I hate men so much.  And yet, hilariously, they still want to love them.  It's really weird.  Same thing with incels.  Well, but the thing with incels, as I've always said, is that half the time, it's just inventing their frustration.  They actually don't.  Half the time, they actually don't even hate women.  They're just trying to convince themselves they don't want women as much as they do.  And then you have the more truer incels who understand what they want.  And they're just, again, venting frustration.  Not every incel is a cruel, evil person.  And I think you can find... I mean, you can find cruel, evil people anywhere.  It's not even a fucking point to say that some incels are evil.  Like, yeah, people are evil.  You know?  You have Casanova-type guys or alpha male-type guys who are viciously evil as well.  Look at fucking Ted Bundy.  It's not even... You know, but with the fem cells, they don't really seem to have any, like, degree of, like, nasty evilness to them, where, like, they really want to castrate or hurt men, although you can find some women like that.  They seemed more particularly depressed and sad about their state of affairs of being ugly.  You know, and that's actually kind of like an insecurity that is kind of just affects women in general.  So for themselves, like they're not really special in that regard when it comes to women in general, because women in general have huge amounts of insecurity, even the most, even the prettiest women, even so-called Stacey.  It's just a very is a huge ball of insecurity.  And of course, the obvious reason why is because, you know, even even the most attractive woman, it doesn't matter how stupid she is.  She has to realize her power is only as strong as whether anyone is attracted to her.  If people don't find her attractive, then she has nothing.  And that's where their insecurity always stems from.  But the femme cell doesn't seem to understand this concept.  She seems to genuinely think that men only care and men will only commit to women who are beautiful.  Now that's one thing.  that's also particular about femme cells, right?  Because in cells believe that women don't want to have fuck all to do with them at all.  They won't even literally give them the time of day.  But femme cells seem to recognize that even ugly guys or that men in general will have sex with them and will use them for their own ends, but they will not commit to them.  So the fem cell's fear is not so far as they're actually celibate, but that they actually cannot have a long-term committed relationship, or that men are incapable of loving them, oftentimes because they're just too ugly.  And here's the thing, they're just fucking wrong.  They're just not right.  Their whole philosophy that men cannot love them because they're just too ugly is just not accurate to the state of affairs.  I remember the other day I saw this video where this one woman, she clearly had a good deformity in her face.  And if I can find the video, if I can download it, I'll show you guys.  There's no way to, it's not me trying to be rude.  Her face is clearly deformed, which you'll see if I can find that video.  And she still found a guy to date her.  Now this guy she found to date her was kind of nerdy.  He wasn't, he's not very, attractive as a person.  you know he's not very small or anything like that.  but this like the thing that's hilarious is like she didn't even have to pursue him.  in fact even in the video she's still kind of Eric.  she's actually still kind of arrogant about it.  you know like she was still able to pull some guy despite the fact that her face has his clear on deformity.  She, like, but her boyfriend, or I think husband, whatever, was the one who approached her.  Like, he tried to date her, despite the fact that she looked this particular way.  And I'm looking at this shit, and then I see themselves complain, and I'm just like, bruh.  Hey, bruh, you can't find someone because you're too ugly, bruh.  The real problem is the same problem that a lot of women face.  You just can't find the guy you want.  And here's the thing, is that, and that's kind of the beginning and ending.  Like, incels will always say that these girls can't find Chad, but I just, I mean, maybe they might, I don't know.  I don't want to put it on, I don't want to put it like that, on that.  Maybe it is that, I don't know.  But it does seem to me that at the beginning of the day, it's just these girls just can't find the men they want.  And I guess by the men they want, men that will commit to them, men that will stay with them.  And I've seen lots of different stories of incels saying they try to date, like, ugly guys or something, or I date guys, you know, below my league or some shit like that.  And they say, these guys still become arrogant, these guys still... And I'm just sitting here like, yeah, like, yeah, that happens.  You didn't care about his character.  You desperately clung to someone so you could get some attention or you could get some dick.  Obviously, his character was the last thing you were concerned with.  Clearly, that was what was going to happen.  That's why it happened.  Because you didn't pick someone based on how good they were as a human being.  You picked them because they were the only things available.  uh... so obviously the reason why those relationships fail those artists because they're drenched in desperation and in the evening at a lot of people might think that they're victims here because they still get abused by other guys.  they still get used for sex with the guys that are sitting here like.  i mean listen it's not like you were using him for attention validation anyway that you're not the hero here.  he may have had sex with human left but you were just trying to use and so you make so you feel better about who you are.  you know what's not.  You know, you guys were both villainous in this area.  Maybe he shouldn't have fucked you and left.  I totally agree with you on that one.  But at the same time, you shouldn't use people as validation machines to make yourself feel better.  It's that simple.  So like you're not a hero basically is what I'm trying to say.  You're not a victim either.  You're just two abusers who used each other and you just got the short end of the stick because you thought it would be something long term.  But that being said, I mean are there any true blue genuine like fem cells?  I mean probably.  And by probably, what I mean by genuine is not like.  they're actually incapable of finding men to like sleep with them or date them or even be with them long term.  But more that, like, they honestly want strong, tight relationships.  And they honestly want to be loved and respected by men.  And probably, I say probably because I don't know all of them.  Maybe that might be the case.  But it does seem to me that the ultimate femme cell problem is that they just can't get the men that they want.  And I actually had a very, very tough time empathizing with these women.  Especially as they complained about their looks.  Because, like, I look at myself from my own, my personal point of view of trying to date women, right?  Let's go, let's talk about me for a second, right?  And I've actually never tried to date, like, super beautiful, like, women.  Like, super popular girls in high school or anywhere for that matter.  You know, most of the ladies I've always tried to date have been plain Jane, average girls.  And I acknowledge I'm actually kind of, like, inversely... attracted to clean ginger on the more attracted to normal working women than i am to like supermodels are to like any like a beautiful.  you'll see her and her commercial and i acknowledge that i'm fucking weirdo but i am you know.  so i've always tried to be clean jeans.  i've always tried to be normal average growing.  i mean i i'm talking about girls in the anime and some girls like you know read books and jesus.  you know kind of unit kind of ladies and they didn't give me they didn't give me a fucking time they didn't give me a fucking plate.  you know what I mean.  like these girls weren't frothing at the mouth for me like I my whole life I've tried nothing but to be friends with women and tried to date women and try to love them.  and you know and I can literally.  I can literally count on on my hand the amount of girls who were attracted to me.  only one of them I was able to date the other four.  well the other.  there's some circumstances that I that prevented me from dating three of them.  no only two of them.  they're like circumstance with distance and then make two of them.  one of them was one of my friends exit.  so we were like now and then one of them house think you know.  okay there's a whole story with one of them.  so even still only on five hands.  of all the girls who were attracted to me all of them no only one of them was like really attractive like universally attractive and the other ones were all planes.  no my ex-girlfriend was pretty hot.  so that's like only three of them.  really on The whole point in saying all this is like they weren't really like... My whole point in explaining all this is like even they, even those girls, they weren't frothing at the mouth for me, you know what I mean?  You know, they weren't like desperately trying to prove themselves worthy to me.  They were in the same environment that I was in.  There's only one of them really that like put in effort.  And that's the thing, like I can say one girl in the whole of my life Ever really try to prove herself.  Like she should date me.  Like one.  My whole life.  And again there's a whole story to that thing.  It's not even that I didn't like her.  But I'll tell that whole story some other time.  So looking at my personal experience.  I've tried to date like what?  Like well over 40 girls I've tried to date.  I don't remember.  I had a whole list or something.  There's a whole story behind that too.  Um.  I try to date a lot of girls, and I can only say one of them out of all of those girls I've ever talked to or interacted tried to date me or tried to prove herself.  I'm sitting here like, bruh.  I'm sorry, bro, but cry me a fucking river.  I know it sucks, like, I know it sucks that I don't, I have more empathy for so-called male incels than female incels, because, like, I've tried to date women, but, like, coming from the other side of trying to date women and trying to date these, like, average plain Jane girls and these girls, like, still not giving me the time of day, like, still putting me in the friend zone.  Still only like still not having any attraction to me.  It's like this.  It's like, dude, you have options.  You had me as an option.  No, there are very many women even now who are trying to scoop me up and marry me.  I exist.  I'm here.  I'm alive.  I don't get a bunch of girls knocking at my door trying to fuck me.  So it's like I'm sitting here like breath.  You're telling me that you can't find men to commit to you.  and then here I am, I exist, I'm not special, I'm not all these great things and you can't find anyone?  It's like, no, bro.  The issue is not that you can't find anyone.  The issue is that you can't pick a good one.  That's the problem.  And there's actually a whole host of reasons as to why women... Don't pick good men today, which I'll probably go over probably in the video after the next.  Because I actually saw a really good video that kind of put it in succinctly.  But it does seem to me at the end of the day, the fem cell problem is not that they're too ugly.  It's not that it's not locism.  It's not any of that nonsense.  It just seems to me that as women, like women, they just can't seem to mate select very well.  It does seem that the true issue of the fem cell is a lack of an ability to honestly mate select and honestly pick people.  I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that they're ugly or they don't look good.  It does seem to me, excuse me, just being a male and trying to date women.  And half the time, if you ever catch a picture of these girls, if you're ever able to get a picture of them, They're always kind of attractive.  They're always okay looking.  They're never really actually ugly people.  You know what I mean?  I've never actually seen a Femzell.  Maybe there are some of them, but I've never actually seen a Femzell who's actually ugly.  It just always kind of boils down to... I can't get the guy that I want to commit to me.  And that's just not the same issue.  At the end of the day, I don't really think they should even call themselves involuntarily celibate because they seem to just be fucking celibate.  You are not having sex with men because you don't want to have sex with them because they're not the men you want.  That's just being celibate.  It's not involuntary.  That's just what the word means.  And if you're telling me that you would obviously jump the bones of the guy you wanted to, so you mean... Again, you're just being celibate.  There's nothing involuntary about it.  So I don't know if a new word should even be created.  I mean, again, involuntary.  celibacy is a dumbass word to begin with.  But more to the point, should they even be considered or associated as the same people?  No, not really.  Another thing that's also hilarious about femcels is you would think that these people would flock over to incels and try to date them.  But you see incels are mani.  They're mani heads.  They're very mani.  Um, no, but like some, some incels are very mean and vicious to, to themselves.  Um, for, I would, I think for obvious reasons, one, they think that those women are just being arrogant to those women oftentimes prove their point that they wouldn't date them anyway.  So.  They have, like, these, you would think that these fem cells would sift through the incels.  That's what I would do, honestly.  Like, I would sift through the incels if I was a woman, try to find one of them, try to find a good one and date them.  Like, as much as, like, I mean, colloquially people think incels are vile human beings, but it's like, no, they're vile human beings who are incels, yes.  But, I mean, being an incel itself doesn't make you a bad person.  In the same way that being Kakasanova doesn't make you a terrible person either.  But could you find an evil person who's actually murdering women after he sleeps with them?  Yeah, Ted Bundy.  So, you know what I mean?  It's like, you would think that these women who honestly were having these issues would just go to... like incels.  just go to these male environments where these men don't get a lot of attention from women and just like pick one of them but they never do.  and just on that face just on the front of it just like literally there's a whole epidemic of men who can't even talk to or relate to women So much so that they're buying Belle Delphine's bathwater.  It's like, how the fuck do you have a problem?  How the fuck do you, like, you don't have a problem, dude.  You know, you're just being, it just seems to me that they're just being picky at the end of the day.  And thus, they're not really femcels.  They're just, dare I say, normal women.  So those are my thoughts on fem cells.  I will probably go do some screencast videos where I'll read some of the posts I see on Reddit so you guys get a good idea of what they're actually saying and what I mean when I say they sound very similar.  I do think it is an interesting topic to broach, but at the same time, at the end of the day, I have to come to the conclusion that everyone has come to.  You cannot be a female in cells.  It just seems like you're being picky.  So that being said, I assume you guys got something out of today's video.  And if you did, man, go ahead and click the like button.  And shoot, go ahead and click that subscribe button.  Comment down below.  And as always, you guys have yourselves a great day.  We'll see you cool cats soon.  Adios. ",
