            "text": "Well, I only have seven minutes, and I should talk about the bankruptcy act that's before us.  because this is a proposed additional law, and there'll be plenty of time to debate it.  Let me ask you a couple questions here.  And by the way, this did start eight years ago, this legislation, but there's been numerous changes to it in eight years.  Eight years ago, the person who stopped its passage was me, because it did not have a safe harbor in it.  It did not put women and children to the front of the line.  that did not do a whole range of things that subsequently have occurred.  And, uh, and we, we, we relitigated this two years ago, not in this committee, but in the floor of the Senate in conference.  And we did it in great detail.  And, uh, I might say, uh, I'd ask you to ask consent to the statement that I had, Mr.  Chairman, be entered, uh, entered for the record, uh, if I may, at this point.  And to say that, I think one of the very important amendments that should be added to this legislation is the Schumer Amendment, which in fact was part of the legislation, was part of an agreement that was crafted between the House and the Senate, and was part of what passed out of here as part of the bill.  overwhelmingly, the numbers that the the chairman cited 87, 88, 89 votes, whatever the numbers were, the several times it's passed out contain the Schumer amendment.  But I am, I am confused about one thing here.  Um, there is no question having, uh, coming from a family that has had been a, unfortunately an excessive consumer of medical healthcare expenses, how a, uh, someone can be absolutely crippled by these medical expenses.  There's no question about that in my view.  Where I have difficulty trying to figure out is should the irresponsibility of the federal government and the state government thrust upon the creditor?  And what confuses me is, let me move away from health care for just a moment.  There's an awful lot of people in the National Guard right now who are being sent overseas, they have jobs where their combined income of the husband and wife may be $80,000, $90,000 a year.  But when the person, the male or female, who is sent overseas, called up by the National Guard or the Reserves, maybe was making $60,000 a year, is now, based on their rank, making $24,000 a year.  They have the same car payments.  They have the same uh the same house payments.  they have the same tuition payments.  they have the same bills.  my question is if they cannot pay those bills because of an extended um extended tour which many are going through and they have to declare bankruptcy um should the creditors who have lent money to them based upon their initial income, should they be the ones that pay the cost, in effect, of their inability to pay?  Or is that a larger responsibility of the public at large?  And that's what confuses me about your arguments, Professor Warren.  They're very compelling.  They're literally true, but in a sense, They beg the question.  It seems to me that the federal government should be seeing to it that every American is put in a position where their health care costs are such that if, in fact, they have these extraordinary expenses, that it's a social responsibility of the community to help them.  as opposed to the social responsibility of the particular doctor or the particular bank that lent the money or the particular creditor who has put forward money assuming there was any ability to pay.  I'm just in a philosophic question.  Should anyone who has extraordinary medical expenses unquestionably exist, extraordinary medical expenses, should they be able to say when there's an inability to pay all other bills, whatever they are, I mean, if they were going to pay those medical expenses, they wouldn't be able to pay any other bill from the gas company to whomever.  Is it a societal requirement we should write into the Bank Street Code that says that the gas company should subsidize the payment of those medical bills, that the local drug stores should subsidize the payment of those medical bills.  Maybe we should.  I'm being deadly earnest here.  Because you make a very compelling and mildly demagogic argument that talks about what is true.  All of these things are true.  And so my question is, is it a, from a philosophic standpoint, Is it the responsibility of the gas company and the drug store and whoever else you name to make sure that these people do not have to make these hard choices?  Or is that a responsibility of the government or the people at large?  And that's my only question I'll ask.  Then I'm asking you, Professor. ",
