All right, so, you know, for all of us political comedians out there, this just got a hell of a lot funnier, man.  Andrew Yang, I've been trying to spice up the channel by doing a couple different, you know, vids because some people say that they like to see my ideas on other things.  But, man, Andrew Yang came out on Fox News immediately after the debate.  And I can't believe I missed this.  I'm a couple days late to it.  But he destroys them with corrections.  Man, it's like a Ben Shapiro level facts and logic meme.  I'm telling you.  Fox News does their typical Republican thing and tries to smear his wildly popular UBI.  Anybody you come across to who says something about it is usually in favor of it, not necessarily... Most people who say something bad about it is usually either on... far right.  or you know a bernie bro who's afraid that his ubi would definitely just overrule his bernie's medicare for all.  so they're kind of scared right.  anyway let me play this clip for you guys.  um um and yes the the.  the corrections are very noticeable.  roll the clip.

Essentially everybody 18 and over gets a certain payment each month from the government to give them a little bit more freedom with their professional life and whatever else is going on with them.  The Washington Post talking about this, it says, the biggest challenge to the freedom dividend will remain the key factor that torpedoed the FAP, which is something under the Nixon administration, essentially a payment out there, ingrained American opposition to others getting something for nothing.  The most revolutionary aspect of a universal cash grant, breaking the link between work and reward, is also the most controversial.  You certainly understand the objections to that concept. ",

And there's one state that's had a dividend for everyone in the state for almost 40 years, and that's a deep red conservative state, Alaska, where everyone there is getting an oil dividend of between $1,000 and $2,000 a year.  And it's wildly popular 40 years in.  What I'm saying is that technology is the oil of the 21st century, and we can do this for all of our people, particularly because right now the marketplace is not...

I spoke to 70 CEOs in New York City, and I asked them, how many of you are looking at having AI replace your back office clerical workers?  And all 70 hands went up.  People who are deep in the business world know that these changes are going to affect white collar workers, lawyers, accountants, pharmacists, radiologists.  It's not just drivers and warehouse workers and retail workers and call center workers.  A lot of white collar work is what's called repetitive cognitive work and it's going to be subject to displacement by artificial intelligence in the days to come.

But man, she's just fundamentally wrong on quite a bit.  She said, why would people want to pay in when somebody else is just getting money to live off of?  Like, what?  No, that's not what he's saying.  Everybody gets it.  And it's not like a hefty tax.  It's a VAT.  It's a value-added tax.  It's really not that big of a deal.  Would you rather pay a quarter for your milk, a quarter for your bread extra, and then get $1,000 a month?  Of course you would.  Of course you would.  Yeah, she's just completely wrong on that.  And to say that people would just stay home and be lazy on $1,000 a month, you couldn't.  Let's just say you have, not even saying cable and car payments, right?  Let's just say you have rent.  Median average rent across America is $600 a month.  That's the median average.  Not counting big cities like New York where it's upwards of $1,500 for a warm bedroom, right?  $600 a month.  Now let's add in utilities.  $200 a month on average, $150,000.  So, you're already up, what, $750?  Almost $800?  The rest of that's going to go on food.  You know what I mean?  Maybe a cable bill.  Throw $60 to $100 on there.  Or an internet bill.  Yeah, you're not going to be able to just sit around on $1,000.  But what it will do... um... is uh... elevate you to be able to if you follow hard times to be able to support yourself for people who don't have jobs and do to stay home take care of kids you'll be able to support yourself uh... for it.  it just solves so many problems.  you know uh... women who can't uh... leave.  you know bad relationships because they don't have enough money there uh... there you go.  you know what i mean.  it's just really so.  you don't have enough money to pay for your medical bills or to get some good insurance.  here you go.  you know what i mean.  just 100 on food stamps.  you're getting just ain't cutting it.  well here's a thousand dollars.  all your bills are paid.  you just need help with food.  here's a thousand dollars.  you know what i mean like it's.  just come on for them to constantly say that it's just a typical republican smear tactic that people are just going to sit around.  people are getting food stamps right now do?  does people sit around on their laurels because they get food stamps?  no they work.  they have to work.  food stamps don't pay for the rent the what.  This is a common tactic.  Even back in the day when they were trying to propose Social Security, people were saying, oh, people are just going to get lazy and not do anything if they have Social Security.  These people, when you get to 60, 70 years old, your life is done.  You shouldn't be working anyway, really.  You know what I mean?  Sadly, more and more people with fast food are elderly because they don't have all of the real jobs that have been taken away and given away by automation.  Guess what?  UBI helps that.  So, you know, it's just... I just love the corrections, you know?  Anyways, I don't know.  I might do the Tulsi Gabbard versus Pete Buttigieg's bitch next.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe Yang and Tom Starr.  I don't know.  Let me know in the comment section below, guys.  Yeah, that's all I got for you.
