Because there are two genders, male and female.  There aren't.  I am non-binary.  I have a friend who is intersex, who was born, who has different chromosomes than you would expect somebody physically to have because You know, how many people in this room have had a chromosomal test?  This issue affects more than women.  It affects trans men.  It affects genderqueer folks.  Women have wounds.  I am not a woman, and I have a wound.  You are a woman, and you do have a wound.  No, no, no, no.  Next question. ",
