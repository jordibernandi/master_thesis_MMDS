            "text": "Hey guys, and welcome back for today's video.  I appreciate you stopping by.  In this one, gonna be talking about a hypothetical 2020 election between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump and where I currently have the Electoral College map sitting.  Now, as you can see, I've already filled out a number of states.  These are ones that I view as being safe for either Sanders or Trump.  That gets us to 183 for the Democrats and 116 for Donald Trump.  And all of the states that are left, I think, are a little bit more interesting and worth a bit more of a discussion.  So I'm just going to go through starting west, working my way down into the southeast, up into the northeast, and then finishing with the Midwest.  So I'm going to start out there in the state of Nevada.  And this region of the country as a whole has been trending towards the Democrats.  Some of this has to do with the demographic shifts becoming more diverse.  We saw in Nevada, for instance, the Democrats flipped the Senate seat in the 2018 midterms.  They also claimed the governorship in the state as well.  Also, this is a state that Hillary Clinton was able to pick up in 2016 in her head-to-head against Trump.  And this would likely be a scenario where Bernie Sanders would be able to continue to carry that state in what's continuing to trend towards the Democrats.  then we go down and take a look at Arizona.  now I think there are certain Democrats that can have more success in Arizona than others.  I think Sanders might have an issue with this state because Bernie doesn't do all that well with older voters.  that's an important voter demographic in the state of Arizona and also based on what we've seen it's been more centrist corporatist type Democrats that have had success in the state.  we saw that in 2018 with Sinema winning that Senate seat as a Democrat.  And historically, this has been more of a Republican-leaning state.  But like I said, because of those demographics, it's been trending towards the Democrats and then also just those suburban areas in and around the population center.  around Phoenix have been trending towards the Democrats as well, which is helping them.  I think it can be really close between Sanders and Trump in a state like Arizona, but I'm actually going to give this one as just a slight lean over to Donald Trump.  Trump carried the state back in 2016 against Hillary Clinton.  It was relatively competitive within around three or so percentage points, but I'm just not totally convinced that Sanders is the best head-to-head for the Democrats in this particular state.  Now, I do think there are other regions of the country where Sanders brings more of a strength than maybe some of these other Democrats that could have a positive benefit for him being on the top of the ticket.  But I don't think Arizona is one of those states in particular.  And kind of a similar theme to Arizona, I also think that Florida would be a slight lean to Donald Trump.  He picked up the state in 2018 by about one percentage point over Hillary Clinton.  But Sanders, if we take a look at those 2016 primaries, he got absolutely crushed in the state.  And then on top of that, this is another state where that older voter demographic is important, where Sanders doesn't do very well with those particular aged voters.  And I think that also probably gives a slight lean to Trump in the state of Florida in that head to head.  But then moving back over here to the southwest, New Mexico has been a state that's been trending really well for the Democrats, and it feels like it would likely be a pretty safe one for Sanders to continue to pick up.  We saw in 2018 the Democrats won all the congressional districts in the state and the statewide elections, and then we also saw Clinton win the state back in 2016, and then Colorado won.  kind of a similar theme to New Mexico, but maybe not quite as safe for the Democrats as what we've been seeing from New Mexico, but trending towards the Democrats.  They own the governorship.  They have one of the two Senate seats right now, but the other Senate seat looks like it's a pretty decent shot that the Democrats are going to be able to pick that one up as well in 2020, going to be put in Colorado as just one step below being entirely safe.  And then Texas is In terms of the demographics having an impact, that's certainly the case in a state like Texas.  We saw in the 2018 midterms where Beto O'Rourke was very close statewide with incumbent Republican Ted Cruz got within a couple of percentage points.  And this is a state that's feeling like it's going to continue to get more and more competitive as we work our way.  through the next decade, but at this point in time, still going to be giving it as a lean over to the Republicans and a head-to-head between Sanders and Trump.  We've seen extremely competitive polling out of the state of Texas between these upper-tier Democratic hopefuls and Donald Trump, and it's definitely one to keep an eye on for 2020, not just in terms of the presidential election, but also the Senate and some interesting House races ahead.  On top of that, now I want to talk about two more consistently Republican states that we have here, Montana and Kansas.  But I still feel like they're worth at least a little bit of a discussion.  So Montana, they can elect Democrats statewide.  We see this with Jon Tester, for instance, in the Senate.  Governor Bullock, who's right now running to try to get that presidential nomination, which seems like.  a fruitless endeavor on his point.  It seems like, at least for the Democrats, Bullock would be in a much better situation to run for that Senate seat, for instance, in 2020.  And that could be really competitive and possibly a seat that the Democrats could pick up.  But in Montana, you need a certain kind of Democrat to succeed.  Somebody who's viewed as uncorrupted, working for the middle class or the lower class.  These are the kind of Democrats that can succeed here.  Hillary Clinton was not that candidate.  She was absolutely demolished by Trump in 2016.  I think Sanders makes things a lot more interesting, but still just going to be giving this one as one step below safe for the Republicans and continue to give that to Trump and kind of a similar.  situation that we have in Kansas.  So we saw in 2018, the Democrats actually won the statewide election for the governorship.  And we could find maybe a relatively competitive Senate race here for 2020.  It's an open seat.  And the current Republican has really poor approval numbers.  He's not going to be running for reelection.  But if it's Kobach, for instance, on the Republican side, that can make things a dream scenario for the Democrats to try to pick that one up.  We'll see what ends up being that head to head matchup.  But Kansas is a state that has soured a little bit on the Republican Party in contrast to a lot of these other areas within the Great Plains, given what the former Republican governor did, particularly in the state of Kansas.  And that can make this result perhaps a little bit more interesting, maybe within single digits and a bit more competitive.  Moving down into the southeast, if Florida is going to be going to Trump in my projection here in this Sanders versus Trump matchup, it seems like Georgia would likely also go in.  Now, Georgia can be very competitive statewide.  It's a very diverse state.  And then also the suburban areas in and around the population center of Atlanta have been trending towards the Democrats, which is making these statewide races even more competitive, as we saw in the 2018 midterms where the governor's race, the Democrat Stacey Abrams, came up just short.  against Kemp by a couple of percentage points, extremely close race.  We're actually having two Senate elections in Georgia.  One is just the regular 2020 race, and then there's a special election on top of that.  Both could be relatively competitive, depending on the matchups that we get in those scenarios.  And then also the presidency could be relatively competitive as well, as we saw back in 2016.  Clinton only lost to Trump in the state by around five or so percentage points.  Still going to be giving this one as a lean over to Trump, though, in this head-to-head matchup, especially with already giving Florida to Trump in what's likely to be even more competitive than even what you would consider Georgia.  Now I'm going to move up into the Northeast here.  And particularly for Bernie Sanders, out of all of the Democratic candidates, maybe you could also throw Elizabeth Warren into this mix because she's the senator from Massachusetts.  But I don't think any of them can do better than Sanders in this region of the country.  So that includes New Hampshire, I think would be pretty much a lock for the Democrats.  It's the neighboring state to Vermont.  And Sanders did really well in the state.  if we look back at the 2016 election.  primaries and his head to head against Hillary Clinton, then also the state of Maine statewide, I think would be really safe for Sanders.  And then the second congressional district, I think it would just be as a slight lean.  It's the much more Republican district in the state of Maine, but I still think I would give it as a slight lean over to Sanders and what would be a likely competitive result.  As we saw in 2018, the Democrats were actually able to flip the second congressional district from an incumbent Republican to the Democrat that was able to win it.  And it's likely to be a relatively competitive race as we go towards 2020.  Now moving into these key states here, North Carolina and Virginia.  So I'll start with Virginia.  This has been a state that's been trending really well towards the Democrats.  They just claimed all three chambers of their state, a situation where they have the governorship.  They flipped the Senate as well as the House.  That's the election that we just had.  The Democrats won this state back in 2016.  Tim Kaine was a helpful component of that.  But given how this state has been trending, going to be giving it as just a step below being solid for the Democrats, as it still will likely be relatively competitive.  But given how we've consistently seen the state wide races, specifically in a state like Virginia, trending in recent years, feels like it's going to be a relatively safe one for the Democrats in 2020.  And then North Carolina, basically about as true to a toss-up as you can probably get heading towards 2020, but I'm gonna be giving this one as a slight lean over to Trump.  He won it over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by around three or four percentage points, right about that range.  The polling that we've seen has been extremely close between Sanders and Trump out of the state.  Still just gonna be giving a slight lean to Trump in this one in what's likely to be a very competitive race.  Moving over to Nebraska's second congressional district.  This is one where I think Bernie Sanders can actually pick up and maybe be a lean to the Democrats out of all of the districts in the state of Nebraska.  This is the one that the Democrats can absolutely claim.  We saw in 2018, they ran a progressive who didn't have a ton of financial backing behind her candidacy.  She was a justice Democrat, very similar in terms of her message aligning with somebody like a Bernie Sanders.  She came up just a couple of percentage points short against the incumbent Republican.  And this is a seat that the Democrats have their eye on to flip for the Congress in 2020.  I think that they have a decent shot at doing that.  And I think if that would be the case, Sanders would probably be able to carry that particular district as well.  And then we get into the meat and potatoes here of the Midwest plus Pennsylvania, which is kind of a similar voter demographic to what we get in some of these other areas.  And basically, The 2016 election came down to this group of states.  And I think this is where Sanders has the strongest case, perhaps out of all the Democrats, to find success.  Working class white voters in this part of the country really like Bernie Sanders.  And we saw this carry over into the 2016 primary situation.  And his head to head against Clinton did very well in a lot of these states, especially the ones that had open primaries and allowed independence, working class independence vote.  That puts Sanders over the line in a lot of these instances, specifically in states like Wisconsin and Michigan, So I'm gonna start here with Iowa.  Trump has really terrible approval numbers in Iowa, even worse than states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.  Democrats are spending a ton of time right now in the state as we get prepared for the first caucus that we're gonna have, and I think that can also have a carryover positive effect into the 2020 elections.  And let's not forget, Iowa, it did go for Trump by a good margin in 2016, but just going back the two prior election cycles, Obama was able to carry the state in 2012 and 2008.  I actually think that Iowa, would be a slight lean over to Bernie Sanders in what would likely be a very competitive situation.  Moving up to Minnesota, going to be giving this one as just one step below being safe.  In 2018, the midterms, the Democrats dominated in the state, winning the two Senate elections as well as the governorship.  And out of all these Midwestern states, the only one that you'd put further to the left is probably Illinois, other than a state like Minnesota.  And then also in 2016, of course, the caucus that they had at that point in time, Sanders absolutely crushed Hillary Clinton in that particular race.  And then moving into a state like Ohio, we've actually seen some polling coming out over the past couple of months where Sanders actually has a lead over Trump in that head-to-head scenario.  And I think that Sanders can do well enough among the working class voters, those union voters, those that view Sanders as somebody who's uncorrupted, where they didn't have that view of somebody like a Clinton who they viewed as more of an elitist.  I think that has a huge impact, and I actually think that Sanders would be able to bring Ohio back into the fold after the Democrats had won it in 2012 and 2008.  They lost it in 2016 with the wrong type of candidate.  I think with the right type of candidate, they'd be able to claim it here going into 2020.  And then that gets us to Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, where the election was decided in 2016.  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by about 0.7 percentage points and Michigan by 0.3 percentage points.  And that was with Hillary Clinton on the ticket.  I think Sanders is a much better Democrat to run in this particular region of the country.  His populist progressive message plays very well with these types of working class Rust Belt voters.  And I think that's enough to get him over the line.  You don't need that much of a change in these states for the Democrats to be able to pick him up over Trump.  And I think Sanders is the candidate that could do that.  And I actually give Michigan as one step further than even Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  Now, also these three particular states, in 2018, in the midterms, the Democrats dominated here where they won all three statewide Senate races, all three statewide governorships.  This is how I see things trending for the Democrats very positively going into 2020.  And Sanders is likely to be arguably the strongest out of all of these Democratic hopefuls, particularly in the Midwest with that working class progressives.  populist message that can play well in that region.  so that gets us to a situation where we're at 304 for the democrats and bernie sanders 234 for president trump.  and this is actually extremely close to what we had in the 2012 map with obama versus mitt romney.  i believe to get to that we would flip florida and then take away the second congressional district of nebraska and if i'm not mistaken i think this is what the 2012 map was.  so really similar to that as you can see Really the big difference maker there just being the state of Florida, which would likely be very competitive in a Sanders versus Trump matchup.  And Florida essentially almost always competitive in these statewide races, especially in presidential years.  So that's where I have the map.
