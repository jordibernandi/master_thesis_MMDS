Meaning I initiate divorce, I get a huge settlement, I get a huge alimony settlement, I get huge child support settlement, and I get the kids 27 days a month, but what happens is that because they're getting this influx of cash in their 30s and 40s, by the time that the music stops, they are now into age discrimination and they have no way of really supporting themselves.  That's what we're calling the divorce rate premium.  And what ends up happening is I was challenged by someone about it in the New York Times.  And she told me, you should walk into a grocery store in the Safeway or Kroger or H-E-B or Giant or Trader Joe's and go find how many women you see are 60 that have no wedding bands.  Because they basically, they got divorced, they looted everybody.  And now they picked up their feet and their life outcomes are tragic because of it.  Yes. ",

            "text": "The life outcome of women and men who divorce is usually worse for everybody.  Women oftentimes do get the children and they believe that they're the right parents for the children and they are mistaken.  The right parents for the children are both parents and both parents for about an equal amount of time.  But what happens for the woman is that she is overwhelmed, exhausted, and doesn't do the job that she wishes to do with the children.  she devotes her life her caring her heart her nurturance her psyche her soul to the children.  and what happens?  they're far more likely to be disobedient disrespectful for for her.  they're far more likely to be coercive towards their mom.  and so the mom is experiencing.  Instead of the dream of a wonderful, sensitive, loving, caring child making full use and maximum use of his intelligence, they're getting a child who is very intelligent, but misusing his intelligence unmotivated.  They don't know how to get the electronics away from him.  They don't know how to stop him from being addicted to video games.  They fear that when they walked in, that the child was focused on porn, that the child is not having the life she or he wants to have in terms of being able to initiate in a healthy way with women.  If he's initiating with men, he feels shameful about it.  And she is sort of like my life's heart and soul.  It's like being a CEO of a company that says, you are not the right CEO.  You are a bad CEO.  We're going to take the CEO ship away from you.  Everything she poured her identity into her heart into is taken away from, is not working out the way she hoped and she can't admit it.  because she can't admit it to herself and she can't talk about it to others because it just emits the shame.  Secondly, the father is feeling lost without his son and without his daughter because when males lose relationships, they're far more likely to go into depression and into suicide.  Kopa Sawa found that when a male and female divorce, a male is 10 times as likely to commit suicide Ten times as like to commit suicide as his wife. ",

That means 40 men a week.  40 men a week are killing themselves from the family court a week on.  that report I find was very interesting.  It was people that said basically wrote a note that said, you know, I'm killing myself because I'm being a divorce and blah blah blah blah blah blah.  well The ultimate problem in all that is that it's not talking about men that are two years later that have been in and out of the system three or four times that engage in risky behavior, commit suicide by copy if you're African-American, right?  Or if you commit suicide by copy if you are in the lower half, et cetera.  Or if you drive your car risky and get in an accident and kill yourself.  Or if you overdose, what they say on the report is, oh, that man killed himself because they were depressed.  Or that man died because he committed a homicide and he was killed by the cops or killed by gang violence.  They're not talking about any of this.  They're not saying it's not really 40 a week.  It's more like in the hundreds a week. ",

            "text": "Yes, we have to really understand the deeper foundation of all this, which is that men grow up love deprived.  When you learn to hold your feelings to yourself and not share who you are, you're learning to cut off yourself as a human being.  And men had to learn to do this, to be heroes.  This is what a hero did.  Every man who was successful learned to repress his feelings, not express his feelings.  He learned that if he talked about, he was having challenges with his marriage, and he talked about it with a colleague at work, who was the person he felt the closest to, that the colleague would listen for a few seconds, maybe a minute or two, and then the eyes would begin to glaze over.  And he realized that if he continued talking like this, he was going to just sort of distance the colleagues.  And then he realized that if he had obligations to his family and that colleague might report to somebody else that he was preoccupied with this divorce and really hurting from that, so maybe he shouldn't be promoted.  Then he starts feeling ashamed because he's not promoted.  So he learns it a hundred different ways, a male does, to disconnect from his heart and his soul and his feelings.  And then he learns that the only person he can possibly express those feelings to is that one woman he met who seems to be able to listen to him when he shares his feelings.  But he doesn't often realize that that woman respects him in part in a Lois Lane type of way.  And a Lois Lane type of way, what I mean by that is Lois Lane did not fall in love with Clark Kent.  Lois Lane wanted Superman to express his feelings, not Clark Kent to express his feelings.  And so the male doesn't learn that the woman who falls in love with him did not fall in love with him because he expressed his feelings.  she fell in love with him because she respected his ability to perform and his strength and his ability to protect and then when he had all those things like superman did then he.  she also wanted him to express his feelings.  and then when he did with her she heard him.  And when he felt heard, he felt whole.  And when he had children, yes, additional responsibility, but this was the love of his life.  And then suddenly, the one person who understood him, who loved him, suddenly is filing for divorce and taking the children with him and increasing the pressure on him to pay more while he gets less love.  We don't understand that men are love dependent exactly because they've been cut off from the skills of love.  And then we marry with the hope of more love, more compassion, more understanding.  And we pour all our emotional eggs into the basket of the woman that loves us.  That's unfair to women, by the way.  And it's also unfair to men to not have many outlets for their love.  When men and women get into crisis situation, women know enough to go to therapists.  They know enough to go to their women friends.  When they go to their women friends, the women almost always say, yes, I always thought that he wasn't worthy of you.  And you and you'll always be able to find a better man.  Don't worry about it.  And besides, I saw this flaw in him and this one, this one.  Versus when a man goes to another man and talks about the problems he's having, he gets at most that three minute window of opportunity and then things begin to go against him.  So he becomes very needy of women's love for better and for worse.  And we need to know that.  that when men and women break up in relationships, when heterosexual relationships break up, your son is much more likely to go into depression, alienation, distance, feeling of loss, in part because he doesn't know how to talk about those things and those feelings.  than our girls.  And so girls will express that loss to a much greater degree, cry for help, but their crying for help is exactly part of the solution, whereas boys not crying for help is part of the problem. ",
