So over time, your muscles become weaker and you lose muscle mass.  So upon my diagnosis, that was kind of the, the first thing was my right arm.  went completely limp, and then my legs started to be affected.  So, by the time it was time to move to LA to go to college, cause originally I'm from Northern California, I needed to figure out how I was gonna get to class.  And I knew the leg braces were not gonna get me to class in time.  The college campus is like three times bigger than my high school campus back home.  So I was like, okay, I'm gonna have to start using a wheelchair.  And I just made the decision based on what my needs were in order to get through my day.  I didn't, it didn't even cross my mind of anything socially.  what the issue could be if, you know, would I get bullied for using a wheelchair?  Would I be looked at different because I use a wheelchair?  Literally, my thought process was, I have to get to class, I'm in college, how am I gonna get there?  I gotta use a wheelchair, I have no other choice, and that's kind of when using the chair started, and that's pretty much how I've gone these past 13 years as a wheelchair user throughout my life.  I look at it like I have to get from point A to point B, I'm gonna have to use my chair. ",

The first being that it's very painful for me to walk because essentially all my joints are loose hinges.  So it's two things.  The joints themselves hurt because they're like, you know, they're swishing around on themselves.  Got it.  And then my muscles hurt because my muscles try to compensate for the fragility of my joints by being tight and tensing and trying to hold the joints together.  So I'm experiencing muscle pains and joint pains.  And it's very intense, like whenever I stand up, I compare it to like walking on rocks or if sometimes it gets very bad walking on glass.  when I first started feeling the pains I thought that I had fractures in my feet was like was what was what I thought the pain was?  yeah um but really it's just that when I stand up I'm putting pressure on my joints and my feet and all of them kind of collapse into the ground.  my feet are kind of like bags of bones And so, and so when all those bones like squished down, it's painful.
