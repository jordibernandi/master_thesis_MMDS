            "text": "Sharif Jaber is an atheist activist in Egypt who has been forced to run from police in order to escape jail time.  The outstanding work he's done to shine a light on taboo and criminalized topics in his country must continue.  He's been called a blasphemer by the Egyptian officials and abused by their court systems as a way to manipulate him and shut him up.  They've taken his passport so he can't even escape until they find a way to put him in jail.  We know they're trying hard.  We've been watching.  Some of the charges that they're charging him with are insulting Islam and being a traitor.  We've seen him bravely stand up for his beliefs.  Now it's our turn, Sharif's community, to shine a light on him, his bravery, his humanity, and the torturous treatment he has endured simply to spread better ideas.  Please share Sharif's story. ",
