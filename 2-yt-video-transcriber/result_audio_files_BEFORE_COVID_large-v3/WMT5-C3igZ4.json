Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record.  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.  She blocked evidence.  She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.  And she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way. ",

So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who've been profiting off the backs of sick people have had to see the table writing this legislation.  Now Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill.  This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal.  Sebelius works for Medicare Advantage, private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan.  If we're seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we've got to shut out big insurance and big pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.

This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have.  as a country, what to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment.

And it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.  Wow.  Donald Trump won this election because far too many people in this country felt like they've been left behind by both political parties, by self-serving politicians on both sides who are more interested in partisan politics than they are in actually fighting for the people.  I'm speaking the truth to people all across this country about the fact that people in Flint, Michigan are still being left behind, still being poisoned by the water in their system, because every single month we are spending $4 billion on a continuing war in Afghanistan.  $4 billion every single month, rather than ending that war, bringing our troops home and using those precious resources into serving the needs of the people here in this country, people and communities like Flint.  That's the kind of leadership that I'll bring.  First of all, this is personal.  You can imagine I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world.  So for us, growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue.  It's a way of life.  It's part of our culture.  It's part of who we are.  This is why, as a member of Congress, long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the Off Fossil Fuels Act.  That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy, invest in workforce training, invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today.
