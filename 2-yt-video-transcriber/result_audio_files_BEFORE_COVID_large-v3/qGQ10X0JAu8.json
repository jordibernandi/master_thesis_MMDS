            "text": "But let me tell you this much, though.  If you see somebody with a red jumpsuit on and some Jesus Wall earth sandals, you better run your ass off because they coming to kill you.  They coming to kill you.  Run your ass off.  Run away.  Hey, it's your girl Tyusha and I'm back with another great video.  I just saw the movie Us.  I've been waiting to see that since I saw the trailer back in December.  Let's go ahead and talk about some things you may have missed.  This is spoiler free.  We're going to get right into it after you go ahead and hit that subscribe button.  This review is going to be spoiler free until we get to the end.  And don't worry, I will give you a warning before we get there.  So I'm going to explain the ending and what my perspective on it was.  But this movie, Us, it has so many references to the 80s and certain things in pop culture.  Blink and you would have missed it.  We're going to go ahead and get started.  I jotted a few of them down.  Let me know what you think.  Put it in the comments.  The first thing that caught my mind, with any good thriller or horror movie, it takes place at an amusement park.  There's so much going on.  You kind of have a sensory overload.  And some of the best movies that were filmed in amusement parks, I know from the top of my head, was Zombieland, Carnival of Souls, and The Fun House.  And also this movie Us by Jordan Peele.  The beginning of it takes place at an amusement park.  More in particular, the amusement park is Santa Cruz, California.  And a little bit of history on that is that's one of America's oldest, maybe even the first amusement park right there on the boardwalk.  So that's like so cool to reference that.  Second, now in the trailer, this scene, and I'll put a picture so that you can see what I'm talking about, but I can't put a video up because whenever I do videos like this, I get demonetized.  So make sure you hit the subscribe button and go ahead and give this video a thumbs up to support small YouTubers like myself and help me grow.  But when his name is Gabe, the actor Gabe, when he comes out of the house to confront the strange family that's in the driveway, he has a baseball bat.  And he's like, he has a baseball bat.  And he says, you want to get crazy?  I can get crazy.  And what that immediately made me think of was Joe Clark, the principal from the school in, I believe, New Jersey.  And, you know, the movie that they made where Morgan Freeman played him.  And he said, they used to call me Batman.  Now they call me Crazy Joe because he walked around that school with his bullhorn and his baseball bat.  So, yeah, that was super cool.  That was so cool.  Okay.  Another one, let me go get my scissors.  Okay, I'm back.  So, another reference they made in this movie was scissors, okay?  They had the scissors.  That was part of this movie.  Now, scissors are absolutely identical, except they're like mirror images.  Except when you take them apart, they're absolutely useless.  But, you know, the two ends, once they're put together, then they're able to split things, you know?  So, yeah, it's kind of symbolic and... cutting that tethering cord that the two doppelgangers have with each other.  So yeah, just looking at a pair of scissors, it's the same, but a mirror image of each other.  I thought that was pretty cool.  I don't know.  That was just deep.  Okay.  Again, talking about the actor or the character Gabe.  And when they come back to the house after the beach, And again, I'm not giving a spoiler because you saw this in the trailer.  He is wearing a Howard University t-shirt.  And like I said, going back into the 80s, of course, we had the Cosby Show.  And of course, I got to give a shout out because that was the year of 1984 when it made its premiere and good things happened in 1984.  I don't mean to brag.  This played out with the character Gabe because he was a black man, he was a father, a husband, and he had on this Howard University sweatshirt.  And what that symbolized was the Cosby Show and how Bill Cosby wore that.  He would wear t-shirts for Tuskegee, a lot of other well-known black colleges.  And at that time, and still today, was that having that access to higher education, you know, that's important to see right now because, you know, knowledge and that higher education with black men and seeing that, that was often seen as a gateway to, you know, a better life, to access to wealth, things like that.  And I thought that was pretty cool.  how that scene where he goes to the bedroom and he has on his Howard t-shirt.  He takes off his glasses and he gets to the bed and he's ready for, you know, some intimate time with his wife.  And that brought me back to the Cosby show because we knew that Cliff and Claire Huxtable, they were intimate.  They loved each other.  And At that time on TV, that showed a healthy love between a black husband and a black wife in their family.  So that was super cool to, you know, bring that back into our psyche because us 80s babies and before we grew up seeing that.  So it was really good to see that played out on TV today.  I really appreciated that.  And that was like really powerful.  I hope y'all caught that too.  With the family that is the us, the other side of, you know, the main character family.  was that they wore red jumpsuits.  And one thing that is like super nostalgic from the 80s and horror movies and thrillers is the killers always wore jumpsuits.  Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees.  And ironically, the son, his name is Jason.  I don't know if anybody caught that, but that was pretty cool.  And he also wore a mask the whole time.  So I thought that was a pretty cool connection.  However, all of them... the well-known major murderers or killers, thrillers in horror films wore jumpsuits.  They were either black or blue, you know, because they was kind of putting that over to the blue collar workers and things like that.  But this time, in this movie, they have on red.  I'm still trying to put out what that means.  And it could be the red jumpsuits.  Um, just going off the top of my head, the red jumpsuits is people who have been at the bottom of society.  So they're doing everything in their power to overtake those who have like the finer things in life.  That's kind of what I'm saying.  I don't know if I'm wrong.  That's just one thing that kind of popped into my mind.  um another connection i made with this movie is like i said this isn't a spoiler because it's in the trailer.  um there is a reference to michael jackson's thriller and you cannot mention any kind of horror or thriller without talking about 1982's michael jackson's video thriller.  and when i when i think about how thriller was It takes place on screen, then also in the theater, then on the street.  And in the theater, it gives you that perspective as if you were on the screen and you saw the audience reaction.  The audience went from, you know, fright, to laughter, to humor, and then Michael Jackson and his date just storms out.  And that's exactly what Jordan Peele's Us did to me as I was in the theater.  One second I was, get away, and the next thing I'm just busting out laughing because of something.  It was super cool, but then also with Thriller, how that video made its stamp in pop culture and the stamp for horror films and all that is.  it showed two perspectives kind of like a us.  uh with your doppelgangers like okay you have the innocent michael jackson and his date on the screen you know walking home.  then you go to the the the underworld dead side you know as they're actually on the street.  so it was super cool.  i can't really explain it but it just makes sense to take these elements from you know, well-known popular horror films and thrillers and kind of have them all compiled into this one movie.  Another movie that I forgot that also takes place at an amusement park is Final Destination 3.  Now, warning, warning, warning, warning.  I'm going to explain the ending and there will be some spoilers, okay?  So you might want to pause, come back and see me after you watch it, or if you just don't care, let's get going.  But hit the subscribe button up.  do it again.  yeah hit the subscribe button.  the ending my explanation the ending.  oh my gosh it took me for a freaking spin.  yeah i was sitting there when it was going off like hold on i'm still mine from this.  okay let me get my notes so i'm not looking down.  so As I saw it, it's like as above, so below.  Because when we find out that Adelaide was actually her underworld side, that kind of explains throughout the movie why she fought so hard.  to not be back in that predicament to go back.  because, and then it also explains the Adelaide who was pulled into the underworld, why she's fighting so hard to get back up.  And my explanation is someone who has been at the bottom you know, the original Adelaide underworld finally getting a taste of the world above.  So she will run, she would kill, she would do everything to keep from going back.  And then the Adelaide who was at the top ended up at the bottom because she lived that luxurious life.  And now she's down at the bottom, you know, eating rabbit and stuck in this little, confined prison.  And you kind of saw that, you know, it's kind of like a world of just programming, you know, they're sitting in the classroom, the hard walls, it's like, you know, a prison school, prison school, confined experiment, something.  Below world, now above world, Adelaide was going down the rabbit hole to go back and get her son back.  I thought that was a pretty cool reference.  The below Adelaide who became the above Adelaide, she had to watch her children die, you know.  So, yeah, she's doing, well, the underworld children die.  So she kind of saw, you know, her world, what it could have been, what it could be, worst case scenario.  But that's why she's trying so hard to top.  You are mistaken as if, you know, a mother fighting for her family.  No, she's been at the bottom and finally got to the top and she's fighting to stay there and she would take out and destroy and run from anything that threatens to put her back down in the underworld.  Let me know what you think.  Those are my opinions and what I observed and kind of pondered on after watching the movie Us by Jordan Peele just came out.
