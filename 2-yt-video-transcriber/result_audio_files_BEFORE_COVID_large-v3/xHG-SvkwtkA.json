            "text": "The Iranian regime is profoundly misogynist.  If you ever look at any picture of the Iranian leadership, you see a misogynist, septuagenarian male elite that has had virtual control in Iran for 39 years.  They have literally tried everything they can.  to push Iranian women back into what they think the model of womanhood is.  Nevertheless, in spite of the systematic effort, at every level, the Iranian women have fought this regime.  The significance of the women's movement is not just about the veil.  It is about breaking the authority of a despotic regime.  Fear is an absolute essential ingredient of authoritarianism.  No authoritarian regime survives if fear dissipates.  Women have been fighting this gradual dissipation, this gradual challenge to the authoritarianism of the regime.  If you can beat them in the streets the way women have, maybe we can beat them in other places. ",
