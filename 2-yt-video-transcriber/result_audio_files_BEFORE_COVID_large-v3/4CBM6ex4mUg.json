            "text": "good morning y'all.  so I wanted to hop on here.  I'm just on these back roads.  I wanted to tell you guys I had a rapture dream last night and I woke up in the middle of the night after I had had it.  I don't remember what time it was must have been two three o'clock in the morning and in my rapture dream I heard the trumpet.  it was definitely a shofar wasn't like real high-pitched but it wasn't really low-pitched either.  it was like mid and it's so funny because when I had woken up I could literally mimic exactly how it sounded.  and like I almost didn't want to go back to sleep because I didn't want to forget what it sounded like.  And so I kept replaying it and like doing the shofar sound in my mind, like over and over and over.  But I knew I had to go back to sleep because it just wasn't time to get up.  And you know, this mama needs all the sleep she can get, but it, let me see if I can mimic it.  Like I can't mimic a shofar, but the tone was like like basically like that like not real low like you would think but not real high-pitched and like kind of all over the place.  but what happened was I was had pulled into this gas station and Christina, you were there.  Girl, I didn't want to text you or anything right now because I know you're three hours behind me.  But I just had to get this out there.  So I was in this gas station, but it was a familiar gas station.  It was actually the one that I used to always go to when I was growing up as a kid right down the road from my old house.  and I was in the parking lot.  Hey, baby.  And I was in the parking lot.  Hey, baby, say hi.  It was not a whole lot to this dream, but it felt so real.  I had just got gas maybe, not sure, and All of a sudden I heard the trumpet and I opened up the door to my car.  there was a few other people around and I'm screaming it's Jesus it's Jesus.  as I'm hearing the trumpet and all of a sudden Christina's to the right of me and we're looking at each other and we're so excited and we're literally just waiting to be lifted off of the ground.  but the thing about this dream was Um, it was slowed down because I know everything's going to happen, um, in the twinkling of an eye, but everything was slowed down so that I could kind of like actually process like what was going on, I guess.  But, um, so I'm screaming as Jesus, Jesus, we're looking up in the air and we're just waiting to be lifted off the ground.  All of a sudden me and Christina, cause, and I'm like wondering, all right, am I going?  Of course I know I'm going.  Um, um, Christina's to the right of me and we link arms and all of a sudden we just started being just levitated off of the ground and we're being raptured.  and I remember looking over her and her smile my gosh she had so much joy on her face like it was finally time.  I remember we linked arms and we're looking at each other and we were just smiling with so much joy.  oh my gosh guys oh it's almost time to go home man I I finally heard the trumpet.  I don't think I've ever I don't know that I've ever heard really heard the trumpet like that yet.  So, I just wanted to give you guys that encouragement because I've been feeling really down.  Not down, I've just been feeling weary, you know, and everybody's been feeling weary.  And I said, man, God, I just want more confirmation.  I feel really bad that I'm asking you for more confirmation.  But I just need... Excuse me.  I said, please can I just have just like a little bit more confirmation.  Just one more.  And he gave it to me.  I just want y'all to be encouraged.  Sorry, I had to snippet this video together.  Came up here to get a coffee.  What's new?  But... God is good for giving us the strength and the confirmation when we ask for it or when we need it.  I don't know how I don't know.  I don't know when he's coming, but I know it's soon.  And I just thought that was amazing that I heard the shofar.  And that sounds silly.  I don't know how to, you know, obviously I don't have a shofar.  But it was that tone.  Or that pitch.  Sorry guys, I've been sick for like a week.  But yeah, me and Christine linked arms in that parking lot as soon as we heard it.  and we started to be raptured and I felt like I felt I know that we're gonna get our glorified bodies but I every time I've had a rapture dream I've always felt like I've always felt like my spirit kind of not being separated from my body because we get our glorified bodies like these bodies go with us.  I don't know.  I can't describe it.  It's just like the same feeling that I always get in every rapture dream that I've ever had.  So, please be encouraged, guys.  He is at the door.  Hallelujah.  Alright, guys.  Well, I hope you guys have a really just a great day.  I'm getting this mop done on my head.  Finally getting it dyed.  So, a little man back there is going to enjoy his afternoon with his daddy.  But I just had to come on here and tell you guys that I had that dream last night.  And our redemption draws near.  Talk to you guys later. ",
