This is from Alabama, and there was the president's motorcade going down the road, and all of a sudden this car comes from the other side and headed towards him and crashed into the, they have like those wires in the median, and it stopped the car, but had those wires not been there, this car would have crashed into some of the motorcade and probably where Trump was.  I mean, this is something.  I'll show it to you and then I'll come back and cap everything up. ",

            "text": "So wow, isn't that something?  This happened once before, if you remember.  Wow, this just was incredible.  And as you can see, I'm gonna do this, turn off the sound here, but this, as it was starting to go by, the motorcade, Trump's probably in the very first part of it as it's going along, like these are some of their first vehicles.  He's probably one of these right along in here.  And so when this car was going along right here, Trump was probably in one of these vehicles right here.  One of these three, there were a couple more behind him, he might have been in one of those.  He probably was not in the first one or maybe not the second, I don't know.  They all look alike so you can't tell which one is him.  And there's a reason for that, obviously.  But yeah, look at this.  If this car would not have been stopped by those wires in the middle, it would have gone right on and could have hit him.  And obviously the beast is built pretty well, so it may not have damaged President Trump, although you never know.  And it's just really odd that this happened.  I mean, like I said, this is kind of like that other one.  where there was a car over here and just came barreling in about the same time he was going by.  so wow i mean that's something that thing would have been right over there headed right for him.  so you gotta wonder what was going on.  is the deep state really getting that scared?  i don't know.  but i sure am glad our POTUS is okay.  So that's what I wanted to share with you.  And I hope you'll share this with others and let people know what happened.  Because, wow.  And there's a whole article down here.  I mean, it's not very long, but it talks about it.  And, yeah, it's unclear if anyone was injured in the crash, but the presidential motorcade did not slow down or take any sort of evasive actions because the guy was stopped in the center.  And that's why.  But... Boy, had it not been for those wires across there, what would have happened?  That would have been something.  And so I just wanted to share that with you.  And the date on this is March 8th.  And it was updated at 6.56 p.m.  Central Time.  So there you go.  Interesting times for our POTUS.  Keep them in your prayers.  Also the Q people because... Q's been posting today and wow, lots is going on.  He says some indictments may be unsealed.  I'm looking forward to it and things are ripe for it.  If you look at the condition of things, we know for sure a lot of people are guilty of things and more and more is coming out all the time.  So It's going to be an exciting couple of weeks and, you know, maybe they should all heed the warning, beware the Ides of March, right?  Oh, that'd be funny if it came back to bite Brennan on the butt.  So there you go.  That's what I've got for tonight.  I want to thank you for stopping by and share this video so others can see what happened, okay?  I'll see you all later. ",
