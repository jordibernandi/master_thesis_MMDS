            "text": "Hey everybody, I have a video for you this morning.  Won't necessarily be quick, won't necessarily be short.  It's going to be whatever it is.  Last night, I was watching Zombie Farmers live stream.  And there were comments made, a lot of them that stuck out to me.  Something in my eye this morning, excuse me.  A lot of them that stuck out to me, but the one that really pinged me hard was was the one where he was discussing about the fact of gun confiscation and trump and this red flag law that kind of stuff.  i'm sure you guys are well aware of all that.  if you're not search it out anyway then i got an email i won't say who from but one of my subs who i happen to like by the way And this individual was asking me about the guns.  This person was on the livestream last night.  And they made the comment that If I remember right, did I feel that we were supposed to hand over our guns?  Are we supposed to lie and say that we don't have any?  This person said that they had guns that were registered to them, but they also knew of someone that they could get guns from that had no serial numbers.  Okay.  And they wanted to know my opinion.  Well, first of all, as a Christian, I'm going to say right up front, don't lie.  God is not going to honor a lie ever.  So don't lie.  As far as the guns, boy, this is just a really hot topic.  What I feel about the guns is that you purchased your guns.  They belong to you.  They don't belong to the federal government.  They belong to you.  The government has no right to take them away from you, just like if you were to save silver and gold.  In my opinion, the government has no right to take that, which they have passed legislation back right after the Great Depression, I think it was, or whatever, giving them the right to take it away from you.  But I don't buy that, okay?  If you buy silver and gold, it's yours.  They don't have a right to take it.  So where the guns are concerned, first of all, purchasing guns without serial numbers, an officer of the law, you know, a law enforcement officer or a judge or a jury, they're going to consider you a criminal because you purchased a gun that you don't know where it came from and that the serial numbers were filed off.  That's a bad idea.  Bad idea.  Okay.  That's not putting down this individual that asked.  It's just a bad idea.  As far as whether or not you give up your guns, if they come pounding on the door, no one can make that decision for you.  No one can tell you inequivocally what the right thing to do is.  It has to be And in the moment, hopefully you can decide before the moment, situation, okay?  No one can tell you what to do.  You're going to have to do what your heart and mind dictate to you to do.  Now, if you're in Christ, that makes it harder, much harder.  The way I see it, the guns are mine.  I purchased them.  The guns that I do have, or are not, I guess I should say, registered to me.  Does that make them stolen or criminal act?  No, they were my dad's.  They're not registered to me.  They're not in my name.  I feel... That without the leading and the guiding of the Holy Spirit in your life, you cannot possibly make good decisions.  You can make fleshly decisions based on your will, your emotions, your thought patterns.  But if you're not being led by the Holy Spirit in your life, if you're not hidden in Christ, if you haven't given your life to Christ and been filled with his Holy Spirit and been born again, you don't have that inside of you.  And you cannot make the kind of decisions that you should probably be making.  I think it's that simple.  As a Christian, I believe that And I'm relying on the fact that when that time comes, which I pray about all the time, and I will continue to pray about until that time ever comes.  But when that time comes, I'm leaning on the Holy Spirit to give me the words to say, to speak through my mouth, and to tell me what to do.  Okay?  Darn it, I don't know what's in my eye.  To tell me what I should be doing.  I'm not gonna lie, that's for sure.  I don't see me giving up my guns.  I just don't see myself doing that.  My wife and I have discussed this.  I feel that if there was a door-to-door gun confiscation, which could happen, Honestly, I doubt it, but it could happen.  I just don't see me doing that.  I've told my wife, kind of like the old movie from Star Trek, resistance is futile.  If you fight the government, you're going to lose.  If you fight law enforcement, you're going to lose.  There's more of them than there is of you, and you are going to lose.  That is settled in my mind.  My wife and I talked about it, and I made the comment to her that I was struggling whether or not the guns and keeping them, knowing that if I was to resist and stuff, there's very high possibility I could just get shot and killed.  Is that worth some metal and some wood and standing on my rights?  I don't have an answer.  I didn't have an answer for that.  um she had made the comment.  you know that if that happens then that happens and she understands my feelings.  are.  i want to be here for my wife and kids but i can't see me giving up my guns.  um so i'm leaning very hard on trusting that god through his holy spirit will tell me what to do when that time comes and that i will handle it in a godly manner.  I'm hidden in Christ.  This world isn't my home.  We hear that all the time, but we are part of it.  We're living in it, but this isn't my residence.  This is a temporary dwelling.  And being caught up in the cares of this life in this world is a snare to people.  It's a snare to me.  And every Christian, every, well, I'll just leave it at every Christian, is going to have to settle in their mind where they stand on gun confiscation.  You're going to have to.  And if you're in Christ, then, you know, you better be praying for the leading of his Holy Spirit and for him to give you wisdom and to speak through your mouth.  if he If there's a time that comes that you need to open your mouth and talk, then you better be relying on the Holy Spirit to do the speaking through you.  I think that's imperative.  It's very important.  My wife was encouraging me in that this morning, and she's correct.  We've had this discussion before, and she's correct.  Anything that is not of faith is sin.  The Bible is very clear about that.  My faith is in Jesus Christ.  My faith and my trust must be in him and having the belief and the trust and the faith that he will give me wisdom when I need it.  I just wanted to share that with you.  I think that's very, very important.  You guys are going to have to settle this on your own terms between you and the Lord.  But getting guns with no serial numbers, bad idea.  Lying, bad idea.  And I just wanted to say that.  I think that's very important.  This is going to go against a lot of people.  A lot of people aren't going to like what I'm saying right now.  And I have great subscribers.  I honestly care about you guys.  I really, really do.  I tell you that all the time.  I have a journal full of your names.  that I pray for you guys on a regular basis.  Regular basis.  And I care.  But you know what?  If you don't like what I'm saying, I don't want to tell you.  This is my channel, and I'm going to say what I believe and what I think.  And if you don't like it, don't listen.  It's that simple.  As far as the comment by the FBI... that conspiracy theorists are terrorists, you know, in the making.  Um, that's a crock of crap.  Okay.  Just period.  That's exactly what it is.  It's a crock of crap.  You know, the Bush administration, uh, when they paste, when they pass the, uh, Patriot Act, um, you know, that's just a, a rights grab from the government.  It was a terrible thing to pass.  Um, I can't tell you how much I dislike Bush.  I don't care if you guys don't like that either.  But in the Patriot Act, it states, it's in there because I've read it, that information gathering can be considered an act of terrorism and get you deported out of the country, expatriated.  of this country.  they can seize your property and all your bank accounts.  that is in the patriot act period and in my opinion that is very very wrong and that's a crock of crap as well.  i feel like it was done and it was put out to the public in general, to freak out the public, to scare them into keeping their mouth shut, to scare them into not looking into 9-11 or any of the other false flag things that our government has done over the years, Gulf of Tonkin, a bunch of stuff.  But I believe that the act is there because I've read it.  I believe they'll use that on people like Snowden.  I'm not saying he's right or wrong, but people like Snowden.  I don't think your average Joe, like myself, that they're going to go after because I'm collecting information.  I had stacks, and boy, I'm telling you, stacks, like this is not an exaggeration, stacks this high of documents and information on 9-11 and the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and all that stuff.  I got rid of those things.  when I found out the Patriot Act had made this comment and they were putting it out there.  At the time, I was listening to InfoWars and they were talking about it, you know, and I'm thinking, well, you know, what the heck?  Why keep it?  Is it worth the risk?  No, it's not.  The information's in my head.  People don't want to believe me if I tell them something.  Oh, well.  And I got rid of all the paperwork.  Later on, I realized that, in my opinion, was a mistake.  It makes it hard to prove your point when you don't have information to back it up with.  You can't vet your information, so to speak.  However, I feel that this crock of crap from the FBI that conspiracy theorists, conspiracy theories, and those who believe them can be considered terrorists, That's just, it's fear-mongering.  They put it out there to scare the public, to warn the public, so that the public won't look into, quote, conspiracy theories and make a decision for themselves whether it's actually a conspiracy or if there's a single shred of evidence that within that conspiracy that it's true, then it ceases to be a conspiracy.  Then it's just an investigation, is these things true or not?  The government doesn't want you investigating what they're doing and knowing whether they're lying or they're not lying.  And they will always come against you for that.  And I believe this information was put out in the news intentionally, PSYOP will say, of a kind, by the FBI to make people back off on conspiracy theories.  um so i'm against that 100. um i believe we have a right to know what our government's doing a right to know if they're lying to us or they're not if they're doing things for our benefit or not.  they are tasked to protect the people and to enact the will of the people not their will the will of the people.  And our federal government does not do that.  We're pawns and that's all.  They don't care about us at all.  I don't care what they say.  I don't care what Trump says when he stands up there acting like he's all pro everything.  I don't care.  Because he talks out of both sides of his mouth from what I can see so far.  And it makes me nervous.  You have a right to know what's going on.  So don't let this conspiracy theory crap bother you.  If it does, don't.  If you hear about it and it makes you nervous, don't.  Just don't.  Use your own brain, okay?  I guess that's all I can say.  If you want to know if something's true or not, look into it.  Don't worry about what the government tells you.  Look into it.  You have a right to do that.  I guess that's it.  I just, boy, this thing with the gun confiscation and the red flag laws, you know, and people that they've arrested on red flag laws, It's just very, very disheartening.  I don't think they'll go door to door.  They could.  I don't think they will.  I think they'll find other ways.  They'll do stupid things to try to get you to turn in your guns.  But I don't think they'll go door to door.  But they might.  Having unregistered guns, unregistered guns, depending on your state you live in, is not a crime.  In Kansas, we do not have to register our guns.  If we buy a gun secondhand, it does not have to be registered.  Period.  Okay?  So, if that's the case, then there's a viable option for more guns, isn't there?  you could turn in the guns that you have that are registered, depending on what state you live in, and possibly purchase another gun.  You know, I don't know.  You're going to have to work that out for yourself.  But I will say, if you're not in Christ, not only do you have the penalty of your own sin nature going against you but you also don't have the leading of his holy spirit which will always tell you the correct thing to do.  your consciousness isn't good enough so i just want to say that i guess that's it.  i've been talking for 18 minutes and you guys probably aren't going to listen this whole thing anyway.  most of you don't i can tell by your comments but uh Anyway, I guess that's that.  You guys take care.  Thank you for subscribing to my channel.  I really do appreciate it.  I do.  Honestly, I wish I could make you believe that.  I very much care and appreciate you subscribing to my channel.  I appreciate the Patreons that I have that are helping support me on Patreon.  Those who have blessed me through my other forms of channel support, thank you all very, very much.  Those who can't afford to do that, don't feel bad.  I'm not judging you.  You're subscribed to my channel.  You encourage me.  You add comments to the conversation.  You are a valuable person to me, and I very much appreciate you.  being subscribed and sharing your thoughts on the videos.  So you guys all rock, every one of you.  And I appreciate all of you, okay?  For real, I really do.  I want you to know that.  So thank you.  That's all I got for today.  So until I have another one, stay safe, stay alert, engage your brain.  Don't get freaked out by the news.  Kind of travel on an even keel.  You know, as preppers, we can get really depressed sometimes with the news.  Sometimes we're rocking it and we're just on fire on prepping and other times, you know, they're not so good.  We need to find just an even keel and stay there.  And of course, for me, that even keel is the Holy Spirit that keeps me in peace in what I'm doing.  So anyway, God bless you guys.  That's it.  Talk to you later.  Bye. ",
