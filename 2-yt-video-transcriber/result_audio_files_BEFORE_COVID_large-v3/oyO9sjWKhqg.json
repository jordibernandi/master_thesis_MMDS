Hey guys, it's Kat, and it's time for another episode of True Tea.  I wanted to thank you guys for joining me for yet another episode of True Tea.  I appreciate those of you guys who are here every single week, and also I wanted to give a special shout out to those of you guys who have been here long enough to have heard me repeat some stories that I've told before.  Those of you guys who watched my video a couple weeks ago about why I am not a dom will have, and if you've been a long-term follower, you will have acknowledged that this was an old story that I'd already told.  I had an animated series where I told that story before.  And I appreciate those of you guys who have been with me long enough to have seen those videos.  And if you've been with me that long, you'll notice that those videos are now private aid.  They're no longer available.  But I did put them in a little playlist over here for those special people who care to see those old animated videos that I used to make.  So I'll put that right here for you guys to watch.  But yeah, I want to give a special thanks to those of you guys.  And if you're brand new here, what we like to do here is learn, share, and grow through education and conversation.  And this right here is the conversation segment.  This is where we talk about just the things that are on my mind, the things that relate to my personal life, the things that honestly I just sort of think about and feel like talking about.  And I like that.  we have a lot of really deep conversations in the comments section.  And that's really what this is all about.  My, my perspectives are not always correct.  They're not always measured, but they are my honest, true tea, right?  So that's what we're here to talk about.  And if you're into that sort of thing, you know, I think you should subscribe.  We'd like to do that here every single week on Tuesdays, usually at 6pm Pacific standard time, even though this video is definitely not being uploaded then.  So anyway, yeah, let's jump into this video.  But before we do, I would highly suggest that you go and grab yourself something to drink.  Personally, I am drinking some water because it is so hot.  If you can't already tell, I just, I try to film these videos at night, but I've had a really hard time filming these videos and have to film during the day.  It's stressing me out and I'm sweating quite a bit.  So let me drink my water and then we'll get into this conversation once again.  So I wanted to have a conversation about something that's been going on in my feed specifically on Twitter, right?  Um, I want to talk to you guys about pronouns because there's been a little bit of a discourse happening right now and I felt like I would share it with you guys because this particular conversation is honestly a true representation of some of the things that I was sort of referencing when I was talking about not always really having a full perspective when I used to make certain videos about certain things, you know?  And pronoun conversations definitely went a certain way for me when I was coming out of stealth, living in Orange County and not really having to engage with a community where people were discussing pronouns, where people were talking about pronouns, right?  Some of you guys know that I sort of became more popular on the internet because I was in a Buzzfeed video where I specifically talked about pronouns, right?  And after I made that video, I made another video talking specifically about pronouns.  And one of the bits of advice that I gave was if you don't know somebody's pronouns to use they, them and their pronouns until you know that those are the right ones, right?  Again, that's an example of something that I used to say when I wasn't so engaged in a certain community.  that now I feel differently about because personally for me, I definitely feel a lot of discomfort around people using they pronouns with me simply because they know that I'm transgender.  Right.  So I want to talk a bit about that.  I want to unpack that, go into my feelings about that, go into misgendering a bit more and yeah.  So this conversation started out by a tweet that I saw And this tweet was by someone named Diana Terje and she says, sometimes it's funny when you're the only trans person in a space where everyone's announcing their pronouns.  Like it gets to you and a hush falls over the room and you just like check your phone because only cis people need to be working on their pronoun game.  Right now, ContraPoints AKA Natalie Wynn respond to this and she says, this has happened to me before in hyper woke spaces.  Like it's me and a bunch of cis women and we all have to go in a circle saying she and her because I'm there.  She goes on to say, there's this paradox where I can go into a sports bar in North Carolina and be missed and ma'am all night.  No questions.  But in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces, I have to explain my pronouns and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves every time they say, you guys.  I guess it's good for people who only use they and them pronouns and want gender neutral language, but it comes at a minor expense to semi-passable trans women like myself.  That's super fucking hard for us.  And I actually really understood where this is coming from because this is actually something that I've dealt with, right?  You know, as a trans person, as a binary trans person specifically, I worked really, really, really, really hard to get to a point where people were looking at me, assuming my gender and gendering me properly.  Now, of course, my story is different from a lot of people's because my goal ultimately in life at a certain point was to be stealth, right?  And so that was really, really invested in maintaining these cisnormative ideas about what a woman looks like, how women are, da, da, da, da, classical femininity.  I had a lot of stake in these sort of ideas and it was all sort of created so that people would look at me and assume my gender, be correct and not be in a situation or I was being misgendered anymore.  Right.  And you know, I made a whole video over here where I talk a little bit more in depth about what it feels like to be misgendered.  But for me, being misgendered always felt like an attempt to embarrass me.  Right.  And you know, honestly, most of us are just out here trying to survive.  And for someone like myself, the goal was always to be, have my gender assumed and have it assumed correctly.  Right?  That's a very large component of what for me puts my dysphoria at bay.  Um, now sometimes when we have these conversations about, you know, pronouns and stuff, I'll be honest and say that it's an interesting paradox for me because I do feel a little dysphoric when people are specifically asking me for my pronouns because they know that I'm transgender.  Right.  And it's a confusing thing because, you know, on one hand, You know, when I was in college and I was coming out and I was figuring my stuff out, I would have killed for somebody to pull me aside and ask me what my pronouns were instead of assuming them and then misgendering me.  But now I feel very differently because there's so much space between that first couple of years of my trans life and where I am now almost a decade later, well, over a decade later.  And I think what it sort of triggers for me are those sort of defensive feelings, that sort of defensive reaction, right?  But I think one of the big things to acknowledge here, I think one of the most important things to acknowledge here upfront right away is that I have an incredible amount of privilege, right?  When I go through the world, I go into most spaces, and again, people now look at me, assume my gender, assume that I'm a woman, assume that I'm a she, her, and hers, and that's correct.  And that is an incredible privilege.  amount of privilege that your average non-binary person does not have.  I mean, for a lot of non-binary people, there's no such thing as passing as non-binary.  There's no such thing as looking non-binary and people just being able to look at you and assume that you use they, them, and their pronouns.  And then there's non-binary people who don't even use they, them, and their pronouns.  It's a very complicated, complex thing, right?  And non-binary people don't really play into, in fact, they're fighting against the cis-normative sort of ideas of gender that have made me feel so affirmed and welcomed and at home, right?  And so there's this weird way in which I think both of these sort of goals, right, are sort of working against each other.  You have trans people who, you know, trans people who are binary trans who say, you know, I want people to assume my gender and get that correct.  That is my goal.  That's what I want, right?  That's, even if it's not where I'm at now, it's where I'm trying to be.  And then you have people who say, well, I don't want you to assume my gender.  Right.  And so for me, that leaves me with a big question mark about how do we solve this.  right now, whenever we have these conversations, a lot of times non-binary people are sort of made to feel as though they are inconveniencing.  Um, people, right?  I, you know, obviously when we have these conversations about what, what are your pronouns, what are your, this, what are your, that's a lot of that is made in order to show support, right?  It's a, it's an attempt at sort of showing allyship to trans people, to non binary people, right?  And I have, you know, however, that all being said, I have my reaction to it.  Right.  And so I, this was a very interesting sort of bit of discourse for me to see in my feet because a lot of people were upset with Natalie because she was expressing that this sort of makes her uncomfortable, that being in these spaces where you have this sort of standardized, let me disclose what exactly my pronouns are.  it kind of makes people feel a little uncomfortable.  And I mean, to her point, a lot of times this happens and it feels like a very indirect way of attempting to clock somebody, right?  It happens a lot of times when people suspect that someone is trans.  suspect that someone has certain pronouns.  And in that way, sort of having a pronoun conversation draws attention to it in a way that a lot of trans people, especially ones who are binary, just don't truly feel comfortable with.  But again, it's this sort of complicated dance because this is something done in order to make people feel more included.  And a lot of times when binary trans people like Natalie complain about it, it seems like they're complaining about trying to be inclusive to non-binary people.  Now, one of the big things that I want us all to acknowledge in this conversation is that we're not really fighting against each other.  Binary trans people and non-binary trans people, like I said, we may have separate approaches when it comes to how we feel about pronouns.  But if we're being honest, if we're being real, what we're both fighting against is this sort of pressure to assimilate into cis normative standards.  That is what we're both sort of navigating around is this sort of thing that we're both sort of going through where people need to assume gender.  Obviously, assuming gender for most trans people, I would argue all trans people, has been something that at one point in our timeline has been incredibly hurtful, incredibly oppressive to us.  It's prevented a lot of us from being able to live the lives that we'd like to live.  In a way, I think sometimes we need to stop sort of looking at, oh, you know, non-binary people are making it inconvenient or binary people are sort of, you know, making us feel unwelcomed and understand that what we're both fighting against is the cis-normative standards.  Now, of course, everybody's feelings are valid.  Everybody's positions are, you know, valid.  And, you know, for me, where I sort of, my reaction sort of has, it comes from, you know, It's dysphoria and dysphoria isn't going to make any sense.  You have this practice that people do in order to make people feel included, but it makes me feel kind of alienated.  One of the things that I talked about on Twitter when I was sort of responding to a lot of this stuff was that this practice makes me feel alienated and so I tend to avoid most spaces where this is standardized.  We've already made a video on this channel about, you know, my discomfort in, you know, queer spaces and things like that.  But ultimately, um, when I know that I ha I'm going to go to a place where this is sort of a normal thing, I just try not to sort of engage with that.  I mean, I can really count the times that I put she, her and hers on, you know, my, my, my ID tags and any of these events that I've gone to with that standardized.  on one hand, it's It's just not really a thing that I find myself doing because for me, I feel like I guess my gender is obvious and somehow drawing attention to that does sort of trigger my dysphoria.  And what I want to communicate is that that feeling is valid, right?  But the big question that I have with that is, you know, a lot of times when we talk about allyship, we sort of talk about how allyship is supposed to be uncomfortable.  And maybe part of me being an ally to non-binary people is swallowing that discomfort that I have with people needing me to talk about my pronouns.  Because in truth, if we all standardize the practice of discussing pronouns, this would be less of a thing, right?  It would feel less like people are specifically targeting trans people.  They're only doing this when trans people in the room and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  When it was just a standardized thing across the board.  Right now, you know, I feel like this is a complicated conversation because to some degree, I think that people are always going to assume pronouns.  They're always going to look at somebody and assume their pronouns.  But maybe if we moved to a point where we were having this conversation, it would be less of a thing that felt jarring to me.  So I don't truly know what a solution in this conversation would be, which is why I'm asking you guys this question.  What do you guys think we should do?  Because on one hand, I don't want any non-binary people to feel alienated about these things.  On the other hand, I know I feel alienated when I feel like people are only asking about people's pronouns because I'm in the room.  You know, that for me doesn't feel like a safe and comfortable, happy place for me to be.  right?  But where does that leave us?  Where do we go?  I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.  So anyway, on that note, I will talk to you guys next week.  Right now, you're looking at two videos that you can watch if you want to continue to sip true tea right here on this channel.  And you know, you've got a little area in the corner where if you feel like sending me a tip, if you feel so inclined, you can do so.  Anyway, I'm melting.  So I'm going to go and I will see you guys next Tuesday.  Bye. ",
