And it doesn't matter whether you've handed a weapon or not before you showed up here at boot camp.  When you show up, first day, you'll go to SAMT to get some simulator training.  First, you'll go through a classroom portion.  You'll learn from a PowerPoint and an instructor.  And they will go over very basic shooting fundamentals of the M9 service pistol.  And then after that is finished, then you will actually go out onto the laser range, shoot the simulator, go through the course of fire.  Holster.  And we'll also go into holster drills to get some more hands-on training with some weapons, what we call dry fire. ",
