            "text": "Part of my mostly meat eating habits and lifestyle is eating raw beef.  I'm gonna show you how I prepare raw beef.  Stay tuned.  Here we are on the cozy nook.  This is raw beef that I prepared yesterday.  I'm gonna show you how I did it and then what I do 24 hours after marinating it.  What I do is I start out with sliced thin raw beef.  Let's just open this up.  Hands are clean, everything is clean.  And this would be the kind of beef that you get when you make brajol.  So what we have here is raw beef, like this.  One piece in a bowl.  Two, three, four.  Now this will be my breakfast tomorrow.  I need wolf energy when I go to the salon.  So this is what we have.  Smells fresh.  I take the juice of half of a lemon.  Now remember, we're not cooking this at all.  So juice of half a lemon goes in here.  The whole thing.  And then a little bit of the Himalayan salt from the salt pig.  The salt and the lemon juice make a mild form of hydrochloric acid, which... for lack of a better term, cooks the meat.  It's still raw.  If you've had ceviche, like with scallops and shrimp and seafood, like a little ceviche cocktail, you know that seafood can be cooked in lime juice.  So I just put that around.  In the past, I've done things like added pickle juice because there's brine in it.  And then I would use the flavoring and the spices that are from pickles to also be imparted to the meat.  I have some pickle juice that I'm just going to put in there.  And that's the same thing as putting some salt in there.  Just a little bit.  Tiny little bit.  A little bit of roasted garlic.  You can use fresh garlic as well.  Chop it up well.  I just kind of... Put a little bit of that in there and then grind some black pepper.  Look at my watch falling off me because I lost so much weight.  My watch just doesn't even... I have to take a link out now.  This is what being mostly meat has done for me.  It's trimmed me up.  And then I just mix it up.  Now, like I said, this will be my breakfast tomorrow.  Get that all in there.  And then I basically just cover it up.  You can already see the redness is starting to go away.  Let me just put that aside.  Now, the stuff that I prepared yesterday, I have raw meat once or twice a week.  So this is the meat.  the sliced beef.  that was the same thing that I took out of the package from yesterday.  It almost looks like cooked roast beef that you would get in a deli, right?  But the same process.  So in order to make it interesting, and the problem that I found doing carnivore is that it gets boring.  And if you don't get some techniques to take the boredom out of it, you'll quit.  Just like anything in life, you'll quit.  So one of the things that I do, because I'm of the firm belief that meat is food, firm believer that meat is food, and that plants and vegetables are medicine and spice.  I like taking capers.  I'm going to take a couple capers.  These are capers.  They're very, very, very sour, sweet, and salty.  So it has everything in it.  I'm going to put a couple capers on here like that.  Can you see that?  And I'm going to take an olive.  Cut that olive in half the long way.  So I have like two halves.  Put that in there.  Now I'm going to roll this up.  And you could put a toothpick through it if you want.  And this is what I end up with right here.  This is raw beef cooked in lemon juice, garlic, pepper, a little bit of pickle juice.  Take the next one.  Same thing.  Two capers.  An olive.  And if you want to, you'll notice that the vegetables in this are more condimental in nature.  So it's not a vegetable dish, obviously.  Made another roll.  And this makes it interesting, like I said, when you use things like capers and olives, you use them as, when I say condimental, in the same way that you would use ketchup or mustard on a hot dog.  It's not about the ketchup or the mustard, it just flavors it.  People would say, well, I thought you were a carnivore.  I'm mostly meat.  Not 100% carnivore.  I did 100% carnivore for 30 days and lost a lot of weight.  Very controversial if you look at my carnivore videos.  I got everybody attacking me.  All those compassionate people that just are so compassionate.  Wishing me heart attacks.  That's always fun.  Roll that up.  Again, this will be dinner tonight.  I like the big capers.  These are called Capote capers versus the little nonpareil capers, which are tiny little things.  And the extra brine and salt in the capers and the olives helps magnify the flavor of the beef.  So this is about three quarters of a pound of beef that I'm preparing.  You could use the olives that are stuffed with garlic or with feta or blue cheese.  That works out well too.  This is the beef that I get has kind of like veins of fat running through it.  So you can see this is my dinner for tonight.  Made fresh, marinated for 24 hours, which the acid itself in the lemon juice and then with the salt which becomes hydrochloric acid, literally almost starts digesting the meat, so to speak.  It breaks down the fibers, but it is still considered raw.  And then what I'll do is put a couple capers on the plate.  And you can prepare this any way you want.  I'm gonna show you a couple things that I do.  That's my dinner plate for tonight.  Black pepper on top.  And then I take a potato peeler and get some cheese.  So you can't please the hardcore carnivores and you can't please the hardcore vegans.  So I like being a radical moderate.  That's what I like doing.  But the results have worked absolutely amazing for me.  This tastes great with a glass of red wine.  There's something about red meat and red wine that is just out of this world.  And I am ready for dinner.  I will let this sit and let those flavors from the olives and the capers kind of marry a little bit.  And that's my dinner.  Satisfying.  Filling.  I don't feel cheated.  I'm not... Dying for anything else gives me the protein that I need, the fat that I need because it is a marbled fatty meat.  You ought to try it sometime.  Using this recipe, I think you'll be very happy.  Or make it as an appetizer.  And don't tell anyone what it is in your house.  People are going to love it.  You could even take these little rolls.  and slice them up into medallions and put a toothpick through them.  And that's another way of creating more visual interest and more steps that you have to take rather than just like a pile of stuff on a plate and throw it down.  You can take a bite and have a sip of wine and enjoy yourself.  And another way to Get away from the boredom of a diet.  It's really not a diet for me.  It's a lifestyle.  I hope you enjoyed that.  Try it and let me know in the comments section down below when you try it and what you think of it.  I'd be interested in seeing what you have to say.  In many higher-end restaurants, this would be called beef carpaccio.  Give it a shot.  I think you'll like it. ",
