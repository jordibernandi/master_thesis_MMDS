            "text": "So Joe Biden recently made a lot of liberals incredibly angry because an article from Reuters came out recently that cited two sources close to Biden that indicated that he'd be seeking a more middle ground approach when it comes to the issue of climate change.  And rather than taking bold action, he'd instead be doing more incremental things to mitigate climate change.  So he rejoined the Paris Climate Accord, for example.  Now, the problem is that even when Obama joined the Paris Climate Accord, it didn't go far enough back then.  But now we have even more data telling us that we need to act urgently.  Otherwise, we will not be able to stop a climate catastrophe.  The IPCC in last December just warned us that we have 12 years to get our act together.  So to see this from a leading Democrat, it had a lot of people on the left justifiably outraged.  Because if you're going to pursue a middle ground approach... then we will not save the planet.  You will not stop the planet from becoming an apocalyptic hellscape, pretty much.  So Joe Biden saw that everyone was ripping him.  And that same day, he walked back this claim that his advisors had put out, tweeting, \"'I'm proud to have been one of the first to introduce climate change  legislation.'\".  what i fought for in nineteen eighty.  six is more important than ever.  climate change is an existential threat now.  today we need policies that reflect this urgency.  i'll have more specifics on how america can lead on climate in the coming weeks.  Now, I don't think that this satisfied anyone because everybody knows that Joe Biden is willing to say and do anything to get elected.  He takes policy positions, much like Hillary Clinton, for purposes of political expediency.  So he's telling us this now, but we all know once he gets elected, he's going to do whatever his donors want.  So Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, someone who's been a leader on this, decided to take a thinly veiled shot at Joe Biden.  So she tweeted out an article from Common Dreams that explains how CO2 levels for the first time in more than three million years.  hit 415 parts per million.  And she says, this is why a middle ground approach to our climate crisis is unacceptable.  This isn't like other issues where you can pretend you're a sober adult by cutting the difference between left and right.  You're either fighting for our future or you're not.  So it's obvious that she's talking about Joe Biden here.  And before he jumped into the race, she made comments about him that suggested that she's not too happy about him running for president.  In fact, she said something along the lines of she's not excited about a Joe Biden candidacy or it doesn't excite her.  But nonetheless, she doesn't like what he's saying here because this undermines what she's been pushing for with the Green New Deal.  She crafted legislation specifically designed to meet the urgency of this crisis.  And what he's saying here in opting for a more middle ground approach is basically a slap in the face to that effort.  It's a slap in the face to all of these climate change activists who have been begging Democrats to take bold action.  So the problem is that Joe Biden will say one thing and then do another.  So the fact that he walked back this middle ground approach, it's not going to persuade anyone because we know that.  He's going to govern as an incrementalist, as a centrist, because that's how him and Obama govern for eight years, because he was the vice president.  We don't have to try to speculate about the way that he would govern.  We know how he would govern.  We have the empirical evidence that dictates that he will pursue a middle ground approach if he does anything on climate change.  Will he even push for legislation or will he just pursue executive action that can be undone the next time we get a Republican president.  So obviously this won't suffice.  And at a speech, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was talking about the Green New Deal and she very bluntly took another shot at Joe Biden and it was phenomenal. ",

What is too much for me is the fact that ExxonMobil knew exactly that climate change was real and man-made as far back as 1970, and instead of being part of the solution, they paid millions of dollars to lobby and lie and confuse the American public about it, endangering generations to come.

I'll be damned if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to come back today and say we need a middle of the road approach to save our lives.  That is too much for me.  That was amazing because she's right here.  The reason why he is seeking out this middle of the road approach is because he doesn't want to take action when it comes to climate change.  He may care about it, but he has a lot of special interests in his ear who will be persuading him to do otherwise.  So he knows that if he says, well, look, we need to work with Republicans.  That's going to give him plausible deniability.  He's going to say, look, I tried to work with Republicans and they shot me down so I couldn't do anything.  So I guess we can't do anything.  But going back to her tweet, when she says that, you know, you're not acting like a grown up if you're splitting the difference between left and right.  She's 100% correct here because you're not being reasonable.  You're being an imbecile.  You're being suicidal here.  And you're putting all of our lives at risk by saying you want to seek out middle ground.  between democrats and republicans one party believes in climate change and kind of wants to act, the other party doesn't believe in climate change at all.  Donald Trump thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax.  So even if you seek out middle ground and you concede to their insanity, even minimally, they still win.  That's still a victory for them.  So what AOC is doing here in calling him out is a public service because she has the popularity and the name recognition.  That will maybe make him realize that he's not going to win anyone on the left over if he's going to continue to pander to Republican voters, who he thinks he needs to win over.  Which we all know, if you want to win, you've got to get non-voters to come out and vote for you.  But again, this is Joe Biden, so he's dim-witted.  But nonetheless... She's been taking these thinly veiled shots at him, and he's now starting to take notice.  Because a reporter from the Hill actually asked him about this at, I believe, a yogurt shop.  He's always in these ice cream or yogurt shops.  But nonetheless, he was asked about this, and his response basically was... Me?  Me?  Are you talking about me?  Like he literally denied that she was even talking about him.  Take a look. ",

Well, no, so I guess that's technically true, but people closest to you... have said that that's what you are pursuing.  And it's not like that's some absurd thing to believe.  You're a centrist.  You are a center-right politician.  So, of course, you're going to pursue middle ground when it comes to this issue and pretty much every other issue.  But he says, oh, I've never said that.  Well, come on, you're being disingenuous because we know that that's what your team knows that you're going to do, and that's why they said it.  He also says, I've never been middle of the road on the environment.  Well, you have a really weird way of showing that you know about the urgency with which we need to act because you were vice president for eight years and you didn't say too much when it comes to climate change.  You haven't been a leader on the issue of climate change.  And then he says, you know, if AOC is talking about him, then look at his record.  I don't think you wanted to do that.  But then he ends by saying, I don't think she's talking about me.  Joe Biden is such a joke.  And I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about his other recent denials.  He denies that his crime bill led to mass incarceration.  He's denied this or made this claim twice now in a week.  He's a danger.  If he wins the nomination, we are risking another four years of Donald Trump.  So if you are on the left, if you are a liberal and you still have these warm and fuzzy feelings for Joe Biden, put that aside and realize that you're playing with fire if your ultimate goal is truly to defeat Donald Trump.
