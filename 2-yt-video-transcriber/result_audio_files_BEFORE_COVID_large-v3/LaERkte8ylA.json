There's no systemic American racist going down to El Salvador and saying, you better get up and sneak into the United States.  And there's nobody in the United States who forces people who come here illegally to commit crimes.  I think the premise of this question is actually quite offensive, though it's a popular assumption, which is that illegal aliens somehow don't have free will.  It's the assumption that illegal aliens are somehow morally uneducated.  They have no sense of right and wrong.  They have no ability to control their emotions and their impulses.  This is obviously profoundly racist and not true.  We have free will.  We have the ability to do what we want to do.  This is why, by the way, the majority of Hispanic people in the United States and Hispanic voters oppose illegal immigration.  The races are exactly the same.  The ethnicity is exactly the same.  The question of crime is different because race does not determine your criminality. ",

They all seem to be doing just fine.  I don't think any of them have felt violence because they listened to a lecture on basic facts about our immigration system.  The question was, have I asked people in this room if they've felt as though some violence has been committed on them?  No, I haven't asked because no violence has been committed on you.  Because violence is not a subjective feeling.  Violence is an objective fact.  I can objectively gauge whether or not someone has become violent.  The other day, I was at the University of Missouri, Kansas City.  Some protester attacked me with some weird chemical.  That was an objective act of violence.  But somebody disagreeing with me, such as some people in this room are doing, are not committing violence on me.  And I would say to you, as a faculty member at a taxpayer-funded university, this is the foundation of liberal education.  If you cannot understand that there is a difference between speech and violence, you don't understand anything that undergirds the liberal arts or liberal education.  And that is a real shame.  And I say this with all respect and with great distress for our universities.  If our teachers don't understand the difference between ideas and violence, between speech and violence, then they are in no position to educate the next generation of Americans. ",
