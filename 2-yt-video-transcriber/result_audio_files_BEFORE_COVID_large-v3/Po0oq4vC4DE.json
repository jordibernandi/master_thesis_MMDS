I'm not letting up.  I'm going to put my foot on their neck, and I'm not letting up, I promise.  Another thing is a lot of people said something about the things I asked for.  That's not going to be every video.  Again, I just wanted to see how many of you were active on my channel and I just wanted a little feedback.  I figured feedback would be better, would be more appreciated than me getting on here doing what some auditors do.  We won't say his name because we all know who I'm talking about.

We nicely, as I'm dialoguing with you, spoke to him and said, officer, listen, you might show me the inside of your car.  Can you talk to me about the tents?  He was telling me, officers can have whatever tent they want to have in their car.  And I said, so what's the street code?  He said, what, like 5% or 10%?  I said, you know what, thanks for the information.  That's what we were looking at.  We went back after we spoke to him, talking to those sweet ladies back here.  That's why we're walking back up this way when we encounter him.  Nobody said anything to us about being out here except him.  We've spoken with three officers personally.  I'm talking about within as close proximity as you are to me.  That's how we spoke.  Great.  So that's our confusion because if that's protocol here, how come?  he's the only one that said anything?  That's what I'm asking.  If this is protocol, which I hope it isn't, nobody else said anything.  So either he's right and they're wrong and needs to be wrote up or they're right and he's wrong. ",
