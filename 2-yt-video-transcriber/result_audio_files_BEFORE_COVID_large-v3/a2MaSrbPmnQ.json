            "text": "12, 12, 12.  So anyway, one of Jordan Peterson's new grifts is that he's conning his fans into signing up for this school that cost them $65,000 for a year.  And it's really, really, really fucking cult-like.  So let me show it to you, right?  So this was on his Twitter three days ago.  I guess it's four days ago now.  And he's been advertising this all over the place, trying to get people to sign up for it.  And it's kind of a... vague.  The people don't really know how much it costs or anything until they get into the process.  I'll show you in a minute how they do it, but they kind of mislead them.  And then finally at the end they reveal to them that it cost $65,000 in the scam.  So Peterson Fellowship at Acting School of Business, ranked by Princeton Review as having the most competitive MBAs in America seven years in a row, apply now.  So all of this is bullshit.  What he's doing here is he's purposely trying to mislead people.  Now if you read this, Princeton Review as having the most competitive MBAs, what does that make you think?  Do you think, hey, according to Princeton Review, which is obvious, it's Princeton, so it's obviously a reputable source, this program gives you the most competitive MBAs in the business world.  Obviously, the job market is what makes this competitive.  And so these MBAs are incredibly competitive in the job market.  That's how important this business school is.  Isn't that what you would think?  Of course, that's what he wants you to think, but that's not actually the truth whatsoever.  The truth is that the most competitive MBAs is where the students go to the Princeton Review website and they say, hey, our classmates are really competitive.  See, it's basically a cult, and they basically encourage the cult members to go to the Princeton Review website and fill out the online survey saying that their classmates are really competitive.  And then they use that as a selling point for the school to mislead people.  I'll show you here.  The way he words it, purposely meant to trick you into believing that the MBAs from this program are the most competitive in the job market.  when nothing could be further from the truth.  It's simply an online survey of your classmates.  Here's the Princeton Review.  Most competitive students, that's what he's talking about, based on student answers to survey questions concerning how competitive their classmates are, how heavy the workload is, and the perceived academic pressure.  That's all we're talking about here.  It's not that these are the most competitive MBAs in the job market.  It's that it's a cult, and they're like, hey, did you go to the Princeton Review yet and tell them how hard your classes are?  Go do it.  Peterson wants you to.  Jordan wants you to do it.  Go do it.  And they're like, OK, let me go fill this out because this, you know, part of it is what we're known for.  So we all got to go do it.  Right.  And so it's just basically an online survey that they're using to purposely mislead people.  It's just a scam.  You know, Jordan Peterson is a con artist and this is just an obvious fucking part of the scam.  So let's look into this a little bit more.  And here is the Web page that he leads you to.  So cult-like.  The opportunity.  Audition.  You have to audition for it.  Audition for the Peterson Fellowship at the Acton School of Business in Austin, Texas.  The fellowship includes pay it forward financial support, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And so here's a Reddit thread about it.  This is basically one of his fans that started an open letter to Jordan Peterson explaining to him that something's hinky.  Something's hinky in your fucking scam and we want more information about it.  And he starts asking questions.  And so this person goes to Reddit and they want answers.  I was accepted as a Peterson Fellow for the Acton MBA Fellowship and had my acceptance rescinded for asking too many questions and being uncomfortable with ambiguity.  I'm confused, Dr.  Peterson.  This program requires $65,000 in debt and relocation.  We deserve answers.  Dr.  Peterson, the following is an unedited transcript of the email exchange I had with ActonSense.com.  Being accepted as a Peterson Fellow, I'm confused.  Your message of responsibility speaks to me deeply, and it does not seem very responsible to ask someone to uproot their lives, move across the country, lose a year of wages, go into $65,000 in debt, all for a program that refuses to answer basic questions about your level of involvement.  The Acton MBA seems like a wonderful standard program, but fellows applied for this because of your name, not because of Acton.  If you just signed off on this as a branding deal, I'm profoundly  disappointed.\".  I'm flummoxed that you haven't mentioned it once in a public interview that I can find in the past months.  Not even your recent Q&A.  So basically this guy's like got accepted.  They want his money.  And so he starts asking questions, right?  He sends all these questions, you know, how does the Peterson Fellowship differ from standard acting MBA specifically?  How were their workload class experience different fellowship recipients?  What is Jordan Peterson's involvement in any?  Just ask, you know, can you give me information before I give you $65,000?  And so the CEO, Jeff Sennifer, which we're going to talk about in a minute, he's basically a right-wing douchebag, rich right-wing douchebag.  Anyway, basically he responds with, you're asking too many questions, so we're going to let you go.  We already have like 2,300 people who have tried to sign up and apply to be a fellowship, and they didn't ask that many questions.  We only had 50 spots, so we're basically going to reject you right now because you're asking too many questions and go with some of the other people, which is strange as fuck.  So basically what is happening here, let me just show you.  The Acton Business School was basically about to go out of business.  You see, the tuition until 2nd of September was $49,000, according to their student handbook.  Due to low enrollments on October 2018, the president of Harmon-Simon University was about to close the Acton, as they say, as their accredited B school.  And so right before they close the school, what happens?  They make a deal with Jordan Peterson.  And they're like, hey, Jordan.  Well, you put your name on this school and get students to come to the school by saying, you know, it's a Peterson Fellowship.  And then suddenly they go from being a school that's almost about to be shut down to having 2,300 people sign up for it.  And they get to choose 50 people at $65,000 a pop.  So what I'm guessing happened here is they basically came up to Peterson.  They said, hey, Peterson.  Want to know how you can make an extra million dollars a year?  And, of course, he's like, hell, hi-yo, I am Kermit the Fraud.  Hell, yes, I want to know how I can make an extra million dollars a year.  And so basically they're like, all you have to do is advertise our school on your Facebook and Twitter and maybe show up like once a year to give a speech to the students or something.  And this is all speculation.  This is what I'm guessing happened, though.  I'm guessing it's some kind of marketing deal.  And since their original fee was $49,000 a year, now suddenly, now that Peters is attached to it, they raised it to $65,000 a year.  I'm assuming that they're giving him a kickback.  Probably something around $20,000 per student that he... supplies to them.  so they're picking 50 students per year.  $20,000 per 50 students is a million dollars right.  so they're like you can make a cool million dollars.  all you have to do is advertise the school to your fans and then say you're loosely associated with it and we'll pay you and you'll make bank.  So that's what I'm fucking guessing happened, and this is the shady motherfucker that actually started the school.  This is how shady the people that Peterson is in business with, because he's a con artist.  This is the kind of people he hangs out with.  Peterson recently announced the establishment of a partnership with Acton School of Business, where a Peterson Fellowship has recently been set up.  The school started and run by Jeff Sandifer, a billionaire oilman who acquired 17 billion barrels of Australian shale oil reserved in a controversial deal... and pumped much of the profits into bankrolling conservative non-profits in tandem with other big businesses and big oil groups.  These non-profits, including the American Phoenix Foundation, he gave them over $280,000, notorious for strapping hidden cameras onto operatives in order to track and illegally film politicians, essentially for the purpose of blackmailing or ousting political opponents.  Senator also runs the Ed Foundation, a philanthropic tax exempt organization that spreads cash to dozens of right wing causes.  For example, it dishes out about five million dollars in grants a year to conservative groups like Texas Public Policy Foundation, a climate denying Koch funded group of which Senator is a board member in power in Texas.  And agenda wise, Senator is also part of a network, including the Koch brothers.  Anyway, he's basically a giant rich shithead who's in bed with all the other fucking giant rich shitheads, and this is the guy paying Peterson.  You know, these are the same people that always pay Peterson tons of money.  Peterson's making already like $8 million a year.  It's never a fucking enough for this goddamn con man.  He just wants to grift people as much as he fucking can possibly grift.  And this whole thing sounds exactly like a fucking cult.  Let me read the description from one of the people that actually goes to this school, what they had to say about it.  Here's what Peterson's website says about it.  Who should audition?  You are not afraid of committing to something important, facing hard work and challenges head on.  Catalysts, leaders, dedicated workers, inquisitive learners, team players.  This is exactly like fucking Scientology.  This is just Scientology bullshit, man.  He has his own cult.  And then this is what a person that is trying to \u2013 this is a person that says they go there, but it sounds like a sock account that's trying to sell people to sign up for this Peterson Fellowship.  This is what they say.  He was one of the founding board members of the Acton Institute of Grand Rapids, Michigan.  If you are unfamiliar with Acton Institute, it is one of the most dynamic think tanks working today.  It focuses on Judeo-Christian principles that are necessary to create a free and virtuous society.  Their Acton University summer school experience is one of the most dynamic gatherings of people who are theologically and economically minded on the planet.  It is definitely not PC, and the conversations taking place there are vital to the future of our country as we are facing an assault by cultural Marxist and socialist populism.  Definitely not a cult at all, right?  Want even more proof?  this is not a cult?  It gets even fucking creepier than this, dudes.  This is what they literally say on the Peterson Fellowship Act.  This is what they say on their website.  One caveat.  While we work closely with Dr.  Peterson and his team, it would be a mistake to attend because you long for personal time with Dr.  Peterson.  That is a rare privilege that must be earned.  Does this not sound exactly like an L. Ron Herbert cult?  L. Ron Peterson.  This is as fucking cult as it can possibly get.  $65,000 to a school that helps you combat cultural Marxism and that may give you the opportunity to earn the privilege of hanging out with Jordan Peterson if you're worthy.  That is the fucking most obvious cult-like scam I've ever seen, right?  It's just never a fuck enough for these people.  It's crazy, crazy how fucking cool it is.  It's crazy that he can find so many people that are willing to pay $65,000 just to be involved with him.  That's what a hold he has on these people.  And that's what I find.  It's really sad, you know.  There's so many people out there who are just desperate to find somebody they believe has all the answers.  Like a guru who just tell them how to live their life.  They're just so desperate to want to know what's going on in this world.  And they just fall for this shit hook, line, and sinker.  What you have to understand about these gurus is they're all just human beings.  They don't really know.  They don't have all the answers.  They're just trying to figure this shit out like everybody else.  They're not superhuman.  And sometimes, like, it's obviously much more rare than it is for Jordan Peterson, but sometimes people treat me like this.  Like, I'm some kind of guru that has all the answers and shit, and holy shit, nothing could be further from the truth.  Not only do I not have all the answers, I don't even have all the questions.  Like, I don't know what the fuck's going on.  I'm just trying to figure all this shit out as I go.  Just like every fucking body else, that's what Peterson's doing.  So, you know, stop putting your faith in these gurus.  Stop putting your faith in these men that you think are so genius.  that they have it all figured out because they fucking don't.  The ones that pretend like they do, they're trying to grift you.  They're trying to get money off you.  They're feeding off you like fucking vampires.  Why is up to this shit?  It's obvious as fuck, man.  It's not too late.  It's not too late. ",
