            "text": "We're living through a time when conservative Christians have a lot of political power, which means we get to see how they're using it.  What are they doing?  Well, they're shoving far-right conservatives, even unqualified ones, to lifetime appointments on federal courts.  They're discriminating against LGBTQ people however they can.  The government's kicking trans people out of the military and writing Supreme Court briefs in defense of discrimination by Christian-owned businesses.  They're making sure the White House is overflowing with as many right-wing Christian leaders as they can find.  So for all their talk of religious freedom, they're really just using their power to instill Christian supremacy.  Now, if you watch Fox News and live in a conservative media bubble, you might think all this is necessary.  After all, if atheists were in charge, we'd be doing the exact same thing, right?  We'd shut down churches.  We'd block people from saying Merry Christmas.  We'd put pastors in jail for speaking out against homosexuality.  I mean, right?  That's what they say.  I'm not exaggerating.  Now, we know that's wrong.  But they don't.  And now a study has shown just how ignorant they are.  This week in the Washington Post, there was an article from a Denison University professor who showed how a majority of white evangelical Christians sincerely believe atheists would strip away their rights if given the chance.  Even though the research shows atheists don't want to do that.  His study found that 60% of white evangelical Protestants believe that atheists, if they have the power, would block their ability to hold rallies, teach in public schools, have free speech, or run for office.  Again, the correct answer here is 0%.  Because that's not what atheists want, certainly not as a group.  But 60% of white evangelicals think our goal is to shut them up and deprive them of their rights.  Most of us might have passionate disagreements with conservatives, but we are not trying to do to them what they are doing to us.  I know this sounds cliche, but bear with me.  Liberals aren't trying to take away your health care.  They want conservatives to have affordable health care.  Liberals aren't trying to take away anyone's right to vote.  They're fighting to make sure everyone of age can vote.  Liberals aren't trying to gerrymander states for political gain.  They're fighting for fair maps.  Both sides are not the same.  And most atheists are liberals in the U.S Anyway, the professor went even further.  He mentioned another survey he conducted a couple of years ago in which he asked various religious groups to name how much they liked other religious groups.  So, naturally, there were atheists who really hated fundamentalist Christians and fundamentalists who really hated atheists.  No surprise there.  Those people were then asked if, given the choice, they would allow those other groups to do things like give speeches, teach in schools, run for office, etc.  Get this.  Among atheists who said they hated Christian fundamentalists more than any other religious group, 65% of them said they would still be perfectly fine with those Christians having the same rights as everyone else.  I wish the number were higher, but there you go.  But among white evangelicals who hated atheists the most, even more than white supremacists, only 32% said the same.  This is a core difference between the two groups, and it illustrates why the both-sides-are-the-same argument is ridiculous.  We are not equally dogmatic just on opposite sides of the spectrum.  In fact, these results just emphasize a point I've made repeatedly.  When it comes to the government, atheists fight for religious neutrality, while white evangelicals fight for Christian supremacy.  when white evangelicals are in power as they are now, everyone outside that particular bubble is screwed.  We see that in action now.  We hear them say it all the time.  And all the fear-mongering that occurs in conservative media and at evangelical churches has made it so.  those Christians believe they have to keep others down.  They've taken the Golden Rule and destroyed it.  That's not the case when just about anyone else is in power.  White evangelicals have long believed they are persecuted.  That's why they overreach when given the opportunity.  And yet the irony is that there's no way they would swap power with any other group.  If they truly believe Christians are under attack, I am happy to trade the number of open atheists in Congress with the number of evangelicals.  No Christian would ever take that bet, though, because it would shatter the myth that they are persecuted, when in reality, they're the persecutors.  The bullies always want you to think they're the real victims.  Don't fall for it. ",
