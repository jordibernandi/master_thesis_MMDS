And we've got every right to be worried because we're like some entity by ourselves.  And while you're by yourself, the enemy can do whatever he wants with you.  But when we become an army, a collective, a community, the enemy has to think twice.  this is important.  our young people.  they're warriors but they're rebellious warriors against themselves and mostly it's not xenophobia.  mostly they're suffering from self-hatred killing themselves killing their own brother abusing their own sister.  This can only change when those of us who understand that change is necessary and decide to be a part of the change.  Not expecting somebody to change it for us, but knowing that we have to play our part.  Only when we understand this and we decide once and for all.  Let's do this.  And let's stay the course.  Because this ain't no walk in the park.  As I said before, it's not for punks.  It's not for cowards.  It's not for weak-hearted people.  When you're talking about Robert Mugabe, you ain't talking about no weak heart.  The day of judgment is not a 24-hour day, beloved.  We're living in the day of judgment right now. ",
