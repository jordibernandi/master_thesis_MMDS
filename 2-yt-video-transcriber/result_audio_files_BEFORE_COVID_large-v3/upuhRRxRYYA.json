            "text": "All right here.  I am makaiki challenge 2019 pretty stoked just of course to shoot it for my friends of mine been shooting this event since its inception.  But I'm really stoked cuz I get to take my forerunner out here at Jurassic Park, and it is a muddy one.  So I'm slipping and sliding already just even on the main road.  look at the rain coming down starting to come down hard and Yeah, get to push the 4-0 a little bit today as I'm running around shooting here.  So I'll try to get some shots hard because I'm shooting solo.  Actually, I think I'm going to spin back around and go to the mud pit since I'm going to be behind a bunch of lollygaggers right now.  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  okay this is actually pretty legit mud.  i am sliding everywhere.  i'm in four high right now but the mud is.  i mean the road is so muddy.  i'm slipping sliding everywhere.  it's pretty cool and i mean it's tough on.  the competitors are running this.  look at the guys sliding around in front of me.  man i want to go off the path.  so bad my truck is literally sliding around.  this is this kind of slippery clay style mud here.  what always sliding around?  let's take a look at the wheels.  Yeah, I'd say pretty stoked I went with some mud terrains.  You know, daily driving, of course, they're not the best tire, but here you go.  Final example, you need a mud terrain tire.  Once every, once a month, maybe, unless you're, you know, somebody who really does need them daily.  This is cool.  Look at the valley.  Also, they got like a burpee station or a box jump station.  Oh, the rain just hit hard, pouring right now.  Look.  And here's like the boulder carry.  Nice.  Get them, boys.  Get them.  Trying to film it out the door because the cage is soaked and I got to shoot the whole rest of the day.  Little river crossing.  Oh, dude, it's dark.  Oh, dripping in, dripping in.  Yeah, I definitely love the auto windows in these trucks, man.  All four, too.  Yeah, this is where they shot Kong Island.  Pretty cool.  Oh, the mountain is just towering.  So epic, this place, man.  I can't even imagine just feeling just free rein back here every day, cruising.  Nice.  See you.  Good job, team.  Good job, team.  There you go.  Yeah, baby.  All right.  Oh, my gosh.  Wow, that's awesome right there.  Many hands make light work, yeah?  Sweet.  Let me see.  Good luck to you.  Okay, cool.  I'm gonna meet you at the bottom.  Ready?  Ready, set, go.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Hey, thank you, thank you.  That's definitely highlight reel.  Thanks, good job, girls.  That was definitely highlight reel.  Okay, I'll get somebody else coming down.  Perfect.  That was the highlight of the mud right there.  What, what, what?  Oh, nice.  Good job, good job.  Yeah.  I know you got mud in the teeth.  Nice.  Nice recovery.  Nice.  Good work, good work, good work.  All right.  Right off.  You hit him.  Good job, good job.  Yeah, grab him.  Yeah, it's a tough one because it's so slippery.  Hey, there's a little ledge.  Okay, right on the other side.  There's a little ledge.  Oh, yeah.  Can you grab your wrist?  Yeah.  There's a little ledge, yeah.  Nice teamwork action.  Yeah, gosh, it's such a blessing to be out here.  This place never gets cold, unreal.  True mud run style.  The only thing that bums me out is I never get to really run the course.  I'm always shooting the thing.  Usually every year I used to run it at the very end, but now I'm so smoked by the time the day's up that I'm like, okay, I've been running around the obstacles all day, and now I'm going to go run the obstacle course at the end of the day?  I'm like... I'm beat.  Plus, I'm 44 now, so I'm getting a little older.  The joints don't recover like they used to.  Good job, good job, good job.  Thank you.  Nice, boys.  Thank you.  Charging, bro.  Look at you.  This is where it gets hard.  What the?  nice all right that's about it.  i gotta go shoot a wedding now so i can't even shoot the whole event but You'll see a little following highlight.  You'll see some shots throughout the whole day, and it's just such a fun event.  This makes this so unique, as this is Hawaii's first and only true mud run.  You know, there's the national ones, you know, like Spartan Race and Tough Mudder.  What else?  Warrior Dash.  There's several out there, but this is Hawaii's own, and it's always here at Kulo Ranch.  And every year, it just keeps getting better and better, all the obstacles.  We're on it.  Okay, so next time.  I actually got a good old wedding now, man.  I got a bunch of stuff though. ",
