Don't forget, Friday, live stream, 8 a.m.  Central Standard Time.  Here we go.  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, Republican, South Carolina, says he will direct his panel to investigate whether top officials at the Justice Department and the FBI considered an attempted bureaucratic coup to remove President Donald Trump from office.  It's about time these Democrats, communist traitors were investigated.  Republicans are finally going to scratch the surface of what's going on in the deep state.  The Justice Department's attempt to subvert the will of the people and remove a duly elected president of the people, for the people, and by the people.  Here's the ones on the list to be investigated by Senator Graham on the attempted coup so far.  James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, and Andrew McCabe.  It's starting, people.  What I've been talking about, military tribunals are right around the corner.  The envelopes, well, here you go.  The contents of these envelopes in some way let the deep state cabal know this was going to happen.  It was short, sweet, and to the point.  And it only took seconds to understand what was going on when they looked at their envelopes.  It could have been a picture or a three or four word warning.  Again, I ask, where are they?  Barely publicly visible since the funeral.  Senator Graham is beginning investigating the Obama and Hillary Justice Department officials for their attempted coup.  Where will it lead in the end?  I'll tell you where it's going to lead.  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Boo-Rake Obama, Al Gore, Dick Cheney.  That's where.  Mark my words, people.  It's happening and faster than I thought.  So that's the giggling conservatives report for today.  So Senator Graham is going to start investigating.  It's about time.  It's time to end these people.  It's time to get these people out of our government because they do not care about the American people.  And that is the giggling conservative for today.  And I will see you Friday at the live stream.  And I've got a report to start with before we get started with the live stream, looking at your comments and talking about what you guys want to talk about.  So see you Friday at the live stream, 8 a.m Y'all have a good day. ",
