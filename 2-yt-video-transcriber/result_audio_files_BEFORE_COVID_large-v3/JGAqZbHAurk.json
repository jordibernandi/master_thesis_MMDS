But no matter how much Hussein and Gaddafi deserve to be removed from power, our military actions to take down those regimes ended up creating more misery than they prevented.

You can't say that Iran is a great player in the region because you look at somebody like Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guard, who has killed a lot of people, including U.S.  troops, and he's also helped Hamas and Hezbollah and other terrorist groups.

He's investigated corruption, or not corruption, but overreach of power during times of war by the CIA.  Yeah, and here in Washington,  D.C.,  he's worked for President Bush, he's worked for President Obama, he's worked for President Clinton, and so far he doesn't seem to be a very partisan person.
