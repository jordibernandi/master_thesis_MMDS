They want to put you in the military and ship you off to some foreign country to kill people that had nothing to do with you?  Don't participate.  Don't join the military for that.  That's insane.  You watch your nightly news and they tell you about how horrible?  Turn it off.  Turn on something else.  Find another outlet.  It's very instrumental for the people that are in a position of power to convince everybody else that they have no power.  That's the greatest trick of all.  But you have to wake up to that.  People go bankrupt slowly then all at once.  So it's a slow process and then all at once.  We watch that with social media.  Social media has realized, uh-oh, people are waking up.  We can't have that.  So they're trying to silence any dissenting voices.  It's a dangerous thing.  But it's also an acknowledgment that we're on the right track. ",
