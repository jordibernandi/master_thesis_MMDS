            "text": "Hey MGTOs, this is Vincent.  Boy, I really need to trim these grapes or they're going to take over the whole house.  Well, I'm just hanging out here, living the dream.  enjoying the uh the migto lifestyle good times.  basically.  um i just got back from a trip to another state and i've been looking at some houses over there and i found this a couple of really nice places.  well They're sort of fixer-uppers, a little bit like this place, but they're on like very close to this lake, like within a half a block.  And it would be awesome for like getting a little sailboat and sailing around and learning how to fish.  Good times.  So basically, and it has like a very, an RV, a covered RV pad so that I could, Do that mobile lifestyle thing.  And it has a beautiful shop with like a second floor on it.  And it's got it's and it's on one and a half acres, I think, or something very close to that.  And right next to it, there's a slightly smaller house with a lot bigger lot, like six acres.  So either one of those houses would do nicely.  And so I'm getting my paperwork done.  The plan is to get a mortgage approved and then... and then buy that house.  just buy it and then uh begin the process of moving and i'll be able to take all the time i want.  i'll own both houses and i'll just be able to like load up at my leisure and uh make a trip over there and sort of camp there and then uh rest up for a day and then turn around and come back and make another trip.  and Not killing myself, not stressing myself out.  Most other times I've moved, I had some kind of time limit, but as far as this goes, I'll be able to take all the time I need.  Yeah.  Good times.  And I love being able to be completely autonomous on this.  If there's nobody that I have to consult, there's nobody that has the ability to like threaten me with divorce if I don't do exactly what she wants me to do.  Right.  And, um, so basically not a bad situation.  Um, this trailer is nearly done.  I just took a little bit of, I took, I kind of hurried up a little bit and, uh, uh, hit the, hit it up with the primer, um, before I took off on the trip.  So all the time I was on the trip, I, it had time to, uh, to, uh, dry.  And this is the way I, with the materials I have and, uh, I don't really have the ability to make a very strong rear gate that could be used as a ramp.  I would need metal for that.  And I don't know if I would be able to make it really robust enough to make it do well.  So I just sort of thought, I just sort of came up with this idea on my own.  We've got, here's the back.  And these are going to be the latches right here.  As you can see.  And then what I do is I just drop those latches into these slots.  Then I'll have a locking device.  These little bolt locks on the side.  And then basically the Boards go in like so.  Trailer's a bit warped.  It's seen some hard use before I ever got a hold of it.  This little bolt lock will go right here.  And that will hold, that'll keep the gate from vibrating out.  And at the same time it will prevent the sides from, if I have it loaded with something like brush or a lot of, I don't know, who knows, whatever I have in here.  But anyway, this thing will prevent the sides, which are not very strong, from going out or being sort of flaring out or sagging outward.  And it'll also hold the gate down.  And then I'm going to take a couple of these little handles.  Probably stick it there and there.  Then I'll be able to easily lift the thing in and out.  That's the plan.  But today I'm going to put the final coat on.  The exterior white paint.  And then I think I'll just roll it on.  and then once it's dry i'll put the put the handles and everything on it and then the trailer will be done.  then it'll be ready for its first trip to my new location.  good times.  so yeah it's uh that that lake house will be like like a dream come true like a beautiful huge shop way bigger than what i've got here.  and uh three bedroom two bath.  um on about an acre and a half it's fully fenced.  um geez it looks like exactly what the doctor ordered.  and because it's close to the lake the water table will be high.  So chances are anything I plant there, if I use reasonable common sense, it'll get all the water it needs from the water table.  So yeah, I'll be able to plant fruit trees, raspberries, grapes, pretty much anything I want.  And then of course I will take off to Mexico and finish up this cancer treatment.  And then, uh, probably, um, then next spring I'll spend some time with my dad, of course, and then, uh, take off north and, uh, and probably do permaculture projects in the summer.  So that's the plan.  Good times.  Okay, guys, well, I'm going to get on this painting and don't get married. ",
