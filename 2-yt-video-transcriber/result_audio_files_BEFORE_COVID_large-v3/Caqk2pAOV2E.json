It's lavender scented, too, guys.  It's hysterical.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Okay.  Massage it all over.  Right, Noble?  Okay.  Okay.  That's weird.  He's like, oh.  Do you approve?  Do you approve?  He's like, I totally approve of this, Mom.  I totally approve of this massage cream for pigs.  Okay, and the last item, as always, they include an IQ toy, and this is a biggie.  He is going to have so much fun.  You put the treats in here or Cheerios or whatever.  And he's got to try to get them out.  They fall to the bottom.  And he's got to push this sucker around until he can get the treats out of it.  So we have so many IQ toys for him.  But it's good.  You fill them all.  He plays with them throughout the day.  Okay, Noble.  We'll go back one more time for everyone to these winter warmer piggy treats.  Come on, bud.  Come on.  Sit down.  Okay, show everyone how you savor.  Is it delicious?
