Right On the moderate pro-life side you may not necessarily consider the fetus alive at conception.  you may need more criteria to consider something alive some may use the heartbeat as the criteria or perhaps the first brain activity.  this is somewhere around six to seven weeks into the pregnancy.  so an abortion would be permissible only in the first six weeks.  after that it should not be allowed as the fetus is considered a living being.  hmm and then we have the moderate pro-choice side.  this side will argue that a fetus is alive when it becomes viable.  A viable fetus means it is at a stage where it has a 50% chance of surviving outside of the mother's womb.  If we are therefore at a point where the fetus has a 50% chance of surviving separate from the mother, then it should be considered a human being and so should have moral weight.

The moment of conception is the event that started everything off.  There would be no pregnancy and so no human being without the moment of conception.  This is in fact the most important point in the entire chain of events.  It cannot be denied that conception is the beginning event in the development of a human being.
