            "text": "Over the five days of the last month of the Islamic lunar calendar, every Muslim who is able is required to make a pilgrimage to the Kaaba.  But what is this mysterious cube-shaped edifice, and what is its significance for Muslims?  The Kaaba is located in Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, being the birthplace of their prophet, Muhammad.  Wherever they are in the world, praying Muslims must face in the direction of this holy structure.  The Kaaba is a cube-shaped structure, 15 meters high, draped in 670 kilograms of pure black silk adorned with Quranic verses embroidered in gold thread.  This structure was built to house the Black Stone, a holy object believed to go all the way back to Adam and Eve.  that fell down from the gardens of heaven to a spot that would be the first temple on earth.  A separate tradition says that the stone was originally Adam's guardian angel who turned to stone on the day Adam ate of the forbidden fruit.  During the holy pilgrimage, known as the Hajj, pilgrims walk seven times in a counter-clockwise direction around the Ka'bah as a sign of unity and harmony of belief.  Ritually pure pilgrims all jostled to get as close as possible to the Black Stone, which has been set in the east corner of the building by the Prophet Muhammad in 605 CE.  Touching the Black Stone, now worn smooth by countless pilgrims, acts as an atonement for sins.  In recent decades, scientists have suggested that the Black Stone may in fact be a fragment from the impact of a meteorite that fell 6,000 years ago near Mecca.  In 2004, scientific analysis of the impact site suggests that the event may have occurred within the last 200 to 300 years.  But for devout Muslims, the black stone will always remain an object of holy reverence.  Thank you. ",
