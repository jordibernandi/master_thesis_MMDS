I don't see why not.  If I don't make it, just call 911, okay?  Or call Andy or Randy, okay?  Or Harry.  Or Walking Stick or Delta.  Take off my slippers.  We're not allowed to jump, so I'm going to sit on there.  You can watch that, okay?  Yep.  Love you, family.  Have a beautiful day.  Can I swim halfway?  No, all the way down.  First you have to hyper-oxygenate.  Let's try that. ",
