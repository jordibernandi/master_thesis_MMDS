Sorry, I can't hear you.  Can you stay on the other side of the street, please?  Why is that?  Technically, it's the property.  Up to these telephone poles and this gas pipe here is.  Okay.  What's your name?  Yeah, that's our property.  Okay, I'm gonna stand right here.  This is the state.  I'm okay?  Right there, it's fine.  on this side of the street.  I don't think so.  We're here today in Taylor, Texas, at the T. Don Hood Oak Residential Center, which is a prison for non-citizens that are in our country.  This place is closing down here pretty soon this year I believe.  Thank you. ",
