            "text": "Hello everyone, this is Michael Voris coming to you from Rome with breaking news.  If what an aging Italian atheist journalist, a longtime friend of Pope Francis said is true, Pope Francis has just denied the divinity of our Lord.  Here is the relevant quote, supposedly from the Pope, as recorded by Eugenio Scalfari.  He says, Francis told me, quote, They are the proven proof that Jesus of Nazareth, once having become a man, was, though a man of exceptional virtues, not at all a  god.\".  And further in the article, Scalfari gives his interpretation of what Pope Francis meant based on what he calls their greatest cultural intimacy.  And these are Scalfari's words.  This is just breaking here in Rome late in the afternoon, and the Vatican communications office is sure to be inundated and publishing some response to international reporters soon.  We will let you know more as soon as we know it.  Coming to you from Vatican City, this is Michael Voris for Church Militant.  God love you. ",
