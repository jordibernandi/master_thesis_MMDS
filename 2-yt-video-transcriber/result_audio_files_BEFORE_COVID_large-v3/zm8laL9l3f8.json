            "text": "Damn.  Do they know where they're going?  No, they're all locked.  Yeah, I'll just stay back.  You guys have got to cross down here.  GoPro start recording.  It's on now.  Damn, look at this cop.  No lights.  No lights.  We're going to get the airship here, man.  I guarantee you they're setting a perimeter.  What is it?  I don't know.  They're setting up a perimeter.  There it goes.  All right.  This makes for some good YouTube.  Yeah.  We're going around.  Damn.  Yeah, just stay back.  They are running.  Cops are sprinting.  Thank you.  I don't know how many cops are here, but I think they're all here.  Benny, bring me everyone.  What do you mean, everyone?  Everyone!  Right in here, yep.  Yep, bring everyone.  Holy.  Holy.  uh you can't see me but i am pointing to all the officers.  more more units arriving.  i am pointing to the officers as to where to enter.  what building more units we probably have.  i would say 13 to 15 units here Thus far, they're going to be going around the block to be setting up a perimeter if they're looking for somebody.  How the airship is not up, I do not understand.  On a night with such light volume.  But then, I was in the center and then the others were sitting.  Here comes the airship now.  Thank you.  Yeah, we're just going to secure the cars because most of them are on the car.  Thank you.  So what can be.  There's someone else walking out with a lot of blood all over his hands and his white t-shirt.  so So, uh, I'm here with the, uh, Oklahoma boys.  They said that the police knocked him.  They threw him over this bench, which is embedded into the concrete here.  It's not a... Well, but you know what?  You, you got people bleeding and shit like that.  Like, I mean, you know, like I don't... So this guy is not related at all to the family.  All right, so here's where things start to get a little bit weird.  One of the firefighters decides to point his flashlight at us.  And at first we think it's harmless and inadvertent because he's filling out paperwork.  Then we figure out it's far more nefarious than that.  When you watch the video, you'll see that his flashlight magically follows our cameras no matter where we go, which is a classic example of prior restraint.  which is censorship imposed usually by government institution that prohibits a particular instance of expression.  So he's not even allowing us to tell our story.  Censorship is after a story is published and it gets squashed.  Prior restraint is.  we're not even going to allow you to tell the story.  That he broke in, you know.  Oh, he's not, for sure?  Oh, no, didn't that what you guys just said?  No, he's saying he is.  Right, right, no, he's, this guy is not.  You know.  Oh, he's not.  Hey guys, we're going to push this all the way back over here, guys.  Okay, cool.  Can we move that way?  Yes, please.  Okay.  Here's a great view to show you just how bright his light is.  Yeah, he's just being a dick.  The fireman with the flashlight.  Yeah.  Yeah, everywhere we're walking that the fireman is following us with the flashlight.  pretending to not be shining it on us.  And people wonder why they get retaliated against.  People wonder why they get the bird flipped.  People wonder.  People wonder.  It's fascinating to me.  Um... Maybe Haney will tell us his name.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, there he goes.  please please don't do that.  don't do that please please don't do that.  don't do that.  please don't do that.  td.  you're my hero.  cd you're my hero.  So here's the name on the LAFD jacket.  When I searched for TETEY, I did not find anyone.  So if you've got a better idea than I do, please comment below or shoot me an email.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Even on the way out.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  I said, TD, you're my hero.  Even on the way out, he's... Did you guys see that light in our eyes?  the whole time?  The firemen?  The entire time?  The unintentional... Yeah, he's still shining it at us.  Okay, this is Los Angeles Fire Department 104.  Engine 73.  There it is, kids.  The face of tyranny.  TD, you're my hero.  Yeah, there you go.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Yeah, there you go.  Look at him.  Look at him.  TD, you're my hero.  You're my hero, TD.  You see that?  You see that retaliation?  You see that blatant retaliation?  I think it's a blatant retaliation.  Engine 73, Los Angeles Fire Department.  T-E-T-E-Y, my hero.  That's my hero right there.  TD, will you sign an autograph?  Are you more of a TD man or a leg man?  That was the most egregious violation of civil rights by any... Fireman I've ever witnessed.  Congratulations.  I don't know.  Do you have the number of Anita?  The fireman was raised right.  False report.  Broke another vehicle from a cop arrest.  I have it all included.  There's nothing.  Yeah, Bell, I hear you.  So that shows that it was absolutely blatant retaliation when I called out T.D.  and then he pointed the flashlight again at me.  I knew it from the very beginning.  But, you know, you gave him the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  Is that the biggest code three you've ever seen?  That was the craziest scene I've ever witnessed.  I've never seen 30 cops sprint into an apartment complex falling.  I mean, they were falling over.  I was in the middle level.  The fat ones was the funny ones.  It was great.  I guess they thought I was a cop.  I don't know.  No, they were just too busy.  I finally stepped out of their way.  I didn't want to get trapped.  I ain't scared to film Chloe, so.  Well,  T.D.'s  got his stuff posted.  Well, you know what?  And that was confirmation that that was absolutely retaliatory behavior when I said he was my hero and he shined his light at me again over his shoulder.  Again, yes.  Again, that was absolute confirmation. ",
