And if you don't agree that an infant that's a few minutes old has a right to life, then I don't have any reason to talk to you.  If you can't agree with that, there's no way in hell I'm going to agree to talk with you about anything.  Like, all we've done with these people who want to murder babies and steal guns is talk.  That's all they want to do.  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  But while we talk, they act.  And in the case of an Antifa member in Eugene, Oregon, and I'll put a link in the description box below to this, this Antifa member who was supposed to be some sort of firearms instructor, dude, I use that term loosely, He basically decided to go into a school ",

They are digging in for the long haul and they expect people like you and me to continue talking while they continue doing their actions.  So what I advocate at this point, folks, is to prepare.  Get those books that I recommended in the description box below.  With all peaceable means necessary, we need to be able to resist these people, but they are probably going to push, as have their predecessors in all socialist movements in history.  They are going to push too far.  They are going to overstep, and when they do, we're going to be ready.  This isn't a threat.  All I'm advocating for, folks, is for preparedness and for the lawful, lawful preparation of to resist individuals, tyrannical governments, and agents and emissaries of government that would come to strip your rights away.  Our founders did it.  If it was good enough for them, it's good enough for us.  And when you've got people who are so blatant as to sit in the halls of Congress wearing white when they should be wearing blood red for the blood of infants that they are happy to spill, sitting there scowling when being told that, no, you don't get to make this place into a socialist utopia.  We are guaranteed a republic form of government under our constitution.  When they're scowling about that and they're open about their desires to destroy the country, to dismantle the Bill of Rights and to slaughter infants, these people are not people worth talking with.  You know that they're coming.  You know that they're coming at you.  It's just a matter of are you going to have the intellectual honesty to prepare for it.  Hope you enjoyed the video.
