            "text": "Content warning!  This one's gonna contain some talk about suicide and also a discussion of some pretty gross injuries, so if that type of thing is not your bag baby, maybe don't watch this video.  My first job, my first real job, was working at a shitty Canadian coffee chain called Tim Hortons.  If you're not Canadian and thus aren't familiar, imagine Starbucks, but worse and cheaper, but with more donuts.  I was still living with my parents at the time, but I needed the job to pay for my university tuition.  And I hated it.  I hated every waking second of it.  There was not a single element of the job that was pleasant.  It was degrading, dehumanizing, easily the worst job I've ever had, and I've had some doozies.  If you've never worked in fast food, you need to understand that it's essentially like spending eight hours a day in a totalitarian state.  People tell you what to do, how to speak, what facial expressions you're allowed to make.  They put you in a uniform.  They tell you when you can and cannot go to the bathroom.  At all times, you are being surveilled, you are being monitored, you are being measured against the arbitrary minimum.  some highly paid bean counter in a fancy office somewhere decided was the normal amount of work to do.  When a car pulled into the drive-thru, you had to answer within five seconds.  Your response time was monitored, and if the average dipped below a certain threshold, you'd be yelled at, punished, or threatened with termination.  Everything you said and did was scrutinized.  Employees were specifically forbidden from fraternizing during work hours.  Saw a cool movie over the weekend?  That's great.  You can talk about it on your break if you want.  We can't let you talk and work at the same time.  If we did that, then you might discuss unionizing.  By the way, if you do that, if you even mention the word union, you will be fired on the spot.  Just know that going in.  Hey, there's too many donuts left over at the end of your shift.  Were you upselling to every customer?  What did you do to help us sell these shitty donuts to people today?  Did you sign in when your shift started?  You should really sign in 10 minutes earlier so that you have time to get ready.  You won't be paid, of course.  Don't act entitled.  A manager will adjust the time sheet after the fact.  Hey, you want to leave at the end of your shift?  Did you complete the task list for the day?  If you did, I guess you didn't have enough work to do.  Here's some more.  Every shift will actually end about half an hour after you're scheduled, unless that'd result in overtime, in which case you'll be clocked out by the manager and just work for free.  Sure, that's illegal, but what are you going to do about it?  Plenty of illegal stuff went down.  I was 19.  I didn't know my rights.  Most of the people I worked with didn't know their rights either.  Case in point, if you walked into the store unshaven, instead of being told to go home, you would be told to use the store raiser.  An old disposable razor that multiple employees had already used that had purposefully not been replaced so that it would remain dull.  as a warning to you not to let this happen again.  One time I saw a co-worker spill some sort of concentrated cleaning fluid on her arm.  It was the type of stuff you're meant to mix with.  like nine parts of water and her skin... started bubbling.  She was rushed into the manager's office, coerced into signing a release form, and then put back on the floor to finish her fucking shift.  For as long as I knew her afterwards, she had a huge scar from like here to here.  I asked her why she didn't sue, and she said the manager told her that the release form, the one that she was threatened into signing, meant that she gave up her right to sue.  And she believed that.  She accepted that.  And all of that was just when you were on the clock.  You'd come home stinking of coffee, putrefying bits of donut mashed into your clothes, your stiff, non-slip shoes making your feet burn.  Half the time, you didn't even know when you were supposed to be working.  The schedules were done with as little as eight hours notice, and you'd get your head chewed off if you called into the store to ask if you were working the next day.  You couldn't make plans.  You couldn't commit to doing anything with friends or family.  And every day, some new asshole would come in and fuck with you.  In the weirdest and most pointless ways.  These petty little power trips where people would get off on making you perform some needlessly complicated task.  Because they knew you weren't allowed to tell them to fuck off.  Everywhere they went in their pathetic little lives, someone made them feel powerless, and they had power over you, and they were going to make sure that you knew it.  There was a man who came in every day, and even now, 15 or 16 years later, I still remember his absurd order.  a quarter inch of hot coffee from the freshest pot in the store, in a medium cup, but charge me for a small, filled to the brim with hot water and two sugars on the side.  Each day this man would walk into the store, and each day I would say, hello, sir, the usual, and instead of saying, yes, please, or thanks for remembering, yes, I'll have the usual, he'd say, a quarter inch of hot coffee from the freshest pot in the store, in a medium cup, but charge me for a small, filled to the brim with hot water and two sugars on the side.  He would take one sip of the half ounce or so of coffee diluted in hot water, and if he didn't think it was fresh enough, he'd make you brew a fresh pot on the spot.  Tim Horton's coffee, by the way, is never more than 20 minutes old.  Once each pot is brewed, we mark it with a little washable white marker with the time to dispose of it.  It was like the main rule of working there.  Evidently, this madman had such a sensitive palate that he could taste the difference between a half ounce of shitty coffee diluted in water that was brewed 10 minutes ago and one that was brewed 12 minutes ago.  Anyway, Tim Hortons has this yearly promotion called Roll Up the Rim to Win.  You roll up the rim of your coffee cup and sometimes it has free coffee or some shit written on it on the inside.  And then you you either tear off that part of your rim or bring your moldy ass cup to the cashier and they'll exchange that for whatever is written on your rim.  So in comes this guy, and he says to me, a quarter inch of hot coffee from the freshest pot in the store in a medium cup, it charged me for a small, filled to the brim with hot water and two sugars on the side.  Small coffees were not eligible for this promotion at that time.  It literally was not printed on the fucking cup.  I got him the medium cup that he wanted, but not one of the special cups he might win a coffee or some shit with.  We weren't allowed to give those out unless someone paid for that size of a coffee.  This man, who is like 60 years old, lost his fucking mind, demanding to get this special contest cup.  He screamed at me.  I was 19.  This man saw me every day, and he screamed at me because he didn't get a special donut contest cup without paying for it.  The difference between a small and medium coffee, by the way, was 10 cents.  The co-franchisee of this location wanted to make sure we were getting each and every order right.  Each day he'd pull up to the drive-thru, order a double-double, which to you non-Canadians means two cream, two sugar.  It's a Tim Hortons trademark term.  And he'd ask for two medium-sized ice cubes in the cup.  We had a machine with completely uniform ice chips, but each time he did this, he would take a long sip of coffee.  hold it in his mouth for dramatic effect, and then decide based on the temperature whether or not the correct size of ice cube had been used.  If he imagined you used the wrong size of ice cube, he'd get out of his car, come into the store, and yell at you.  And that was about 70% of the time in my experience.  I remember I had a thought back then that I wish I had listened to.  I thought, geez, if this guy just came in here and worked with us, he'd know how the equipment worked.  How can he run the business?  How can he be qualified to judge our performance if he didn't even know how the job was done?  I remember the day I decided to quit.  I was walking to work after school.  I had to walk because my abusive stepfather, who had never held down a steady job as long as I knew him, would lose his goddamn mind if he felt I was asking for rides too often.  So I saved up my rides for when it was raining.  This particular Tim Hortons was along the side of a highway, across from a bunch of box stores.  And on this day, I saw this big truck coming down the road.  And it occurred to me that if I just jumped in front of that truck... I wouldn't have to go to work.  And in that moment, it felt worth it to me.  That day, I called my mom on my break.  Very ashamed that I couldn't hack it at this crappy job.  I handed in my two weeks notice.  They demanded three weeks from me.  I gave it to them.  I always just gave them what they wanted.  I was terrified that if I didn't, I'd get a bad reputation in the business community.  Because that's how I was taught things worked.  I was ashamed of that for years.  I thought, I was so lazy, what's wrong with me?  Why can't I just work for a living like everybody else?  Why do I feel so tired, depressed, and beaten up by these normal-ass jobs?  The ones that are supposed to be the easy, entry-level jobs.  I hated myself.  I wanted to be a writer or an artist or whatever.  One of those jobs where you either work harder than a thousand other more qualified people or you starve.  And I couldn't bring myself to work at Tim Hortons without feeling like I had to jump in front of a truck.  And it kept getting worse the older I got.  I kept getting shitty job after shitty job after shitty job.  I wasn't qualified to do anything else.  I wasn't smart enough, charismatic enough, connected enough.  I don't know.  I wasted my twenties because I was so scared that it wouldn't amount to anything that somewhere along the line, I decided to prove myself right.  And I sank into this horrible depression and abused the generosity of my family and ex-girlfriend.  I paid back my ex.  Not sure I'll ever afford to pay back my family.  And all I could think was, is this all there is for me?  Just going to keep working these menial, pointless jobs for the rest of my life?  And maybe I can't even hack that.  Why am I so lazy?  Looking back, it kind of made sense.  I worked my ass off for a long time at that job, and no matter how hard I worked, it never got any better.  I was never treated better.  I got yelled at either way.  The only people who benefited from my hard work were the assholes that I felt were taking advantage of me.  I got paid the same amount whether I busted my ass or did the bare minimum.  And here I was, spending every waking moment of my life either doing schoolwork or working for minimum wage or walking between the two locations where I did those things.  No wonder I was miserable.  No wonder I didn't want to live like that.  No wonder that faced with the prospect of not getting more out of life than a shitty, unrewarding job that didn't even pay the bills, I kind of just disconnected from it, you know?  Just retreated into escapism and depression.  No wonder I felt like life wasn't worth living.  There was another guy at Tim Hortons.  I think his name was Jason.  I can't really remember.  If you're watching this and your name wasn't Jason, oops.  He was older than me.  At the time, he was about the age I am now.  And he worked so goddamn hard at that job.  It annoyed the shit out of everybody.  I remember it was my first week or so, and I was sitting on the break room on my legally mandated 15-minute break.  And in walks Jason, and he asks me, how you like the job so far?  And I said, I don't know, man.  I'm kind of stressed out.  It feels like there's always a lineup of people and you just can't get the coffee to them fast enough to keep them from getting mad at you.  And he got this big grin on his face and he said to me, I love when there's a line.  I live for the challenge.  When I see a big line all the way out the door, I can't wait to get out there and bust it down.  Cool, man.  Cool.  He would never take his full break, which, by the way, he was legally obligated to do.  He would dare people to time him with the egg timer we were supposed to use to measure our break time with to see how fast he could eat his lunch before getting back on the floor.  I was always afraid he would choke.  Then he'd rush back to work, sweating from the exertion of moving as fast as he was able to.  Not just because it's summer in Toronto and the lights where he shoots his YouTube videos make him sweat like a pig.  The thing is, he and I made the same amount of money.  We got the exact same score on our performance review.  Everyone got the same score on their performance review.  It was always just shy of the threshold where the company would give you a raise.  And they always came up with a fun reason for it.  They said to me, I didn't wash my hands enough.  You were supposed to wash your hands every five minutes.  And I know for a fact that was a lie because I luxuriated in washing my hands as often as possible.  I would take any excuse to wash my hands because each time I did it, it was a little bit of time that I got to spend not doing anything for Tim Hortons.  And when I said to my manager, hey man, that's not fair.  I wash my hands more than anyone here.  He shrugged and said, look, I gotta write something down on this form.  Totally, man, I get it.  If you didn't, then they'd have to give me a 15 cent an hour raise, bringing my total to about 7.45 an hour.  In order for me to recoup the losses they were spending on me, I'd have to sell three, maybe four coffees an hour.  Oftentimes, we'd sell thousands of coffees an hour.  We'd be moving so fast to prepare them that very seldomly did a day go by without someone getting scolded.  If I worked full-time hours at that job, I would have made about $14,000 a year before taxes.  Adjusting for inflation, that'd be about $18,000 a year.  By the way, that inflation rate, it means that whatever money I managed to save between 2003 and 2019 would be worth about 30% less than when I started saving it.  Fun stuff.  Also, this is Canadian dollars, so to put that in perspective, $18,000 is about $13,500 in U.S.  dollars, 10,000 pounds sterling, or 12,000 euros a year before taxes.  And the people that did work full-time hours at that job weren't pimply teens trying to build work experience.  Those people worked part-time like me.  The full-time workers, the ones making $14,000 a year before taxes, they had families.  They had bills to pay.  We like to pretend that people working these jobs are kids.  It's not a big deal if they're underpaid.  They'll grow out of it.  The statistics don't back that up.  This is a dead-end job for the majority adult workforce.  You can bust your pretty little buns slinging coffee to people who disrespect you for people who disrespect you, making them millionaires.  You can work yourself to exhaustion every day, scalding yourself, injuring yourself, debasing yourself, and you'll still make as little as they can legally get away with paying you.  The same amount you'd make if you did jack shit.  The rational, intelligent response to a situation like that?  Be lazy.  Work less.  You want hard work?  Pay me more.  Does it make sense to you to glorify allowing yourself to be exploited?  Does it make you a good person, a strong person, to keep giving away more and more of your effort for no discernible benefit to anyone but the greedy assholes who demand it from you for free?  We are told that the high wages of CEOs and other parasites are meant to motivate them to achieve more.  And at the same time, we're told that if we don't work hard when we're not paid well, we're just lazy.  So I posit this.  Laziness, so described, is a propagandistic term.  You're not lazy if you don't work hard for no reward.  The purpose of hard work is to get a reward of some kind, even if that reward is just satisfaction.  That's how brains work.  A rat will go through a maze to get some food.  It won't go through a maze for no reason, unless... It's scared not to.  Like you might be scared to lose your job.  Like you might be scared not to be able to pay your bills.  Like you might be scared to live on the street.  Truth is, these workers are not free.  That's why time away from work is referred to as free time.  And that free time, by the way, is negotiable.  It doesn't really belong to you.  Chances are you'll spend a large portion of it commuting to and from work.  There's no choice in any aspect of your employment.  You don't get a say.  You do what you're told or you're left to die.  If any government operated in this way, we would rightly call it totalitarian.  But we have accepted that it's permissible for our working lives to be under worse conditions than our personal lives.  We should have democracy in government, allegedly, and autocracy in the workplace.  That we should spend the entirety of our professional careers under the thumb of some managerial dictator, and to complain, to resist, is a sin, is lazy, is slothful.  To that, I say, workers of the world, rise up.  And if you can't rise up, then lie down and rest.  Thank you for watching my video where I completely lost focus on what it was supposed to be about at some point.  Hey, all of these people gave me money on Patreon, so you can also do that if you're interested.  It's patreon.com slash thoughtslime.  If you're already donating, thanks!  Should probably say that more often.  Thank you!  Another thing I'm going to thank you for is liking this video and subscribing to my channel.  Thanks for doing that.  It sure helps me, by golly.  You can jingle jangle that little bell and that'll help because you'll know when the videos come out and you can watch them.  And boy howdy do I love it when people watch my videos.  We're entering the sweaty months.  Get ready for me to be sweaty for the next little while.  That's just how that's going to be.  Next Tuesday I'm going to be streaming at 8 o'clock.  Normally I stream on Thursdays, but this week I'm going to be streaming on Tuesday because it's my birthday.  It's the day of my birth.  I will be turning many years old.  None of your business.  A lady doesn't tell. ",
