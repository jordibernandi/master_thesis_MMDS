            "text": "I was in near Arkansas this weekend.  And I happened to swing by a friend's place.  And he's one of those guys that's like you and me.  And he is building him kind of a bug out camp.  But it's kind of obvious because it's so tall.  But he's got a deer camp slash bug out camp.  But this thing was so cool.  So I went inside there and I was like, let me video a little bit of it for my YouTube channel.  So what he did is he took two shipping containers, 8x40 shipping containers, he stacked them on top of each other, and then he started remodeling the inside.  He started putting cedar on the walls and on the ceiling.  He put cherry on the floor.  He's got in a water system and stuff.  It's not completely done, but I just... I don't know if I'm going to get back there again, but you guys got to check this thing out.  So for you guys who want to have your own little secret bug out spot, check this thing out because this is totally cool.  And guys, share this.  This could go viral.  This thing, he's doing an awesome job.  So check it out.  I hope you enjoy it. ",

And this is like a little patio for, you can see all around the country.  Got a little stove top right there.  But let's go down inside this thing and check it out.  This is cool.  So this is, so you guys that want to create a little bug out community or a little bug out site for yourself, this is the way to do it on a budget if you don't mind doing it yourself.  Okay, so now it's a two story, so it's one box on top of the other.  But inside here, We're creating a little bedroom here.  Is this cedar? ",

And then go down the stairs again, actually you're supposed to turn around and go backwards.  This is actually steeper than the stairs in my shelter.  But down here, he's got a same thing.

One of the things I would have done if I was him, I would have probably hid a bunker underneath it, then put a shipping container on top of it, like this picture right here.  You see how the guy, he's got a shipping container and there's a hatch hidden under the floor in the shipping container?  So you can do a lot with a shipping container.  You can build false walls in them, you can put false floors in them, you can do a lot with them.  But when you put it in your bunker, think about hiding your air pipes and then hiding the hatch in a shipping container because you're going to need supplies outside.  It's a good way to do it.  And then you've got your perfect bug out situation or your bug out camp or whatever you want it to be.  But guys, having a bunker with a cabin on top or having a shelter on top.  It's totally cool.  So guys, I hope you enjoy this video.  If you're not watching my channel already, guys, I put out some really cool videos.  So please subscribe to my channel.  Like, subscribe, and if you like this video, share it so it goes viral, okay?  I like people to watch this stuff.  But guys, as always, I love you.  See you in the next video. ",
