            "text": "Did you know that the foreign-born workers here in the United States are sending roughly $150 billion each year in remittances overseas to foreign friends, family members, and associates outside the US?  More than $28 billion of that is sent by illegal aliens alone.  A remittance is money earned in the United States that is transferred to relatives, friends, or business associates who are outside of the country.  Remittance payments can be made by US citizens, lawfully present aliens, and illegal aliens.  So if $150 billion is leaving the US each year, how much is being sent to the US in remittances from Americans in other countries?  Well, Americans residing abroad only sent home $6.6 billion in 2017, resulting in a net loss of $144.5 billion for the United States.  That is almost three times the total trade deficit of the entire US economy.  Crazy, right?  So, where is all this money going?  Turns out, Mexico is the primary beneficiary, receiving just over $30 billion in 2017.  China comes in second, receiving more than $16 billion in remittances from the US each year.  In the Northern Triangle countries of Central America, remittances from the US are so significant that they are considered a major part of their Gross Domestic Product, or GDP.  US remittances comprise an astounding 20.38% of the GDP in El Salvador, 18.8% in Honduras, and 11.2% in Guatemala.  In other words, remittances to the Northern Triangle countries are keeping their economies afloat.  So, what are the problems here?  First, money sent out of the US isn't recirculated in the US economy, costing us tax payments and jobs.  Secondly, remittances sent back to home countries are an ineffective form of foreign investment.  They generally buy consumer products made in other countries or are used by family members back home to try to move to the U.S.  In short, remittances are a direct loss to the U.S.  economy, taking profit away from American families and companies and sending it directly into the pockets of foreign businesses and governments.  Today, only one state, Oklahoma, taxes remittances.  If all 50 states had a remittance tax, we could keep at least $1.5 billion circulating through the US economy each year.  Bottom line, a heavy reliance on foreign and undocumented labor is costing the US billions of dollars in remittances every single year.  It is about time we ask ourselves, is this good for our economy, our communities, and our infrastructure?  To learn more about the costs and consequences of US immigration policy, visit fairus.org.
