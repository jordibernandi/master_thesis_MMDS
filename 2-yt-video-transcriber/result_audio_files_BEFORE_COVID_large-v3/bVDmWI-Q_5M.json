            "text": "What color was Adam?  In modern times, we hear arguments he was white.  Others, he was black.  But the one missing argument is the one we believe far more logical and supported by scripture and even science.  No, this video is not about race.  We could care less about race.  It's about restoring what the word says and exposing what it doesn't say because so many have gone nuts on this topic far from Scripture.  Let's fix this now.  Welcome to 100 Clues.  The Philippines is the ancient land of gold known as Ophir in the Bible and history.  No, it's no fable and this has already been proven in full in the God Culture Solomon's Gold series.  At the request of many viewers, we have pulled out 100 compelling clues, really proofs or evidences, from this research in which we will highlight briefs of the most compelling points.  And yes, there are over 100.  These videos are for those who have not had time to watch Solomon's Gold series.  great for small groups and churches and schools and easy to share to friends and family especially skeptics.  this brief video cannot replace that 50 video series nor prove the way that it does as it is a researcher's journey but This will be very effective nonetheless.  So go there for full evidence.  But now, part 44 of our series, 100 Clues, The Philippines is Ophir.  One clue at a time.  Before we start, let's deal with the elephant in the room.  The difference in DNA from one end of the spectrum of humans to the other is all of .04%.  That's it.  In other words, this nonsense of the media trying to paint the human race as anything but one race is ludicrous and loaded with propaganda.  We are all one race.  We are all brown.  Just different shades based on the amount of melanin in our skin.  That's it, really.  Having said that, there is a tone from our beginnings, from Adam, that can be identified in scripture and science, really.  Are we crazy to go here?  Not at all, because we can prove our position.  See what you think.  Also, some calling themselves scientists have actually made the claim that this chimp is 99% similar to us humans.  Oh, what they forget to mention in their so-called science is that they actually abandon over one billion lines of DNA code in this chimpanzee, which they cannot explain and do not understand.  Now, obviously, that code is not human, or they would be able to identify it, wouldn't they?  Yes.  Thus, this is fraud, and the closest this chimp is to this baby is about 83% perhaps.  That's not a little margin of error.  It is complete and utter fraud.  The Bible defines us humans as a kind.  chimps and monkeys are a different kind because we cannot have children with them and the reproductive limit is what defines the difference between Kinds as Genesis is clear in the creation account we reproduce after our Kinds over and over and over.  it says that.  now let's go right to to the scripture, which tells us exactly what color Adam was.  Here we go.  Genesis 2, 7, and the Lord God, Yahuwah, that's actually Y-H-W-H in scripture, Yahuwah, formed man of the dust of the ground, in Hebrew, Adamah, Adam and Yah, isn't that cool?  And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.  This word for ground, Adamah, means soil.  from its general redness.  See, it is a color, red.  Let's explore this further so we can fully understand it.  Justinius also identifies Adama as red or tawnish.  Eberim Publications, a very well-respected Jewish dictionary in concordance, really nails Adamah down in its many forms, and all as red.  Red ground, earth, from the root, dam, to produce or to be red.  It's right there in his name.  Yep, Adam was made of red soil, thus red in color.  Red is the first color a baby learns to see.  And red, or ruddy, see, ruddy is red, is indeed the color of rudiment.  See, ruddy, rudiment is red.  As a verb, Adam.  means to be red.  As an adjective, adam means red.  As a noun, odam denotes a ruddy or red gem, possibly quartz.  As a noun, Edom denotes a kind of red stew.  Some then assume that Esau, because he's the origin of the word Edom or the Edomites, that Esau must be red.  But Esau doesn't mean red.  Edom means red, and it's after the stew that Jacob made for Esau.  That's how it gets into that story.  Did he have red hair?  Maybe, but doubtfully.  Very doubtfully.  As an adjective... It means reddish.  Then again, as an adjective, it means red or ruddy.  So can we all take a hint here?  The soil Adam was made from was red.  And he was, in the skin tone, red.  In verb, adverb, noun, etc.  Adjective, all of it.  So this is always associated with red.  What does this mean?  Well, history tells us a red skin is known as a North American or Native American Indian.  Now I know well what this means because my grandfather, great grandfather, was 100% Native American Indian.  And even my grandmother was dark skinned.  In fact, my Filipina wife met her and thought for sure she was a Filipina.  The similarities are uncanny, but that's another topic.  Red skin is dark brown in tone.  It is not white and it is not black.  And there is a reason for that even scientifically as neither of those extremes would actually work as the origin of skin tone for mankind scientifically.  We'll get there.  King David was described in 1 Samuel twice as ruddy.  Now, we just covered that.  We learned that ruddy is red.  David was red-skinned, as are most Hebrews, though not all.  Some are indeed black.  Song of Solomon is used to claim Solomon was black, in fact.  Yet, they just aren't reading.  That's Solomon's first wife, the Egyptian, who in fact was black, writing at first.  as if Solomon is writing, here we have a major problem, because it says, let him kiss me.  I hope that's not Solomon.  No, Solomon's not writing that, that's his wife writing.  And she says that she is black and comely.  And she's a very beautiful black Egyptian woman indeed.  Now Solomon describes her in detail and she's very beautiful.  He thought so.  However, Solomon is then described in many ways.  But he is called white and ruddy or red.  And this is further explained.  when she then describes specifically his countenance.  That's a word for skin tone specifically.  His countenance was as the cedars of Lebanon.  Pictured below, there is a medium brown or red skin tone for the cedars of Lebanon.  just as his father David and just as Adam in fact.  In fact there are many hieroglyphs in Egypt of the slaves in the time of Israel's Exodus and they are two different skin tones in color one medium brown or red and the other is black.  Now, Judah married Shua the Canaanite, and Moses is an Ethiopian, in fact, so later you'll find even more.  Thus, there are definitely darker black tones mixed into the Israelites, again, especially in Judah and some of the Levites.  What they definitely are not in all of history, sorry, is white.  As we've never seen one hieroglyph ever depicting a white rabbi with a long beard slaving on bricks with a sunburn.  You will never find one, which tells us much about our modern paradigm.  Many things need to be corrected, and we do this in our Lost Tribes series.  If you haven't seen that, go watch.  Also, Egyptians are depicted on these hieroglyphs as the same, medium brown or red, and black as well.  This is why Abraham, Joseph, and Moses were all mistaken as Egyptians.  Imagine Joseph's white rabbi-looking brothers, if that were true, coming before the Egyptian leader Joseph, the white rabbi-looking dude, and not even recognizing that he was white like them.  That's because none of them were white.  There's no such history to ever support that.  Now, ",
