Now, there's not a lot in the Bible, actually, on what actually happens in heaven and what it's like.  The Bible uses, particularly in the book of Revelation, all sorts of different imagery with regard to precious stones and jewels.  But ultimately, you know what heaven is?  It's a renewed place.  Earth and heaven.  Heavens.  In other words, the world is recreated to a point that there is no sickness, no disease, no death, no natural disasters, and our bodies are resurrected into bodies like Jesus had after the resurrection.  So heaven, you're not a ghost.  Ultimately, heaven is you're going to have a physical body that will never degrade. ",

            "text": "Hell is a place where... where evil is quarantined, where people who don't want to be with God are put.  So let me just explain this, and then we'll be done.  It'll take two or three minutes to explain, okay?  I was in a debate in the University of Michigan probably five, six years ago now, and the atheist was a guy by the name of Eddie Tabash.  He was a Beverly Hills attorney, and he asked me this question.  He said... Frank, my mother was a survivor of the Holocaust.  That's during World War II, a very awful time.  And toward the end of her life, somebody offered her the gospel that Jesus died for her, and by trusting in him, she could have her sins forgiven.  And she rejected it, and then she died.  Is she in hell right now?  And so I said, Eddie, I don't know where your mother is right now.  I don't know if she had a deathbed conversion or not.  But if she didn't accept Christ before she died, then God is too loving to force her into heaven against her will.  You see, because the assumption is everybody wants to go to heaven.  That's not true.  There have been people running from Jesus their entire lives, and Jesus is in heaven.  So what's he going to do after they die?  Go, hey, where are you going?  You're with me now.  That would not be loving.  You say, well, what's all this business about hell being separate from Jesus?  Well, let me ask a question of this, and this will be good advice for you a little bit later.  I asked the University of Michigan audience this question.  I asked it of the ladies.  So, ladies, I'm going to ask you this question.  Ladies, have you ever had a man pursue you whom you did not want to date?  Some of you are going, yeah, and he's sitting next to me right now.  He will not leave me alone.  Whenever I ask that question, the ladies giggle and the men look at their shoes.  Like, is she looking at me right now?  Well, ladies, suppose this man continues to pursue you.  He continues to pursue you.  He keeps asking you out.  You finally go, look, I like you, but only as a friend.  Ladies, why don't you just stick the knife in and turn it.  Every man has heard a dreaded friend rejection.  Gentlemen, this is for you later.  If you ever get the dreaded friend rejection, move on.  She's not interested.  In fact, gentlemen, I have some shocking news for you.  She doesn't even like you as a friend.  Because if she did, I'm not done.  Hold on.  Because if she did, if she did, she'd be interested, but she's not.  Well, suppose this doesn't deter this guy.  He continues to pursue.  He continues to pursue.  And he gets to the point where he says, look, I love you so much, I'm going to force you to love me.  Ladies, run, screaming from the building.  Can he force you to love him?  No, love by definition must be freely given.  So if he truly did love you, ladies, what would he do?  He would leave you alone.  That's what God does for us.  He sends us cards, letters, and flowers.  He sends us creation.  He sends us Christ.  He sends us conscience.  He sends us a Bible.  He sends us Colonial Heights Baptist Church.  He sends us... If you're a Muslim in a far off land, he may send you a dream or a vision.  And if he does all that and you keep saying, no, no, no, I don't want you, God will leave you alone.  That's what hell is.  You're separated from God forever by your own choice.  You say, well, what could be so bad about being separated from God?  Well, think about it this way.  Everybody right now, whether they're a Christian or not, gets some of the common grace of God.  Everybody experiences love, relationships, a future, hope, right?  His reign falls on the just and the unjust, right?  Right?  But I want you to imagine a place where there is no love, where there is no hope, where there is no future, where there's just stone, cold, narcissistic self-absorption.  That is Washington.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm sorry.  And it's been that way a long time, ladies and gentlemen. ",
