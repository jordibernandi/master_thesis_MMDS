            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to Moonride.  Some of you have been sending me messages.  Hey Dave, where you been?  What's going on?  Hope you're okay.  I really appreciate these messages.  It's always nice to be wanted.  Maybe you can see behind me the moving boxes.  I moved and I moved to a new city.  So that's where I have been.  I actually haven't seen much of the news.  You might notice my t-shirt.  I just, I'm not gonna find one right now.  I'm just too exhausted for that.  Maybe you've heard the Beyonce song, I Woke Up Like This.  Well, you guys, I woke up like this.  So this is how I'm going to stay for the moment.  Again, I don't really know what's going on in the world.  So I'm just really just going to tune in and ask Spirit to tell me whatever.  If it has to do with Trump, it has to do with Trump.  I'm just going to ask for the most important current information today.  It's Tuesday at 1.16 in my new city, Adelaide, Australia.  Let's see what Spirit has to say.  Okay, well we are getting the Donald here.  It is going to be about Donald Trump.  It's funny because he kind of has his hands on his hips.  It's sort of like saying, deal with me or else.  Stubborn, that's the other feeling that of course I'm getting and it seems stubborn about some current events.  Okay, Spirit, so what about this emergency wall building?  Is that going to happen?  I see a furious Trump, and I actually see something like, here's a wall, and it's kind of like Pink Floyd's the wall.  It's breaking, and Trump is hopping mad.  So I think he actually might go this direction and try to call emergency measures.  But it looks like not just a thwart.  He will be disastrously thwarted.  And I do think that Mitch McConnell will be behind it.  It looks like they are finally losing patience with him.  The Republican Party just doesn't have any real interest in continuing with the Donald campaign.  Yeah, it seems extremely important.  Mitch McConnell, it is this sort of time where he is working behind the scenes to thwart Trump.  And it's just something feels very telling about this.  It almost feels like this is the moment when they really do abandon him.  Okay, McConnell keeps pointing to his head.  What does that mean, spirits?  He's making plans.  McConnell is making post-Trump plans.  He is trying to figure out how to get out of this situation and what is the most effective way for him to get rid of Donald Trump.  Okay, so Spirit, can we know any more about Mueller's investigation?  Sure.  Wow.  Well, so Mueller's in this office and I just see piles and piles, separate piles of papers.  These seem like, you know, investigations or maybe even indictments, you know, separate cases against separate people that he's planning.  I think the significant thing is there are a lot of them.  I mean, it seems like there's papers, piles of papers all the way around a room.  So Mueller's got a lot to do.  And see him stepping up to a podium.  So I think something is going to be made public fairly soon.  I'm seeing a tape recorder.  Like the old school kind like Richard Nixon would have had when he made the tapes inside the Oval Office.  What does that mean?  I think Cohen's got some tapes.  Maybe we're going to find out what's in some of the Cohen tapes.  It might even be that we hear what's in the Cohen tapes.  What's Cohen doing?  Cohen's now coming into his office.  He's pleading with him.  He's pleading with Mueller.  I think he really is afraid of Donald Trump.  Cohen isn't doing this for political reasons.  He really thinks that Trump will get him and maybe kill him.  He's pleading with him to protect his family.  Cohen does feel like they are in danger.  Hmm.  I think Cohen has had more threats than we realize.  On the surface, it just seems like Donald is vaguely threatening his father-in-law.  But I think he has received a few phone calls that he believes that involve kidnapping of his children.  There's specifically one of his daughters that's maybe disabled.  And I see that there's specific... specific threats to her.  At least that's what he fears.  He does believe that those people are in real physical danger and he knows.  He's like, look, you know, I had something to do with these kind of threats.  I know that these threats are not necessarily idle.  I know the difference between an idle and a real threat.  And you know what, I get a real feeling of karma for him.  He is finally ashamed.  Cohen is finally realizing that he did this to other people and he's getting what he deserves.  Now, I mean, nobody deserves to have anything happen to their kids.  And so do not misinterpret what I have said here.  But at least he understands the feeling of fear that he helped to create in others And that is the vengeance.  It's not the act.  It is the idea of living in fear.  So, Spirit, what else do we need to know about Donald?  And let me get to the point, Spirit.  Should we be worried?  What should we be worried about in the next few weeks or days?  Okay, Spirit is saying, look, okay, this is not about worrying.  It's not the end of the world, so don't freak out.  It's just, you know, he keeps going like this.  Look, it's going to be okay, but some stuff is going on.  What will happen next regarding Donald Trump?  Hmm.  You know, I see an arrow hitting a target.  And right, it's a bullseye.  Some bullseye is going to happen.  Something's going to get it right on the mark.  Would this involve, well, what would this mean?  Yeah, Russians.  I'm seeing lots of Russians, you know, with their hats doing their Russian dance.  It's the Russians.  There's something that is going to really put the mark on Donald Trump.  Yeah, I see the Russians doing their dance, Putin laughing.  And the Russians are just, the line of Russians keeps turning in different directions.  It keeps facing different directions.  So I wonder if they're not going to do things.  Gosh, I hope it's not the border into another country.  Is that what that means?  No, it doesn't mean that.  Okay, it seems like they're turning different directions, almost like Putin is maybe sometimes helping Trump, sometimes hurting Trump, whenever it suits him.  It seems all these people are bending to his will, and Donald is not the one in the power.  He is subject to Putin's power.  So Spiritus, is Donald Trump in trouble in terms of what he spoke to Putin about?  Look again, I'm seeing a recording.  So look, you know, when he went to Helsinki and he talked to all those people, I think it might be that the Russians recorded Trump.  They have evidence of what Trump said and they can make it public.  Hmm.  Uh, spirit, what did, what did, what did Trump say?  Again, I see Putin laughing.  He just, uh, he completely bent to Putin's will.  He essentially gave Putin everything that he wanted.  He told Putin, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh yeah.  He believes Putin.  He doesn't believe anybody else, but he, he believes other strong, strong men, if you will.  And you know, it's an interesting thing.  It's because Putin's a man.  Basically, Trump believes men who are strong and he does not like women who are strong.  So I see that like Nancy Pelosi, he just he hates her guts because she's.  there's something about his psychology where he's very threatened by powerful women and he will acquiesce to powerful men.  It's very much part of his childhood psychology where his father was a completely dominating character and dominated every relationship.  And that is how he's carried over.  Somebody who takes the role of his father, he will kowtow to and become almost like a child to them.  Whereas if a woman does that, like his father, he believes, you know, hey, you know, just you should know your place.  He really hates Pelosi.  And Pelosi's looking really happy in my adventure.  Pelosi's playing a harp.  Okay.  To me, that means like, hey, Trump, you're gonna, your days are numbered.  I'm playing the harp at your funeral.  You know, I'm playing this harp and maybe she's just playing him like a harp.  Yeah, that's what I feel like.  It's, she's looking good.  She sounded good.  she's really overcoming him in this image right now.  She's sort of floating above him and she's totally carefree.  And it's almost like she's using him to walk up a ladder, you know, like, she's flying around, she's moving back and forth, almost like with magic powers, just sort of flying around him, you know, and, uh, Yeah, she's way ahead of him.  She's just doing zigzags around him.  Yeah, I feel honestly very proud of Pelosi.  She's just showing up as this, you know, hey, I am woman, hear me roar kind of feeling.  Okay, so Spirit, is there anything else that we could know about Trump right now that would be useful?  I really do see him falling.  He's just, he's like put both of his hand, his head in both of his hands.  It's like he's kind of given up.  He's very much kind of become like a child.  I think that there's this period where he's going to be really, really furious and he's just going to be banging his head against the wall and he's going to be fighting.  But once McConnell outmaneuvers him, once McConnell sets him up to fall, again, he respects men, not women.  So once another man sets him up to fall, then he will, and McConnell's the tricky type, then he realizes that he's got nowhere to go.  And he's very much kind of almost returned to a sort of infantile behavior where his head's in the hands.  So, Spirit, what about economics?  What about our economic situation?  It's going to be up and down.  And it won't just be down.  It really will be up and down.  It'll be very much zigzagging.  Absolutely, really zigzagging.  So, you know, Don't freak out with your money.  Keep it fairly safe, I would say.  There may be a business opportunity if you're very savvy with the stock market to pick the times when it's up and down.  But if you're not an expert, I would not touch it.  Just let it go.  Put your money in a place where you think it is good long term.  And don't just get terrified about it.  going up and down and up and down and up and down.  I even see there's some point where it goes way down and then it climbs back up again.  So Spirit, is there anything else that we could know?  Is there anything else useful for us?  Hmm.  Well, this is a really great image.  You know, I often see this Calistoga wagon, you know, those wagons that went across the West.  And I hope everybody understands that these are symbolic.  I don't want to imply that this Western expansion was really good for everyone.  But just the symbol of that movement West of the West.  you know, building and creating and, um, you know, sort of learning and innovating that, um, has stopped like the wagon stopped, but a woman is coming out and she is giving me food.  And, um, she's, it's, it's like, it's like we have become neighbors and friends again.  Uh, it's like we remembered the community again.  And I just think that this message from Spirit is like, don't forget that.  You know, we are all fighting here and we're arguing at these people.  At the same time, we're also joining together in these groups.  And that can be positive.  I don't want to encourage anybody to have exclusive groups, but I really do want to encourage you to create a group or become a member of a, of a community.  That's the problem.  That's what we've lost is that people do not think of the community and, um, we are going to go back to this.  If you live in some place where you can be generous, uh, this, this will be really useful for your soul.  It'll really help you, uh, Just for example, I'm Dave Johnson on our channel.  I'm volunteering to tutor here.  That's just a small thing.  I was a teacher for many years, and so I feel like I want to become part of my new community and my new city and my new country.  And any small thing like that is really worth doing.  It will help relieve some of this stress that you're feeling.  What we're all really worried about is this destruction of our communities.  So reinforce those ties.  by being generous with your time.  It will help if you find somebody else that you can help because it'll just make you feel good and make them feel good.  This is the best thing that we can do right now.  It's not going to help you to get online and argue with a bunch of people that don't agree with you.  That will not do you any good.  And I know I always say that it's very easy to say stop arguing with others.  It's very easy for me to say while I'm channeling.  It's not so easy for me to say when I am walking about in my normal day.  But it's a message for all of us that, yeah, turn that direction.  Turn away from the argument and turn to the people that are like you.  Out of this, you might actually meet somebody on Facebook and start a political movement or even a movement whereby we are more generous.  This will be very hopeful.  It's funny because I see almost like a bow on a present.  This will be a very, very hopeful thing right now.  And it doesn't have to be dramatic.  You don't have to give lots of money.  It could be at one moment at a bus stop where you help somebody get on.  That's all you need to do.  It could be a few kind words to somebody that needs to hear them.  I always feel this is better with a stranger.  You're doing that out of your generosity.  Just to be generous, not because you want to be recognized as that person.  Although it's fine to be recognized as that person.  And with that, we will stop.  Thanks so much for watching. ",
