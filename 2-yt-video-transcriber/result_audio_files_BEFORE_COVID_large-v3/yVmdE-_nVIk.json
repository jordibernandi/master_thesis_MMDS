Videos brought to you by the offset and store scored in the description section.  Let's roll with this.  Michelle Obama is at a panel and her and Barack was there too.  And it appeared that they spoke on separate issues.  Michelle is on a panel.  And she decides to bring up this philosophy of white flight. ",

And we'll get into that.  Michelle Obama got on the stage and claimed that white people would flee the community because her and Barack moved into it and a couple other successful black people moved into the community.  You don't graduate from a prestigious university and come into the community very articulate and unless you're riding up in a hoopty with rims on it, banging Tupac Shakur with gang flags hanging out your pocket, barbecuing every night, cussing and yelling and smoking weed, will anybody have a problem with you?  You guys are very distinguished individuals, regardless before or after you were president.  I mean, they're lying.  I mean, it just eats me away at the hypocrisy and lies just to try to be politically correct, just to try to be SJWs.  But anyway, she says that white people were fleeing and white people are still fleeing from black people.  Because they're afraid.  They're running from us. ",

And then our race becomes third and treachery or you want to call it third and fourth and fifth.  I'm talking to you dummies.  I'm talking to you fools out here still thinking white people are actually concerned with you.  I want to give you a reality check real quick, real fast, so I can get to other stuff.  White people are not worried about you black folks.  Two or three white people in a cornfield don't count.  They're not worried about you.  Black people, you are not a threat to white people in America.  White people own your football teams.  White people own everything that all the people you love own.  Their entertainment value, their sport value, all of that is owned by white people.  They're not worried about you.  You're not a threat to them.  If you look at it like this, you guys are voting for politicians that are allowing Hispanics to take over your race.  Before you know it, black people are going to be irrelevant because Hispanics are going to live in your communities.  Hispanics are going to take your vote.  And I'm not talking about just legal.  I'm talking about legal and illegal.  And y'all run around and think the white man's scared of you.  They don't worry about you.  You have abortions per capita more than white people do.  You're killing each other more than white people kill themselves.  Overall, we have some of the greatest amount of spending power, but we don't reinvest in our own communities.  Let's move on.  Big head Michelle Obama, why don't you talk about black flight?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Michelle, why don't you talk about black fight?  Where do you and Barack live at?  Y'all don't live with the black folks.  Y'all live with the white folks.  Mostly every successful black man in America have moved to live with white people.  Where it's safe.  And I'm not saying exclusively it's not safe around black people.  But if you want to make that argument, it seems as if it's safer around white people because that's where you moved.  You didn't move to the south side of Chicago.  You ain't moved to Watts.  And to be honest, if a lot of millionaires move into these areas, it'll bring the property value up.  But y'all not going to move there.  You're going to go live with all the white people and then complain about it.  Why come black people don't live in their own communities once they make it?  And then another thing she said, which blew my mind, is because she openly admitted how hypocritical she is.  She said the white people move out of the community and then the community starts to degrade. ",

            "text": "Well, if white people move out and it's primarily black and they start to go to crap, that should tell you something.  Maybe they made a good investment choice by moving out of the community where knuckleheads are coming in and ruining the community.  Let me give you a perfect example.  I lived in Crowley with my father, Crowley, Texas, for a period of time.  When we lived out there, it was mostly middle class blacks.  And middle class whites.  Mostly white.  Obviously because the population was mostly white.  But it was black and white.  A very diverse community.  Very nice.  People walking their dogs.  They moved the projects.  Over into the community.  And then it went to crap.  Property value went down.  People getting their cars broken into.  Now the sports teams went up.  But crime and everything else went down.  Now.  There was some black flight going on, too.  So it's not white flight and black flight.  It's that when poor people move in and they begin to bring in things that devalue the community, people that have common sense and economical intelligence know that it will behoove you to move out of this community to a better community because this community is getting ready to tank.  That has nothing to do with white versus black.  That has everything to do with poor versus people who have economic sense or economic intelligence.  what you say, economic proficiency.  That's the word I was looking for.  So man, I think it's absolutely disgusting that Michelle Obama will come out and say this.  I'm not shocked because this is the way the liberals and the SJWs work.  And it's shameful.  And I think she should be condemned.  That is absolutely racist to say that.  And if the roles were reversed, And a white person was on the stage and saying, these black folks are always running from us.  Look at these black folks.  Y'all are running from people like us.  Y'all are scared of us.  You know, if you were to talk about black people like that and you're a white person, they would call you a racist and you'd lose every single endorsement you ever thought you had.  And it's shameful.  Anyway, like and subscribe to the channel if you like the content.  Make sure you hit the bell so you can get notification of all the stuff that I do.
