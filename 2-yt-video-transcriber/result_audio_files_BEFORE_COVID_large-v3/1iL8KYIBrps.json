There's got to be like, what, 20 to 30 of them out of the millions of PhD holders in the world, with something like 12,000 new life science PhDs every year?  These creationist PhDs are going to outnumber the non-creationist ones if this keeps up.  Oh wait, maybe it's just that people with doctorates are normal people and you can find quacks in any field, no matter how well educated.  Oh yeah, and also, long video, lots of filler, I'll be skipping.  Check original, make sure I'm not being dishonest.  Same old, same old.  Let's see how this guy does. ",

PubMed searches across more than 30,000 scientific journals dealing with life sciences.  If you can't be found there, you must not be doing much.  Just having the letters PhD after your name does not automatically make you a scientist.  You have to actually do something with them.

These ages have agreed with the relative dating methods used to date the coal beds beforehand.  There are different methods of dating the sandstone layers, and I'm not sure which methods were used on that particular sandstone, but one method is to find the youngest zircon crystal.  Sandstone, since it is sedimentary, cannot be older than its youngest zircon.  Layers of volcanic ash can also be used, as was done with the coal bed.  Index fossils can be used as well.  But here, let's just agree.  There's a 5 million year unconformity between the coal and the sandstone.  That is, the coal is 5 million years older than the sandstone, and there is no strata from the time between the coal and the sandstone.  Does that mean the coal had to be exposed on the surface of the Earth for 5 million years before the sandstone was deposited?  no it does not.  there are a few ways unconformities conform.  certainly it is possible that the older layer of the unconformity was exposed for a significant amount of time and there were just no depositional events.  that does happen.  there isn't deposition going on everywhere on the earth all the time.  But it could also be that whatever layers were deposited above the coal were eroded before the deposition of the sandstone.  This is five million years we're talking about here.  A lot can happen in five million years.  Or nothing could have happened.  Well, I mean obviously something happened.  I just mean nothing geological. ",

Did you guys catch the sneaky little lion there?  He takes the massive category of mutations which are completely neutral and don't do anything harmful or helpful, and renamed them near-neutral and claimed that they do have a very small negative impact.  I've never seen anyone do this before, and if I were to guess, I would think that this is his response to the fact, yes fact, it is an observed fact, that beneficial mutations are real and do happen.  Because if beneficial mutations are real and the vast majority of mutations are neutral, then this allows for natural selection to slowly cull out the negative mutations while favoring the positive mutations.

It's not about how many mutations you can survive, it's about what those mutations do.  And even if they were slightly negative, the way mutations are passed down would mitigate their negative effects.  Not all the children of a mutated parent will share the mutation, so if there is indeed a negative effect, then the children who do not share the mutation will have better reproductive success than the ones who do.  Add an occasional beneficial mutation into the mix, and boom, evolution. ",

One of the arguments that I have seen creationists use time and time again is that we breed things like bacteria in a lab for thousands to millions of generations and, shocker, they're still bacteria.  And then they complain that even if we do see changes, it's because we artificially sped up the mutation rate.  But if genetic entropy is really a thing, then speeding up the mutation rate should wipe them out faster, should it not?  Even just moving up to small mammals, rabbits can reproduce every year.  If they lost just 0.1% of their genetic fitness with every generation, then in the 3,000 years since the flood, they should be down to about 5% of their immediate post-flood genetic fitness, right?  So, where are the ancient super rabbits?  All signs point to rabbits being pretty much the same as they are now for the last several thousand years.  If genetic entropy is real, then these organisms with fast reproductive times should either be much worse off than they are today, or should show signs of having been significantly better than they were in the past.

So they are saying here that God's mercy is evident because this cruel shithole of a world that he created will only last a few thousand years instead of a few million.  so god is wonderful and merciful because he'll put us out of our misery and send most of us to an eternal torture chamber because an eternity of torture is more merciful than millions of years of individuals suffering for a little bit before ceasing to exist entirely.  They spend the rest of the video discussing molecules that have survived for millions of years that supposedly shouldn't have, and they seem to be going about it on a different track than just the typical dinosaur soft tissue thing, so I might cover that in a follow-up.  But for now, that's a pretty big topic shift, and it seems like a good place to leave it.  Today's comment of the day comes to us from Gary Avey, who says, Even a child could tell you that man did not evolve.  You only need special credential to show what a muppet you are, and show me one fact that anything evolved.  Firstly, children can tell you all sorts of things.

Citrate-metabolizing E. coli.  11 broken copies of an identical gene found throughout our genome, which can also be found in a chimp's genome in the exact same places.  Fuse chromosome 2.  Antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  the hominid transitional fossils, the cetacean transitional fossils, other transitional fossils, atavisms, vestigial structures, homologous structures, biogeography predicted by evolution, molecular clock dating using neutral mutations, the phylogenetic tree, how well Linnaean phylogeny matches up with molecular phylogeny.  Human embryos have extra hand muscles that are found in lizards, but not in adult humans.  Dolphin embryos start with the nostrils on the front of their face, which then migrate up to the top of their head as the embryo develops.  I could go on, but that would be a whole video in and of itself of just me listing facts that demonstrate evolution, so that's where I'm going to leave it.  Shoutout to TJ once again for sending me a nice little gift basket which included a book for the kids and an iPhone 6.  You may remember TJ from the time he sent me a Drobo fully loaded with hard drives, which I now use to archive my channel.  And no, this is not TJ the Amazing Atheist.  And also another shoutout to J.R.  Eldridge, author of the hilarious Misread Bible Genesis, who has now sent me his new book, A Misread Bible Christmas.  That's it for today.
