            "text": "Welcome back, everyone.  Today I'm going to be addressing this request, which goes as follows.  Hey there, Martin.  I'm what the Manosphere would describe as an OG Tyrone.  On an almost daily basis, I pump and dump, drop ship, and stir fry all of the women.  Well, that's kind of peculiar.  I've noticed over recent years this trend of guys in the social and political spheres advocating more radical forms of traditionalism, conservatism, or fundamentalism.  Whether this stems from your typical Caucasian conservatives like Rick Santorum or Prager, Arab Muslim fundamentalists or extremely short and angry Indian incels, do you believe it is a positive development or simply another example of insecure men who cannot cope properly with guys like me?  Well, there's a lot of stuff to unwrap there, a little bit loaded, and I should say I think a lot of folks are always looking for a kind of one-size-fits-all explanation or solution when in reality it's a tad bit more complicated or nuanced.  So I'll say, as far as people obsess with this social rules, mandating or legislating female rights, I think they tend to miss the point.  I know a number of guys who are legitimately in these so-called traditional relationships in real life, and they don't spend a whole lot of their uh... you know existence on the internet dot com because they try to provide for like seven eight nine kids or keep their family together keep it prosperous and functioning thriving.  they also don't tend to be a big like mouthy and preachy about.  it's not a political point of view.  it's just something they're trying to construct and if you ask me that's liable to be more successful in the long run than these campaigns for political revolution on the basis of traditionalism.  In fact, when it concerns women themselves, there's two primary reasons why a girl is going to be traditionalist.  And again, considering this social enforcement or legal mandates, you have to recognize if you read into these societies like Iran, Saudi Arabia, There was a book on the female Pakistani squash player.  You have the other one reading Lolita in Tehran.  They all give some pretty good insights.  Well, yeah, you can have that fundamentalism, but it only works very well in terms of the social sphere, unlike the familial or maybe the tribal level, close family, because you're always going to have in any society, especially those on the scale that we know today there's going to be liberals there's going to be people who are moderates there's going to be people who are just going to ignore laws or regulations and so if it's not starting at the home you've already lost the battle because you're not going to be able to mandate people into a particular form of behavior and that in of itself creates a whole lot of other problems which i'll discuss a little bit later in this video.  So primary reasons that a woman's going to be traditional, number one, it's because she was raised that way.  So that's kind of like the girl that I'm with now.  It's not you lecturing or telling her.  It's just what she's been used to.  It's innate.  It's been learned, acculturated, if you will.  That's the one angle.  The other one is that she's going to be traditional either because she likes you, she wants to stay with you, or if you want to be more cynical, you could say, well, she's doing it strategically.  in reality she was with a lot of guys and she's just cleaned up because she wants to secure financial support.  but either way that's not really on the basis of rules and mandates and this is where you have to understand what a traditional society would even look like if you're just doing it essentially because you're angry about the current state of romantic and dating affairs which i could see why people would be but that doesn't necessarily mean that the traditional social state is going to be much better.  in fact i've told a lot of guys this if you are if you happen to be a bottom feeder in a liberal society where at least you know you can you can if you believe in that that stuff which a lot of it's garbage but you can take the red pill and you can do the PUA stuff and maybe you'll be successful, right?  In a traditional society, if you are a bottom feeder in the liberal one, you might very well be the bottom feeder in the more traditional one, because let's take some of these proposals just for the heck of it, okay?  A big one that I've seen thrown around for years is the whole.  Girls are the property of the father.  We need arranged marriages.  That's like, okay, so let's consider arranged marriages in reality as opposed to the fantasy.  Okay, so we're going to arrange you to be married.  Well, as it turns out, it's not just women who are being arranged to be married.  It's not just frustrated or horny dudes who get matched up with who most of us would want, the 19-year-old Jessica Alba.  Too late, I was there before you guys.  You might get matched up because she comes from a good family, because she's got money, whatever.  You might be matched up with Fern or LaRonda, someone you don't find attractive, someone you might even find kind of repulsive.  but it's an arranged marriage, you're going to have to deal with it.  You see, just because you have a traditional society does not mean that magically every guy gets a bikini model.  That is the big misconception where a lot of these dudes think that I'm going to be a winner if I have a traditional society.  Well, you might very well be at the bottom of the heap still, and you just don't know what you're trying to get yourself into.  So I would say at least try to understand the models instead of just assuming it would be better because those women would pay.  Whenever you have a vengeance fantasy, that's where you need to kind of ease off a little bit on the power and say, am I doing this because I really believe in it?  Would I want to live in this society?  or am I doing it because I basically want to spite someone?  Because it's important as far as personal development would be concerned.  Now, going on from that, if you are in this current society and you don't have your financial act together, you're not in any position to actually provide for a family, what makes you think that a traditional model would leave you much better off?  You know, you go up into the interview and he's like, with a father, he's like, sit on down, tell him about yourself.  So you do so.  And he's like, so what do you do for a living?  well i took the red pill and i talk about red pill mangina alpha male.  it's like okay that's great.  next candidate please.  i mean as a traditional man in traditional society you're going to be expected to act in a traditional way.  so if you're not able to provide for a family if you don't bring anything to the table besides believing in traditionalism you're probably not going to be the winner in that society either.  so my point would be And I warn folks about this.  Don't orient your whole life around a political idea or prediction or particular outcome because it might not work out that way and you might have missed opportunities to better your own position along the way for just, you know, your own betterment or whatnot.  Traditionalism, if it did happen, you're going to have to do traditional things.  A lot of guys would not like the expectations of men in a traditional so-called society.  With that being said, of course, there's the other dynamic, and that is, what are these traditional societies, what do they actually devolve into?  When you start mandating human behavior like that, it might sound good, oh, you know, they're not going to be allowed to be Stacey's, they're not going to be allowed to screw around or whatever.  Well, as I said, some of them are just going to dodge the laws, there's going to be people who don't really care about the laws.  But on the flip side, this is from Reading Lolita in Tehran, which is a good book, I recommend checking it out.  if you want more of an insight into these cultures in the middle east you create this basically paranoid police state where you have to justify reasons for why people might possibly be doing something wrong.  You have this very, I don't want to say reactionary, but it's like this fearfulness of basic human sexuality.  So they would like ban certain TV shows because there were too many men, and that might mean that someone would consider them gay.  Or if you had more women, that meant it was promoting sexual immorality.  Or if a girl had her nails too long, she'd be sent to the principal's office.  Or her eyelashes, or she's running in class.  That could be seductive, running to class.  If she was biting into an apple a certain way, well, that could turn a guy on.  You have to be reprimanded for that.  If you're out with friends, well, you're going to be taken to the police station because you might be up to bad stuff.  The question is, how many rules and regulations do you want to have?  And is it not simply going to backfire because you're not doing it on the basis of the individual genuinely wanting to take that path, but you're doing it on, we're going to try to force you.  As we see with Saudi Arabia, by the way, Saudi Arabia is not as conservative as you think.  They did the social conservative stuff, I think it was in the 70s or the 60s, because they were afraid of losing out to, when there was a revolution in Iran and the fundamentalists came to power, The king in Saudi Arabia was basically freaking out.  He thought, I'm going to lose my head next.  And so he said, okay, we better go down that route.  Well, of course, the royals are not social conservatives in reality.  And even a lot of society under the veneer, they're not either.  So just because you see these and we hear about, oh, man, they're so reactionary.  it might not be quite as much as you believe.  So you have to recognize, even in these so-called ideal social conservative havens, you still have a lot of hypocrisy, you still have a lot of really lack of enforcement, and you have to ask yourself ultimately, is that what you want to live under?  Do you want to have a system where you basically are policed?  your behavior, whether you're a man or a woman, you're policed that much simply to hope that this society will turn out better.  As we see with Iran, at least part of that's because the United States, but Iran's not exactly thriving and prospering.  And at least the Iranians I've met were pretty happy to get out.  So if you want the traditional thing, go and find it in the real world, but do it in an organic fashion.  Don't assume that a law or a society or community is going to do the job for you.  That to me is coping.  That is, you know, I'm not getting with the girls I want, therefore if it was traditionalism, I would.  And you may very well find out that's not the case. ",
