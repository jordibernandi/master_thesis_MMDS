My goal is to see you successful in every single area of your life.  I want to build you up in the faith, but I also want you to be successful spiritually, physically, emotionally, in every single area.  And I promise you I have a lot in store for 2020, so don't leave without subscribing.  Okay, let's get into today's video.  Tip number one is having a prayer life.  It's so important to be in constant communication with God.  And I know I've shared this in a few of my vlogs, but I want you to understand something.  God gave us all free will and he is never going to force himself on anybody.  He wants you to have a relationship with him, but it's totally up to you to do that.  Just like with any healthy relationship in your life, you have to work at it.  You have to be in constant communication with that person, letting them know what you like, what you don't like, what's going on in your world.  That's exactly how God wants to be with you.  He wants to hear from you and know exactly what's on your heart.  And he, you know, even though he knows everything, He wants you to voice it.  He wants you to come to him with your needs.  Come to him with your wants.  Come to him with the brokenness that's inside of you and just let him know, here I am, Lord.  I am yours.  So don't forget to be in constant communication with God.  If you want to be consistent with with the Lord, with your walk with God.  You know, I tell my husband all the time, good communication is key in our relationship.  And so just like with any relationship, God wants to hear from you.  Tip number two is hanging out with like-minded people.  This tip is so important because who you're hanging out with really reflects who you are.  And I'm not saying that you need to like separate yourself completely from the world and you know just live under a rock for the rest of your life.  I'm not saying that at all because we are called to be the light of the world.  so they won't know the light of the world if they're not around it, right?  But on the other hand, you need to be surrounded by like-minded people who believe the way that you do, who have been in the things of God for a really long time so they can help guide you as you surrender your life to Christ.  They probably know something Or two things about what the Christian walk looks like.  And so they might be able to help you in your struggles, in your downfalls, you know, when you feel like you can't do this anymore, you want to throw in the towel, you know, you're going to have a friend to rely on, but you need to be surrounded by those friends.  who think like you, you know, and believe the way that you do.  So it's very important to be at a church where you can do that.  So if you're not in a church, I really highly recommend that you find a church home that you can call your own, where you can be surrounded by these people who are going to help build you up in the faith.  I love what 1 Corinthians 15.33 says.  It says, \"...do not be deceived.  Bad company ruins good  morals.\".  And that is true, it really is.  I mean, if you're hanging out with the wrong crowd, that are doing the wrong things, then you're probably going to end up doing those things along with them.  You know, not saying that you're easily influenced or anything, but it's just kind of how it goes when you're hanging out with those people.  So sometimes, you know, it's good to separate yourself and find those good people to hang out with that are doing the will of God and that are serving him and that are honoring him with their lives.  And especially if you are a new believer, because when you're a new believer, you're very vulnerable, and you need to set really high boundaries.  Tip number three is you need to have boundaries.  Boundaries are so important in your walk with God.  Without them, you can epically fail and not fulfill the call of God upon your life.  You know, when we're little, when we're children, our parents give us those boundaries.  You know, they tell us what to do and what not to do for our protection.  Well, when you become an adult, you have to create your own boundaries because nobody's going to do it for you.  And you need to decide, you know, what your triggers are, what's going to cause you to sin.  decide to set boundaries along the lines of you because you know your convictions are different from my convictions.  my convictions are different from your convictions so nobody can tell you what those boundaries are but you and God.  you need to have a conversation with him and And ask him what your boundaries are and figure out what you need to do in order to not go that way or not do that thing that you know is going to cause you to sin against God.  And again, one of my biggest pet peeves is when people try to put their own boundaries on you because I don't believe that everyone has the same convictions.  Something that might be bad for you is not bad for me.  Or something that's good for you might not be good for me.  So, you know, it's important to really have a real raw conversation.  And, you know, maybe you have a mentor in your life that can help you decide what those things are.  Or maybe your pastor can help you, you know.  line up those boundaries and figure out like where you need to cross, you know, draw a line so that you don't sin against God, you know, and you know, those people, those pastors in your life, they're put, God put them there for a reason to really help you.  So sometimes you need to listen to what they're trying to tell you.  And then once you have a clear picture of the things that you know that you need to set boundaries for, then that's where you learn to practice self-control.  Self-control is one of the fruits of the Spirit and it's very important that every believer has self-control and that you practice it on a daily basis.  You know, you want to be that good fruit-bearing tree that the Lord is proud of, that the Lord is honored by, and you want your life to show God's glory, really.  So set those boundaries for yourself.  Tip number four is read your Bible.  And this just goes without saying, but I'm going to reiterate it over and over and over again, because this is probably one of the most common ways that the Lord speaks.  I'm not saying this is the only way, because God speaks in several different ways through people, through dreams, so many different ways.  For me personally, this is one of the most common ways that he speaks.  And the word of God is living and alive.  It's working in us and through us.  And, you know, there's so many times where I'm going through something or, you know, I open up my Bible and I'm doing my devotional and I just feel like what is written there was... like it was written exactly for me at the time that I needed it the most.  but how can God speak to you in that way if you're not receptive to receiving what he has for you?  you need to make time.  you need to carve time out of your busy day.  I know you're busy we're all busy but you need to make it a point to carve out time.  you know sometime during the day to where you're allowing God to speak to you through his word.  It's very, very important.  Tip number five is remember why you started.  You know, sometimes we get so caught up in Christianity and ministry and in doing the will of God that we really forget what this is all about.  it's all about Jesus you guys.  that's the bottom line.  you know.  you need to go back to why you started this in the first place.  why did you decide to follow God in the first place?  for me personally I decided to follow God because I knew that he was the reason that I existed.  you know I I was looking for my purpose and I was looking for love in all the wrong places.  And I ended up feeling alone and feeling like I had no purpose.  And then I remembered that my mom, she grew up telling me about Jesus when I was really, really young.  And it led me back to church where I found that void that was missing in my life.  God filled it with His love.  And ever since then, since I turned 19 years old, I have been serving him.  And sometimes I have to go back to that girl, that 19-year-old girl who felt alone, who felt like she had no purpose, who was looking for love but couldn't find it in any guy.  I have to go back to that girl and remember that he is the reason why I live.  He is the reason that I exist.  And my life was created to honor the true living God, Jesus Christ.  So remember why you started.  And my last and final tip for you is to keep your eyes on God.  I believe one of the biggest reasons why people fall away from the faith or they end up, you know, sinning against God or backsliding, whatever you want to call it.  Everyone has different terms for it.  But I think the number one reason is, is because they take their eyes off of Jesus and then they start putting their eyes on people.  Now I'm gonna tell you right here right now on this vlog that people are always going to fail you.  We're all human, we all make mistakes on a daily basis.  So every single time that you put your time, your attention and your efforts into people, they're going to fail you.  That's why, you know, we have to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith.  We need to keep our eyes on him at all costs.  Because if we don't, we're going to fall away just like Peter when he was walking on water with God, when he was there with Jesus, walking on water.  the Sea of Galilee.  but as soon as he took his eyes off of him he fell.  he fell on the water because he took his eyes off of Jesus.  don't be Peter don't be like Peter in that instance.  keep your eyes on God because people are always going to fail you but God will never fail you.  he is always there for you.  he's always there to comfort you to help you and to keep you.  he's going to keep you in the faith.
