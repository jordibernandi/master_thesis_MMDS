            "text": "But you guys are familiar with that show, The Daily Shoah.  Basically, Daily Shoah means Daily Holocaust, and it's a white supremacist show, a really popular white supremacist show.  And one of their hosts is... An EMT.  And on this show, The Daily Show, he plays a character.  And his character basically makes fun of black people.  He plays a character, quote unquote.  His character is a doctor or a medical professional who... tortures black people and goes around, talks bad about black people, makes fun of black people.  He's basically making fun of the people that he treats as an EMT.  Um, so he got fired for it.  Uh, Alex McNabb, a prominent white supremacist podcaster has been fired from his job as an emergency medical technician in Northwestern Virginia.  According to reports from multiple local media outlets, his termination comes three months after a HuffPo report exposed McNabb's racist diatribes on the white supremacist podcast, the daily show.  Uh, The Jeb Stewart Volunteer Rescue Squad in Patrick County, Virginia, voted unanimously Sunday to terminate McNabb, according to the news station WSLS.  McNabb has been a regular co-host of over 130 episodes of the daily Shoah.  The podcast title makes mocking reference to the genocide of six million Jews in World War II.  Shoah means calamity in Hebrew and typically refers to the Holocaust.  On the podcast, which has featured prominent white supremacist guests, including Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin, McNabb frequently assumes a persona.  His name's Dr.  Narkin.  As Dr.  Narkin now tells his co-host stories about being an EMT, referring to black patients as dindus, a deeply racist slur, and comparing them to animals.  It's hard to find a dindu vein anyway because they're black.  Basically, he's talking about how hard it is to find black people's veins when you're an EMT because they're black and you can't find them.  McNabb maintains that his Dr.  Narkin character is a work of fiction.  And one of the most disturbing Dr.  Narkin segment, McNabb recounts dealing with an unruly young African-American male child running around an emergency room.  As it turned out, this young African-American male was there to get blood drawn.  So guess who volunteered to take his blood, he told his co-host.  Dr.  Narkin enjoyed great satisfaction as he terrorized this youngster with a needle and stabbed him thusly in the arm with a large gauge knife.  for catheter.  So basically he's bragging about torturing a black child in his job as an EMT on his white supremacist talk show.  Medical experts told HuffPost that large gaze needles should never be used on young children.  So just basically this piece of shit.  who's gone on a white supremacist show joking, quote unquote, I guess he was joking, about torturing black children, and he got fired for it.  So anyway, they had a hearing to determine who he was going to be fired for, and there was a councilman that basically just let him fucking have it.  This guy's basically like, hey, it's all jokes, man.  You shouldn't be able to fire me for making jokes about torturing black people who were in my care because it's all jokes.  Freedom of speech, right?  I should be able to say whatever, but no, dude.  You can't do, like, seriously, what the fuck?  These guys are such pieces of fucking shit, man.  Let's listen a little bit.
