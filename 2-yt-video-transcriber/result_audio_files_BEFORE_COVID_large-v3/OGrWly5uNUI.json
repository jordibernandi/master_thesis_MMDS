            "text": "So in 2016, you tweeted out a list of 20 people that you called alt-right or alt-right friendly.  It included Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, and even Donald Trump.  Recently, you gave a speech at Stanford about Nick Fuentes, who you called an alt-right lead influencer.  My question is this.  It seems like conservatives like you, like Charlie Kirk, like Dan Crenshaw feel threatened by America-first conservatives and America-first ideas?  Is this why you're smearing them as alt-right, racist, homophobic, and all these other things, instead of actually addressing their ideas and debating them? ",

            "text": "So first of all, I'm happy to address any ideas.  I'm not happy to debate somebody who has joked about murdering me.  That's Fuentes.  As far as some of the other people who are mentioned, obviously when I say alt-right or alt-right adjacent, you'd have to date the tweet.  So back in 2016, the fact of the matter is that people like Ron Paul, who has a long history of extremism, if you go back and read the Ron Paul letters, there's a fair bit of anti-Semitism and racism in them.  If you look at Donald Trump, who I said overtly in 2016, flirted with the alt-right because he did in April and May of 2016.  That was a dated tweet.  If you're going to date the tweet to 2016, you actually have to date the tweet to 2016, not to yesterday, because things change.  Donald Trump, thank God, has forcibly expelled many of the people who are alt-right adjacent, like Steve Bannon, from his administration, which is a very, very good thing.  As far as the idea that I'm somehow refusing to debate lower levels of immigration.  That is obviously untrue.  You can go watch an hour-long interview that I did with the aforementioned Ann Coulter back before 2016 about a book she did on immigration.  It's all about lowering levels of immigration.  If we're talking about tariffs, happy to have that conversation.  I had it with Tucker Carlson.  If you're talking about a more isolationist foreign policy, I've had that conversation with many, many people.  I said this in my speech at Stanford, which people are willfully ignoring.  I'm not arguing that people who hold those views are quote unquote alt-right.  The alt-right is a very specific viewpoint that sees The problem in America is a problem of demographics.  that suggests that white nationalism is the answer to that problem, that suggests that the problem with immigration is not a problem of culture or assimilation.  The problem in America is a problem of what race the people are who are coming into the country.  That is not a point of view that is even within the realm of sort of the paleo-con viewpoint.  That is a point of view that is actively alt-right.  So the alt-right does have a definition.  And I tried to be as specific about that definition as possible at Stanford University.  If you want to ask for a follow-up, that's fine. ",

You've called Pat Buchanan an anti-Semite and racist for 15 years when Pat Buchanan is a legend of conservatism.  You need to stop smearing people who want to reduce immigration and criticize Israel as anti-Semitic and racist.  and just accept that they disagree with you and they simply want to put America first.

There are plenty of people who disagree with me on all the aforementioned issues.  I've mentioned some of their names and that is perfectly fine.  If you want to discuss Nick Fuentes specifically, I suggest, again, you go back and you look at his videos about why... 6 million Jews, or what was it, 1 million Jews could not have been burned in the ovens at Auschwitz or Treblinka.  I suggest that you go back and you look at videos of him, actual videos of him, doing things like playing Grand Theft Auto, running over an Orthodox Jew, cackling maniacally, and then talking about how he just killed Ben Shapiro.  I refer you to a video last week in which Nick Fuentes pulls out a switchblade and starts randomly jabbing it in the air while talking about me.  No, I don't think he's a mainstream conservative, and I think that it is a sin for people to conflate mainstream conservatism with that kind of garbage.  Thanks.  I gave you a couple of questions.  I gave you a couple of questions.  There are other people in the line.  So wait, let me guess your political affiliation. ",

Free speech is under attack in this country.  So recently, when you spoke at Sanford, you smeared America First patriots like myself with all the same leftist insults Antifa uses, the same ones they're using outside to smear us walking in here today.  So my question for you, Ben, is will you debate a true conservative like Nicholas J. Fuentes, or are you too scared to defend your anti-America-first positions? ",

I see no purpose in debating somebody who has joked about my death.  That is not something that I make a habit of.  If you want me to debate somebody about immigration policy who is a limited immigration person or have a discussion with that person, I'm happy to do so.  I see a very strong argument in favor of limiting immigration, both legal and certainly illegal, to the United States.  Okay, if you want me to talk about tariff policy and have a discussion with somebody about that, I'm happy to do that.  If you want me to have a discussion about Israel or Israeli policy, I'm happy to do that.  What I am not happy to do is have a debate with somebody who has joked about my death, called people who work for me Shabbos Goy race traitors, praised the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.  That I am not going to do.  And by the way, I'm not going to stop anybody from asking questions, but if you keep asking the same question, you're going to keep getting the same answer. ",
