His conflictual stance, especially in Canada in the beginning, towards all this LGBT plus naming and so on.  towards what he calls cultural Marxism.  And my stance towards him, as far as I knew, there was not just fanatically against, but it was there.  When he criticizes LGBT+, political correctness and so on, he nonetheless sees some problems, identify them correctly, but of course give them a long term and so on and so on. ",
