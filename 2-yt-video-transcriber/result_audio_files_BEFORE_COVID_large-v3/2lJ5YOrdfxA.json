            "text": "Bushakusha back here with another video, but before I go and get into the topic, which I think now is becoming more and more clear.

All right, so here we go.  and that this video is entitled that iraq dinar is going to be gold backed and i'm going to show you guys i'm going to prove it to you that what's been going on with gold and what the what the central banks are preparing for.  and let me tell you something essential banks are not in control as much as you think anymore right there's?  I've been following X-22, and he does a lot of reporting on Trump taking down the central banks.  He has a lot of videos, too much to go through or too much to explain, but I'm going to do it shortly here.  concerning the gold, right?  Now, the first thing, not only will Iraq be backed by its oil, but Iraq will also be backed by gold.  Their economy, the state of Iraq will be backed by gold and oil.  Now, of course, they're going to have to diversify to keep it up.  And regardless of what happens, whether it's a RIRV or whatever, it doesn't even matter.  But all this, the countries that are ready will go.  This is all going to go online at once.  But I'm going to discuss first of all, just to give you some articles.  Back in 2017, February, President Trump replaced the dollar with gold as the global currency to make America great again.  All right, so it just talks about how he wants to make replacing the dollar with gold or gold-backed dollar.  All right, that's article number one.  Trump Fed pick wants to revive the gold standard.  Here's what that means.  As President Trump named his picks to fill two influential seats in the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the price of gold surged.  That may be because one of them, Judy Shelton, is a believer in the return of the gold standard, a money policy abandoned by the United States in 1971.  Shelton is raising eyebrows among mainstream economies for her views, which include slashing the Fed's benchmark rate to zero, pegging the value of the dollar to gold prices.  She's not the first Trump picked for the Fed to advocate a return to the gold standard.  With his two previous failed Fed choices, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain also advocated for a revival of the policy.  In picking Shelton, Mr.  Trump is aiming to place a supporter on the Federal Reserve, which he argued is slowing economic growth and depressing the stock market by keeping interest rates too high.  Trump has been making his moves since he's been in office, getting people on the board, but he's already been dismantling the central bank system behind the scenes.  And if you know certain things of what's going on, you already know that most of the central banks are owned by you know who.  And there is a concerted effort to take them down, not because of the banking system, but it's because of the other sickening things that they are involved in.  And if you watch the other video on Patreon, you will see that.  And I'm gonna show you another article.  The quiet campaign to reinstate the gold standard is getting louder.  This is July 3rd.  This was just less than a week ago.  The quiet campaign to reinstate the gold standard is getting louder.  It has been long dismissed as a fool's errand on par with abandoning the Federal Reserve and other trappings of the modern economy.  Mainstream economists deride it almost without exception.  Reintroducing the gold standard would be a disaster for any large advanced economy, says University of Illinois Chicago.  And now Keshav, who connects enthusiasm for it with microeconomic illiteracy.  His colleague, noble Richard Thaler, struggles with this very underlying principle.  Why tie gold?  Why not the 1982 Board Acts?  Yet the idea that every U.S.  dollar should be backed by a small amount of gold is actually more popular than an economist's opinion might suggest.  Advocates include members of Congress and President Trump.  Enthusiasm for a return to the gold standard has become more prominent since Trump's most recent nominees to fill the vacant Federal Reserve governorship have endorsed a return.  All right, so it just goes on about Judy Shelton.  and again, This is going to happen.  See, it's not just going to happen with the United States.  It's going to be happening with many central banks.  And they are getting in line with the United States because if they were to go to a gold-backed dollar, what would happen if all the other countries in all the world didn't do that?  Well, figure it out.  So now I'm going to get ready to show you some articles of what's been happening.  right, when it comes to gold and how this is all being set up.  All these countries are buying gold because once the United States goes to gold standard, so will a lot of other countries, including Iraq.  All right, this was published January 31st, 2019.  Central bank gold buying hits highest level in a half a century.  In 2018, central banks bought the most gold by volume since 1967.  The Russian central bank is leading the way as it looks to reduce its reliance on dollar reserves.  The amount of gold bought by central banks in 2018 reached the second highest annual total on record, according to the World Gold Council.  Central bank purchases reached 651.5 metric tons in 2018, 74% higher than in the previous year when 375 tons were bought.  So the WGC has estimated that central banks now hold nearly 34,000 tons of gold.  Federal Reserve is reported to hold the most amount for almost three quarters of the nation's foreign exchange reserve pot.  All right, so that's article number one.  Why are central banks buying gold and dumping dollars?  This came out June 23rd.  That's about almost three weeks ago.  Yeah, why are central banks buying gold and dumping dollars?  So as you read the article, it just talks about bonds getting crushed, clash of currencies, All right, it just talks about how the central banks and United States and how everybody's buying gold.  All these central banks are buying gold.  All right.  Gold may not all, may not be all that glisters.  All right.  Uncertainty about U.S.  trade policy has truncated the rally in stocks.  Gold remains supported by central bank buying in fears of a U.S.  dollar collapse.  Gold miners look to the... Gold miners look the best place to reap the benefits regardless of direction.  A collapse in the U.S.  dollar is needed for gold to rally substantially.  All right.  Well, the U.S.  dollar is not going to collapse because they're already trying to turn it into the dollar into gold backed.  So it's not going to collapse.  You're not going to collapse this economy and then everything's going to go to hell.  You won't even have time to even to put stuff together before you know, people are riding in the streets and all kinds of other crazy stuff.  In quarter four, 2018 as stocks declined gold rally 8.1% and gold mining stocks, 13.7%.  Interesting.  I would like to know which gold mining stocks those are.  And it goes over the same information that I just talked about.  Uh, you can look at here, the central banks continue gobbling up gold here in 1997, down, down, down, down here about 2010.  They started buying, buying, buying, buying.  All right, gold reserves as of March.  You see here some of the major countries.  All right, so you kind of get my point on that, right?  That gold, and that's the reason why they were saying like years ago, buy gold, buy gold, because gold's gonna go up, gold's gonna go up, and people have been waiting for gold to go up.  I know some of you have gold that has been waiting and waiting and waiting.  Well, you actually might see it go a lot higher than what you're seeing it now.  Forgot to mention, so I'm just going to reread it here again.  Central Bank net purchase of gold reached 650.5 tons in 2018, up 74% from 2017 when 375 tons were bought.  And I'm going to skip down.  For probably similar reasons, the Turkish central bank bought 51.5 tons down from 88 tons purchased the previous year.  Other big central bank buyers include Kazakhstan, India, Iraq, Poland, and Hungary.  In the first quarter of 2019, central banks purchased a further 145.5 tons, up 68% on quarter one.  The trend is not new.  Central bank purchases have been rising since 2009.  All right, so obviously there is something there that's going on.  You know, and it says it's interesting as I look at the Iraq gold reserves, you know, a lot of people talk about the revaluation up to this point right here.  They didn't have hardly any gold at all.  And maybe that's what this whole thing with the global reset has to do with.  And I haven't really heard very many people talk about this.  The Iraq dinar, Iraqi dinar is going to be backed by gold.  Not just their oil, but their gold, too.  And that's why I say in some of my videos why you need to support the president and everything that he's doing and trust the plan.  Because if he was not in power, the people that are currently in charge would remain in charge and it would have never happened.  It would have never happened.  Oh, that would have kept feeding you.  That's for sure.  Maybe raise the rate a little bit.  Make it 1,000 to 1.  Then everybody starts buying more again because, hey, it's getting ready to take off now.  They never intended on doing that, but now God had intended.  Yahweh had intended it for it to happen.  Anyways, guys, I want you to tell me what you think.  This is part of the global reset.  Gold-backed currency led by the President Trump.  I'm just going to say this one last thing.  For those of you who are waiting, like me, we still have time.  powers to be the elites need to be removed the mass arrests have to take place and it's going to very soon here.  then he will have the freedom to do what needs to be done.  then he can have the people in the Federal Reserve even if the Federal Reserve is still even will exist after the global reset a lot of changes taking place And you guys just have to follow a plan.  Be patient.  It's going to happen.  There's some other things that need to take place first.  I thank you guys for listening.  Watch, like, share, right?  Don't forget about the Patreon.  And let's move forward and dig in for a little bit longer.  And watch all these events unfold over the next 30 days.  What's going to come out in the news is going to be shocking.  It's all connected together.  All of it is connected together with the bankers and everything else.  So this is Twisted Christian out. ",
