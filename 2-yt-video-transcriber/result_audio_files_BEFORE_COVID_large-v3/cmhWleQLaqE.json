Okay, so got these city cops out here.  We got Officer Michael Crusoe.  He's definitely has something to hide.  He won't let me anywhere near scene.  Look at all these cops.  How we doing, man?  Good, you?  Pretty good.  Keep an eye on these, holding them accountable.  They said there's 25 juveniles down here in a... Big fight.  I don't see any big fights going on.  You guys can see here we got all the red and blues going tonight.  Red and blue lights.  These militants are out in full force tonight.  There was a call for 25 juveniles fighting in the middle of the street, Blackstone and Van Buren.  We've got witnesses here asking me what happened.  You'd think they would have seen 25 juveniles fighting if that was really happening.  My guess is it's just a reason for these cops to come down here and disrupt this neighborhood on a quiet evening.  There goes one cop.  Oh, we got the undercover car here tonight.  it looks like.  Okay.  No, that's not the undercover car.  Yeah, Justin.  Hey, Justin.  Justin.  Okay, so there's Officer Michael Crusoe.  He's more interested in telling all these people about me, my business, and who I am, rather than taking care of his job, doing what he's paid to do.  This cop loves harassing photographers, Officer Michael Crusoe.  Look, he keeps looking up this way.  because he has something to hide.  Oh, there's Caruso.  Here comes Officer Caruso.  Hey, can we get any comments, Officer Caruso?  Just keep your distance, okay bud?  This is a dangerous cop, guys.  Keep your children far away from this cop.  Right here.  These cops are shining their light in my camera right now.  Got to keep my distance.  A camera might hurt me.  A camera might expose my corrupt ways, my misconduct.  Please don't obstruct my camera.  Please don't obstruct my First Amendment rights, Crusoe.  Please take that light out of my face.  That's blinding me.  You're blinding my eyes.  That's doing permanent damage to my eyes right now, Crusoe.  I'm wearing tan.  Tan and white.  Black and white shirt.  I told you what I was doing.  You know why I'm here.  You know who I am.  Please take the light out of my eyes.  You're doing permanent damage to my eyes right now.  That's an assault.  You're assaulting me.  Oh, for your safety.  Oh, for my safety.  Let me see your hands for my safety.  For everyone else's safety here.  These cops are corrupt, man.  Blinding me with their light. ",
