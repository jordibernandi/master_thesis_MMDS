            "text": "Georgia-Florida Line, Chris Tomlin, and the hypocrisy of the American South.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your friend Spencer Smith.  I've been just bombarded with requests to deal with this story, and I think it's worthy of attention.  Fox News is reporting that Florida-Georgia Line turns concert into worship service with special guests.  Quote, we've never done this before.  Apparently, the article says, here country duo georgia florida line turned atlanta georgia concert in the full-blown worship service when they invited a prominent christian singer songwriter who had become one of the really good they're really good buddies onto the stage.  and so basically florida georgia line one of the most popular country music bands of today invited chris tomlin onto the stage to lead them in how great is our god?  and another song.  let's see what that other song was and how great thou art on stage.  And so, ladies and gentlemen, everybody is celebrating this.  Fox News is celebrating this.  Even Glenn Beck is all over this saying this is a wonderful thing.  And even the comments of the article on Facebook are overwhelmingly positive.  Everybody's just loving this.  And They're so excited to see a country music duo and a contemporary Christian artist, singer, work together for the cause of Jesus Christ.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you, and I may be the only person on the internet who's going to say this, but this is blatant mockery of Christianity.  This is not how this works.  I keep referring to the Geico commercial.  That's not how this works.  That's not how it works.  That's not how any of this works.  That's not how any of this works.  And so, ladies and gentlemen, the problem with this is, is that this is just another example of the spirit of the age where people are trying to take secular and sacred and trying to merge it together and call it sacred when the truth is it is nothing of the sort.  And I've got biblical proof to prove this.  Let me just show you a few verses that I read even this morning in Galatians chapter 5.  The Bible says here in Galatians 5, 16, This I say, then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.  Verse 17, for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would.  And it goes through and talks about the works of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit and all that good stuff.  Verse 25, if we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit.  Okay, so basically, what does it say in verse 17?  It says that there's a spirit and there's a flesh, and these are contrary one to another.  For example, if you take two magnets, you put them together, they stick together.  But if you actually take one of those magnets and you flip it over, they won't stick.  They push apart from each other.  They push away from each other.  And ladies and gentlemen, spirit and flesh never, they never will do this right here.  If they do that, then one of them's not spirit and one of them's not flesh.  Okay, either one could be true.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I see Florida Georgia Line bringing Chris Tomlin on the stage and right in the middle of a raunchy, gross, sin-filled country music concert.  These people just plug Chris Tomlin right in the middle of it and then they transform it into a worship service.  I have biblical authority to question the legitimacy of that.  This is not how it works, ladies and gentlemen.  Now, I'm going to just give you some information about Florida Georgia Line.  I didn't know a whole lot about these guys, but just doing a little bit of quick research, I found out basically all I needed to know, okay?  Their most popular song is called.  This Is How We Roll.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would not even read the lyrics to you of this song, even on my YouTube channel.  This is raunchy.  This is X-rated stuff that these guys are singing.  They're singing about, you know... being dirty with your girlfriend and singing about making your drink a little bit stronger and and and all of that you know.  if you want to be a country music artist and you want to sing all that make millions of dollars.  god bless you.  this is america.  go do whatever you want.  just realize at the end of the road you're gonna have to stand before god with your life.  okay but I'm just appalled.  I'm appalled that these guys will get up and sing this stuff.  And Chris Tomlin's sitting out there in the audience just enjoying all that.  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you, most of the people that are in that place are drunk.  They're all drinking, and I don't know if Chris Tomlin was drinking.  There's no way for me to really say yay or nay on that.  But he is right in the middle of an absolute sin fest where they're talking about raunchy, illicit sex.  They're talking about drinking.  They're talking about good old boy stuff, you know, mud on your truck and whatever.  And then right in the middle of all of this just raunchiness, Chris Tomlin walks on stage.  And everybody in the crowd just goes, oh, how great is our God.  You know, and the truth is, many of the people that were singing that stuff had just downed three or four beers.  And then they're up there going, how great is our God, with a Bud Light buzz going on in their brain.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is mockery.  This is apostasy.  Ladies and gentlemen, God is not within a million miles of this stuff.  This is not who Jesus is.  Now, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Tomlin, but let's talk about the hypocrisy of the American South.  I'm from Atlanta.  I grew up in this culture.  I know these people.  I know what they think like.  I know what they are because I are one.  Okay, these people have a serious problem in that they have a cultural Christianity.  Now, for example, in India, the people that are trying to reach the Hindu people in India, they have a real problem because they're trying to teach people to take Jesus as their savior.  And I met one guy, he went there.  as a missionary years ago, and he'd try to get folks to take Jesus as their Savior, and he was seeing so many people take Jesus as their Savior, but he found out later that the Hindu mindset is that they worship multiple gods, and they're willing to take Jesus in addition to everything else that they have.  Okay, and that's the problem with all that.  And in a sense, the Southern culture of the United States of America has the same mindset in that, yeah, we love beer drinking.  We love, you know, all this raunchy stuff.  We love all that.  I mean, the country music of today is nothing more than just raunchy, raunchy, illicit, sexual, horrible things, okay?  We love that, and we love Jesus.  And truth is, ladies and gentlemen, if you really love Jesus, you can't really love that too.  You cannot, you cannot love beer drinking and, you know, whatever.  One night stands.  You can't love all that and love Christ at the same time.  It just doesn't work.  That's not how it works.  That's not how any of this works.  Flesh and spirit do not merge.  They're contrary one to the other, ladies and gentlemen.  And to try to merge them means that you have to make one of them not what they are.  This was not spirit.  This that I'm watching right here.  I'm watching this little video of Chris Tomlin up here singing, How Great Is Our God.  And I'm seeing hands being waved everywhere.  And these people, I guarantee you, half these people are drunk.  And they're singing, How Great Is Our God.  This is a mockery.  And ladies and gentlemen, this is just another example of the great apostasy that is taking place in America.  Secular and sacred are merging.  And literally, literally now, We are calling evil good, and there's going to be a terrible price to pay for that.  Ladies and gentlemen, I wrote a whole book on this subject, Calling Evil Good, The Live Christian Rock and Roll.  God gave me some insight into this years ago.  And I'm seeing more and more of it pan out as time goes on.  It's scary some of the things that God told me to put in this book that are even coming alive now.  And so, ladies and gentlemen, go ahead and go to Amazon and get this book.  The link will be provided below.  And this thing will help you, I promise you.
