But I've just done a video on Obama being over yesterday and meeting up with Merkel.  And it suddenly dawned on me, because Obama came over and spoke to the British people and encouraging them to vote to remain in Europe, it suddenly dawned on me that this man still has his dirty fingers in the British government.  Brexit situation.  And also Janice Carpenter talked about that May and Merkel had already done a deal.  So there are things going on behind the table.  So I've got various ones that I just want to share with you, which I think will make very interesting watching, because there is treason being done.  There are traitors in the House.  traitors within England.  That's quite clear.  Just as there have been traitors in America, invariably English traitors, but there are also English traitors in the British government.  And remember, behind much of all this is the Committee 300, who are really, that's part of the globalists, really, and wanting to create a one world order.  So this is why there is this battle royal going on, really between the banking system that has been running most things and the people who are standing up for democracy. ",

Our officials looked somewhat crescently.  Clearly the advice was to go for a higher line with Brexit.  And then subsequently, in a sense, the rest is history because the European Union then offered us that kind of Brexit.  President Tusk's offer on behalf of the Council included an advanced free trade agreement.  Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the only remaining possible model is a free trade agreement.  I propose that we aim for a trade agreement covering all sectors and with zero tariffs on goods.  Like other free trade agreements, it should address services.  Now, the reason I mention this is that the constant refrain throughout my time in government was this atmosphere of reluctance to leave.  And I think this is at the heart of of a better term.  I would call the governing class. ",

It is quite clear under the ministerial code, and I'm glad to see the Attorney General sitting here on the front bench, that the law officers must be consulted in good time before the government is committed to critical decisions involving legal considerations.  Now, even if I was prepared to concede, which I'm not, that it follows that the law officers don't necessarily have to divulge their opinions, though actually he's been obliged to do so by resolution of the House on the 4th of December in the past.  which the Prime Minister today and two days ago has resolutely refused to answer me, did the Prime Minister consult the law officers as a matter of fact?  I asked her and she refused twice.  The inference is that she did not.  Is this not misleading the House? ",

            "text": "That if you legislate in haste, then you will repent at leisure.  And that may well be the case for the Remainers.  with regard to the Act passed last night that attempts to prevent a no-deal Brexit.  Yesterday evening there was a lot of back-slapping and high-fives for Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin as the bill they sponsored and rammed through both Houses of Parliament in three sitting days was made law by Royal Assent last night.  The result was that the Cooper Act forced the Prime Minister to bring a motion to the House of Commons today to extend the Article 50 process to a specific date.  And in that motion, the PM has asked the Commons to order her to... But the date in the motion can be changed by amendments put forward by MPs and chosen for debate and voting on by the Speaker of the House.  On the face of it, you would be forgiven for thinking that it's game, set and match to the Remainers.  But it is not all that it seems.  Having read through the legislation itself and what the House of Lords Constitution Committee said about it, the Act may well prove to be quite toothless.  The first point is that the Act requires the Prime Minister to put the motion to the House on the day the Act became law or the day after.  That has been done, and as far as I can see, there are no other clauses in the Bill that requires her to repeat that exercise ever again.  Secondly, the Act only requires the PM to seek an extension.  It does not talk about negotiating or getting an extension at any cost or limited cost or anything like that at all.  Thirdly, any date that MPs vote for has to be an end date.  Amendments that try to make it an open extension are not allowed, as far as I can see, because of the wording of the Act itself.  Fourthly, there is no time limit imposed between the passing of any motion that forces her to go to Brussels with a date and when she actually does so.  She could just put it at the bottom of the in-tray.  Now, according to the House of Lords, the likely outcomes are... ",

            "text": "Or the EU could agree unconditionally to the extension.  In that case, the law's report says that the exit date in the Withdrawal Act could then be amended by statutory instrument, but the Cooper Act itself would once again then have no further application.  That is, it would not impose any further duties on the Prime Minister nor make any relevant further provision.  Or the EU could agree to the extension conditions on the UK for doing so.  In this case, once again, the Lords Committee says the bill would have no further application.  That is, it would not impose any further duties on the Prime Minister nor make any relevant further provision.  That means that because the Cooper Act only tells the PM to seek an extension, it does not say she has to negotiate or accept any conditions.  She could just say no.  and the final clauses that would have required the PM to become some sort of ping-pong player with offers and counter-offers of dates between Parliament and the EU Council have been removed.  That means that if the EU declined the date proposed by the UK, but made a counter-offer of a different date, then it seems to me that the Prime Minister would have no duty whatsoever put forward one single motion with an Article 50 extension date that can be amended by MPs.  This she has done.  So it seems to be a one-shot act.  Now MPs can amend that date to another date.  that must be an actual date and not open-ended.  But today our MPs were offered that option and actually chose not to change the date.  So after initial use, the Cooper Act appears to me to be redundant, as it has no further use apart from one clause that says any extension actually agreed cannot end before 22 May, the day before the EU elections.  The upshot from all of this is that the PM may be nowhere near as constrained by this Act as people, especially our MPs, think. ",
