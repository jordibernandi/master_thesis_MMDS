I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a Category 5.  I knew it existed, and I've seen some Category 4s.  You don't even see them that much, but a Category 5 is something that I don't know that I've ever even heard the term.  Well, we love the people of Florida and they went through something that I guess the likes of which we can really say nobody's ever seen before.  They've never seen a category like this coming because it came in really at a five.  It actually hit the keys with a, it was a category five.  I never even knew a category five existed.  Puerto Rico got hit with winds.  They say they've never seen winds like this anywhere.  Got hit as a five, category five storm, which just literally never happens.  But when you see 200 miles, and even more than that, 200 mile an hour winds hitting a place, and literally houses are just demolished.  It was like tornadoes.  It was like having hundreds of tornadoes, the winds.  So we've never seen it actually touched down as a category five.  People have never seen anything like that.  This has been the toughest one.  This has been a category five, which few people have ever even heard of.  a Category 5 hitting land, but it hit land, and boy, did it hit land.  But then they got hit dead center.  If you look at those maps by a Category 5, nobody's ever heard of a 5 hitting land.  Usually, by that time, it's dissipated.  I've just come from a stop at Tyndall Air Force Base where I saw the devastating effects of that Category 5 hurricane, Category 5.  Never heard about category fives before.  Category five is big stuff.  I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a category five.  A category five is something that I don't know that I've ever even heard the term. ",
