            "text": "Tony Bear, LAX, had a woman allegedly trying to steal luggage.  And she grabbed a woman's purse, allegedly.  And cops came quick.  They're talking to the victims.  It's an older white couple.  And she was hanging out in baggage claim here at American Airlines, 705.  We just saw... The cop with a handbag.  They're waiting on a female officer to search.  They're going to pay to be at 5150.  Busy day here, LAX.  I got to the scene, I saw some cops talking to the victims, and I saw some more cops with the handbag.  Cops were really nice here about me reporting.  They've gotten a lot better over the years.  That's LAX Air Force Police on the scene.  Leslie, a woman tried to steal their bag.  When I got to the scene, the cop appeared to have a handbag.  So I think she allegedly tried to steal the handbag.  They're calling the female officer to do the search.  He's a good cop here on the left.  He used to be TSA, now a LAX F4 police officer.  He's with the outreach program for the homeless.  He tries to find people to stay and get them the proper help.  But I don't believe she's homeless.  She looks young and scared at this point.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Okay, we're waiting on the female officer right now.  Been a busy day as far as crime-wise here at LAX.  You never know what you're going to get here.  But keep in mind, I said allegedly tried to steal a bag.  You want to always use the word allegedly because you don't know 100% on what happened.  I'm just going off the police radio and what I saw when I got to the scene.  A person is innocent before proven guilty.  We got the female cop showing up.  Search.  Thank you.  He's a good cop.  He makes people smile even though they're meeting under these weird conditions.  He's really fair with people.  He treats them as a human being, and that's the way he should be.  The LAX airport police have gotten a lot of training over the years and became a better police force, dealing with people as human beings.  That's the best way to be, to be a cop.  I know lots of cops that actually talk to me like a cop.  I don't appreciate it.  A lot of cops talk to me like a human being.  The best cop I knew was Commander Peters.  He retired.  He was the captain in Pacific, LAP Pacific Division.  Then went on to Westboro as a commander and retired.  I also believe they should have made him the police commander.  He's cheap.  Okay, she's being searched by a female officer.  Now she's marked.  She'll be put in a book.  And if she comes to the airport now, she'll be watched carefully. ",

The woman's laying on the woman's bathroom floor with abdominal pains.  So this is Secretary 51.  They're a new unit.  They go to the terminal on bicycles.  And they do a hell of a job.  This is the cops getting statements from the witnesses that allegedly seen a woman steal a handbag from the two travelers earlier.  I don't want to say no, I just want to speak.  Thank you.  That's probably her bag the cop was holding, so I guess it was luggage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  There's the sergeant supervisor.  He will approve the arrest.  All right, we're going to the perc walk.  All right.  These clowns trying to copy my style.  Disgusting.  This guy's a paparazzi, but yet he wants to steal my style.  I'm the only guy doing creepy, but now he wants to get in there.  What a joke.  This is the guy that Beaver ran over.  He's soon Beaver at this point.  Shouldn't be working.  Doesn't even know what's going on.  He sees me here.  All right, folks, that's a wrap.  Should we take it to 6th Division?  Are you serious?  Yeah.  How'd you do it? ",
