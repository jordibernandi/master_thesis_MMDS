See, the basic problem with the U.S.  economy is.  we have too much consumption and borrowing and not enough production and savings.  And what's going to happen is the American consumer is basically going to stop consuming and start rebuilding his savings, especially when he sees his home equity evaporate.  And when you have the economy, 70 percent consumption, you can't address those imbalances without a recession.  You know, rather than the recession being resisted, it should really be embraced because the disease is all this debt finance consumption.  The cure is that we stop consuming and start saving and producing again.  And that's a recession.  And sometimes, you know, medicine tastes bad, but you've got to swallow it.  Art Laffer, you hear him?  He says the consumer is going to slow down in order to rebuild the savings.  And you know that two-thirds of the American economy is driven by the consumer.
