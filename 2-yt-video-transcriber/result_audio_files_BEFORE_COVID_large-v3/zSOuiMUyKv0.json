            "text": "Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  You let her off with a warning today.  I appreciate that.  I want to let you know that I've been behind you for a while, and I got you on film with two unmarked lane changes.  So, I mean, I appreciate you not giving her a ticket, but I assume that, and thank you for observing Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but when you're out there, the badge doesn't give you extra rights, man.  I understand that some... You commit all guys, Josh, the accountability for all.  And today we're doing a little bit of cop watching in the city of Rentham, Massachusetts.  Now, I've been behind this officer for quite a while and he didn't use his directional.  So I wonder what he's pulling this citizen over for.  How's it going?  Not too bad.  How you doing?  Good.  Thanks.  So here's cruiser W9.  Now, like I said, hopefully he's not pulling over this motorist for an unmarked lane change because I do have him on video conducting an unmarked lane change as well.  Miss, are you okay?  Are you all right?  Okay.  So I'm going to see if the motorist will speak to us.  This is what we do.  Miss.  Miss.  Did he pull you over for directional?  What?  So we don't have her on video.  I don't want to get her on video, but I, you know, sometimes when I do this, it ends with, you know, them not getting a ticket.  We do have a flag code violation.  I don't remember the flag being gray and white.  It says Cruiser W9 of Rentham's Finest pulling over a citizen today.  I'm not sure what the cause of the stop being initiated is.  But I do hope it's not an unmarked lane change.  It would be extremely hypocritical for this officer to pull over another citizen for an unmarked lane change if he himself, when he didn't know no one was looking, committed the same infraction.  I wonder if he was wearing his seatbelt today.  Accountability for all is here to find out.  There's a camera, guys, so we got backup because of a camera.  So now we got backup for a camera.  See, they shoot bullets, I shoot frames per second.  Guys, we got backup for a camera.  That's why we do this.  So we got W6 here now.  So good, man.  Yeah, you name him.  Right now, I don't want to take you away from her safety.  She's all set.  That's beautiful.  No ticket today.  I mean, it would have definitely been hypocritical because I've been behind this officer for a while.  So I got him recorded on two unmarked lane changes and a seatbelt violation. ",

Would you do anything for me?  No, I just wanted your name and badge number.  The other thing was, though, are you aware of what flag code violation is, desecration of the flag?  No.  If a flag hits the ground, it's considered desecration.  If you burn it, flag code violation, it states that the flag has to have red, white, and blue, and the stars have to either represent the 13 original colonies or 50 states.  So having a blue line on your chest Thank you.  Having a blue line on your chest is actually a flag code violation.  Okay.  Okay?  Because you're wearing it in an official capacity.  I did not know that.  Yeah, I mean, I understand that you guys have, like, a brotherhood and you believe in what you do, and that's very important.  But if you were to fly that flag in the police station, that's how colonies seceded.  That's how wars started.  It's not an official flag.  It's considered desecration. ",
