And AWIA, which passed by Congress last fall, did not receive any money this year, but we're requesting $83 million for that.  And there's a number of different small grant programs in the new AWIA legislation.  So what we're trying to do is look to see, we know we've been successful in the SRFs, but in order to reach more smaller communities, we think some of the funding mechanisms and the AWEA legislation might be very helpful there.  So that's why we're asking for money for that legislation or for that new statute that was passed last fall.  So we're asking for $83 million for AWEA.  We asked for an increase over our budget request last year for WIFIA, and with the total amount of money available through the SRFs, we are looking at $80 billion, because every time we put money out through the SRF, it gets repaid.

Bernard Goldstein was the chair of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Board in the Reagan administration.  He was then appointed by President Reagan to be the head of EPA's Office of Research and Development.  And there are seven members of the Scientific Advisory Board, and he points out that they rely a lot on the scientific information provided by subcommittees to the board.  And then he writes, that's how it's supposed to work.  In other words, they're supposed to get input from the subcommittee experts.  But last October, Wheeler suddenly and high-handedly terminated the subcommittees, working to develop recommendations for the particulate standards, as well as the standard for ozone pollution, which is what this advisory board's going to review next.  And he says, for the first time, this advisory committee will lack a single epidemiologist.  So my question is why?  Why eliminate the panel of experts?  It seems to me it, you know, it looks like another step to eliminate outside independent expert opinion. ",

Part of the problem was having the subcommittees, which are not required under the statute, took a lot of time to go back and forth between the subcommittee and the full CASAC committee.  So we streamlined the CASAC review.  so we will get both of those reviews for ozone and PM done within the five years.
