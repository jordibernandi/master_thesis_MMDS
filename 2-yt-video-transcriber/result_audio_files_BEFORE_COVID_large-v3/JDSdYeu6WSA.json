If you can really complain about 6% GDP growth per year, it's difficult to complain about that when you're living in the United States where you have less than 3% GDP growth and much lower as we go forward with forecasts and projections.  But China certainly has seen a deceleration.  Also, Europe has been stymied.  With some pretty low growth and even inflation figures.  And that's caused recently the ECB back at the beginning of March to make a big U-turn.  They were just three months out of the gate from ending their last major round of monetary easing.  And then they announced a brand new one just at the beginning of March.  So they've started QE all over again, a new round of cheap loans to European banks. ",

            "text": "Well, there's no doubt.  I mean, we're in a super interconnected world today.  And the United States has been, you know, I think fairly insulated in some ways, especially since the Trump administration began, as we've been pulling back from some of our typical alliances.  The slowdown that we've seen in China, the slowdown we've seen in Europe, You know, it doesn't bode well for the United States.  But again, I think I think it all depends on what data you've been looking at here in the United States.  Things have not really been growing much at all.  I mean, as far as the economy goes, I think the main thing that, you know, economists can lie with numbers.  And I think that's really what's been happening here.  So here in the United States, there's been a lot of pointing at the stock market.  Right.  Look at the stock market go up.  It must mean that the economy is great.  We've also been pointing, we've seen the government pointing at the jobless figures and saying that's great.  But take a look at what happened to the yield curve just last Friday, where we saw this leading recession indicator flash a warning for the first time since 2007.  So we have very likely not only a slowdown in Europe, not only a slowdown in China, but But now economic reality setting here in the United States, which suggests that we are in for a recession at some point, maybe over the next three to 24 months.  However, the former Fed chair, Janet Yellen, recently stated when asked about this recently inverted yield curve, she was asked if this meant that we were going to see a recession here in the United States.  And she basically said, no, it means we're going to see a slashing of interest rates.  And I think that's what the Fed is going to do.  And in fact, if you take a look at the overall expectation of the rates going forward, I was looking at the federal funds futures rates over the weekend, and they actually suggested about a 60% of investors believe that we're actually going to see a rate cut in 2019, whereas in November of last year, that number was just Eleven percent.  In fact, it was even just a month ago.  It was just 11 percent.  So we've seen a massive shift in sentiment.  So, yeah, I mean, you know, Europe's Europe's not in a great shape, especially with Brexit.  What a basket case that is, where you have Britain who says, hey, let's leave the EU.  And then after they decide to do that, then they decide, well, we're not sure if we want to or not.  And how are they going to untangle themselves?  So, you know, we're really in flux.  I think for the average investor who is out there watching all of this, it's really good to be diversified now.  And it's certainly good to have a core position in precious metals because in this environment, they're going to be the primary beneficiary of all of these poor monetary and fiscal policies that are leading us on this road to, quite frankly, just to insolvency and to bankruptcy.  We have no plan to pay off all of these debts, Elijah.  In fact, we have a spending plan, but we don't have a debt repayment plan.  The Trump administration just released its budget for a better America, ironically, that showed that for the year 2020, fiscal year 2020, the Trump administration wants to spend $4.7 trillion for the whole fiscal year of 2020.  And $4.7 trillion, I think that's a lot of money for one year.  And They plan on taking in $3.6 trillion in revenue during that fiscal year, which means they're going to saddle the United States of America with another trillion-dollar deficit.  That's on top of the 2019 trillion-dollar deficit we already had.  That's in addition to the trillion-dollar deficit that they are projecting for 2021.  That's in addition to the trillion-dollar deficit the Trump administration is projecting for 2022.  They continue to saddle not only us but future generations of with excessive amounts of debt that they have no plan to pay this debt.  They have no plan to pay it off.  And they think they're going to keep cheap interest rates so that they're not going to have to, you know, worry about high interest payments and that all of this is completely a house of cards.  I wrote a book called Bankruptcy of Our Nation.  I meant it.  The United States is, you know, technically bankrupt because it cannot pay for what it has promised.  So either We're going to have to inflate our way out of this, which is what I expect that's going to happen.  We're certainly not going to pay off the debt.  That's for darn sure.  It's completely impossible.  So it's a pretty bad scene. ",

            "text": "Now, you mentioned the yield curve.  If you could expand on that a bit, how there's an inversion with the three-month treasury and the 10-year treasury.  Now, you've talked about on your YouTube channel, actually, how this has kind of been, in the past, has preceded a recession anywhere from about 12 to 24 months beforehand.  So do you think this is going to happen, that we're going to see a recession because we're seeing the signs of that?  Or will the Fed be able to maybe even lower interest rates and protect us from that? ",

            "text": "Yeah, that's the big question.  Yeah, so this yield curve inversion is pretty significant.  it's kind of a geeky thing to look at.  I mean, it's not something that people talk about all the time, but basically whenever you have a flood of demand for the long bonds, and that would be 10-year treasuries, even 30 years, but let's focus on the 10-year because that's what's in focus here.  The 10-year treasury, it finally dipped below the three-month treasury or the T-bill yield.  And the three-month yield is kind of considered the risk-free rate.  It's It's kind of considered \u2013 it's just a very, very important rate that many people turn to, and it's very attached to what the Federal Reserve is doing, the rates that it's setting.  And the fact that the 10-year yield \u2013 think about it, Elijah.  If you were going to loan somebody money for three months or you were going to loan them money for 10 years, which one would you expect to have a higher interest rate?  Well, obviously the one for 10 years because there's more risk involved.  I mean anything could happen.  And so the fact that that rate has fallen below the three-month rate is really quite staggering.  It's really quite staggering.  And the last time this happened was back in 2007.  And this inversion of the yield curve has preceded the last seven recessions in America.  So it's very predictive of a potential recession here.  The only caveat that should be mentioned is the fact that you know, it just fell below that rate.  That inversion has lasted now for a couple of days.  Typically, you want to see a period of about a quarter where you actually see that holding.  So the fact that it dipped below, we could get a knee-jerk move right back above that rate, and maybe it's just a blip on the screen.  But it appears to be staying.  It appears to be lingering.  And the primary reason is because the Federal Reserve has signaled that it's not going to raise rates anymore.  And much of the expansion that we have been perceiving here has been due to the fact that the Fed is going to raise rates again and again.  And that's why we've been seeing those rates kind of rising.  And so now in this new environment where the Fed has just totally changed its game, totally did a U-turn, now we're seeing those longer rates coming down.  And so, yes, it's It is possible that we will see a recession.  In fact, it's very, very likely based upon this event if it remains and lingers.  But again, as Janet Yellen had stated, this inverted yield curve doesn't necessarily mean we have to have a recession because the Fed can always cut rates.  And again, I think that's probably what's going to happen.  So we'll see if this recession indicator, which has proven to be correct the last seven times, will be correct again here.  Again, the Fed, we fully expect to step in, though. ",

            "text": "Well, they can first, you know, be thinking about diversification.  First of all, you know, one of the things that when I take a look at how we've kind of diversified our own investments, you know, we've really positioned ourselves for future trends.  You know, we expect China to continue growing at a much faster pace than the United States.  So, you know, China right now is the largest economy in the world.  based upon GDP on a PPP basis.  That is real, you know, real purchasing power.  You know, forget the nominal GDP that the U.S.  likes to use.  Instead, focus upon the actual real purchasing power.  And if you take a look at China, they are the largest economy, and they've been that way for five years.  And in the next, probably the next two to five years, they're going to surpass us on a nominal basis.  And that's whenever the majority of Americans are going to wake up.  That's when they're going to wake up and realize, hey, China really isn't going away.  China's been here for five, six thousand years and they still aren't going away.  And so what we have done is we've diversified.  We certainly have some exposure, not just to United States equities, but also outside, you know, emerging markets.  So I think first of all is to be a little less U.S.  centric in your mindset if you have a longer term time horizon.  Another thing you can do certainly is to diversify your income.  We've talked about that many times on your broadcast.  And I would encourage people who are out there listening to this to go to our website, followthemoney.com.  forward slash five levels.  And they're we have listed out the five levels of financial freedom that myself and my wife have used to break free financially.  Yeah, I used to work at a job I didn't like.  I used to live paycheck to paycheck.  I used to be in debt.  I used to live in the city and kind of live in a way that I really didn't want to live.  And over time, I've been able to escape the rat race.  I've been able to go out and buy my own piece of property with, you know, water supply on it.  I've been able to, you know, grow a garden, teach my children how to farm.  I'm trying to get off the grid, moving towards solar for energy.  We've got about ourselves about 75 percent off the grid now in our property.  And we've kind of moved out of the city.  And, you know, that's what we decided to do.  But we decided to take action for ourselves.  And we've shared.  on our website, exactly how we went about that.  follow the money.com forward slash five levels.

There's such a temptation to pay attention to all the press releases that are coming out and for you to pay attention to the corporate press releases and get outraged about something every single day.  And to take action would be to focus upon making sure that you have your plan in place.  Do you have a financial advisor?  Do you have a will?  Do you have guardianship for your kids?  Do you have insurance?  Are you properly insured?  Have you diversified your savings?  Do you have savings?  Do you have enough savings to get you by if something happens to you?  Do you have diversified investments?  Do you have diversified income?  Are you dependent upon one stream of income and only one stream?
