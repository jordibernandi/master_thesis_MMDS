            "text": "There's confusion because we don't agree on the definitions, and we haven't for a long time, and that has to be put on the table.  Otherwise, we don't know what it is we're in favor of or opposed to, and a lot of the conversation is confused in that way.  So here we go.  Very simple.  As we come toward the end of the first half of this program, we're going to give the definitions that we're then going to use in the second half to really tell the story.  So the first definition is this.  Capitalism is when enterprises are privately owned and operated.  They're owned by individuals or groups of individuals who set them up, own them, and run them.  Socialism, by contrast, in this definition, is when the government does that.  It's not private groups of people.  It's not private individuals.  It's officials of the government who own, who operate, who run the enterprise, or at least control it.  Okay, that's one definition.  Here's a second one.  Capitalism exchanges goods and services, both the resources that go into production and the products that come out of it, by means of market exchanges.  Capitalism is the free market where buyers and sellers confront each other and negotiate the terms of exchanging whatever any of them has to sell or has produced.  By contrast, socialism isn't the market system, it is the government planning and controlling and directing who gets what and who gives up what for what.  In other words, market versus planning, it's often called.  Those are definitions.  Here's another one.  Capitalism is when you organize production with a few people at the top making all the decisions.  the chief executive, the board of directors, and the vast mass of other people called employees doing what they're told.  Whereas socialism, the workers who do the work are themselves their own bosses.  Oh, that's a very different definition.  We're going to have to look at them because these different definitions are all cropping up without being dealt with as they really are.  Is it reasonable to think that capitalism is private enterprise and government taking over the enterprise is socialism.  And I would argue strongly with you that it is not.  Let me explain briefly.  In previous economic systems, we never reasoned like that.  If we saw in a slave economic system, whether it was in the pre-Civil War American South or any of the many other places in the world where slavery has existed often for centuries, If we see there, as we do, that there were sometimes private individuals who owned and worked slaves, whereas sometimes there were state groups, state entities, who owned and operated slaves, did we say that one was slavery and the other one was not?  No, we didn't.  Let me give another example.  In feudalism, where the division is between the lord who operates the land and the serf who works on it, were there governments that had serfs alongside of private individuals who had serfs?  Yes.  Did we say that?  therefore serfdom or feudalism, the name we gave that system, was somehow not there?  No, we didn't.  And I would argue the same logic applies to the capitalism versus socialism debate.  The fact that states either alongside or instead of private groups hire and employ workers doesn't end capitalism.  It is a strange argument that says because this relationship between employer and employee operates outside the state and inside the state, therefore one is capitalism and one is the opposite.  Uh-uh.  Makes no sense.  Isn't a reasonable way to go.  So then how about the other one?  Market versus planning.  The same problem.  Did slaves and feudal societies only deal with markets?  No.  Did they exclude markets?  No.  Slavery is famous for what?  The market in human beings.  They bought and sell people.  They bought and sell land,  etc.,  etc.  So the presence of a market way of distributing things versus a planned or organized way that exists in all of these systems and the presence or absence of it in the United States or in the world today is not, I would argue, a sign of the presence or absence of capitalism.  Shouldn't be part of the, quote, debate between capitalism and socialism.  Well then what ought it to be?  It ought to be about that third definition I gave you.  It ought to be about what distinguishes a capitalist system from, say, the predecessor systems of feudalism and slavery.  And that is the relationship between people in the act of producing the goods and services we all need. ",
