            "text": "Are you serious?  Are you serious, guys?  The walls of Jerusalem are falling.  Is this a sign that a Middle East peace deal is about to take place?  Is the walls falling a sign that God doesn't want his land parted, especially the city of Jerusalem?  This is a separation wall between East Jerusalem and the rest of Jerusalem.  And a flood came, breaking news on this, a flood came in East Jerusalem, washing away a large section of the wall.  Also, there was about 100 Palestinian school children that were actually trapped in a school due to flooding and many had to be rescued.  They're okay.  But this wall came down.  It was not the, it was, you know, you could say it's nature, but it's an act of God.  And it happened the same time.  Jared Kirshner is in the Middle East meeting with six nations about a Middle East peace deal.  Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates.  I mean, are you serious?  Something biblical is going on with these signs of the second coming of Christ.  This is the 70th year of Israel's a nation.  President Donald Trump declared Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel.  Then he moved the U.S.  embassy to Jerusalem and dedicated it on the 70th anniversary of Israel as a nation, on May 14, 2018.  We had the longest blood moon in the century over top of Jerusalem, July 27, 2018.  The red heifer was born a month later, first time in 2,000 years, approved by the Sanhedrin court, 2018.  The bomb of Gilead Farms received a letter from the Sanhedrin confirming that his incense that he'll be growing from his trees will be used for the dedication of the third temple.  He just got that in the fall of 2018.  A snake crawled out of the Western Wall, a sign to Jewish rabbi sages that the Messiah will soon come.  Another blood moon, the dedication of the stone altar for the temple, 2018.  Still all of this in the 70th year.  A blood moon, a super blood wolf moon over Washington in January of 2019.  Still a sign of Washington preparing the peace agreement, which I told you.  that's what this was, a warning.  I believe it was a warning to America and Israel.  Still in the 70th year.  And now floodwaters tearing down the dividing wall of East Jerusalem and the rest of the city by the hand of God.  What does the Bible say?  Bible tells us not to divide the land, but yet the Bible does say that there will be two nations and two manner of people are in the womb of Rebekah.  I mean, listen, here's the scripture, Genesis 25, 23.  So on one hand, God says, don't part my land.  But on the other hand, God had already prophesied this was going to happen.  Genesis 25, 23.  And the Lord said unto her, because she was struggling with the pregnancy.  Rebecca, married to Isaac, couldn't have a baby, finally conceives.  And then she's struggling with the pregnancy and she goes to the Lord and says, what is the problem here?  If I'm supposed to have this child, why am I struggling?  And the Lord answers her in these words in the King James Version Bible.  In Genesis 25, 23, and the Lord said unto her, two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels.  The one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger.  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  As the children struggled together within her, she gave birth to two nations and two manner of people.  Well, we have one nation, it's called Israel.  We don't have the Palestinian nation yet, although this seems to be coming and the water's breaking now.  It's like, is this a sign that the water's breaking?  That the birthing of a second nation is about to happen?  The wall is coming down in Jerusalem?  What does this mean?  And of course, if this agreement is signed, is it the covenant with many?  As it says in the Bible in Daniel 9, 27, in other words, many nations would be involved in this agreement.  But look, it's going to take a lot of nations, folks, not just the six that Kirshner's meeting with.  You know Egypt's involved.  Israel will be involved.  The Palestinian Authority will be involved.  The United States is certainly involved.  The British Empire will be there.  The Vatican will be there.  Jordan is who manages the Temple Mount.  They'll be there.  And others, believe me, Russia, are you serious?  Of course they'll be involved.  And Iran doesn't want anything to have anything to do with this.  And while all this is going on, let's just stay focused.  Many signs are happening.  You know, we've been, tomorrow we celebrate our ninth anniversary of doing online Bible prophecy, breaking news information, keeping people informed.  Over 13,000 videos that we do right here free.  We have never, I want you to understand this, we have never monetized one video on YouTube in nine years, never.  Now you might see sometimes somebody throws one up on me if I play a song and somebody claims the song, but it isn't me.  We do not monetize on YouTube.  We never have 13,000 videos.  Our ministry, which reaches the world, we send Bibles freely to people all over the world that need them.  We have two orphanages that we pay the rent on those facilities and help those children in India.  And we take care of the rent and help the children of another orphanage in Pakistan.  We reach out to people.  We hold crusades that we just did last year in India.  We hold conferences across the country.  And we preach in revivals.  Baptizing people all over the basic all over the world.  everything we do is based on the faithful partners of our ministry donations from our supporters people who support us.  Some of you are tithers.  Some of you are faithful contributors.  There's even a couple of different companies that help a little bit here and there along the way.  But at the end of the day, it's really you, the viewers.  And I'm gonna say that tomorrow, we do this every year now, tomorrow is our ninth anniversary.  I'll be back home in the Salvation Station tomorrow doing a live broadcast.  It's a special offering day tomorrow.
