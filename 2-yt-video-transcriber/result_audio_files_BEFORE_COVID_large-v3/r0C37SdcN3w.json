            "text": "Banks freezing accounts.  Let's have a look.  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Florian Heiser, and welcome to another episode of Heiser Says.  I've got my evening stein of coffee, and I hope you've had a good weekend.  I thought tonight we would have a look at this article written by Frank Chung from news.com.au, and it's about a Gold Coast tattoo artist, the owner of a tattoo parlor, whose bank accounts were frozen.  Now I have some serious concerns with banks actually being able to pick and choose who they provide services to.  We all have heard of many people due to political association where businesses have denied them service.  Here in Australia, overseas, there are lots of people, particularly on the more conservative side of politics, shall we say, that are banned from using any of these social justice value products or services.  And that I find quite disturbing, particularly now that we have this cash transaction ban already through the House of Reps and heading into the House of, well, into the Upper House and the Senate.  I mean, let's have a look at this situation and ask ourselves, do we trust the banks?  Do we trust them to not freeze people's accounts?  Because you don't, you know, first it's tattoo parlor people.  Then it's your political ideology, you know, or sorry, no, you voted the wrong way.  Oh no, your social credit score on Facebook is too low.  You can't have a bank account or we're limiting your transactions to $1,000 a month.  Yeah.  So, a Gold Coast tattoo artist says she was treated like a criminal and discriminated against by the Bank of Queensland after it froze all her accounts without warning.  So, they gave her no warning and froze all her accounts.  So, considering her a criminal, the bankers decided, nope, we don't want to have anything to do with tattoo artists or tattoo parlors.  So, they froze all her accounts just like that.  Bianca Rogensack was shocked by the move this week that left her suddenly unable to run her business or pay her suppliers.  But Bank of Queensland said the only error on its part was that it let her slip through the cracks when it changed its policies to ban tattoo parlors several years ago.  So it's letting her keep her accounts open for now.  Now, I was thinking about this because we've got the Anti-Discrimination Act here in Queensland.  And I was looking at the reasons why you cannot discriminate against someone.  If we have a scroll all the way down here, you have to preamble what it's about.  We have legislation in place that you can't discriminate against someone with the following attributes on their sex, their relationship status, their pregnancy, their parental status, their breastfeeding, their age, race impairment religious belief or religious activity political belief or activity trade union activity lawful sexual activity gender identity sexuality family responsibility association with or relation to a person identified on the basis of any of the above attributes.  So does this mean we're allowed to discriminate for people based on their employment or their type of business?  Because what this amounts to, the bank is indirectly discriminating against this lady by denying her access to a service because of the type of business that she was in.  Because there were some links for tattoo parlors to criminal activities and to bikie gangs years ago.  Now, is that fair?  Is that reasonable? ",
