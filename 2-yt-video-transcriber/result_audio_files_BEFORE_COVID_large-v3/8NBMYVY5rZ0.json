He has been fired for planting drugs in their cars in the state of Florida.  Now, this police officer's name is Zach Wester and an assistant state attorney named Christina Pumphrey actually started looking into him after what she says she noticed was His name was the arresting officer on a disproportionate number of drug arrests.  And specifically, she says she started investigating him.  And as she watched the body camera footage from Wester's arrest, Pumphrey grew concerned.  His vehicle searches were not always conducted legally, and his written affidavits didn't didn't always match what she saw in the video.  She also says that she noticed the people's reactions in these arrest videos, they were odd.  This is what she says, she says, it wasn't okay, crap, I'm busted.  She says it was, what do you mean?  And then Pumphrey began looking a little more closely into Wester's arrest.  So soon, he was pulled off patrol.  At this point though, here's the thing, there were more than 100 people who he had arrested at this time during his two years on the force.  Now, all of these people, some were still out on bond.  If their arrest had violated probation though, they were behind bars.  She says the state attorney's office didn't immediately move to drop the cases.  And at the time, she was getting an explicit instruction to not dismiss the cases, saying, I know these people are sitting in jail.  I know the particular charges they're in jail on.  They're either innocent of, based on the information I see, or there's no way I could take this in front of a jury.  But I'm being told, just let them sit in jail.  He was fired, this officer West was fired after Pumphrey uncovered this video.  It's a dash cam, a body cam, excuse me, video of when he pulled Theresa Odom over for a faulty brake light.  And take a look at this here.  He claimed to find meth in her trunk, but in the body cam video, you can see that he's hiding something in his hand.  I mean, you can take a look at it.  You're watching it there. ",
