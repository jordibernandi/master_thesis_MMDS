            "text": "What's up, everyone?  Matt Perino here, nyupsyracuse.com, coming to you from the Ad Pro Sports Training Center, where the Buffalo Bills just finished day one, well, actually day two of OTAs, but it's the first day that was open to the media, and we are... We're in the books here, the first practice.  It was an energetic one.  It was one where we got our first look at some of these new players that I think all Buffalo Bills fans were waiting to get a look at.  Mitch Morse was not one of them.  John Brown was not one of them.  Cole Beasley was.  TJ Yeldon, four guys right off the bat that are dealing with some injuries, some surgeries for Morse and Beasley, some abdominal core muscle things.  John Brown, it wasn't mentioned what happened to him, so we'll wait for next week to see what's going on with him.  But the big news coming out of today, Sean McDermott dropped a bomb at the start of \u2013 His press conference that Tyler Croft, tight end, the Bills signed him in free agency to a three-year deal, broke his foot yesterday on the first day of OTAs.  Kind of a blow for the Bills, you know, trying to remake that room quite a bit.  And they go out and bring in a guy like Tyler Croft, who by most accounts is going to be the starter in this room, and he's now off the board.  But, you know, we want to talk about, you know, opportunity and the next man up.  You look at a guy like Dawson Knox, rookie tight end from Ole Miss.  The Bills took him in the third round.  He's going to get a lot of first team snaps and I think that it's going to be good for players like him.  Jason Kroom, who's going to want another look this summer and Tommy Sweeney, seventh round draft pick, tight end.  They'll get more of a look because of that.  I want to take your questions.  Again, if you're just hopping in, Matt Perino, nyupsyracuse.com.  We got you covered with the bills.  We are out here today watching practice, talked to a bunch of guys, talked to Josh Allen, Zay Jones.  Jerry Hughes spoke about his contract extension.  We can cover all of that.  Take your questions, whatever you guys got.  I had a few points.  If you head on over to nyupsyracuse.com right now, You can check out my takeaways, what we've learned from today.  Those are up on the website.  But I wanted to talk about Josh Allen.  I wanted to talk about, this was, a lot's been made about.  This is his team now, and he's gonna step up into more of a leadership role, and you saw that on the field.  You saw that in the way that he carried himself in here today.  You saw most of that at the end of last year, but the confidence seems there, and something that really stuck out to me from him, when he was talking to the media was the comfort level that he has and the confidence that he has now that he's been in the system.  He's gone through a year playing in this system.  He's learned from Brian Dable.  They've built a rapport.  And now he is going into year two as, you know, one of the guys in the room that, you know, has been through this dance before, has learned this playbooks.  He knows what his wide receivers do well and what they maybe don't do so well.  He even mentioned that in the press conference that, you know, he's going to work on things that he's interested in or that he's comfortable with with these receivers.  And I think that you saw that.  One of the big things that, you know, the knocks on Josh Allen is that short to intermediate passing game, right?  That's where he struggled at times last year.  Well, you look at today and, you know, you look at practice, and I think it foreshadowed what we're going to see a lot this summer throughout minicamp and then into training camp is \u2013 Josh Allen working on that short game, those easy plays, some that he kind of left on the field last year because I think that that's where he has the most room to grow.  He mentioned it today.  He thinks that's going to be something that's continuing to get better and better as he goes along.  You're seeing that there's a commitment to developing that part of his game and you got guys in camp Isaiah McKenzie Cole Beasley didn't practice today, but he'll be out there.  Nick Easley David Sills guys that are you know Maybe smaller speedier receivers that you want to get them the ball in space so they can make some plays along with a LaShawn McCoy a Devin Singletary, which we could talk about in a little bit, but I came away today very impressed with Josh Allen.  As I've been for the most part throughout his rookie season and into this year, I think that he understands what he has to do and what he has to improve on, and he's set on doing that and getting better.  So it's going to be fun to watch that as this period of Phase 3 of off-season workouts continues on into training camp.  Another guy I was able to talk to today was Zay Jones.  Going into this period, we put up some stuff on the website about who is the number one receiver of this team.  You bring in a guy like John Brown, a speedy outside threat that has been a number one before.  He was brought into Baltimore last year and by most accounts was their number one, especially early on in the season when he developed a bit of a rapport with Joe Flacco.  And then you ask yourself, what does that do for Zay Jones?  But he was the first guy in team drills.  uh... or individual drills and then he was for the most part that number one guy in uh... in the team drills as well.  So I think that we may have a situation here that whereas many fans may not view Zay Jones as the number one on this team, I think he could be the number one.  And there's a confidence about Zay Jones.  You dial it back to last year in training camp when he missed all of OTAs, when he was dealing with the off the field issues, the hotel room incident, the injury and the surgery and then the rehab.  He didn't get back until a week or two into training camp.  He's here.  He's working.  He's building confidence.  He's getting better.  He's more physically ready for the season.  He's added some weight.  He's added some bulk to his build.  And I think that we could be in store for a significant jump in production from Zay Jones, along with all... of the help that's been put around him and Josh Allen in this offense, I think that could open up things for Zay Jones, and he won't necessarily be the number one target on a lot of teams when it comes to game planning against the Bills.  I think that he can get some things done.  Gary says Zay to me is number one, and we'll show it this year.  He looked so good the last five or six games last season.  And Gary, I'm right there with you.  I mean, you take those two Miami Dolphins games, Obviously, not the toughest competition, but he soared in those games, and you want your best players to play well against your division rivals, teams that you have to play twice a year, and he looked great in those games.  He played strong down the stretch, and he's trying to build on that, and I think that's the storyline around everything that's going on with this team.  Also wanted to talk about the running back room.  Guys, I gotta tell you, I'm very impressed with Devin Singletary.  Let me preface this by saying, listen, these guys are practicing without pads, in shorts, the physicality isn't really there, but the traits that Brandon Bean talked about after Devin Singletary was drafted, the elusiveness, the decision making, the vision in the hole, that's all been on display already.  He popped a really nice run today, getting between the tackles, even eliciting a handshake from LaShawn McCoy on the sideline.  A LaShawn McCoy that made some news for the fact that he didn't really congratulate Devin Singletary, and it made people wonder.  He didn't talk today.  It made people wonder, what's his thoughts on the Bills drafting a running back in the third round?  He wants to be the guy still.  He thinks he still has that in him to be the guy.  That dynamic is going to be very interesting.  Frank Gore was brought in this room.  Josh Allen spoke today that Frank Gore got out before the entire team and talked about his experience in the league.  This is a future Hall of Famer that all of a sudden now is in that locker room with LeSean McCoy, who was a captain last year and supposedly the leader in that room.  I think the dynamic of this running back room is very interesting.  And then you have TJ Yeldon in the mix, a dual threat running back who's known for his ability to receive, for his receiving ability out of the backfield.  And that's going to be important for Josh Allen on this offense.  Brian Dable's going to have to dial up some stuff to get these running backs involved in the passing game because I think that they were underutilized in 2018.  I thought that LaShawn McCoy and Marcus Murphy, who was third on the depth chart, when he was in the game, I would have liked to see them more involved in the passing game.  You saw LaShawn McCoy out wide a few times today.  I think that's a formation that Brian Dable is going to lean on, and you've got to get the ball to your playmakers.  Allen knows that.  These running backs know that, and this is a rebuilt offensive line group that's hopefully going to get the running game going, which will allow the passing game to open up a little bit for these running backs.  Interesting alignments today on the offensive line for anybody that would like to know.  Gary, before I get to that, Gary mentions, should the Bills trade for Kyle Rudolph with Croft Hurt?  What do you think?  I think we can get him.  Yeah, it's very interesting.  Listen, I think Tyler Croft will probably be back at some point early in the season if he's not ready for the opener.  But he had the same injury last year, and this is definitely concerning.  The Bills spent a high draft pick, a third round pick on Dawson Knox.  They gave up two fourth round picks.  But he's a developmental prospect.  He's a guy that didn't really produce on the college level.  They like the intangibles.  They like the speed, the quickness, the athleticism.  The route running needs to be developed a bit.  I think his ability at the catch point has to be developed a little bit.  But you saw in practice today, he made a couple grabs.  The speed, the way he bursts into his, you know, his cuts and, you know, the athleticism is evident.  So I think that they like Dawson Knox, but to your point, do they feel confident in potentially Dawson Knox, Lee Smith combination going into the season?  Jason Kroon could get involved if he, if he plays well in camp, which he did last year and in the preseason.  So yeah, I think it's interesting.  I think it would come down to what you have to give up.  Rudolph, a guy that is probably on the second half of his career in terms of production.  The numbers haven't really popped the last couple, but if you can get him for a late-round pick, throw him into the mix, it'll depend on what this regime, Brandon Bean, Sean McDermott, what they feel about this roster and how close they are.  If they make a deal for a Kyle Rudolph, a proven playmaker, a guy that can come in here and bring some leadership and some experience, I think that's an interesting prospect.  But I think it might also depend on the progression of a Dawson Knox, a Tommy Sweeney.  who had kind of a rough day today.  There was one play over the middle where he was stripped by Maurice Alexander, new linebacker, depth guy, probably more of a special teams player.  You hate to see that for some of these younger prospects that are coming in here for the first time around NFL talent.  Ed Oliver got his first go at things today and had a little bit of a scuffle with Spencer Long who was playing right guard.  They were throwing some double teams at Oliver in the team drills.  One play in particular.  he didn't like how long Spencer Long held up his block and they got into a little bit of an exchange after.  Spencer went back to the Gary mentioned, love Knox's upside.  Is he signed yet?  No, he is not signed yet.  A lot of these third-round picks, they're taking a little bit longer, but he is here.  He is taking part in OTAs and minicamps, so it would be good to track his progress, and I'm sure that they'll be worked out at some point.  But, you know, back to Ed Oliver, after the skirmish, you know, he kind of stayed, you know, stood his ground as Spencer Long went back to the huddle and started barking at him.  a There was a lot of chit-chat out there today, you know, back and forth between the offense and the defense.  Josh Allen, you know, a guy who has this very cool persona.  He loves to yuck it up in there.  He loves to talk trash.  You see the way that he gets up in the defense's face in games.  And there's going to be some of that playful stuff and some of that competitive stuff throughout the summer.  And you saw that today.  There was one play, new cornerback Kevin Johnson.  have that on here as well that I want to talk about.  that cornerback number two job.  Levi Wallace lined up at the number two cornerback spot with the first team but Kevin Johnson really really played well showed well again in practice.  no pads but he made an interception almost had another one and he was active today.  he brought an energy to that to that defensive backfield and There was one point where he kind of put his finger up a little bit, waved it, I think it was in Robert Foster's face after a breakup.  And you could see LaShawn McCoy come out on the field, Zay Jones came out on the field to kind of talk some stuff with him, maybe even tell him to back it off a little bit.  But there's definitely an energy around that field.  I wanted to go live on Facebook because I wanted to bring that to you guys a little bit.  What I witnessed today on the practice field and in the facility, there's definitely... you know, an energy and there's an expectation around this team to be good.  And I think that there is real belief and confidence from the coaching staff throughout the, you know, the locker room and on this roster that there's a belief that this team could be good this year.  And then that's exciting.  I mean, you go back to the early parts of last season, that Baltimore game sticks out and going on the road after, you know, the long training camp and the 47 to three, or I think it was the final.  And hope was bleak.  I mean, there wasn't a ton of it.  And now you go into a summer and an off-season, kind of in the books now, what Brandon Bean's been able to do, and there's a lot of excitement.  There's a lot of things to look forward to.  And one of the biggest things to look forward to, in my opinion, I wrote it in the description here, my most improved player, top candidate, is Tremaine Edmonds.  I mean, man... We all marveled at him on the practice field last year throughout training camp and then throughout the season.  He's so tall and he's so overwhelming.  He just looks like he's completely settled into his role, his job.  You go back to last season, he was really learning the middle linebacker position after playing on the outside in college, and it seems like as a guy that his coaching staff has been adamant that he is dedicated to the game learning his playbook learning how the position.  and you're seeing that you're seeing that transformation that transition into a confident player with just crazy intangibles a crazy skill set the athleticism the speed the way he's able to go sideline to sideline is unbelievable.  um i i i think tremaine edmonds is going to be a a real impact player playing behind.  you know an improved defensive line with ed oliver there.  A lot more disruptive in the interior defensive line.  I think that it's going to be interesting to see how all of these guys play off of each other and what kinds of improvements in their own games they're able to have because of the guys playing around them now.  Matt Milano was back on the field as well after the long rehab from the broken fibula at the end of last season.  He looked great.  He looked in great spirits.  So much stuff here, guys.
