            "text": "As of April of this year, Facebook has banned from its platform all expressions of white nationalism.  Under this new policy, if you make statements such as, I am a proud white nationalist, your post will be deleted and your account could be permanently banned.  But what is white nationalism?  Facebook hasn't actually defined what they mean by that term.  So what is this ideology which we are not allowed to express?  I'll tell you what it is.  My name is George Hutchison.  I'm a white nationalist.  I didn't come to know white nationalism because of something I saw on Facebook or a meme I saw on Instagram.  I came to know white nationalism because I spent half a decade in university studying race relations at one of the most left-leaning universities in Canada.  The part of university that had the biggest impact on me was just discovering how much animosity there is towards white people in modern academia.  Arguments like how all white people are racist, only white people can be racist, white people invented racism, white people are privileged, white people are fragile, Canada and the United States are white supremacist countries.  Over the years of study sitting in those lecture halls, I couldn't help but wonder to myself, what impact are these kinds of messages having on the non-white students sitting to the right and the left of me?  How do these ideas make them feel about white people?  It's not difficult to see how statements such as, all white people are racist, can inspire towards white people feelings of animosity and resentment.  Under the Canadian Criminal Code, statements which incite hatred towards an identifiable group are classified as hate speech.  And the ideas which are propagated about white people in our universities easily conform to that definition.  My concern about the ideas that are being taught about white people in our universities is further exacerbated by the demographic changes that are taking place here in Canada and across the Western world.  A process by which white people are rapidly becoming a minority.  What is the future going to look like when white people have become a small, democratically disempowered minority in countries where our universities are teaching people things like, all white people are racist?  I'm concerned that the convergence of these factors is going to create conditions that threaten our culture, our political autonomy, and our physical safety.  It's with those ideas in mind that I come to a conclusion which I think is reasonable and intuitive, which is that if people in positions of power are inciting animosity and resentment towards us, then white people need to start standing up for ourselves.  That might take the form of articulating the counter-arguments to the hate speech that's being propagated against us in our universities.  or if it's the case that we are skeptical about the viability of mass immigration and multiculturalism, then we need to express those concerns and democratically pursue political solutions that align with our perceived political interests.  But however we go about it, in principle, we need to stand up for ourselves.  Then I discovered that, oh, there's a name for this type of thinking, this idea of standing up for your people, asserting, protecting, defending, advancing their political interests.  And that name is nationalism.  Random House dictionary defines nationalism as the policy or doctrine of asserting the interests of one's own nation.  Today we often use the word nation in the sense of a country, like the nation of Canada or the American nation.  But traditionally, nation doesn't mean country.  Nation means ethnic group.  Random House defines nation as a group of people of the same ethnic family.  We Europeans, or white people, are a group of people of the same ethnic family.  We share common lineage and common descent, and in that sense, we are a nation.  So if nationalism means to stand up for your nation, and a nation is a group of people of the same ethnicity, then nationalism simply means to stand up for your people or for your ethnic group.  White nationalism means to stand up for white people.  The oppression of white nationalism, therefore, is the oppression of white people.  It is an attack on the very notion of white people standing up for ourselves in principle.  And in our increasingly globalized and ethnically diverse societies, where identity politics is becoming an ever more prominent component of everyday discourse, to oppress white nationalism means to deny to white people self-interested participation in modern political and intellectual life.  And that's exactly what Facebook is doing with this new censorship policy.  Under this new policy, it is apparently not against the rules to discuss identity politics, but it is against the rules for white people to express our self-interested perspective on identity politics.  Under this policy, it is apparently not against the rules to intellectually attack white people by calling us fragile or privileged or to say things like, all white people are racist, but it is against the rules for us to intellectually stand up for ourselves in response to those attacks.  Facebook's new policy apparently has no effect on the nationalist organizations of other ethnic groups.  For example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, etc.  Facebook has been very clear and explicit that this new policy discriminates exclusively against the nationalism of white people.  This is an indisputable example of racial discrimination.  And that's why we are suing Facebook.  The Ontario Human Rights Code guarantees that every person in Ontario has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour or ethnic origin.  And Facebook's new policy is a clear violation of that guarantee.  This new policy marks a significant milestone in the history of race relations because it is an explicit example of racial discrimination against white people by a major corporation and media platform.  Through this action, Facebook has vindicated the concerns of white nationalists and demonstrated that our movement is indeed necessary.  Furthermore, the implementation of this policy deals a significant blow to proponents of mass immigration and multiculturalism by demonstrating to white people that the promise of a peaceful multicultural society is not coming to fruition and that our future as a minority could be one of censorship and oppression.  Because this video is itself a violation of Facebook's policy, we expect that it will be deleted and that our account will be banned.
