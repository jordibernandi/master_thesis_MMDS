            "text": "I learned we all need a pep talk.  I think we all need pep talk.  I think we all need pep talk.  You, we need you.  Now, I'm not trying to sound needy, but I'm just saying, we need you.  We need every voice, little voices, shaky voices, any voice looking to spread love.  We need the young, we need the people who might have forgotten what it's like to be young.  We need the hopeful, we need the hopeless, the usual, and the unusual, because we can't handle any more business as usual.  We posted a video on the internet.  Brad wrote a pep talk, well, because he needed a pep talk.  I know what it's like to need a pep talk, so I delivered it.  We put it online and realized lots of other people need a pep talk.  Teachers, parents, kids, Beyonce, people who aren't Beyonce, more people than I even knew existed.  There are people all around you who need reminding, to laugh, To dance.  We can remind each other of all the reasons there are to dance.  And there's lots of reasons to dance.  I mean, if you're looking for them.  So look for them.  Because your dance moves, they're needed.  Even if they're awkward.  Especially if they're awkward.  Your joy, it's needed.  We are little reminders to each other to stay unusual.  Whether you're Michael Jordan and you were in Space Jam, or if you're just somebody who's watched Space Jam.  A lot guilty.  You are needed.  There are people all around you who need reminding.  And you, you can let them know.  We can help each other roll on when we can't do things on our own.  If this journey has taught us anything, it's taught us that.  The little words created out big love that can go a long way.  So here's to love.  Here's to throwing parades for each other.  Parties that cheer each other on.  wise friends to light the way.  We need reminders that amazing things can happen because they do, all the time.  And one of them is you.  We can brighten up every room we enter, every place we go in the entire world, but only if we take care of each other.  Together, we're unstoppable.  So we've got to stop stopping each other from being unstoppable.  That makes sense, right?  What I'm trying to say is that we've got too much goodness to be spreading.  Pep talks are nice, but they're not a one-time thing.  We all need them again from time to time because people grow.  Days pass, times change, challenges come, and we all need little reminders that we're here, reminders why we're here.  The most amazing thing is the fact that we're here together right now.  One chapter may be ending, but there's a whole big story that we're telling together.  So we'll keep pep-talking, and we hope you will too.  Sometimes it'll be seen, sometimes it won't, but it always matters.  Believe me, I know.  Because love, love changes everything.  So let's fill the world with it.  Thank you.  To all of you, thank you for everything.  We dedicate this video to my nieces and nephews.  Back when we started all this, they haven't even been born.  I'm excited to share them with all that I've learned, and I still got to learn. ",
