And there's obviously... I've talked to several people who say there's clearly ties with... with the CIA and this global sex trafficking ring of like, I don't know, ruling elites.  It sounds pretty horrifying and spreads pretty wide.  Your experience with the CIA, what do you think of this?  I mean, first of all, I don't think he killed himself at all.  I think either somebody killed him, one of the powerful people that's in his black book, or the CIA extracted him.  I don't know.  What do you think? ",

            "text": "The day that he died, a friend of mine at the CIA called me and he said, this has to be the Israelis, right?  And I said, that was the first thing that came to my mind.  This has to be the Israelis.  I'll give the Israelis credit.  They are really, really good spies.  Really good.  You know, my first week in the CIA, we had a briefing by the director of security.  And he gave a talk about counterintelligence.  That is, is foreign countries having spies in the United States.  Now, we have liaison relationships with dozens and dozens of countries, and they are what's called declared, where they come to the United States, they work in their country's embassy in Washington, and they are declared to the CIA as intelligence officers.  So in the Israeli embassy in Washington, there's a Mossad officer, and there's a Shin Bet officer, and they officially do liaison with the intelligence community.  But the security director told us, There are those two declared Israeli officers.  The FBI has been able to identify 187 undeclared Israeli intelligence officers all around the United States, stealing secrets every single day.  One of the things that the Israelis are really good at is influence operations.  Now, in part, it's because they have a natural constituency in many countries.  Jewish Americans or evangelical Christians who are pro-Israel.  They're predisposed to helping Israel in the first place.  But that's not always good enough, especially if you're an intelligence service.  So what a good intelligence service would do would be to sit with your operations officers around a table and say, how do we get to the very top of the pyramid in this country, to the very top of the political leadership.  We need an access agent.  So who is out there?  who knows presidents of both parties, cabinet members of both parties, members of Congress, prominent bankers, people in entertainment?  How about this guy, Jeffrey Epstein?  So we can fund him.  We can finance him.  We can introduce him to some business opportunities to make sure that he has an income that's great enough that he doesn't have to just rely on us.  But we recruit him and we get him to introduce us or to give us access to all of these important people.  Well, you look at Jeffrey Epstein's black book and these people don't get any more important.  You've got the Clintons, you have the Trumps, you have Prince, what's his face?  The UK.  You've got leaders in entertainment and business and banking and investments and real estate.  I mean, everybody who's anybody was in that black book.  That's an intelligence goldmine.  That puts whoever recruited him right at the seat of power.  So who would have or what organization would have the wherewithal to do something like that?  The Russians are good, but they're not that good.  The Chinese aren't interested in that kind of thing.  All they care about is science and technology.  And for all intents and purposes, that really only leaves the Israelis.  So I believe from the very beginning this was an Israeli intelligence operation, and it went bad.  And it went bad because he was a deeply flawed individual.  He was a pedophile, and he was a sex addict, and he had a way of just getting himself in Now, you can get yourself out of trouble once, maybe, which he did in whatever it was, 2006.  But he just couldn't stop.  He couldn't stop himself.  And he got in over his head. ",

            "text": "Yeah.  Two years ago, I gave a speech at a, at a peace conference at American university.  It was a speech about ethics, ethics and intelligence operations.  And my main point was if you are a CIA officer or you want to become a CIA officer, you have to enter into that job with your own personal set of morals and ethics because ethics are not taught ever under any circumstances.  There are no training courses that are going to teach you right from wrong or what's ethical and what's not ethical.  And so as part of the speech, I asked a hypothetical question.  I said, let's say you're a CIA case officer, an operations officer, and you've recruited a penetration of a foreign terrorist group, whatever you want, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, it makes no difference.  And you meet with this source every month in a hotel somewhere in the Middle East, and this guy has proven to be the real deal, right?  He's given you actionable information that you have used to disrupt attacks and save lives.  So you know that this guy is the real McCoy.  You've vetted him, and he always tells you the truth.  So you go to meet with him one night in Cairo, let's say.  And he says to you, look, I've been good to you.  I give you everything you ask for.  I always tell you the truth.  Now you're going to do something for me.  You're going to go out, and you're going to get me a prostitute.  I say, let me see a show of hands.  How many people would actually go out there and get him a prostitute?  And usually about three quarters, maybe 80% put their hands up.  And I say, the answer is yes.  You would go out and you would get him a prostitute.  It's not nice.  It's kind of scumbaggery.  But your job is to deal with scumbags like this.  It's for the good of the country.  You would go out and get him a prostitute.  What if he asks you for a child prostitute?  And everybody kind of, you know, gasps.  Maybe once in a while somebody will gingerly put his hand up and I say, absolutely not.  Not under any circumstances.  This is a child, for God's sake.  I said, if you don't know right from wrong at this point in life, then you're a sociopath and you need to find a different line of work.  And I said, the problem, though, is that nobody at the CIA is going to tell you no.  Nobody's going to say, you know what, that's not cool.  We've got to draw the line somewhere.  Nobody's going to say that because they want the information.  They want the recruitment.  Your job is to break the law anyway.  You're not doing it in the United States.  Yeah, it's a terrible world we live in, but, you know, blah, blah, blah.  But the answer is no, not under any circumstances.  And then somebody in the audience, for whatever reason, ran home.  and wrote an article that John Kiriakou confirmed that the CIA procures children for their sources.  Right.  And that's not at all what I do. ",

So that's possible, but unlikely, because the FBI, they all have sticks up their ass about following the law.
