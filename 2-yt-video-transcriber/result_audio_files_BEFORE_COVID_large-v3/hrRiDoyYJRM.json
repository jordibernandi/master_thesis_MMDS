I don't know.  But before we play this clip, which I will play in its entirety, I just wanted to say that there's some criticism of me on the channel of my commentary.  One of the biggest videos I have, it's just.  I didn't talk in the video, so I didn't really explain myself very well.  And then I started doing that, and then people was like, well, just play the clip.  So what I'm going to try to do to help find a nice middle road is I'll play the clip in its entirety during the first part of the video, and then I'll talk about it and give my opinions afterwards.  But make no mistake, this is my channel, and I will give my opinions.  You don't have to like it.  You don't have to agree with it.  But I will give my thoughts.  I will think what I think.  And you're more than inclined to... to not like that.  You know what I mean?  It's fine.  It's cool.  I don't care.  And I encourage debate in the comment section because I'm in there debating with you guys.  And it's cool.  It's a great time.  Anyways, let's go ahead and roll this clip.

            "text": "All right, guys.  So this is where my opinion comes in, and I'm going to lay it on hard here.  If you wanted corporate media, if you wanted a better take on corporate media, look no further than this interview right here.  I mean, good Lord.  It starts out by saying, who are normal people?  What do you mean?  who are normal people?  Some of those people watch your show, misinformed people, but really that just shows that they're speaking to people in power.  They're speaking to the corporations.  They're not speaking to normal people, this mainstream media.  Who are normal people?  I understand she's setting it up for him to explain a little bit about his book, but just the way you say that, who are normal people, like... People know who are normal people, and they all agree with Andrew Yang, just like he's saying.  And then she says, what, like, government can't stop places from closing, jobs from going down.  Yes, they can.  Yes, they most certainly can.  if corporations are paying zero-end taxes and soaking up millions of revenue from Americans, then they take those jobs, which have got them that far, and they move overseas and close plants in America, that can be stopped.  And have you ever heard of the thing called the New Deal?  FDR did that.  That was also kind of stopping places from closing.  They literally gave federal money to corporations and said, hey, make tanks.  We're in wartime.  Here's some money, make some tanks, hire some people.  Excuse me?  It feels like every time I watch MSNBC now, it feels like it's right-wing.  You know what I mean?  It feels like it's Fox News challenging Andrew Yang, but anybody else is in that position.  whenever they're talking to somebody.  Pete Buttigieg is not... they're softball questions.  you know it's and it's.  oh i will give her props for not bringing up the white supremacy thing that i'm more than happy about that.  shout out to her for that.  that's good journalism because you know if somebody disavows something like that you know multiple times you don't keep bringing it up that's you're just trying to smear them.  at that point you want to keep the populace thinking about that about that person.  it's obvious.  um and they said that uh like about the malls.  when she talks about the malls, it makes no sense.  Um, because why would you want any place to close?  Like, well, people aren't buying stuff in there.  It's because of Amazon and that's fine.  We like Amazon.  We want to keep Amazon.  But what he's trying to say is the money that's going out of the community and never going back in.  Cause it's not like even if Amazon paid their fair share in taxes, which this country would be a completely different place.  If all the corporations paid their fair share in taxes, um, that look, If no money that the community that the community spends on Amazon goes back into that community directly or indirectly, they pay zero in taxes.  So none of that money gets floated back to the people.  And that's just it.  They don't do nothing.  They say, oh, we're going to open up a packaging factory and we're going to hire 14 people.  Well, whoop-dee-doo, that just puts so much money in all the millions that you've raped from each community.  That's all he's saying is we've got to take this money that's going out of the community and put it back into the community.  Because if Amazon wasn't there, they'd be spending that money in the community.  It would circulate within that community.  It's not that.  It's just money is being absorbed and going straight to the top.  That's exactly how it is.  It's being circumvented.  There's no \u2013 it's \u2013 It's obvious.  It's obvious.  And I'm glad that she actually brought that question up because it gives him another chance to just explain that people do understand that Amazon and all these other places pay zero in taxes.  They pay zero.  We pay 30 percent, sometimes more.  And then my favorite part, my favorite part.  Andrew Yang laughs in her face when she says politicians are trying to get reelected.  Yes, they're trying to get reelected.  So they lie to the American people time and time again.  We're going to help.  We're going to help.  We're going to help.  And then they turn around and go to a billionaire and go, oh, please give me some campaign money, more campaign money than my opponent so I can put your policies in place and do none of the \u2013 put all of the policies that they promised the American people on the back burner to what?  \u2013 because if I'm a billionaire and I give somebody money that I support, I support him for a reason.  And I'm giving him all that money because I think he's going to do what I want.  Why do I, as an American citizen, not a corporation, but an American citizen, support Andrew Yang?  Because I think he's going to do what I want.  I think he's going to enact the policies that I want.  So if I'm a billionaire, a corporate billionaire, and I go to, say, Mitch McConnell, and I say, hey, Mitch, here's $300 million.  Oh, and by the way, I'm pro-whatever.  Mitch McConnell is going to all of a sudden be pro-whatever because he just got paid $300 million.  So it's just how it works.  This is corporate media.  They're really all trying to smear Andrew Yang.  You can disagree with that if you want, but it's obvious.  It's obvious.  And they're doing it subtly.  They're doing it nicely.  They're not as doing it as what they did to Bernie the last time around.  Uh, and, um, but I still don't trust them and I think they'll probably cheat again.  It's just the way it is.  Um, so anyway, that's all I got for you guys today.  I just wanted to share that.  I thought you guys would like that.  So here we go. ",
