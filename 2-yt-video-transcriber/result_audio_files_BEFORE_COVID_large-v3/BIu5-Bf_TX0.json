            "text": "Trump spoke for a couple of hours.  A real creep show.  But Bob Seska, writing at Salon, points out something.  I think it's been pointed out before, but not the way he does.  He calls it Donald Trump's CPAC creep show.  And he says it's clear evidence of a profound crisis.  He writes, if you've only watched the clips and highlights from Trump's CPAC speech last Saturday, you're not getting the full picture of the explosive horror show that is the worsening status of the president's mental health.  For reasons that defy comprehension, I decided to watch the whole thing live.  Now, Kathy watched the whole thing on TV, on on.  where did you find it?  YouTube right she was holding to at the outset.  Jessica writes I tweeted they given the Michael Cohen testimony in the immediate rearview mirror Trump CPAC speech was going to be quote next level.  crazy in hindsight.  I feel like I lowballed it.  before we continue Jessica writes, I'd like to emphasize I'm not a mental health professional, nor am I an expert in the pharmacological effects of cognitive enhancers like Adderall or Provigil to make a judgment call on the specifics of what's wrong with Trump.  However, I can say with confidence that something's extraordinarily wrong with him, and it's only getting more dangerous for the nation and by extension for the world as time advances.  Now, I'm just going to quote directly from this.  At CPAC, Trump ricocheted from his prepared teleprompter remarks into what can only be described as a herky-jerky stream of conscious creepshow, a Willy Wonka ride into the dark, twisted world of Trump's increasingly haunted and scattered brain.  There was sweaty, red-faced performance art, American flag leg-humping, bizarre and often shouty anecdotes leading nowhere, insults and obscenities directed at his enemies, both real and imagined, mean-spirited attempts at jokes, unabridged fear-mongering about infanticide and murderous immigrants, bug-eyed facial contortions more terrifying than the Momo Challenge and other knee-jerk outbursts that defy description.  Remember during the 2016 campaign when Trump mocked Serge Kovalevsky's disability?  Remember that?  Imagine that for two hours and 20 minutes.  from a man who now has the nuclear launch codes in his pants pocket.  The president is unfit to continue serving.  This is a crisis.  Indeed, no president before and especially since Trinity, the nuclear explosion, has acted like this in public until Trump.  Why?  It's chiefly because presidents with access to weapons of mass destruction, specifically an American nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world a thousand times over, those people are elected partly based on their sobriety and mental stability.  We need our presidents to have immensely sound judgments so that the use of the aforementioned nuclear codes is preceded by sound thought, emotional clarity, and informed deliberation.  Trump appears to possess none of these traits, nor is he inclined to even fake it.  His judgment was never stellar, and it's only disintegrating further as the rigors of the job worsen while law enforcement is closing in on him.  Again, Jessica writes, I don't possess the psychological expertise to diagnose whether his behavior is reflective of mental illness or whether it's politically motivated act for the enjoyment of the Red Hats.  If it's an act, it's just as bad and still perhaps indicative of a mental health condition.  In and of itself, acting like a mentally ill chief executive, a mad king, displays an absence of sound judgment, highlighting a disconnect from social and political norms, as well as telegraphing a profound degree of ignorance about why such an act is unacceptable.  Somewhere along the line, though, this became perfectly acceptable behavior inside the Fox News biosphere.  At some point, Fox News disciples were successfully conditioned to abandon reverence for presidential decency and decorum in favor of whatever the hell that was at CPAC.  If I were to quiz Fox News viewers about Trump's unspooled madness at CPAC, I'd ask them in particular whether they'd ever accept this kind of behavior from their doctor, their kids' teachers, or their own bosses at work.  Whether they'd accept it from a member of the clergy or the bus driver who picks up their children for school every day.  The honest response would have to be, no way.  That is, unless it's okay for our doctors mid-prostate exam to snap off a bunch of insulting impressions of the nursing staff, followed by paranoid threats about Hollywood types and racist blurts about competing physicians.  As indoctrinated into the Fox News cult as they are, I don't believe they'd be okay with that.  And if it's unacceptable conduct for their doctors and teachers, why on earth is it acceptable for a world leader cloaked in immense power and backed by the most powerful military in the history of civilization?  Baby boomer Trump voters in particular, the men and women who taught my generation, Gen X, about how to properly behave in public, how to recognize and surround ourselves with people of strong character, modesty, and goodwill, the ideals of contrition, sportsmanship, expertise, rationality, and reason.  They don't seem to hold their current president to any of those standards.  Indeed, they expect Trump to reject all those values in order to own the liberals, among other ridiculously infantile justifications.  When I observe these people, as I did on Saturday, wildly swooning when Trump mockingly impersonates everyone from his military generals to his political foes, when they cheer for his childish flailing and his total rejection of the dignity of the presidency to the point where he insultingly mocks the very notion of being presidential, I wonder to myself whether they grasp how badly they've sold out their own morality for the sake of petty grievances and racial entitlement.  I wonder if they realize that they've forsaken the social compact in order to support this glorified street hustler.  Tens of millions of Americans have abandoned it all for the sake of propping up a well-documented con man who's only in this, in Michael Cohen's words, for, quote, the world's greatest infomercial, end quote.  The normalization of Trump's unpredictable spasmodic presidency, as well as the fact that so many of us don't have the stomach to tolerate two plus hours of watching him, are perhaps the only reasons why more Americans aren't gathered as we speak, devising how best to legally remove him from office.  For what it's worth, I propose here and now that this conversation must begin in earnest.  Trump's obvious mental instability and emotionally erratic behavior has reached a harrowing new depth.  They need to be addressed by our political leadership with the same urgency as the myriad investigations into his crimes.  This has to begin now, before it's too late.  He will clearly do and say whatever it takes to secure his status, and it's the presidency alone that's keeping him out of federal prison.  He's at least competent enough to understand this, and he might be crazy enough to do anything to avoid accountability.  We are in new territory.  There is no roadmap.  And what we do now would determine whether Trump is the last Trump or possibly the first of many Trumps along the not-so-lengthy journey into a permanent form of lunatic authoritarianism.  It's time to take his madness seriously now before he levels up again.  I have to reflect back on, after reading that piece by Bob Cheska at Salon, I have to reflect back on what I said at the beginning of this particular podcast about reading the essay in last Sunday's perspective section of the Times by the head of the American Enterprise Institute.  about how it's time to tamp things down that we screamers shouldn't be screaming.  we among those of us who are calling the son of a bitches sons of bitches who are calling the racist pigs racist pigs shouldn't be doing that and i i you know like i said earlier tonight after After thinking about what I read and applying it directly to me, because I felt like the guy was writing directly to me, I came to the conclusion that as long as I'm doing this podcast, there's no way in hell that I could ever back down from the hysteric, screaming, name-calling sons of bitches, rotten bastards that I have found myself where i found myself a home.  it's just not going to happen.
