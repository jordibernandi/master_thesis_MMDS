And in doing so, talking about it casually, the clip went viral.  Whole bunch of news media outlets picked it up and they started dragging Robert Downey Jr.  for acting in blackface. ",

Robert Downey Jr.  wasn't playing a black character.  He was playing a white actor.  One of the co-stars is a black person who constantly calls him out on his attempt at trying to be black.  So you have both sides of it.  And my thing is, this is clearly entertainment.  This is clearly meant to talk about a specific topic.  And my question is, if I want to bring up blackface, if I want to represent the history of America that involves blackface, how do I represent blackface on stage without getting a white character to be in blackface?  But that... If I was to get a black character in blackface, it would defeat the purpose because it's not blackface.  It would be like saying because the fact that slavery happened that... ",

It's really easy and lazy to just go like, oh, that's what happened and not look at the context because it takes some time and intelligence to understand what was happening because you have to dissect.  If you just get the things right there in your face and you just base yourself on that, then of course you fall into the trap and then boom, there you go, you're triggered and then there goes an outrage and stuff like that.  You know, we were talking about this the other day.  You have to have a comedic intelligence.  You have to have the intelligence to decipher stuff with its first degree, second degree.  You know, there's some people that are incapable of understanding sarcasm.  There's people that are not able to understand first degree, second degree.  Yeah, that's part of that.
