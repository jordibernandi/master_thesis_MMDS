You feel wrong for the whole situation, how it went down.  And on that note, I did win my court case off this video, cuz I took it to court.  I hired a lawyer, and this happened in 2018, November.  And I just won my case this month, 2019 of August.  That's the reason why I'm uploading this video.  But I was on the right, that's the reason why I took it to court.  And that's the reason why I want my case because I actually got to fix the ticket for this one.  Did you?  It was two weeks ago.  I got stopped on Arden right there by a hostess.  Thank you.  So you got a ticket for the tent already?  Yeah.  Okay.  And I did.  I did.  Do I got to?  Because I just told you to.  No, I'm saying I got it right.  I count that up.  For my safety.  And for my safety also.  This is all being audio recorded, by the way, too.  Okay, that's fine.  Yeah, okay.  Okay, so you got to fix the ticket for the window, Tim.  I got to fix the ticket for that, too, also.  Yeah, okay.  All right, sit tight for me, okay?  I'll be right back.  So you said for your safety?  Yeah, for my safety.  And I want you to keep your hands in your lap for my safety, okay?  Yeah, no problem.  I'm sorry?  I said no problem.  Feels like I'm back in Nazi Germany or something.  The way you people get treated like this, you know?  Do you know your history?  I do.  Okay, so you don't understand what I'm saying?  No, I don't.  You don't understand Nazi Germany?  I don't see the correlation.  Okay.  We were hailed by a citizen regarding your car.  Why would a citizen have hailed us?  For my car?  I mean, whatever y'all got going on, you feel me?  I don't know nothing about that.  We were doing something completely else.  Somebody took time out of their day, took them over and flagged us down regarding you.  Regarding me?  Regarding you and your vehicle.  No, that's false.  Any weapons in the vehicle?  Yeah.  What kind of weapons?  This is a registered firearm in my name.  Okay.  Smith and Weston.  This is also, you know, got a business under my name too, so.  Just go ahead and keep your hands on the steering wheel.  Yeah. ",
