And on this episode, we are going to be unboxing and reviewing a children's marble brick set.  It's where you make a marble machine out of toy bricks.  We're going to try this out.  All right, we're going to be using the TRS striker to open our box. ",

And then they show putting a blue block in the middle.  Sad and happy together in the same marble, okay.  And I'll put, no, that's not for an occult reason or anything.  I just wanted to put two different colors together.  Okay, so there it goes.  All right, so that all works.  You do need to, when you set these in here, you do need to kind of kick them off like that so that they'll spin enough and everything, have enough torque or whatever.  There we go.  Okay, so let's take this apart and try building the big one now. ",

            "text": "Oh, and that stopped right there.  So one of the problems with using real marbles is that they can shoot out the back of the ramps when it jumps down.  So you might have to put something else behind the ramp to keep that from happening.  There went one, see, that's what I'm talking about.  I want to come out the back side of the ramp.  So you're better off using the marbles that come in the kit with these because they work better than real marbles, so that's good to know.  Alright, now if you want to see me try to make my own creation without any instructions, I can give that a try and see if anything turns out any better.  Thank you.  Okay, so my idea, my strategy behind this one was just to see if we could get the most momentum by, you know, having all the hills in line basically.  And just one for starting position in spiral, which, you know, obviously we don't need.  We could take this off here.  And we could move this down here.  like that if we wanted to.  And we actually get more momentum that way.  The corners obviously take some momentum out of what we're doing, but that's actually another factor to think about.  So let's make this corner wider.  And we might lose less momentum.  Yes, we have more momentum.  We made it all the way to the end that time by using the wider corner.  So obviously the sky is the limit and your kids can build anything, think of anything, whatever.  And you can add these little flowers and decorations if you like. ",
