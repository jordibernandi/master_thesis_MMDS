And talking about ridiculous things, today we're having a look at Barnabas Nagy again.  Yeah, I said again, we've looked at him a couple of times before, but he just keeps getting better and better.

CAT 1 is for the old telephone lines, landlines, just bog standard, 1 megabit per second.  CAT 6 and 7, for example, are for 100 megabytes plus, but they can only be a maximum of 100 meters long before they start losing their effectiveness.

I remember from one of Barney's previous videos that he also doesn't believe in satellites.  So if he doesn't believe in satellites and there are no submarine cables feeding the internet, how are you doing what you're doing now, Barney? ",

If you would rather me stick to my Tuesday and Friday schedule between now and Christmas, let me know down in the comments.  I may listen to you.  I may not.  Who knows?  But I want to try and release as many videos as I can between now and Christmas.  So I hope you enjoy them.  And yeah, that's it.  I'm the Creaky Blinder, and I will see you all in the next video.  Whenever that will be, you'll just have to wait and find out.  Take care, guys.  Bye-bye. ",
