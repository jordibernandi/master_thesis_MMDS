            "text": "Hey everybody, thanks for watching our YouTube channel.  We're constantly updating it with new content and never seen before content.  So if you want to get the latest from Harvest, hit the subscribe button.  I think that we see four shocks of this in our culture today.  You know we have never had probably more people say that they are spiritual.  You will ask someone do you believe in God?  Well I am a very spiritual person.  they will say.  No I am not into organized religion but I am very spiritual.  And by that they mean that they take a little of this and they take a little of that.  And they throw in some of their own ideas.  And they have their own belief system that they have effectively created.  Well antichrist will take this to another level where there is something for everyone to grab onto.  that is except for the person who believes that the Bible is the Word of God.  You know I have found that the most Intolerant people are the ones who talk the most about tolerance.  A lot of times Christians are accused of being intolerant.  I find that is not the case at all.  I find that a true Bible believing Christian though he or she wants others to believe in Jesus and will try to persuade them of their need for Christ is tolerant.  And by tolerant I mean they are willing to accept that other people can have their beliefs.  We don't force our beliefs on anyone.  We don't go like Muslims and threaten to take their life if they don't bow before Allah.  We try to persuade them.  We do it lovingly.  We reach out to people in need and show acts of compassion to them.  Sure we want people to come to faith.  But we really are tolerant.  But the people who are intolerant are the ones that talk all the time about tolerance.  They are the ones that say I believe that we all should just get along and everyone should be able to live as they please and express their opinion.  But if you dare to express your opinion as a Christian and say the Bible is the Word of God they will say you are narrow minded.  You are a bigot.  And they don't want to hear you at all.  Well this kind of thinking is going to reach its zenith under the reign of Antichrist in this one world religion.  So this is a time that is coming.  This is a time that the Bible warns of. ",
