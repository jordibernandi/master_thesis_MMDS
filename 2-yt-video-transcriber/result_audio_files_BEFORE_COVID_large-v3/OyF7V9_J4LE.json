            "text": "from it with bike gear.  This is how you shift gears on this line.  All the times that you shift gears is done by RPMs and the throttle pedal.  To take it in and out of gear, you use your clutch, obviously.  A little e-stop here.  This lever right here is for your high gears.  Now this right here is for your split of your high gears.  Push it forward and it splits it to the high side of that gear.  Pull it back and that's the low side of the gear.  You use your pedal to make that shift.  When you let off the pedal, it shifts in or out of gear, depending upon which way you're going, if you're downshifting and so forth and so on.  That is how you shift gears on a set line.  It's all done by your throttle.  No clutch to shift besides taking it in and out of gear.  Wanna shift roughly, I shift anywhere between 1,300 and 1,400 RPMs.  Your low side gears, you know, first through fifth, When you're empty, you can shift at a lot lower RPM than what you normally would if you were loaded.  So that is how you do it.  Thanks for watching. ",
