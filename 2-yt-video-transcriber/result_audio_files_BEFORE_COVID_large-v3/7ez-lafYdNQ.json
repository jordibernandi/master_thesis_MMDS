            "text": "Twister Christian back with another video.  One of the things I wanted to discuss was Vietnam and the Vietnamese dong.  There's been a lot of speculation ever since I've started investing in currency since 2011.  And one of the things is, is that Vietnam, the dong is supposedly supposed to be worth at least 10 cents on the dollar when the world reset or global currency reset takes place.  Now, one of the things as I'm doing my research, you will find that many lists of people or websites that list the gold reserves of different countries, Vietnam is actually left out of it because there's no real official data.  And a lot of it is based on what the Vietnam Central Bank and the government is saying how much gold reserves they have.  Now, there is speculation.  they have about $10 billion.  tons of gold which was the last statement they said that they had which isn't very much compared to a lot of the other countries within the same region.  so as i look back there was only one place that i could find anything that dealt with gold reserves for vietnam.  and of course you know if if all these different countries like china and russia they're going to be backing their currency by gold.  one of the things is is that some countries may be left behind.  Now, we don't really know how much gold Vietnam really has.  They could be lying.  They could have, you know, they could have 90 tons of gold.  So just looking back, just going back over the last year, and it just says as of reporting 415 million in gold reserves, which isn't very much compared to a lot of the other countries.  Now, one of the things that they are doing just to kind of give you an update, you know, Vietnam has been considered a currency manipulator.  And they've been doing it for, at least according to the reports, at least for the last couple years.  I'm sure it's been going on a lot longer than that.  It says Vietnam may be the latest country to be targeted by the U.S.  as a currency manipulator in a twice-year yearly Treasury report on foreign currencies expected this month.  The Southeast Asian nation is coming under scrutiny for artificially holding down the value of the dong, people familiar with the matter said.  Now, of course, they've already been, I think if I'm not mistaken, they've already named them as a currency manipulator.  And when you actually do the research, everything is controlled by the government, very strict control over their economy.  And one of the things that they lack behind in is obviously being able to collect taxes because a lot of things are done in cash and gold.  As I pulled this article here from May 27, 2019, you can still buy a house with gold bars in Vietnam.  And apparently, as you go and read the article, you can see that a lot of people still use physical gold to make their purchases.  And this person here bought a house that says we paid almost half in gold bars and the rest in cash.  A 47-year-old shopkeeper said of his new $138,000 condo.  We did it because we and the flat's owner didn't want to do a bank transfer deal.  So we are so used to buying things with cash and gold.  So that's one of the things is that they have problems with.  They have problems with collecting taxes.  They have, you know, if if if anything is reported in the bank, then obviously you would have to pay taxes on that.  And of course, they talk about a cashless economy in Vietnam to deter tax evasion and money laundering.  So obviously there's a. Vietnam still has a lot of financial issues concerning money.  their economy, concerning their government, concerning the tax system.  So with them saying really not being able to really give anybody any official data as far as how much gold that they have, it's going to make it really difficult for them to really move into the future.  We talked about Iraq and how much gold reserves that they have.  I showed you guys about the American dollar and the gold reserves and the gold buying spree by all the different central banks.  Now, one of the other things here, I found this article back from May 20th, 2019.  Vietnam Central Bank said on Tuesday it was ready to pump U.S.  dollars into the market to stabilize the dong's currency rate as it has come under pressure due to the fallout of the U.S.  trade, the U.S.-China trade war.  Vietnamese dong has weakened 0.9% this year and has fallen near 2.8% from a year earlier, according to data.  It says here the government said in a statement on Monday that Vietnam's foreign reserves has reached a record high without giving a specific figure.  See, that's what I say, is that they keep their information under wraps.  It says he issued an assurance that Vietnam has ample supply of dollars as the central bank has been able to build up its foreign exchange reserves.  So what they want to do is get rid of a lot of their dollars to try to boost the dong.  And of course, in my opinion... That's going to help some, but it's not going to get it to the rate of 10 cents a dollar.  when we talk about the global reset.  And we already know that they've \u2013 and just from the articles that I've just talked about and the things that have made the news, we already know that Trump is planning to penalize those countries who are currency manipulators.  So with this strict control over the information that is coming out of Vietnam \u2013 With them not having, at least according to what they say, as far as the gold data, are they ready for the new system?  And will things change?  Their economy has... As I read that last article, they said that it's going down because of the strains of the China trade war.  But when I put in Vietnam benefiting from the trade war, you look at all these... These articles, Vietnam strains to reap the rewards of the U.S.-China trade war.  U.S.-China trade war is a gift that keeps giving for Vietnam.  U.S.-China trade war gives Vietnam a winning streak.  Vietnam GDP grows on trade war gains.  Because of what's going on with China, Vietnam is benefiting.  Their economy is benefiting.  They're getting contracts.  They've made all kinds of deals with the EU and China and Russia and so on.  And so even though that the trade war has had an effect on their currency, well, they're also benefiting too as well.  So honestly, if Vietnam really can't be straightforward with their information, it's kind of hard to see where they're going to be around the time of the global reset, especially with the strict government control over the data.  Because that's what's going to be important is, you know, how much gold reserves do they have?  You know, if they hold a lot of  U.S.,  if they hold... A lot of a currency of a country that's falling apart, well, that's going to affect their reserves.  And also, too, you have people that still buy things in gold in Vietnam.  So obviously the country itself may have a lot of gold.  And a lot of people, maybe when this thing does take place, maybe a lot of people will trade in their gold because gold, by the time that the global reset happens, in my opinion \u2013 The gold the gold price is going to go up.  I've showed you guys articles about how the Fed is cutting interest rates so that they can boost the value of gold.  So maybe Vietnam has a plan and maybe they're not sharing that information because they're keeping everything tight.  But they're also a currency manipulator.  And I do hold on to some Vietnamese dong.  Dong is still a good investment.  But as far as they return on the investment from speculation only.  that Iraq dinar is still the very best value, especially concerning what the value is supposed to go to.  You know, a lot of people say 10, 20 cents that when everything takes place, you know, you'll be able to get 10 cents on the dollar for the Vietnamese dong.  So I just wanted to present this information to you guys as far as kind of what's going on with Vietnam.  And just one last thing, it says here Vietnam to increase Minimum salary in 2020, that article came out about a little bit over a week ago.  So they are raising the salaries of employees and so forth, which is fine because we've heard that news with other countries many, many times.  But obviously, you know, they want their people to live a little bit better than what they're doing.  So tell me, tell me, guys, what you think, your thoughts on the Vietnamese dong.  If there's any other information that you guys have, please put it in the comment section below.  And we'll see how this whole Vietnam thing plays out.  I'm going to be watching the news when it concerns Vietnam and their central banks and if there's any information on gold purchasing.  I just think they're really keeping things tight-lipped, and they might be keeping things tight-lipped because they don't want other countries to know.  They want to use that data that they have to benefit their own country, their currency, and their economy.  So that could be the very reason why they are.  So when it comes to the global currency reset, we're just going to have to wait to see what happens.  I believe that this will be one of the countries that will change in value.  Their economy is booming and they've grown so much.  And like I just showed you, they've benefited greatly from the trade war.  You can go back and just type in Vietnam benefiting from the trade war.  You can just read the different articles and you can see exactly how.  They're benefiting in many different areas.  So and then what's going to happen when the China-U.S.  trade deal does go through?  What's going to happen to Vietnam?  So what's going to happen to the economy?  How will it affect their economy afterwards?  And I've shared this before.  There's going to be some countries that are going to be left out.  So I hope that Vietnam is one of those countries that will change to 10 cents on the dollar.  That's all speculation of information that I've researched over the years and that discussions have been made about the Vietnamese dong and that's about where their currency should be at is about 10 cents on the dollar especially.  you gotta look around.  there's a lot of countries around Vietnam and their countries their economies are booming their gold reserves are booming so we don't really know.  I think Vietnam may just be keeping tight-lipped just so they can use it to the benefit to try to manipulate whatever they're manipulating, and then when the time comes, they're going to have to get on board with the new monetary system that is coming.
