It's not confrontational.  It's not rude in any way, shape, or form.  But you try to dig to get to the bottom of what they believe and why they believe it.  And honestly, what's really interesting to see is How much have people thought through their beliefs?  And why do they really believe what they believe?  And can they defend it?  And how solid is the framework of their argument?  And, you know, I love that you don't try to strawman people.  You do try to steelman people and take the best version of what they're saying and then kind of deconstruct that because... I'll tell you, the world is interesting enough as it is.
