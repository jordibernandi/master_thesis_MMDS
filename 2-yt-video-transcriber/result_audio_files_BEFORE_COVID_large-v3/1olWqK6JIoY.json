            "text": "Howdy, Drew.  It's Kel here.  Well, you can see by the title, I'm quitting my weightlifting program.  Just got back from the gym.  Got a little bit of Muscle Milk Knockout Chocolate Protein Shaker.  Have to have a sip of that.  What happened was, several years ago, I... I read something online on Google, I did a Google search, and I read an article, a couple of articles that say the way to build muscle and strength is to lift as heavy a weight as you can lift only two or three times.  So I thought that sounded interesting, you know, and they would say someone lifts a really, really heavy weight and then don't lift for a week or two, even a month, once a month or some weird thing.  I didn't do that, but... So I did that for a bit, two, three years ago, and I ended up getting injuries.  I ended up getting pulls, like right here into my shoulder here, where it was all pulled out of whack and hurting, and I kind of ripped something.  So because of the problems I've had, I've discussed that in my live stream.  I wasn't able to work out anyway for a while.  In the beginning of 2018, I was so weak that literally I'd go like this, you know what I'm saying, and there was no muscle at all.  I mean, you couldn't see or feel a muscle.  It was just flat.  I actually had trouble lifting things, just groceries and things.  I was like, ah, I could feel it was ridiculous, but I could feel it was, I'd gotten really weak.  And I just made a lot of decisions in my life, decided to get back and... You know, and the weightlifting and working out and all that stuff and healthy eating and everything.  So I started working out in 2018, but I still had that idea in my mind, you know, heavy, heavy weights, you know, three, four reps, whatever.  So I did it differently for a little bit, but then I went back to that here a few months ago because I, you know, read again somewhere online or some YouTube video that said that was the way to do it.  You know, I believe it, I guess.  And it is for some, I guess.  And it may not be the fault of the things I read because... What they may have been saying is for strength, to develop strength, you need to do it that way.  And I thought strength and volume of muscle was the same.  It's not, I found out just yesterday.  And so I've been lifting three or four reps per weight, heavy enough.  that was all I could do, four, maybe five reps the most.  And I've had pains, you know, and it just feels like strain.  It wasn't a lot of fun the last few months.  So I decided last night to quit doing it.  It was no fun for me.  It was painful.  It's causing pains and tears in my arms and stuff and this and that.  And what I've done is dumped that program and I've started a new program.  And the new program is eight to 12 reps.  because I did a little research, which is what I used to do, by the way.  In the old days, 20, 30 years ago, when I had a workout partner, the guy I worked at the gym I used to go to, we started lifting weights together.  You know, his name was Mark.  And we would do, you know, 12 reps, whatever.  But for the last few years, I've had in my head this idea in my head that you have to do heavy weights and low reps.  And that's not true.  My research shows me that doing 8 to 12 reps, even 13, 14 reps, whatever, you know, is better.  And so that's what I did today.  And I feel so much better, you know.  One thing I've really missed the last few months is the burn.  Also, I don't think it really created any volume.  As you can see, I've got a muscle now, you know.  But I really haven't created any volume to speak of, you know what I'm saying, the last few months.  Though I think I did get a little bit stronger.  Because lifting heavy weights and low reps does make you stronger, I guess.  I didn't feel I was getting stronger.  But I'm interested in volume, both for how it looks, but also because the more muscle I have in my body, the more my body is going to burn calories, the more weight I can lose.  So then I went to the gym.  I reduced all my weights like I was doing.  I was doing not a lot of weight anyway.  On my chest press, I was only doing like 150 pounds, you know what I'm saying?  That's not much weight for most guys, but I've been coming back for a long time.  bouts of weakness and sickness and things.  You know, on my biceps, I was doing a hundred and on my bicep machine, we sit in the machine, you do this.  I was doing like 130 or 25 or some damn thing, you know, and, uh, you know, now I'm, I'm a bicep machine.  I'm doing about 95, uh, on the, uh, the pulldowns, which we did today.  Um, I was doing like 150, uh, And I was doing that about four or five times, maybe six sometimes.  It was getting to where I was doing six because I had gotten a little stronger.  But I could, again, feel myself, my pulls happening.  I could feel my shoulders, you know, I could feel, you know, these pains, you know.  And today I did... 105 110 or 110 or something and I I was able to you know 15 you know 14 13 12 reps and then as I did I did did four sets and it feels great.  one thing I really missed is that feeling the burn.  you know I'm saying when you're lifting weights for your you know you're getting to that.  you know 12 13 you know 12th rep whatever where you feel that burn and of course mostly with the calm going to exhaustion.  so by the time I whatever I do I And I'm going to adjust it next time I go in.  Whatever weight I'm doing, by the 12th rep, I pretty much can barely do that.  So I'm going to where I also can't do anymore at that stage.  Today, the first weight I did on the pulldowns, I put like 80 in there.  And I could do like 30 of those if I wanted to.  So I went through my second.  I did it again at higher weight.  And I went through four times, like I said.  I did four sets.  So I'm feeling much better about all this.  I also think it's going to help me lose weight more, not just because I'll build more muscle and bigger muscles, which would be nice too, but because, you know, I'm doing a lot more reps, a lot more, you know, I'm working the muscle more.  And I think what's going to happen here is it's going to be, I'm going to, my muscles are just being worked more.  You know what I'm saying?  I suspect I'll have some soreness tomorrow, which I kind of like.  I'm not coming out of a mask yesterday like that, but it's kind of nice, you know, the next day after you're done working out to feel that.  So, That's where I'm at.  I thought I'd give you guys an update since I'm doing this online kind of.  I'm talking about what I'm doing as I'm doing it.  That's what I'm doing.  And I'm really, really jacked about it.  Last night when I realized what I was doing wrong.  This is Wednesday.  I worked out Monday when I realized what I was doing wrong.  And I was screwing up and having it for a long time.  I've gotten really jacked about coming today.  And I haven't been that jacked about going to work out lately.  I've been doing it.  I've been regularly doing it every week, three times a week.  But I've had to force myself to do it.  It has been a lot of fun.  And one of the things I really missed and I really am glad to be back, I like that feeling of the burn.  That's kind of a weird mascus, but I like that, you know, when you get to that, you know, like this time, I did four sets, and the last one I do is when you sit in the machine, you do your biceps, and then I had to lower it a little bit, but by the time I did those last couple sets on the biceps, you know, which is the last one I do, I do the pull-downs, I do pull-downs this way, and then I do the the biceps, you know, I really feel, you know, that by that last pump, it's like, ah, I can just feel the muscle and I can feel the whole muscle engaging, which is why they get bigger, I guess, doing it that way rather than doing the strength training.  And I confabulated or whatever you want to call it, uh, conflated or whatever it's called strength training with, with, you know, with, with bodybuilding, they're, they're different.  I have an old book I've had for years and years and about years ago called getting strong, which is about bodybuilding, but strong equals strength.  You know, I guess it's a nice title for a book, but I just thought strength and bodybuilding were the same thing.  They're not.  That's why you have, you know, strength trainers who can lift amazing amounts of weight or smaller in size muscle-wise.  than bodybuilders.  Bodybuilders, a lot of bodybuilders lift, they do fairly light weights.  You know, like I said, I was doing fairly light weights.  I was doing, I'm probably going to be at, I don't know what I know.  I forget.  There was not a minute down, you know, probably a hundred weight, a hundred pull on the pull downs, you know, and that's fairly light weights compared to 150 or whatever anyway, which is not a lot of weight anyway.  So anyway, that's it guys.  I thought I'd share it with you and keep you updated on what's going on.  Um, That's what's going on.

Please share the video with him, and please check my Patreon below and support me on Patreon.  I appreciate that.  Well, thanks for watching, and I'm hard at it still, and I changed my program.  I dumped my old weight work program.  I'm instituted a new one.  And I think I'm going to be just a lot happier, not only with the muscle gains I get, but just because I enjoy lifting this way so much more.  It's actually more lifting.  I did four sets today.  The last one I'd usually do would be two or three sets, maybe sometimes four.  It's going to be more enjoyable for me, which means I'm going to want to go to the gym.  I really felt so good going to the gym today.  I'm glad.  I feel good now that I'm back, but I just felt so good to go to the gym and do the weights this way.  It's just fun.  It's kind of like when you were a kid and you were losing teeth because you're losing baby teeth.  And when the tooth would get to where it was loose, you kind of work it and pull on it with your tongue and your fingers.  And it was like, it's not quite pain.  It's kind of, it's hard to describe.  It's not really pain.  It's like, it felt good to work it back and forth.  And I'm the only one that did that.  And then I used to pull my teeth out with a pair of pliers when I was a kid at some point.  Probably the only one that did that.  Anyway, well, thanks for watching, and I'll talk to you later.  Hope you're having a good time.  Hope you guys out there who are following me for this thing are doing it too.  We're working your asses off.  I'm eating right and losing weight and getting health back and getting in shape because I just feel so much better.  I'm a new person, and I'm not even there yet, but I just feel so much better.  I will talk to you later.  Thanks for watching.  I hope you're enjoying your life and your workouts because that's what it's all about. ",
