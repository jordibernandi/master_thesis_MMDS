            "text": "Hi guys, so it's been a minute.  Once again, I'm really sorry.  My life has just been, it's just all over the place.  Super busy, super crazy.  I've had my brother staying with me for the past month.  He just left a week ago, but we've had another really kind of busy week.  after he left, so it's taken me a minute to be able to jump back into making some videos for you guys, but I'm really excited.  Finally, I have some time today, and so I'm going to be doing a video on my first trimester experiences, my sort of symptoms of pregnancy in the first trimester, as well as a little gender reveal.  So before I get started, I just want to say I'm really excited because this video is sponsored.  I finally, after a couple years on the platform, have found a company that has reached out to me with a sponsorship that I actually feel like I can be really comfortable and happy getting on board with.  And so that company is called My Patriot Supply.  Basically they provide emergency food which lasts up to 25 years with a two day delivery.  It is actually really delicious food.  I was quite shocked when I started to try it myself.  The macaroni and cheese is delicious.  The traveler stew is delicious.  The pancakes are unbelievable.  I really like the food.  So I feel like, you know, if the collapse comes, if an emergency happens, if the power goes out, will be prepared and I will be eating as good as I was before with this with these products.  so they come in a big tub like this which is actually really great because they're easy to stack they're like not cut they're not like kind of gross looking.  I think it's actually a really nice bucket and it shows you on the front what is actually in there.  this one is the two-week supply and Inside, like I said, are things like mac and cheese, white rice, stews, soups, maple oatmeal, which is really, really delicious.  And I think the pancakes are my favorite.  They're so easy and quick to make.  If you're interested in being prepared for emergencies like I am, I would like to encourage you to check out my website.  The link will be in the description of this video.  The website is called www.preparewithcc.com.  And if you go there today, you can save $70 on a two-week supply of emergency food that will last you up to 25 years.  So yeah, if you'd like to support my channel or my growing family and also prepare for, you know, the unexpected things that can happen in life, be that, you know, natural disasters, electrical issues.  Um, you know, there are just tons of things that can happen in life that would require you to have a supply of food on hand.  Please check out my website.  So once again, that's preparewithcc.com.  So without further ado.  Let's get into the meat of the video.  So my first trimester was, there were some things that were difficult, I think, for me during my first trimester.  I really struggled with food aversions in my first trimester.  I didn't really have any nausea.  except when I encountered certain smells.  but I didn't ever wake up with this feeling of like not being able to eat or you know feeling nausea.  just you know throughout the day that never happened which I feel very fortunate about.  a lot of the ladies that I've spoken to who are either currently pregnant or have been pregnant have experienced this.  so The first thing that happened before I even realized that I was pregnant was that I got really, really bloated, my boobs were really sore, and I had kind of a ferocious appetite for fruit, which, I mean, I've always loved fruit, but normally I have small portions of fruit throughout the day, and I'm kind of more of a meat-eater type thing.  And what's interesting is that eggs, which I love, like eggs are one of my favorite foods, and just meat in general, especially fish and salmon, just the thought of it would make me feel sick.  Now the interesting thing was that when I would sit down and force myself to eat these things because, you know, I'm not going to not eat eggs while I'm pregnant, even if it makes me feel sick.  because they're such nutrient dense good foods for pregnant ladies.  I would force myself to eat it and when I would take my first bite, was fine and it was like oh this isn't actually so bad it's totally a psychological thing.  so that was rough at first you know trying to force myself to eat protein and eggs and stuff when I really didn't want it.  all I wanted to eat was watermelon.  that was my my biggest craving in the first trimester.  I buy like one of those you know meat small medium watermelons every single day pretty much and I would either eat a full watermelon myself or I would split it with my husband and then the next day I would just go out and get another one.  It was something about the sort of crispness, the high water content, which was sort of satisfying my insatiable thirst which I still have to this day.  I'm still like just constantly thirsty, drinking water all the time.  Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, That's been my biggest craving, especially in the first trimester and still now I crave berries and high water content fruits all the time, which, yeah.  I mean, it's not that I don't like these things naturally, it's just that I've never had such a desire to eat these things as I do now.  And normally I love meat, and I love fish, and I love eggs, and those things have been, even now, periodically, I kinda, I'm just like, oh, I don't really want it.  I'm gonna have to force myself to take them.  So, that's the food-related stuff, which I think, compared to most women, or to a lot of women, I've had it kinda easy, which I'm really thankful for.  Uh, secondly, I have found, especially in my first trimester, I was exhausted all the time, like sleeping 12, 14 hours in a day, which I'm very thankful that I was able to do.  Um, cause I don't, I don't have a, a job that I have to go to or any like serious responsibilities that I need to take care of outside of the house, um, at a workplace.  So I was able to get that rest, which was great.  But the low energy was really difficult because things like cooking and cleaning and going to the gym, these things have been difficult for me.  And even with going to the gym because of the move, my whole routine has been kind of thrown up into the air.  So it's been difficult to be consistent with the kind of exercise that I would have liked to have done.  throughout the like consistently with this pregnancy.  but I'm I'm really trying to like get walks in and uh hopefully we'll be going to the gym maybe even this evening.  But yeah, the exhaustion was was rough and I'm really happy now that I'm in the second trimester.  It's not such an issue as what it was in the first trimester.  Also, my emotions were just all over the place in the first trimester.  That was Really really rough for me.  I was way more irritable Kind of like, you know struggling with feeling down a lot, which was really confusing because on the one hand, I was feeling so grateful to be pregnant, so, so happy to be pregnant.  And that it happened quickly and without a lot of trouble.  and you know, this is something that I wanted for so long.  but then to just be kind of feeling down and irritable and you know not really being able to communicate effectively with my husband.  that was really rough especially because of the stress of preparing to move back home to Canada and as well as my husband had so much on his shoulders during that time.  He actually found out, or we found out that I was pregnant the same weekend that he was offered a job in Canada.  So it was like this huge shift of responsibilities and new stresses and things that needed to be organized and we needed to prepare for.  that happened all at once.  And I think maybe the weight of that plus the hormone shifts Really affected my emotional state in the first trimester, and it was rough for me For and for my husband too because he was you know carrying us both through the meat of the move and That was tough for me too.  Something that has lifted now that I'm in my second trimester and I feel pretty emotionally excited and happy and I don't really feel down that much.  Sometimes I feel kind of like, oh, nobody loves me and it's just like, I'm all alone in this pregnancy and it's just like, you know, I'm having a hormonal shift or something.  My husband's like, I'm right here.  You're being silly.  but look for the most part I'm just really happy and excited and getting bigger and you're dealing with that.  that's probably my biggest struggle right now is the fact that I'm really I can't fit into anything anymore except for like baggy clothes.  I didn't really gain any weight in my first trimester.  I Was eating normally Like I always did and what I didn't want to have I was forcing myself to have because I knew it was good for me.  So I wasn't overeating.  I wasn't eating like tons of junk food.  occasionally I would have something that like pizza or like, you know a carb craving I would give in to Like mac and cheese like I crave mac and cheese a lot.  um For the most part like.  I was eating healthy and I was eating normal sized portions of things.  So and I was walking a lot more in my first trimester because I was still sort of in My regular routine when I was like living in Europe still at that point.  So I didn't really gain any weight in my first trimester, which was like a little bit concerning because you know You expect that you're going to be gaining weight being pregnant, but I think you know It's actually a lot more common than I previously assumed to not really gain that much weight.  Some women even lose a few pounds in their first trimester because of the nausea and stuff.  So, I mean, I've started gaining weight now, but my first trimester, it was kind of business as usual.  And so around week 12, I got the genetic tests done so that I could find out the gender of my baby.  and um yeah i i guess i'll just let you guys know now i mean i'm not having a big gender reveal video or a party or anything because you know i don't have any family here i don't really have many friends here that i'm close with.  so there's like no one to invite.  it's like maybe in my second pregnancy um i'll be able to do things like that.  but because we're kind of you know doing things as they progress in this pregnancy, it's not going to be a big reveal here today.  So I'll just tell you, I'm very blessed to be having a little boy.  I'm so excited.  That's what I thought I was going to have, too.  For the whole time, in my first trimester, I was like, I feel like this is a boy.  And I think maybe that was a part of the reason why I was irritable, you know, and kind of picking petty fights with my husband and stuff, because I was like, there was testosterone in me or something, and it was making me more aggressive a little bit, maybe.  The other thing that's quite interesting is that I feel really confident.  I think we all kind of, to lesser and more degrees, struggle with body confidence.  But I feel like ever since I got pregnant, I'm just so confident and I feel so happy and secure in my body, even though it's getting bigger and even though it's changing and stuff.  And my husband thinks that's partially because of the testosterone.  He's like, yeah, that's what testosterone does.  It makes you confident.  makes you feel strong, makes you less neurotic.  So those are all things that are great about having a boy.  And also I just love, I love the idea of, you know, the big brother, you know, the firstborn being a boy and being that big brother to the little ones that will follow him.  And so, yeah, I'm just so excited and so blessed and Yeah, it's what I wanted.  It's what both me and my husband wanted.  My husband's like overjoyed.  He's so happy that we're having a boy.  I wouldn't mind having a girl.  I think I got a lot of the girls' clothes and stuff when I go shopping for him and getting like little baby suits and stuff.  When I look at the girls, I'm just like, oh my God, it's so cute.  So maybe someday if I'm lucky, I'll have a little girl.  But for now, we're working with a boy and we couldn't be more pleased.  So I don't want this video to be too long.  I'm gonna leave it off there.  If you have any more questions for me about my first trimester, please feel free to leave them below.  I will be making a video following this one on my second trimester, as well as sort of, you know, things that I'm purchasing in preparation for the baby, you know, wraps and dodi soothers and stuff, just like a little, I'll do a little sort of product review of things that I'm getting for the baby and things that I myself am using as a pregnant woman because there's a lot of pretty nasty chemicals in most of the products.  that we see at like the drugstore and stuff nowadays with shampoos and body washes and even makeup and stuff.  So I've been really careful about what I'm putting on my skin, what I'm putting on my body.  And so I think that might be an interesting video as well.  If you have any ideas that you would like me to talk about with regard to my pregnancy so far, please leave them in the comment section.
