            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  Yep back with another video.  So anyway, I wanted to do a video Regarding a comment that was left on the previous video and it was left by a gentleman by the name of this subscriber.  name is mr.  Don cough and He had a very very very fair Comment and it was Basically, he said that I'm starting to look like I'm teach like new ages and new age spirituality and all that sort of stuff.  And that that is a utopian ideology or belief and that it's false.  And he is absolutely 100% correct.  And as I replied to his comment that if you watch any of my videos previously, there's no hint of me ever saying that life is to be some sort of utopian lifestyle or anything New Ageism or anything like that.  What I'm wishing for my subs is just to help them with certain tools that makes life a little bit easier for you.  Life here isn't meant to be easy.  In actual fact, it's the exact opposite.  Life here is actually meant to be a struggle.  I've mentioned in other videos that when I was 24 years of age, I died, I left my body, I crossed over.  And if you guys want me to do a video on what I experienced, that whole process of what led up to the event and all that sort of stuff, I'm more than happy to do a video now.  I'm feeling more comfortable with doing a video about that subject.  However, what I learned when I was on the other side was that is utopia.  I mean, there's nothing that can even begin to explain or describe the feelings that you feel after you've died and left your body and ended up on the other side.  And this has happened to me a couple of times now.  One time was I died from the heart condition that I have.  And the other time has actually was in deep, deep transcendental meditation.  I meditate.  And anyway.  The reality of the situation is that life here on Earth isn't meant to be a utopian lifestyle.  It's not meant to be a perfect way of life.  That's what this world is about.  It's about feeling those struggles.  It's about experiencing heartache.  It's about experiencing the pain.  It's about experiencing all these different facets of life.  And we get to experience this stuff here because we don't get to experience it on the other side.  We just don't get to experience that stuff.  And the reality of the situation is that the world is a fucking tough place.  And it's designed that way.  It's not meant to be a cakewalk why we live here in any way, shape, or form.  However, there are specific things that you can do in life to avoid the pitfalls of making your life an absolute fucking misery.  And it's very, very interesting because all the civilizations that have been on this planet that were meant to be utopian lifestyles or utopian civilizations, which was Atlantis was meant to be this utopian civilization.  Babylon was meant to be this utopian civilization.  Can anyone point to where those civilizations are today?  There's no signs of them.  They've been completely and utterly wiped off the face of the earth.  There has been multiple, over the hundreds of thousands to millions of years that humanity has been traipsing around this little blue marble, there has been multiple... extinction level events that have wiped out pretty much near every living creature on this planet.  Scientists are actually starting to discover this stuff.  They're starting to discover so much about what's going on with the planet now.  because of the technology and the data and everything that they can now study.  They can pull core samples out of the Atlantic Ocean now and they can see what was going on with the atmosphere because the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean is just mud.  And it's mud from the thousands upon thousands upon hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years of sediment that has fallen on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  So they can pull core samples out of the ocean and they can see these different events that have gone on based on what has been in the atmosphere.  So there is a huge amount of data and information now in regards to what's going on on the planet.  Even the Chinese have over 8,500 years of documentation in regards to what has gone on on this planet as far as weather, temperatures, sun spots, you freaking name it.  The Chinese have... Like I said, over 8,500 years of data and knowledge.  That's why I go to that information.  when it comes to, let's say, what's happening with climate, you know, the climate right now.  And not man-made climate change.  No, no.  The climate is changing.  It's not us in any way, shape, or form.  However, the world is a brutal fucking place.  And I can, you know... I left the United States of America to come back to this country because of an accident that happened last year.  I had a really, really serious accident.  It was no joke.  I could have caused myself some serious damage.  I did cause myself some serious damage, but it could have been a lot worse.  And I'll play the video.  I've got security camera footage from the storage facility where I was storing my stuff before I came back here.  I shut my businesses down and I put a lot of my stuff into storage.  That's where I started the channel.  If you see me sitting in that tin shed talking, that's where I'm at.  I'm up at that storage facility.  I chilled out up there for about three years tinkering around on a project, on an El Camino.  Now, I will play the video footage of me eating shit on my beach cruiser.  I went in head first.  Check it out.  It's not pretty.  How can I help you if you have any other people?  Sorry to hang up.  What do you want?  I don't want to hurt you in advance or anything like that.  Is there anything done with people here that you can't escape?  So... That's me eating shit on a beach cruiser.  Now, when you're watching that video, off to the right of your screen, you can see some people loading up their storage facility.  They literally yelled out, are you all right?  And I yelled back, no, I'm not.  And I wasn't.  I went in head first.  I went in right here on my skull at about 15, 20 mile an hour.  My arms got grazed up and my left knee got pretty badly jacked up.  But here's what's even more disturbing is literally 20 feet, 15 to 20 feet in front of me under the security camera are some more people.  There was five people that saw me eat shit.  Not one person helped.  Not one.  And I was fucking hurting.  That you see me pick the bike up and walk back up to my unit.  And that will tell you right there the level to which people won't help you.  Especially in the United States.  I don't know what it's like out here in New Zealand because I haven't eaten shit like that in front of people in New Zealand and I have no intention of doing that.  However, what it proved to me is that human beings don't give a shit about you.  They don't.  They will walk all over you and they will spit on your grave and life will carry on like you do not exist, like you didn't even exist.  People will brush you aside like that.  And that's the key thing that you have to realize when you're going out there into this world.  And this is the problem with all this new ageism that's out there, is they sell this utopian lifestyle that everything can be this absolute brilliant, beautiful life.  But it's not.  It can be a good life.  You can have a happy life.  So long as you don't fall into certain pitfalls.  So long as you don't buy into certain beliefs, ideologies, and all that sort of stuff.  That's why I have a problem with Jordan Peterson.  Because he's selling a specific... lifestyle, like if you follow Jordan Peterson's rules, you're going to have a good life.  You're going to be able to make a go of it.  But he doesn't tell his millions of followers that 60 to 70% of you are going to end up being divorced and losing everything you've ever had in your life.  And out of percentage of that 60 to 70%, there's going to be about 30% of you are going to commit suicide.  You're going to take a gun or something and you're going to take your life.  And this is the thing.  That's why Peterson blubbers when he's talking about saving the young boys and helping the young men and everything.  Because he's not.  He knows deep down inside of himself.  That he's just helping to herd the flock in a certain direction.  And that certain direction is for basically economic global sustainability.  Because that was the panel that he worked on in the United Nations.  That was the panel that he helped write, edit.  the documents for global economic sustainability.  So, you know, you've got these people out there that are right in front of you that look like they want the best for you and that they're trying to help you and trying to move you and do the right thing by you, but they couldn't care less.  You know, Peterson, he's getting his millions of dollars.  He's making millions of dollars off selling his stuff to a specific group of people and herding them off to the site.  That's what his job is.  That's what Stefan Molyneux's job is.  That's what Lauren Southern's job is.  That's what Paul Joseph Watson's job is.  That's what freaking even Alex Jones's job is.  It's to keep everybody herded, keep the flock over there.  But are any of them talking about the next massive global catastrophe that's going to be coming our way?  Is anybody trying to prepare you in any way, shape or form for what's coming down the pipeline?  I mean, Donald Trump's just spent a trillion dollars with the industrial military complex.  Okay?  That's the most amount of money that's ever been spent at one given time, at one point in time, on the industrial military complex in the United States.  All that tells me is they're gearing up for something.  And I'm going to give you fellas a heads up, a solid heads up.  There's one thing, one thing that is the precursor to a major economic crash and also the United States going to war.  And it's been the same thing for the last 40 years.  It's a spike in retirements.  And right now, in 2019 into 2020, we are seeing the single largest spike of retirements in the history of humanity, as far as recorded time, Western civilization, everything.  There is over $11.5 trillion that the United States state and federal governments and the banking system owes baby boomers.  $11.5 trillion.  Now.  2008, the market crash of 2008 was only for $4.5 trillion.  $4.5 trillion was wiped off the table.  People lost their homes, people lost their families, people committed suicide.  It was absolute carnage.  There is your utopian life.  So we are looking, my prediction is by the end of 2022, if the economy isn't in some sort of free fall, I will be damn surprised.  I'll be a Dutch monkey's uncle.  And the one thing that happens when the economy goes into a free fall like that, the United States has to go to war.  Every time.  So you've got Donald Trump, who is literally elected by the industrial military complex.  And if you think I'm full of shit, watch the documentary, The Great Hack.  I highly, highly endorse watching that movie or that documentary because it shows you exactly from the horse's mouth, from the people that were doing the work, from the organizations that were behind the CIA and the industrial military complex to get Donald Trump elected so they can get their money to rearm themselves.  and get their military freaking powerhouse, the military, the US military juggernaut, back up and running.  Nobody's telling you anything.  I will guarantee you, you cannot find one person out there, not a Stefan Molyneux, not a Jordan Peterson, not a Paul Joseph Watson, not a freaking Lauren Southern, none of them will tell you what I've just told you.  And I am telling you from factual research.  I have... I've got a friend of mine who works at the highest level of US military intelligence.  I've got another gentleman that I know that worked on the same economic global sustainability panel in the United Nations as what Jordan Peterson did.  And none of this information is getting out there to anybody in any way, shape or form.  So all I'm trying to do is... is help you guys miss some of the pitfalls in life that will cause you greater misery, heartache, anguish, whatever you want to call it.  I just wish for you to be able to have yourselves in a secure position of some sort.  It doesn't have to be, you know... the most perfect situation.  It doesn't have to be, not even, there's no such thing as a utopian life.  And there's certainly no such thing as perfection.  All I wish for you is to be able to get yourselves kind of in a spot where when the shit goes down, You're not going to go down with it.  And the best way to do that is to live the most simplest lifestyle out.  Bar none.  Keep the drama and the chaos and the bullshit off to the side.  I mean, I swear I'll be doing another true marriage horror stories here soon.  Because the carnage that happened in 2008 with friends of mine was unbelievable.  And I see the same carnage coming down the pipeline.  It's going to happen again.  And that is what the world is about.  The world is not a fucking cakewalk.  It's not.  It takes work.  It takes hard work.  It takes determination.  It takes consistency in what you're doing.  There's so many things that go into just being able to get by on a day-to-day basis.  And depending on what level you want to get by at, that energy and the amount of work that you've got to put in, it goes up extra mentally.  It goes up colossally.  So... Anyway, that's the video.  Definitely not trying to sell you a utopian new ageism or anything like that.  Just wish for you to have a good life and not to fall into the potholes as you're cruising or walking down the road.  And there's plenty of potholes out there.  I just hope that I can give you enough information where you can kind of like sidestep stuff and see what's going on.  But anyway, that's the video.  Hope it's helped you out in some way, shape or form.  If you like the content, give it a thumbs up, pound the subscribe button.  And other than that, peace. ",
