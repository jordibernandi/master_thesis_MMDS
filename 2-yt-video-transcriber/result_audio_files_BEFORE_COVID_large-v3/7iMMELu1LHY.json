            "text": "So we need to talk about Moria.  It's one of the single issues in this crisis to receive almost more attention than anything.  It's this small little refugee camp about a 15 minute drive inland on the Greek island of Lesbos.  And this small camp has processed and received hundreds of thousands of Europe's refugee asylum applications.  It's a processing facility that's designed for about two and a half thousand people, but realistically holds around 10,000 in small tents surrounding the actual facility.  And the news reports that are coming out of this place are horrifying.  We've heard reports about starvation, murder, theft, the rape of women and children in these tents at night, and even that this facility is being used to filter ISIS into Europe.  So there's no doubt that this is a place we are going to need to visit while on our trip.  .  .  .  .  . ",

But since the beginning of The Borderless Project, my team and I have wanted to make this a free-to-view movie.  so that as many people can see what we have found as possible.  Because we, and I'm sure many of you who have supported and watched my videos, believe this is an extremely important subject that is going to shape the future of the Western world and just the world in general.  And so many people need more information on what is going on with migration.  The costs so far have been pretty crazy.  from security to flights to camera equipment, hard drives, just our CFAST cards, the little cards to store footage on are $200 each.  And thank goodness we've had many kind donors who have made that possible.  Every single dime that has been donated so far has been spent on making this project.  And we have gotten so much content that we never expected.  Borderless has become a massive project, unlike anything we could have dreamed of at the beginning.  So naturally, The editing costs have gone way up from what our initial projections were.  From scoring the film professionally, to having a server to store all of the footage that we've gotten, to keeping the website running and paying editors to make this film as high quality as possible.  It is a big burden on the project right now.  Of course, we're going to finish it, but it would be extremely just helpful if any of you guys want to contribute to making this last push to finish borderless possible.  we really appreciate everything people have put in so far and we could really use your help again right now to finish this movie.  i know you guys are going to love it and i'm so excited to show you borderless.
