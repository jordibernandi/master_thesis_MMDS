            "text": "Please, my friend, somebody answer a question for me.  Riddle me this.  Why does the Catholic Church even exist?  What's the purpose for it to even exist as a church?  I mean, if it was existing just as a fun house or as a liar's club or as just a cool place to get away and just kick back and listen to some lies and some fairy tales and just, you know, do what you want to do, be what you want to be, it'd be cool.  I'd understand it.  But 1.5 billion plus people in the world follow this church, belong to this church, and are being led to hell by the false doctrines of this church.  I won't go into anything like I've gone before.  I've found dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of things the Catholic Church teaches and preaches that are just totally demonic and lies from the pits of hell.  I've done hundreds of videos on it.  You can find them on my YouTube channel.  Just type in Catholic Church under DocKids.com.  But I'm going to talk about the newest thing now, the latest and greatest from this man, the Holy Father, as they call him, Pope Francis.  He's now saying he told all Catholics in the world.  Now, understand this.  If you're part of the Catholic Church, you, by default, accept their doctrine.  You accept what this man, Pope Francis, says because he is considered to be the equal of God in the Catholic Church.  And you accept what he says.  Whether you believe it or not, whether you want to admit it or not, you do.  Here's what he said.  He told all Catholics, and that's you out there, Catholics, to put all your trust in Mary, not Jesus.  Okay?  He just told all Catholics to put all your trust in Mary, the Virgin Mary, Christ's mother, not Jesus Christ himself.  That is the most blasphemous, heretical thing I've heard in my entire life.  Jesus Christ is the only way to God.  Jesus Christ is the one that died for our sins, rose again on the third day, praised the Lord, and went back to heaven to prepare a place for all true Christians.  He is the intercessor for us, between us and God.  He's the one that forgives our sins.  He's the one to worship.  We don't worship Mary.  We worship the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit only.  That's it, period.  And the Pope has ordered the Catholic Church to do this for the entire month of May.  It's the Mary month.  Just put Jesus on the side.  Just scrap him.  Put him off in a corner somewhere.  Listen to the Holy Father, he says, and just worship Mary.  Put all your trust in Mary.  I just don't understand it.  My brain can't wrap around the Catholic Church.  and i've got family in the catholic church.  i've got friends in the catholic church and it breaks my heart.  i know that many of you do as well.  i've warned and warned and warned.  that's all i can do and they just won't listen.  for the most part there's always a few that do and i praise the lord.  i've heard from catholics who have told me brother paul thank you so much for sharing the truth.  i've gotten away from that uh evil religion.  i've gotten away from that evil church.  i'm serving jesus christ the right way.  praise the lord for that.  if you have a friend that's a catholic if you know anyone's a catholic family member Share this video.  Go to my DocKids YouTube channel.  Copy and paste a bunch of my video links on the Catholic Church.  I go through A to Z. what's wrong with that church and what it teaches, all the lies, all the heresy, all the blasphemy, all the false teachings.  It amazes me.  This man, Pope Francis, I'm convinced, is the false prophet, just as I'm convinced that Barack Obama is the Antichrist, the unholy trinity, along with Satan, that are about to rule the earth because God's going to let them because man has turned their back on God in the Great Tribulation.  These guys will raise pure hell on earth while God reigns righteous judgment on the earth.  Why would you go through all this stuff, my friends?  The rapture is imminent.  Christ is about to snatch his bride away any second of any day.  And those who are left behind are going to be here for seven pure years of hell.  Where if God didn't intervene, no flesh would remain alive.  It's billions upon billions upon billions without the most grotesque, awful, terrible, horrific death imaginable man.  Why go through all that?  Jesus Christ is your only hope.  And no matter what you believe, repentance is a mandate.  Repentance is not work.  You're saved by grace alone.  You have to repent of your sins after you're saved to go to heaven.  Hundreds of scriptures prove that.  I've proved it over and over and over again.  And that's what it's all about, my friends.  If you don't believe me, you end up in hell like a fire.  Don't blame me.  I've warned you over and over again.  Love you all so much.  Don't want to see anyone die and go to hell.  It's been burned forever in the lake of fire.  If you want prayer for anything, again, contact me.  I pray for you every day without fail.  True Christians, witness and pray for the lost daily, and look up our redemption north, now you fly soon.  May God bless you.  Show Jesus Christ you care.  Share.  Get this video out.  And I've had friends tell me they appreciate that I keep my videos short.  I know your time is precious, like I've told you many times.  My time is limited.  I try to get all my videos under five minutes if I can.  Sermons I try to keep around the ten minute mark, maybe a couple minutes over.  I want to bring you the Word of God without fluff, without all the jajaja talking, just bring you the straight Word of God.  All glory to Him.  Praise His name.  Love you all so much.  Share this video.  Take care of yourselves.  And again, look up True Christians.  Our dip from Dorothy Nye.  Be flashy and the rapture is imminent.  Take care.  Bye. ",
