It was January, remember?  I don't remember.  Elizabeth Warren, solid pick, I know.  Nate, you picked Kamala Harris.  Claire, you picked Beto O'Rourke.  And Micah, you picked Amy Klobuchar.

In which city?  In Boise.  Here we go.  And I'm going to be boring but consistent, and I'm going to pick Elizabeth Warren.  In Tuesday night's debate, we got to see what it looked like when the rest of the field considered Elizabeth Warren as a frontrunner and spent the majority of their energy basically attacking her policies in particular.  Mean Pete.  This was back when, this picture was taken when it was Nice Pete.  But we got the opportunity to see how she would respond and how she would withstand those kinds of attacks.  I don't think that we're going to see significant movement in the polls away from her after the Tuesday night debate, which means that she will still be polling in the mid 20s to almost 30% nationally, still doing well in Iowa, still doing well in New Hampshire.  That puts her in a good position to win the Democratic nomination. ",

He's, you know, there are a couple of moderate candidates, Buttigieg and Klobuchar, obviously in that more or trying to be in that moderate lane.  But Biden is kind of the leader in that space.  And as I wrote in a piece a couple of weeks back, which you should totally check out, called The Front Runner?  Biden has a real base of support with black voters, which I don't think we should.  We can't sort of take that for granted for all these candidates.  You know, where I think his frontrunnership is a little bit wobbly is he's not doing that well in Iowa.  Pete's coming for him in Iowa.  His campaign has kind of said, oh, he doesn't need to win Iowa.  Warren is leading in New Hampshire.

I think it's pretty straightforward how you can imagine a world in which Buttigieg wins Iowa, gets a ton of money, gets a ton of momentum, goes on to bigger and better things.  Where things get interesting, though, is in who you pick next.  The reason I went with Kamala Harris instead of Amy Klobuchar is because Harris has had a higher ceiling so far in the debate, and I guess I'm trying to overcome a little bit of a recency bias.  Klobuchar had a really good night on Tuesday night.  Her electability scores in our Ipsos poll went up.  The share of voters considering her went up.  It was probably her best debate.

I think in a campaign where people are going to try to draw contrasts with the president, that positive message, we all need to have common values or common goals, et cetera, could resonate.  We're eight picks in now, so I'm not saying his chances are likely, but if something crazy happens, And we are down to, you know, the third tier.  It's not Michael Avenatti.
