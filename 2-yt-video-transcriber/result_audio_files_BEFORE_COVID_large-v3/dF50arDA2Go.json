            "text": "Hi you guys, how are you?  I don't know why I'm so nervous, actually I do, that's a lie.  But I'm so nervous about making this video because I feel like it's a chapter of something that's new, something that I've been toying with in my head for a while and been considering doing.  and i feel like with anything new that we try you know we kind of are like very vulnerable and kind of unsure sometimes if this is what we should be doing um and we don't really ever know what's gonna come of it.  so um with that being said i um.  that's the reason why i'm a bit nervous um but i just kind of wanted to share with you guys a few things that have been going on, that's gonna go on, and stuff like that.  So without further ado, let's get started.  Hi, welcome back to my channel.  I'm Kim Cohen.  And listen, I've been doing some thinking with myself for quite a long time now.  The reason why I came to this conclusion is that Last year I had a few really close souls and friends of mine pass away.  I cannot believe it's almost been a year, but it's been a year and that blows my mind.  When they passed away, I knew that my world was never going to be the same.  I've always taken death very personally, watching movies and things like that, but when it happens to you, when it's someone so young, I don't know, when it's someone that inspired you so much, it really just shatters your world and changes everything around you for better or worse.  This experience has been a little bit of both.  I think with every tragedy comes a revelation, comes an epiphany, comes an awakening.  And that's kind of where I'm at right now.  I can't believe that it took a year for this transition to finally happen.  come for tuition come about uh... but i'm just gonna give you guys a little snippet summary of what has happened with me in the last year.  so my friends passed away on july third uh... my friends from high on life which if you haven't seen that video enjoy me crying my life off uh... it was the first time that actually put my vulnerable self out there in the internet crying hysterically.  Anyways, I felt like the moment that they passed away.  there was some sort of media that I just was not happy with and I wanted to voice my opinion about these beautiful souls that have changed many, many, many lives.  And I wanted to spread love and goodness into the world like I always try to do.  And it was really important for me to share that message with the world and with you guys.  And since then, I've gone through a very spiritual rollercoaster of just a lot of things.  So two months after their passing, I was insanely depressed.  I couldn't function.  I couldn't do anything.  All I did was stay at home and cry.  And then my birthday finally came, and I was kind of trying to... snap out of it and I turned to writing and things like that and creating content like creating photography and writing that spoke to the soul and that kinda led me to it was very overwhelming.  basically my life was very nuts up until December where I guess I guess in short from July till December life was shit and no matter what I did And I did do a lot.  It just wasn't progressing.  Because I hadn't worked for two months.  I was trying to catch up.  And I was getting involved in more tragic stories.  And I just... It was not good.  It was not good.  I felt like the world around me was falling apart.  I felt like I needed a life makeover.  I felt like I needed a new purpose and a new meaning to everything.  that I've been doing.  And so since then, if you follow me on Instagram, if you don't, you should start now.  But if you've noticed, my photos have always been the same, but they've just kind of became a lot more spiritual.  My captions have been more spiritual.  They've been a lot of quotes and deep thoughts.  Always trying to spread love into this world.  And towards the end of December, I decided my life needs to change.  I need to change.  My life needs to change.  I need an awakening.  I need a sign.  I need everything around me to just change.  I was sick of my life.  I was sick of being a blogger.  I was sick of the people that were in my life.  I was tired.  I was exhausted.  I was just... not living my best self uh... for short okay so around December the end of December it was right around New Year's where I um I started to have a spiritual awakening.  um now I want you to understand something.  I've always been a very very very spiritual person.  some people wear it in their clothing some people live by it or some people keep it in their heart.  um I do a mixture of things.  I share it through my art of photography and caption and writing to my dearest and nearest closest friends and people that I, my nearest and dearest closest friends, but also to like random people that I just kind of feel like sometimes come into my life for guidance or that I meet.  I always try to spread love and joy.  and yeah so i prayed and i asked the universe and god to change my life to make things better to make me find my purpose again to make life more meaningful.  i was i was trying to figure out how i can change the world for the better and leave it a better place.  when i leave especially after just seeing what an impact my friends have made on people's lives and just seeing once again being reminded we all know life is short but just being reminded right in your face that life is super short i wanted to leave like a legacy behind and um so.  since the end of december beginning of january my prayers were answered and wildly amazing.  Out of this world, experiences have been happening to me.  I've been seeing sequences of numbers.  Again, if you follow me on Instagram, you know that I see the number 444 everywhere I go.  Every single day since the end of December, every day between 15 to 40 times a day, it just... It's everywhere.  I feel it.  I know.  Now I know that it's a sign from the universe.  But I've been having a lot of very cool, mystical, spiritual experiences.  I've been having illicit dreams.  I've been having my friends who have passed visit me in my dreams and give me... ",
