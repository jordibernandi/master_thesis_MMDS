            "text": "All esteem to the Most High Elohim, this is your brother El.  Let's begin at 1 John chapter 2, going to verses 19 and 20.  There's been a lot of brothers and sisters in the walk that I've come across and a similar testimony of experience from them all.  And also including myself is that many of the people who were instrumental in giving them information to wake them up to the truth and to get them on the narrow path.  Many brothers and sisters have had the testimony that a lot of these people are no longer in the walk or no longer there with them.  And it's not because the person passed away or anything tragic like that, but things change in life.  People change in this walk.  And I'm just here to tell you, for those that's new in the walk, not everybody that was instrumental in giving you information that helped wake you up will be around 3, 5, 7, 10 years from now and still on the path.  Some people were literally just used by the most high to give you that spark and give you that seed to get you going on the path.  But for whatever reason, some of them veer off and start going into other things.  So for those that's new in the walk, which I would say my channel is primarily aimed at those who are new so that they don't get thrown off track and become unstable.  So I really want brothers and sisters to know that that's nothing strange.  That's nothing weird when you are on this walk to worship the most high in spirit and in truth to keep his commands.  It is not a strange thing when you see people who you once looked up to or who once were instrumental in you getting that zeal.  for the knowledge of the most high, to see them start falling by the wayside and veering off into other doctrines or giving up the way altogether.  This is just something that takes place, family.  So what I want to do is go through some scriptures today that will give you encouragement and edification so that you don't lose your mind, so that you don't lose your faith.  when you start seeing some of those people that you once looked up to who were even instrumental in bringing you into the truth When you start seeing them fall by the wayside or relationships that you once had with people that were real strong, where y'all were doing the work of the most high together or whatever the case may be, or y'all were studying scripture together, y'all were very close.  Under the banner of the most high.  When those relationships starts to separate.  When people start veering off into other doctrines.  These things take place family and it's just a part of the walk.  But you have to make sure that you keep going.  You are not in this walk to be attached to people per se.  We do have to love our brother.  That is a command from the most high.  We do have to love our sister.  That is a command from the most high.  But at the end of the day, you are in this walk to be attached to the most high.  And then he will connect you with his other sons and daughters who are also attached to him.  So it's about attaching to the most high and reaching and striving for his kingdom.  And in the midst of you doing that, he will connect you to other brothers and sisters on that same path.  But it's not about connecting with the people before.  you.  connect with the most high.  Connect with the most high first and then he will connect you with the people.  Not all those people that you connect with will continue the whole way with you on the journey.  That's just a part of it.  So don't be thrown off whenever, you know, relationships go sour with people who, you know, you once had deep admiration, deep love for.  Don't be thrown off whenever people forsake the way and no longer are serving the father.  even if that person was instrumental in your very awakening, even if that person was the person that baptized you or was once an elder at the congregation, if that person goes off, to the left and no longer with the most high, don't let that drive you away from the most high.  I cannot make that point strong enough because there's also been brothers and sisters I've come across that have even said the person that baptized them is now no longer in the walk.  People that they once look up to that did so much for them are no longer in the walk.  So don't cling to people, cling to the most high.  Hallelujah.  Now, let's go to first John chapter two, starting at verse 19.  Here's what it says.  It says they went out from us, but they were not of us.  For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.  But they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  The scriptures right here is talking about that.  When it comes to this walk, there are people that may have started with you in this walk, but they will not end with you in this walk.  There may be people who did not start with you in the walk, but midway through the walk, you will connect with them.  Then there's people that you won't connect with them until you make it to the kingdom and see them there.  So during this walk, it's all about being connected with the most high above all things.  That's what it's about.  We must not forsake our brothers and sisters.  Yet, what we must know is that at the end of the day, people come, people go.  Relationships begin, relationships end.  But one relationship that must never end is our relationship with the most high.  And the most high, as long as we are focusing on him, we will always have that unction to love our brother and our sister.  Because as it says here in the next verse, verse 20, but ye have an unction from the Holy One and ye know all things.  That unction is what the scriptures say to owe no man but to love them.  Owe no man anything but to love them.  So as you're going on this path, even when you see people fall off by the wayside, people who you once admired, people who was instrumental in your awakening, even when you see them fall by the wayside, it's not that you hate them.  You just understand that they're going that way.  I'm going this way and I'm going to keep going on to the most top.  I'm not going to stop loving my brother or sister, but my main focus is making it to that kingdom.  That's what you have to understand.  So once again, to those of y'all that's new in this walk and even those who are not new in the walk, remember when you see people come and go in and out of your life or in and out of the walk, people no longer in the truth anymore.  It may hurt.  It may sting a little bit, but you got to keep going.  Because the scriptures tell us some very interesting things about the times that we're living in and the instability of people and the instability of relationships and the lack of love that will be in these days.  And that many people will go to and fro on again, off again, you know, in the way, out of the way, in your life and right back out of your life.  This is just.  it comes with the territory of being on the narrow road.  So let's go through some more scriptures that will give edification on why things are the way that they are.  Check this out.  Let's start at second Ezra's chapter six, verse twenty four.  Listen to what it says here.  It says at that time, friends shall make war on friends like enemies.  The scripture here talks about that in these days.  that true lasting friendships would be hard to come by because of the amount of iniquity and the amount of offenses.  As it says in Matthew 24 10, and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.  So we live in a time right now where It's very difficult for some people to have lasting friendships because some people are in and out of the walk, in and out of the way.  Offenses rise up and betrayal takes place.  This has been the experience with many brothers and sisters.  But the fact remains, family, we got to keep going no matter what.  If if certain people go this way, we go that way.  We still got to make sure that we are always on the narrow road.  That's a fact right there.  Always make sure that we are on the narrow road, never holding no grudge or no hatred with no brothers or sisters.  Not, you know, having animosity towards them because they decided to go this way while we're going that way.  The main thing is that we are staying on the narrow road unto the most high and not holding no grudges with those who may not be amongst us or with us no more like it used to be.  Don't hold no grudge.  Don't let it shake your faith.  You just keep going.  And I know there's many out there that have experienced this.  The very people who were instrumental in waking you up to the truth no longer in the way anymore.  Does that mean that it's any less the truth?  No, it does not.  The father used that person at the time that you met them to share those things with you.  Even if that person themselves wasn't going to endure all the way to the end, the father used them to wake you up.  So you just got to take that motivation and continue on and endure to the end on your path.  The marathon continues.  Hallelujah.  So, we must not be out here, you know, purposefully not fellowshipping with people and things like that.  It comes with the territory, family, that in this walk, some relationships will go sour.  In this walk, some people will separate.  Some people will no longer be in the way.  You will lose relationships and you will gain relationships.  You might as well just get your mind ready for that.  It's scars that come with the life and the warfare and the battle.  All you got to do is keep going.  Whenever one detaches, the father will bring somebody else to clean.  Hallelujah.  Some will cling with you all the way from beginning to end.  That's beautiful when that takes place.  There are some that will start the walk with you and y'all go on in the kingdom together.  And there are others where somewhere along the way, they'll go their way.  You'll go yours.  But you got to keep pressing on to the kingdom.  A brother that talked about this very well was the Apostle Paul and all that he went through on his journeys to do the work of the Most High.  He had some brothers and sisters that started the ministry and the journey with him and left them.  And he met others that he clung to them and then they began to do the work.  At the end of the day, the marathon had to continue.  No matter who left or who stayed, the marathon continues.  We must still endure.  Because what does it say here in 2 Corinthians 11, verse 26-27?  Listen to the things that he was going through.  It says in journeys often in perils of water, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren, in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.  Paul is talking about all these different aspects that he was going through, doing the work of the most high.  Relationships beginning, relationships ending, people coming into his life, people leaving out of his life.  But guess what he still had to do?  He had to endure to get his crown.  And that same Paul, later on, right before he was martyred by the Roman government, he said, I have finished the race.  I have come to the end.  Now is laid up for me a crown in glory.  That was his testimony at the end.  But you and me, brother, you and me, sister, we're still in the race.  It's not our time to end the race like it was Paul.  But there will come a day where we can say, I finished the race.  Now is laid up for me a crown.  I finished the marathon.  But understand that on this marathon to eternal life, some people is going to fall off.  Some people is going to be with you.  People come, people go, relationships come, relationships go.  Just make sure your relationship and your attachment to the most high is never shaken.  Keep going.  Endure to the end.  The marathon continues.  Hallelujah.  And I'm going to once again leave y'all with those verses in first John chapter two, starting at verse 19.  Let these words sink deep into your soul because you got to understand this, that on your path to eternal life, some people will come and go.  You'll look up in a year, two years, some of the same people that used to be so on fire and have so much zeal for the most high.  You'll look up and there'll be nowhere to be found.  They'll be back in the world.  They'll be in some other wild off the wall doctrine, whatever the case.  But you got to keep on that path that you know to be true and you know to be of the most high.  Once again, first John chapter two, starting at verse 19, then I'm out of here.  They went out from us, but they were not of us.  For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.  But they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  But you have an unction from the Holy One and ye know all things.  So brothers and sisters, whenever relationships go sour, whenever brothers and sisters stop believing and just drop the faith and drop the scripture and just fall out of the hunger games for eternal life, that's on them.  You make sure you keep going.  Hallelujah.  The marathon continues.  We must endure to the end.  That's all I got to say for today.  Join us tomorrow, Most High Will, where we will be on day 50 of this 50-day journey.  And then Most High Will on Saturday, we'll be doing a live stream.  I may even, who knows, I may do a little live stream recording tomorrow when we do our Passover meal.  We'll see.  It's all in the Most High's will.  We'll see what takes place.  But I definitely feel like great things are around the corner.  For this ministry, for the people of the Most High, I just pray the Father continues to give you the strength to endure.  No matter who's still with you or no matter who's left you, you keep going and I'm going to keep going as well.  Hallelujah.  All by the strength of the Most High.  Before I go, just want to remind brothers and sisters again about the works of the ministry.  Some of the recent projects we've done is the 613 Laws of Torah audiobook, which is an audiobook narrated by myself.  This is a five hour project that has all the 613 laws and commands of Torah.  No extra commentary, none of that, just straight law.  All the 613 laws of Torah.  I'll put the link in the description box where you can own that project.  You can also find it on Amazon Audible and Apple iTunes.  Just type in 613 Laws of Torah audiobook by Brother L. It'll pop right up.  That is an amazing study tool that you can use while you at work.  You can listen to the laws while you're riding in your car.  Listen to the laws while you're working out.  Listen to the laws while you're going to sleep at night.  It's an excellent study tool because scripture says faith come by hearing, hearing by the word of the Most High.  Scripture said that we must meditate on those laws whenever we come in, whenever we go out, whenever we sit down, whenever we rise up.  And having those laws and commands playing through the audio book at all times is something powerful.  You can download it to your iPad, your phone, your computer, whatever you want to do.  Check out that link in the description box to obtain that.  We also have the words of the father audio book, which is also narrated by myself.  That is a 14 hour project.  It's a 14 hour audio book with all the words that the most high spoke from in Genesis, where he said, let there be light all the way to the new Testament, where he said, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  We did that project because in so many of the Bibles, the words of the Messiah are emphasized in red, right?  But when the Messiah was here, he always pointed to the father.  So what we wanted to do is highlight the words of the father and do an audio book where it's just the words of the father himself speaking or speaking through the prophets.  A powerful meditation tool.  After you listen to all the words the father spoke from his own mouth, it just takes you to a different level mentally, spiritually, all of the above.  And then finally, we have the words of the Messiah audio book, which is a four hour project, which is just the same as all the other audio books.  But it's all the words of the Messiah that scripture records from Matthew to John, all his parables, miracles, interactions.  You can check that out.  I'll put the links to all those projects in the description box for those who want to own those and make an investment in those.  Check that out.  Also check out HI Fashion Store, Hebrew Israelite Fashion Store.  A lot of the images that you see on my videos, such as the revolution evolution image, such as the I love my roots image.  All those are available in shirts, hoodies, hats, all of the above.  So check out them over at HI Fashion Store, support Hebrew entrepreneurs.  And I'm really looking forward to tomorrow as we come on day 50 of this 50 day journey for Passover and we come solemnly to the Most High to give our offering.  We come solemnly to the Most High to pray, to seek him, to thank him for what he did for our people coming out of Egypt.  And we know that he's going to deliver us again, just like he did in Egypt.  So I'm very excited about Passover.  And you brothers and sisters, enjoy your rest tonight.  Stay focused on the most high and remember, endure to the end, no matter who is with you or who is not.  Shalom. ",
