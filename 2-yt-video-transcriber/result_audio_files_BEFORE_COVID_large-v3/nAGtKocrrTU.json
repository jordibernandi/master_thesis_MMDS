            "text": "Welcome to the debrief.  Everybody will take you back to the courtroom for testimony from Markeith Lloyd in just a moment.  But first, we now know the name of the police officer who shot and killed a Fort Worth, TX woman in her own home over the weekend.  Officer Aaron Dean was the person wearing this body cam in the overnight hours between Friday and Saturday.  A concerned neighbor called a non emergency police number because the door of a Tatiana Jefferson's home was open within seconds of arriving.  Officer Dean saw Jefferson through a bedroom window, open fire, and killed her, he was never attacked.  This is the victim of that shooting, Tatiana Jefferson, a pre-med graduate of Xavier University and sold equipment for the pharmaceutical industry.  Attorney Lee Merritt set up a GoFundMe page in her honor.  By mid-afternoon today, Monday, it was about $30,000 away from making a $200,000 goal.  The police chief there in Fort Worth called the shooting senseless and expressed sympathy, apologies, condolence and prayers from his entire department to the family of the victim.  Then he demanded action. ",

            "text": "We received many calls from the community expressing their concerns and demands.  I assure you as chief of this department, I share those concerns and I demand a thorough, transparent and speedy investigation.  This will not be an opportunity for us to make excuses, but rather to investigate this case to the fullest.  To provide the justice we all seek for Tatiana, the officer who shot Tatiana was served his written administrative complaint on Sunday.  At that time, he was also placed on detached duty, stripped of his badge and firearm.  My intent was to meet with him today to terminate his employment with the Fort Worth Police Department.  However, the officer tendered his resignation this morning before we met.  Even though he no longer works for the city, we will continue the administrative investigation as if he did.  The case will be completed and reviewed by the chain of command.  Had the officer not resigned, I would have fired him for violations of several policies, including our use of force policy, our de-escalation policy, and unprofessional conduct.  Additionally, the separation paperwork that is sent to the state licensing agency, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, will reflect that he was dishonorably discharged from employment with the Fort Worth Police Department.  Despite his resignation, the officer still faces criminal charges from the major case investigation.  I personally checked on the progress of that case repeatedly, and I anticipate a substantial update to provide you no later than tomorrow.  Additionally, we have also presented a preliminary case to the FBI to review the officer's actions for possible civil rights violations. ",

He had the ability to take cover and concealment.  He could have given orders.  He could have stood down and requested a backup.  There were all sorts of options that he had available.  We're taught and trained to use deadly force as a last resort.  We are only allowed to use that force necessary to overcome resistance or in the immediate defense of life.

He just tells her to put her hands up while aiming a blinding light in her face, and then he pulls the trigger just seconds later.  It was two seconds after he said, put your hands up, put your hands up.  Then she's shot and killed.  How is that in any way acceptable? ",
