It was notable that as they lost their heartlands in the north of England in the general election, the Labour Party's only gain was in Putney, an area in which the median wage is \u00a370,000.  I have long had a theory that what we are seeing is not a political phenomena but a religious one and that this strata of the middle class who cleave to social justice are a modern manifestation of what one might call the Puritan spirit.  Because I'm literally a communist!  One can see it, for example, in William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, in which two knights, Sir Toby and Sir Andrew, are united with two members of the lower orders, Feste the Clown and Maria the Servant, who serves in the court of Olivia, who is a noblewoman, against one of the middling sort, Malvolio, who is described in the play as a kind of Puritan.  The play is set during the festive period of Christmas.  Let's watch a little bit.  What ",

Indeed, it fueled the English Civil War and there was always a streak of it in the middle strata right through the Victorian period as well.  One can see it in the figure of Jeremy Corbyn himself, especially in the footage here.  He seems a prig and, well, a kind of Puritan.  especially when contrasted with the Falstaffian and Sir Toby-like figure of Boris Johnson.  One of the films that captures the essence of this sort of puritanical middle class and a personal favourite of mine is Mike Lee's Nuts in May.  Let me play you a little clip in which Keith Pratt and his wife Candice Marie have invited the hapless PE student Ray over to their tent ostensibly to take a photograph for them.
