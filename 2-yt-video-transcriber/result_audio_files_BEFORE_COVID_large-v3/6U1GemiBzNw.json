            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to Clownfish TV.  This is Neon.  We're going to talk about Disney Plus and mass cancellations.  The Mandalorian is over, and for a lot of people that means that Disney Plus is over for them until there's another season of The Mandalorian or other content they want to watch.  You know, and let's be honest, unless you're a huge Disney animation fan or live-action... Disney fan.  There's not really a whole lot on Disney Plus right now.  And a lot of people subscribed just for The Mandalorian.  Now, Clone Wars is coming back with a new season in a couple of months.  Not everybody is into the animated version of Star Wars.  And it's going to be a while until we get Obi-Wan and Marvel and all this other stuff.  You know, I don't think Disney really thought it through that well.  I don't think they really thought the rollout through.  I mean, compare the original shows on Disney Plus to everything coming down the pipeline from Netflix, and especially from HBO Max, which is really ramping up its content.  HBO Max looks like it's going to be the true Netflix competitor.  So we're going to talk about all these people ditching Disney Plus, reportedly ditching Disney Plus.  Now that The Mandalorian is over.  We did a review of The Mandalorian.  You can check that out.  Actually are pretty impressed with it.  We do not like the Star Wars sequel trilogy.  But The Mandalorian is pretty good.  It's pretty good.  But it's over.  So please subscribe for more pop culture news, views, and rants.  We're at about 85,000, 86,000 subs.  Hoping for 100,000 soon.  We're thinking probably January, February.  Something like that.  So thank you.  Yeah.  We talked about this a month or so ago.  A lot of people said.  that they were going to be unsubscribing from Disney Plus after The Mandalorian's over.  Of course, the last episode dropped on the 27th.  And you know what?  It's actually happening right now.  It's happening right now.  Comicbook.com just did an article this morning talking about all the people who are talking about on social media that they're going to drop Disney Plus because there's nothing else on the platform, on the streaming service, that they're interested in.  I guess they don't want to watch Bedknobs and Broomsticks or Welcome to Pooh Corner or anything like that.  Little Einstein's?  No?  Not interested?  Okay.  So this coming from ComicBook.com, people are canceling Disney Plus since Star Wars.  The Mandalorian is over.  So here are people on Twitter saying that they're going to cancel Disney Plus.  There are plenty of Disney Plus subscribers who are being none too shy about taking to social media to let everyone interested know they're done with Disney Plus.  Time to cancel Disney Plus.  Mando's over.  For some Disney Plus users, it's just that simple.  No Mando, no Disney Plus.  About to watch the Mandalorian finale and then cancel Disney Plus.  Wish me luck.  There were a fair number of Star Wars fans that made the Mandalorian finale viewing and Disney Plus cancellation a big doubleheader event.  This guy.  Is there anything worth watching on Disney Plus other than the Mandalorian?  I'm about to cancel this, bitch.  They're going to cancel the bitch.  Could someone else let this man know what the alternative options are on Disney Plus?  There's a lot of content.  Yeah, but it's not all content.  that's going to appeal to the audience.  they went after with The Mandalorian, is it?  Because Disney Plus is still, you know, despite it having Marvel, it's still a very PG, PG-13 movie.  G-rated streaming service, and it doesn't really have a lot to offer people who are used to edgier content from Netflix and Hulu, you know, etc.  So, yeah, they're going to have a problem.  Free ride.  I'm probably going to do the free trial of Disney+, so I can binge Mando and then cancel.  Does that make me even cooler?  People are willing to work the Disney Plus free trial system.  just to see it.  Here's another person.  I'm going to cancel Disney Plus now that The Mandalorian is over.  The new, look at me, I'm too cool for the room, quote.  This is the way.  This is the way.  I've seen this making the rounds on Facebook.  We actually had a friend of ours.  send this to us.  What made you cancel Disney Plus?  Mandalorian's over.  Other.  Mandalorian is over.  This is the way.  This is the way.  So this was not unexpected.  A lot of people said they're going to do this.  Now, what's going to be interesting is how this is going to affect the numbers of Disney+, because Bob Iger, during the last earnings report, said that they're not even going to talk about the numbers of Disney+, unless it's positive.  Then they're going to brag about it because they're bragging about how they supposedly stole a million subs from Netflix, which has worldwide like 150 million.  So I don't think they're too heartbroken about that.  But supposedly, they're not going to say anything about the numbers of Disney Plus until the next quarterly earnings report, which is going to be in like another month or so.  So yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how this affects the numbers.  Because Disney is banking, betting, betting the farm, betting the farm on Disney Plus.  And they have an advance right now because Apple TV Plus... is a joke.  Nobody's talking about this.  Nobody's talking about Apple TV at this point.  Everybody's wondering what's going to happen with HBO Max because personally, I think HBO Max is going to be the actual Netflix competitor.  We keep talking.  It seems like every other day they're announcing that they've got all kinds of animated content, including Rick and Morty and South Park, and there's exclusive anime, Studio Ghibli.  They've got brand new Adventure Time.  Doctor Who is coming, regardless of what you think, but it's coming to HBO Max.  They're bankrolling all the Rooster Teeth content right now.  Right out of the gate, HBO Max is going to have a pretty strong lineup because it's got everything Warner Brothers has ever done, everything that any of their divisions have ever done.  That includes all the cartoon network content, Crunchyroll content, all of that.  So they're going to come out of the gate swinging.  They're going to watch Disney and see what Disney does.  And they're going to learn from Disney's mistakes.  Now, I'm not counting Disney out.  I think in another year or two, Disney Plus is going to be pretty solid.  But right now, it's no replacement for Netflix.  Not even close.  So this came out a couple of weeks ago.  23% of Disney Plus subscribers are likely to cancel in the next six months' survey shows.  Yeah, because once they watch everything they want to watch and they watch all the new content, we don't have the new Marvel shows yet.  It's going to be a while until we get any of that stuff.  So, I think they're going to take a trip down memory lane, watch the Disney Channel shows or the animated movies they wanted to watch, watch some of the new stuff like The Mandalorian, The Lady and the Tramp, whatever, and then they're done until the service has more original content.  So the survey by ExpressVPN asked 1,500 Disney Plus subscribers about their viewing habits and opinions on the streaming service.  According to the survey, subscribers are most excited about classic Disney content, with original content like The Mandalorian coming in second, followed by Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars.  Other than The Mandalorian, only 5.8%.  National Geographic at the ass end of it all.  It doesn't surprise me.  I'm like, wait, they're putting National Geographic on Disney Plus?  Who cares?  So they said 81% said the nostalgia was the only reason or one of the only reasons they chose to subscribe to Disney Plus.  And I think that's huge because everybody was excited.  Hey, they got Disney Afternoon on here.  They got all these classic movies and we're going to watch them and then we're done.  We took our... We took our trip down memory lane and we're done.  While Disney Plus subscribers have had positive feedback about the streaming service, not everyone is planning on keeping the subscription long term.  ExpressVPN asked how likely subscribers are to cancel Disney Plus in the next six months.  23% said very likely, but 54% said very unlikely.  But 23 is a pretty high number.  Yeah, and a lot of people are jumping ship because of the Mandalorian.  So they said their numbers are reaching over 15 million.  We'll be watching to see whether nostalgia and investment in original content is enough to keep subscribers interested over time.  That's it.  This is a long game.  This is a long game.  We don't know what the end result of Disney Plus is going to be.  Disney owns a lot of stuff.  Once they get the original content out there, if it's consistently good, it's going to be a must-have.  But right now, other than The Mandalorian and The Vault, there's really nothing on Disney Plus.  that makes a case for why you have to have this in addition to Netflix.  And then we've got HBO Max coming, and then we've got Peacock coming from Universal.  I mean, people are going to be tapped out.  They're going to be tapped out.  Because at this point, to subscribe to all these streaming services, you're talking a monthly cable bill.  So much for cord cutting, right?  Here they said Disney Plus subscribers are enjoying the $6.99 monthly subscription rate.  However, if the price increased to $11.13 a month, which will happen, I can almost guarantee you, given the budget of these shows, it's going to happen.  Only 21% would stick around.  This is actually less than the rate of subscribers that say they canceled their Netflix accounts due to increasing prices, which was around 49%.  Yeah, this is true for us.  Around the time Netflix launched, the monthly subscription was $7.99 before the price hike in May, and now it's $12.99 to $15.99.  I think we actually paid $15.  I think we're on whatever the top tier is because we've got so many people streaming Netflix at this point.  But Netflix, you know, this is going to be interesting.  I think the top three are going to be... I think it's going to be Netflix, HBO Max, and Disney+.  I think Disney+, is... always going to be around.  It's going to be sort of that niche service.  Disney fans are absolutely going to pay for it, and there are a lot of Disney fans, a lot of Disney fans out there.  So I don't think it's going to go away anytime soon, but I don't see long-term.  I'm going to be honest, I don't see Disney Plus being a Netflix killer.  I see it being a complimentary service.  It's not going to kill Netflix.  There's just not enough content, not enough content that's going to appeal to audiences that like Stranger Things and The Witcher and other edgier content.  They just don't have it on Disney Plus.  They're going to push it over to Hulu, and I don't know how many people are going to care.  Back to this article on Forbes, and they're talking about how there really isn't any good content coming to Disney Plus in the near future.  The first show should be the Falcon and the Winter Soldier sometime in late 2020.  So we're talking a year.  People might leave Disney Plus for a year.  until the Marvel content drops.  After that, WandaVision, Loki, Hawkeye, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, and Ms.  Marvel don't even have dates yet and are likely not to be coming until 2021 or beyond.  This is not great.  I think there are two distinct groups subscribing to Disney Plus.  Families for the old content and new originals, like High School Musical and Lizzie McGuire, then big Star Wars and Marvel fans.  For them, Disney's scheduling only a single new season of Clone Wars for the entire next year and stacking all its big projects so far away seems like poor planning.  It won't always be like this.  Once all these shows are up and running, the ones that aren't miniseries will return for more seasons.  So I think Loki, yeah, they think that Loki and Obi-Wan are one.  I mean, how many adventures can you have with Obi-Wan when you spent most of his time living in a hut on Tatooine, right?  Disney will be able to spread them out throughout the year better.  For now, Disney Plus is trying to compete with Netflix, which at this rate is practically drowning viewers in original content week after week.  That's true.  I can't keep up with what Netflix is throwing out there and not all of it's good.  A lot of it's not good.  but there certainly is a lot to choose from.  There's always something new, and that's not true for Disney+.  It's not even close.  Disney is still revving up its engines on the runway, while Netflix has been in the air for ages now.  I think Disney should have mapped out its first year a bit better here, and it's not going to be able to capitalize on the momentum of The Mandalorian with no true follow-up for an entire year.  It's giving people a reason to unsubscribe after watching a single series, and that's not how you want to debut your streaming service.  I agree.  This was kind of a fail for Disney because, yeah, The Mandalorian got great reviews, even from a lot of disenfranchised Star Wars fans like myself and Geeky.  We loved it.  But, yeah, what's next?  Who cares?  Are we going to go watch The Last Jedi now on Disney Plus?  I don't care.  We're going to keep it just because I like having all the old Disney content.  But I have to be honest, I haven't watched a whole lot on the service because I haven't had time.  And a lot of the stuff on Disney Plus we already own on DVD and Blu-ray.  So I can watch it whenever I want to.  You know, so they've got a problem.  They definitely have a problem.  We'll see.  Maybe they're going to have to just make their money off of Baby Yoda merch for the next year or so.  to keep the money rolling in.  But it's going to be interesting to see how they spin it to investors during the next earnings report if they had a fall in subscribers, which I suspect they probably will.  They'll just talk about what a huge hit The Mandalorian was, how much money they're making on Baby Yoda merchandise, and they'll just ignore the fact that they had a lot of people jump ship.
