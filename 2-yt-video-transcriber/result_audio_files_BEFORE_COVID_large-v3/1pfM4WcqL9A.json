Well, well, well, look who's a little foot soldier for geriatric white patriarchy and wants to prevent women from ever breaking the glass ceiling.  To me this is sad.  Hoped they would back a woman for president.  2020 election needs a woman.  Oh AOC, really?  We've done the white male thing.  Every woman in Congress should stand in solidarity against the elderly white patriarchy and endorse Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren.  Or Amy Klobuchar, if you like a scrappy underdog.  There's really no excuse for a woman to be endorsing an old white guy in this race.  Not a one.  First of all, I love how one woman in particular is conveniently missing from their tweet.  Second of all, yeah, there is a reason.  If you like their policies better, that's a pretty big reason.  AOC, you should endorse Senator Women.  Senator Women.  Senator Warren.  Two fake Democrats whose sole mission is to destroy the Democratic Party from the inside.  That rules.  That's badass.  Did you mean that to sound bad?  Because that's awesome.  He's older and angry.  Isn't Warren progressive enough?  I will vote for a doorknob over Trump.  Who wants or needs to see two older white guys yelling on stage for hours?  Nobody.  Nobody needs that scene.  I need that scene.  I want to see Bernie and Trump go at it.  I want to see the grandpa fight.  Ick.  Why is she endorsing a 79-year-old white man?  Because she f***ing can.  AOC is no different than Ivanka in my eyes.  Same daddy lust.  What?  That's it.  I'm right-wing now.  I give up.  I'm right-wing.  Someone call PragerU.  Get me my own talk show.  The Libs have officially pushed me to the right!  I find it fascinating that women of colour overlook female and minority candidates to endorse a white guy.  Is identity politics over?  Is ideology more important than race and gender?  Yes!  It's like they almost get it.  They support liberal white supremacy.  And Bernie is the lead sheepdog.  They're all just liberal white supremacy.  What the?  I don't want to see Bernie or Biden or Beto.  All white guys again.  We've got a lot of talent on that stage.  No more old white guys.  Time for a change.  I like AOC and the rest of the squad, but I'm not with them in supporting Bernie.  we can do better.  What the hell does this even mean?  Like, do they not listen to the words coming out of the brown lady's mouth?  Do they not notice that the words coming out of the brown lady's mouth are basically the same things coming out of the white man's mouth?  Do they not care?  I'm so disappointed in your endorsement of Bernie Sanders for president.  Elizabeth Warren is the better choice.  I'm allergic to bullshit!  I don't know why you would pick RC Soda when, like, Coke is right there.  don't understand whatever.  we have had more than enough white men in charge.  it also spoke volumes that he did not attend any of the lgbtq town halls.  it speaks volumes.  first of all he dodged a bullet by not going to that town hall.
