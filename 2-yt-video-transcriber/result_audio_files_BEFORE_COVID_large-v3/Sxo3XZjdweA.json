            "text": "Dear Betty, don't you get exhausted having to save folks every darn time you leave one of your Christian homes?  How do you even have time for more important things like shopping?  Concerned Christian in Kentucky.  Dear Concerned, as Christians, it is officially our duty to bring the lost to Christ after a credit check.  But living in America and therefore absolutely surrounded by unsaved trash, I just don't have that kind of time.  Besides, sinners are like old handbags.  It's important to show discernment in picking which ones to save.  Just as not all sins are equal, all sinners are even less so.  For example, last week at Neiman Marcus, I ran into a rather annoying harlot.  I've hated out of Christian love since college.  I could tell from her shoes that she was still going straight to hell, and I really wanted to save her.  I really did, but... As she leaned towards me, I snatched the last laurel piano cashmere wrap before she could reach it, and she lewdly spoke of vulgarity across the display counter to express her disappointment at my agility.  As I tut-tutted at her coarse language, I reached into my Prada to pass her a much-needed Chick Bible track and an even more needed breath mint.  Fortunately, I caught myself at the very last minute.  She could and should have that breath mint, God knows, but not the eternal salvation.  that was far too generous.  After all, if heaven would just involve running into all the people I avoid here on earth, it would hardly live up to its name, right? ",
