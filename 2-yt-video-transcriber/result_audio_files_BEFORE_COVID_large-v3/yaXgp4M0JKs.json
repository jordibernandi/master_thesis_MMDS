            "text": "I came across this book by Ivan Ilyin that was recently translated into German.  I think it was re-translated and re-edited in 2018.  And what I found absolutely fascinating about that book is that Ilyin had the experience of Bolshevism, of the Soviet Union, and he was expelled from the Soviet Union.  He died in 1954, so it was in the early 50s that he had to leave the country, he was an orthodox philosopher, and his idea was that even at that time, and I think now it has undergone a potentialization, so it's much worse, is that Christianity as he saw it, global Christianity, not only orthodoxy, is kind of what the American alt-right people would maybe call cucked Christianity.  It's a kind of Christianity that does not stand for their values, for their purpose, for their... basic ideas anymore, and Ilyin had the idea that it is kind of a Tolstoyan reframing of Christianity.  He said, okay, reframing Christianity not as a religion that can fight for their own values, that can load people with the energy to fight for God anymore, but that is to be pacifistic in a way.  This is a misunderstanding of Christianity.  Just reducing the battle between good and evil, that is always a crucial and basic concept and a basic division within Christianity.  Reducing it just to plain love and love thy neighbor in a kind of stupid and caressing and peaceful sense that doesn't fulfill the aim of Christianity.  So this was Ilyin's main idea.  And then he said, okay, if you are a Christian, a believer, then you have to be kind of a fidei defensor, there's a person in Latin who is defending his belief.  And if you try to be that, you have to be a person of a strong character, and you have to be able to deal with the problem that it is a sin.  The resistance to evil by force is always something genuinely evil, bad, and sinful.  You can't get over it.  You can just say, well, you have to, and we have to deal with it, but you have to stand to this kind of being tempted all the time. ",

And it's quite obvious from the book that you consider the Islam as the new or old enemy because of this mass immigration.  Is this a correct summary of your idea?  Because that's how I read it, that you said, look, you know, Christianity, we need, again, ekklesia militants, we need a militant church, we need a militant Christianity to fight against an old, new enemy, which is the Islam, which is now invading our Europe through.  So if Trump would say, make America great again, you would say, make Europe Christian again. ",

I put if we have the same situation or if we have a kind of continuous historical situation that Christianity has always been genuinely European and always been a battle, a fight of Christianity against Islam.  And the second thing I want to add is it has always been a battle against the sinfulness of man himself.  It is kind of an inner, and so in everyone, and also an exterior opponent. ",

The same thoughts, I think we are living in a, like, the alt-right or fascist in general, they have a very selective memory.  They forget that in the past 100 years they brought two world wars, they made half of Europeans refugees themselves in the past 50, 60 years, and...

You can tell me your whole biography, but the problem is you are not the invasion, it's a mass.  Okay, let me just finish so you can hear what I have to say, please.  Mm-hmm.  So I was born a refugee.  Like I told you at school, they said the Holocaust never happened, whatever, I had all this hate and whatever toward Israel because they just came and stole our land and kicked us out.  But they didn't tell us the other part of history where Jews were hunted and killed and burned and gassed, and they had to flee with their lives and look for somewhere safe to live in.  That's why they flee for America, they flee for the Middle East and other parts.  So it took us... Years under the revolution.  when we did this revolution just to make our country a better place for all of us to live in I didn't risk my life in my school and my family to become refugee in Germany or to make you feel that I have come to invade you.  I wanted to stay in my own country and make my country a better place for everyone for Christians for Jews for anyone.  so as long as Can I please finish?  I was gassed with chemical weapons, with sarin gas, in 2013.  I lived for two years under siege.  I was eating from the rubble.  I used to hold children starving because they didn't have milk or anything to feed them.  I held children while they were suffocating because of gas.  I held children who were torn up to pieces because of bombs.  That's why we left.  We didn't leave because of an earthquake.  We didn't leave because we were like, let's spend the summer in Berlin or let's go out hiking.  We had to leave because the world didn't stick up for the principles, all the high principles you talk about for human rights and treating people as equals.  We have discovered in Syria, in the Middle East, that the world doesn't look at us as humans.  We are only statistics, we are only numbers, we are only children drowning in the sea looking for safety or getting gassed or freezing inside the refugee tents near Jordan and Turkey.  So we are not here to fucking invade Germany.  We are just looking for a place to start and just be safe. ",
