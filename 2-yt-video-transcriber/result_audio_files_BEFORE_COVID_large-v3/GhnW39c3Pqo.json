            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to Moon Ride where we are channeling the man in the moon.  I'm getting the message big time that first of all people need to hear some stuff, right?  I know a lot of you are really freaked out about a lot of things that are going on and it's up and down.  Sometimes it looks good, sometimes it's bad for getting rid of Trump.  But I tell you five minutes ago I have this picture of Trump in the White House and he is not doing well.  Let's just check and make sure this is not my fantasy and see.  Yeah.  Trump's really going nuts in the White House.  And you know, we've always seen him do crazy things and go crazy, but I mean, seriously crazy.  I mean, he is seriously becoming more and more.  He's not quite totally untethered from reality, but he's getting closer every day.  He sort of just rants and goes on these manic sort of rants as he storms through the rooms of the White House.  People are just trying to avoid him most of the time and just try not to get in his way.  They sort of cower in their rooms, praying that he won't show up, which is a safe place because he doesn't leave certain portions of the White House.  And he just stomps and stalks through the house.  He finds people and he yells at them and he asks people to come in and he starts screaming at them and ranting and ranting and ranting.  He's losing it.  He's just going to lose it.  And there's really no way that he can govern the country now.  We are in great danger if you're in America.  I should say, if you're in a democracy, you're under utter danger because this crazy person is just ranting around.  There's no one at the helm.  So, um, you know, for all practical purposes, he needs to be removed just because it is extremely dangerous.  And, you know, one thing is, you know, other people would have made plans like other nations, uh, towards our destruction.  But the one thing is he's so unpredictable.  They don't know what he would do.  Like he might actually do something and drop a bomb on them.  He just doesn't, in a weird way, his insanity has to some degree, uh, protected us, but you know, it just means that Putin is subtle in the way that he manipulates things.  Um, he's having some physical pain, like he's having pains in his chest.  I think it's some kind of, like, it's not a heart attack per se.  It's just tension and tension and tension and tension.  Tension is really bad for your body.  And the stress of the things that are going on are bringing him closer to a full-blown psychological break.  So just tell me more about this.  This might even happen by the end of December.  He is seriously having a psychological, running around, chasing people in the White House with a knife.  He's going to have a serious breakdown here.  And I have to say, as I'm seeing him, I'm shocked.  I'm shocked, I mean, after all these years.  But I did not... I knew Trump was going to lose it, but I just... I'm still shocked.  It's like breaking chairs against a wall.  Smashing 18th century grandfather clocks.  Just running around like a crazed maniac.  And then he'll go through these periods and that'll crash.  And I mean, I know that he is... They believed taking a lot of cold medicine, which is sort of acting like speed for him.  Yeah, he's just out of control.  He's out of control.  He hears what he doesn't want to hear and he turns the desk over.  He chases people out of his office.  People are just, you know, they're completely up in arms.  Everybody who works there is completely up in arms.  Everybody's whispering, like, what should we do?  What should we do?  Should we all walk out?  I mean, they're quite frantic.  Especially women.  I know he targets women, but these women are seriously afraid for their physical lives.  They're not just afraid to be yelled at.  They are physically afraid that he will harm them.  Yeah, and I always see him destroying important works of art.  I always see him, like at the end, that's where he's going to go.  Just start breaking, you know, priceless China and stabbing Lincoln's portrait in the face.  And it just, I don't know if this is symbolic, but there's a great deal of destruction going on.  Now, this is all very, you know, depressing in some ways, but in other ways, it's good.  This may be the way to get Trump out the door the fastest.  It's just, you know, the Republicans know this is going on.  They have eyes in the White House.  They know what's happening.  And they're just looking at me very glazed.  They're standing and it's like sort of half circle, like, uh, what do we do?  But I do feel, again, McConnell stepping up, he's walking across the room, And you know when a child is having a tantrum and none of the parents know quite what to do and then one of the parents in the room does know what to do and they go and they pick the child up and they put him in the bedroom and say, okay, you went through a tantrum, you can have one here.  Tell me when you're done.  That's like Mitch McConnell's rule.  It's like, you know, to try to get him up off the floor.  And now they're going to have to.  They almost like want to see this for themselves.  And then they're going to go later on and, you know, talk amongst themselves and say again, what the heck are we going to do?  And there is no good pathway for McConnell.  Getting rid of him will be bad for him.  Keeping him there will be bad for him.  You know, the one thing that's a benefit is getting rid of him.  It's a bad for him that he can control.  Right?  Trump is out of control.  You don't know what he's going to do not tomorrow to damage the party.  I actually see him physically attacking McConnell.  I've seen him do this before.  And again, I'm not necessarily sure this is literal.  It might be literal.  Often it is.  Sometimes it's a figurative thing that I see.  But I see him with his hands on McConnell's throat while guys pull Trump off of McConnell.  For some of them, again, I don't know if this is literal, but for some of them, this is the final blow.  This is where they're like, We cannot, we can't count on this guy anymore.  There's no way he's going to be in the seat for a year because he's physically attacking people.  He's going to kill someone and, you know, we'll be there with the blood on our hands.  Not to mention he's just attacked my colleague, my next, he's going to kill me.  Right.  This is the, it's a shock to the Republican party.  It's just a shock.  They're, they're trying to Find a way.  Congress is going to try to find a way to get him out of there quietly.  So get him to resign and threaten him and say, look, you either resign or we got an ambulance here.  We're going to take you away.  One or the other.  You choose.  Sign this.  Trump might just do it because he's so out of control and fed up.  This is the only way out.  He doesn't want to be there for another year.  He's staying there because he has to be to survive.  But he doesn't want to be president anymore.  Yeah, Melania is, I'm sorry, his daughter is not speaking to him.  She just doesn't go anywhere near him.  Jared avoids him as much as possible, and he just tried to work in his own little branch of the government.  Nobody wants to have anything to do with him, not his kids.  No one.  No one wants to be within 100 feet of that guy.  And even the soldiers are looking at this guy and saying, he is crazy, he's a menace, and his behavior is such that At certain points, they're wondering, do I need to stop this man?  He's a danger to himself, among other things.  He's just crazy.  I mean, even the soldiers are under orders to do certain things, but they're standing there wondering, should we do something?  I mean, they're talking among each other and saying, what are we going to do?  This is a, this is a danger to our society.  We've sworn to protect the president and the government, and this guy's a threat just by being nuts.  And I think there will be a major medical issue.  I don't know what it is, but there will be an issue in his chest area that will cause, he'll need medical attention.  And they're kind of watching this happening, and they're hoping it happens.  McConnell is hoping he has to resign because of medical issues.  He is praying that this is what will happen so he can get rid of this guy.  Then he can sort of insert Pence, et cetera, and things might get a little bit better.  So he's sort of praying.  the president has another cheeseburger.  And the worst thing about it for Trump is he won't take anybody's medical advice because he thinks he knows everything.  And because he lives in a total fantasy world, he won't listen.  So he won't stop eating bad foods.  He won't calm down.  He won't stop screaming.  And this is just, you know, bringing him closer and closer and closer.  I see him hit it, pull it with his hand to his chest.  And it might even be his stomach.  It might be some kind of ulcers and sort of, you know, fall forward on the desk.  It doesn't kill him, but it's serious.  And everybody's hoping this will make him leave.  Melania is hoping this will make him leave.  She's not so enamored of her husband.  Anyway, she is kind of hoping like, hey, if something happens, it'll get me out of this crazy situation.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Notice the reactions of people when he's around.  You know, you're always focused on Donald Trump.  But if you look at the cadre of people around him, you'll find that they're often looking at the ground.  They're not meeting the eye of the camera.  Their smiles are completely fake, if they're even able to smile.  Notice that in the next month, that the faces around him, If you focus on them, they will tell you everything about what's really going on.  You'll see fear and confusion and just a sense of, oh my God, what are we doing here?  And just an idea that they can't really hold it together anymore.  I even think McConnell's wife might, might actually give him a piece of her mind.  And she finally gets angry.  She finally says, look, you can't act that way.  I don't know why she's showing up, but maybe it's because he's done something with McConnell.  But she's almost on the verge of calling him out in front of others.  She's almost there.  She hasn't yet.  I mean, she goes home every day and tells McConnell what this crazy person's doing.  They stare and stare at their plates over dinner and try to figure out a way out.  It's a trap.  So on the high note about all of this is that even if we were still thinking 50% isn't enough to get rid of him, it is.  Trump knows how this is going to end.  And, uh, best case scenario is he loses the next election and then it gets prosecuted.  This is driving him mad.  So if you think that all the past three years were for nothing and et cetera, et cetera, no, they brought us to the point here where Trump is completely unable to do most of the damage that he wanted to do to this country.  He has, he has completely, uh, lost, um, any kind of, um, agency, uh, such that he's been neutralized.  Uh, and so consequently, I do think that this is going to be good for the nation.  I don't think that much more damage is going to take place from inside or outside.  Because to some degree, the nation is protected.  Yeah, it, it, it has almost like a, almost has a circle around it.  It's sort of, um, It's sort of been contained in a way, and I can't explain how that's happening.  But this is the best case scenario, right?  Trump sort of self-destructing.  That is the best way because it means he can't do any damage in the meantime.  And it also means they will have no choice but to remove him.  I keep getting December.  Something's happened in December.  Really?  Really?  So Spirit, does he exist next year?  Okay, Spirit's just telling me to stop right now.  I don't think it's clear what dates are available, but I do know that something will happen December 31st, New Year's Eve.  I don't know what it is, but I wonder if Trump's not going to really make a fool of himself somehow.  Yeah, maybe he might be removed in June.  But that's a big fat maybe.  I don't think we really know much more.  It's not decided yet, the hour of his departure.  But this physical problems with his body has already, it's already started and it's getting worse.  Thanks for watching. ",
