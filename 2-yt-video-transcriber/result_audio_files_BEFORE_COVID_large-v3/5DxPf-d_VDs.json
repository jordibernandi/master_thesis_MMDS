            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  In the previous video, we spoke about that the Feast of Trumpets, coming up September 29th, sundown, is not the new year.  If you have not seen that video, there'll be a link in the description bar of this video.  In this video, I'll be doing a general rundown on the Feast of Trumpets, Yom HaTorah, why and how to celebrate the Feast.  If we understand the why, we'll understand the how.  As believers in Yeshua, in Jesus, And not what the rabbis teach, not what the Pharisees teach, but what the Word of God teaches, in context.  When studying the Word of God, it is always very, very important to put all the focus on Yeshua, Jesus.  Yeshua is the Word.  This is not only applied to the Feast of the Lord, it applies to the whole written Word of God.  Psalms 40, verse 7.  Then I said, Here I am.  I have come.  It is written about me in the scroll.  Hebrews chapter 10, verse 7.  Then I said, Here I am.  It is written about me in the scroll.  I have come to do your will, my God.  So the first main thing that we can see here is that our focus needs to be on Jesus, on Yeshua, not on the rabbis and on religious leaders.  We find all the feasts of the Lord mentioned in Leviticus chapter 23 and Beginning with verse 2.  So we can see here that they're not the feasts of the Pharisees.  They're not the feasts of the religious leaders.  They're the feasts of the Lord.  No man can claim ownership on them.  Now let's break it down in the Hebrew text.  speak on to the children of israel.  if you're born again in messiah yeshua grafted into the olive tree romans 11 17 then you are spiritually israel and part of the commonwealth of israel.  what paul speaks about?  ephesians chapter 2 verse 15 to 18 the one new man.  so the bible verses that say speak on to the children of israel.  Speak to all those under the blood of Jesus, Yeshua, and say unto them concerning the feasts of the Lord.  The word feast there is the word in Hebrew moed, and moed means fixed appointed time.  So it says, speak unto the children of Israel, that's you and I, concerning my fixed appointed time, which you shall proclaim.  The word for proclaim there in Hebrew is the word kara.  And it means to market, to make recognizable.  In simple Christian language, preach the gospel.  So what God is saying here in Leviticus chapter 23, verse 2 is, speak on to the children of Israel, that's you and I, concerning my fixed appointed time, which you are to preach, to be holy convocations.  The word for holy convocations in Hebrew is, and what it means is, A dress rehearsal.  Many have interpreted it to be a gathering in a congregation, but the Hebrew text says it is a dress rehearsal.  So it says, Speak on to the children of Israel, that's you and I, and say unto them concerning my fixed appointed time, which you shall preach, you shall proclaim, to be a dress rehearsal.  And then he ends by saying, even these are my feasts.  He emphasizes two times, even these are my fixed appointed times.  Even these are my feasts.  When Yeshua, Jesus, was walking in his ministry in the flesh, every time he says, verily, verily, it was something very important.  Well, here in the text, he's saying, verily, verily, two times, even these are my fixed appointed time.  So we're beginning to see how God wants us to celebrate not just the feast of trumpets coming up, Yom HaTorah, but all his feasts.  So first of all, very important to realize that we have an appointment with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  We are called the Bride of Jesus, the Bride of Yeshua.  But we are in the patrol process right now.  We have not yet consummated the marriage.  And until that time, during the patrol process, we have an appointment with the groom.  Part of his appointments are the Feast of the Lord.  If a man patrols a woman and they set up appointments to meet and get to know each other and they don't come to the appointments, is there going to be a marriage?  The answer is no.  In the same way, if we want to consummate the marriage and make it to the end, we have to go to the appointed times of the Lord.  God doesn't want us to hide these feasts.  He wants us to proclaim it, to mark it, to make it recognizable, to preach the gospel, to share with the brothers and sisters that don't know that these are appointed times, that have been taught that it's a new year instead of the Feast of Trumpets, to share the truth with them.  and to be sanctified, dying Messiah Yeshua daily, and prepare ourselves for his second coming.  What the Bible says, we are to become Yeshua-like, Christ-like.  How can we become Christ-like if we don't go to meet the groom and have a relationship with him?  Holy convocations, Mikra'i Kodesh, a dress rehearsal.  A dress rehearsal to what?  How?  There are three main points for the dress rehearsal, three main keys.  Key number one.  to prepare ourselves for His Second Coming, to consummate the marriage.  Because in the Feast of the Lord are multiple fulfillments pointing to the Second Coming of Jesus Yeshua, even the feasts that were fulfilled.  The Feast of Trumpets.  Just like in the book of Revelation, Hidgalut, there are seven trumpets.  The seven trumpets do not blow at one time.  In the same way, the idioms in the dress rehearsal of the Feast of Trumpets don't blow at one time.  They're dress rehearsals.  So we have an appointment with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords once a year.  It's an appointed time.  But the dress rehearsal is all year long.  That is the sanctification process, to get to know the groom, the dress rehearsal.  If we come to the appointment once a year and don't get to know the groom all year long, we will not be prepared, we will not be ready.  This is key number one for the dress rehearsal.  Key number two, to proclaim and to preach to our brothers and sisters who are born again and don't know about the feasts, who've been told that they're the feasts of the Jews, that they have nothing to do with them.  Other brothers and sisters who've been told that it's the new year and are following the rabbis instead of following the written word of God.  We are to preach the gospel to them.  This is key number two of the dress rehearsal.  And finally, key number three, to the Jews in Israel and around the world that are celebrating these feasts but don't know Messiah Yeshua, don't understand that Yeshua is the feast, Yeshua is the word, who have been taught that it's the new year.  As we're going through the dress rehearsal, we are able to share the truth with them.  So we're still focusing right now on why we celebrate the feasts, There are three fall feasts.  The feast of trumpets speaks of repentance.  The feast of Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, speaks of redemption.  And the last and final feast, the feast of tabernacles, speaks of rejoicing.  If there's no repentance, there's no redemption.  If there's no redemption, there's no rejoicing.  I'll be doing a future teaching video also on the feast of Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, and the feast of tabernacles.  The Feast of Trumpets, Leviticus chapter 23, verse 24.  Speak to the children of Israel, that's you and I, saying in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a Sabbath rest.  In Hebrew, it is a high Sabbath.  A memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation, a dress rehearsal.  High Sabbath means whatever day it falls on, that day is to be a Sabbath.  So we can see that it is a day of blowing the trumpets.  Does that mean that you and I need to blow the trumpets?  Very important to emphasize, it's an idiom.  Yes, you can blow the trumpets, but you don't have to.  In the Bible, the sound of the shofar, the trumpets, are also God's voice.  It's also our worship.  So when we worship with our voice to the Lord, it's like a trumpet.  So you can blow the trumpet or you can worship to the Lord.  It's a heart issue.  We find the Feast of Trumpets again in the book of Numbers.  Chapter 29, verse 1.  On the first day of the seventh month, you shall have a holy convocation, a dress rehearsal.  You shall not do any ordinary work.  It is a day for you to blow the trumpets.  And in Hebrew, Yom HaTua.  Yom, day, Tua, blowing.  The day of the blowing the trumpets.  Let's go back to Leviticus chapter 23, verse 24.  Notice it says it is a day of memorial.  Now the word there for memorial is the word Zachar in Hebrew.  And it doesn't mean a memorial like you're memorizing someone that died last year, you're going to memorial service, it's a different word, different meaning.  It's to remember God.  If God does not remember a person or a nation, it means that God has rejected them.  If we do not remember God, we have rejected him.  If we remember the Lord... The Lord will remember us.  Malachi 3, verse 16.  Then those who feared the Lord and spoke to one another, and the Lord listened and heard them.  So a book of remembrance was written before him for those who fear the Lord and who meditate on his name.  Remember, the Bible says God wants us to speak to each other, to preach, to proclaim, to market.  That's what it speaks about, the remembrance.  If you remember the Lord, the Lord will remember you and write you in the book of remembrance.  And that's what the word memorial there means.  Okay, so how do we celebrate the Feast of Trumpets?  By remembering the Lord, coming at this point in time, singing, praising, and preparing ourselves for His second coming.  Psalms 89, verse 15.  How blessed are the people who know the joyful sound, O Lord.  They walk in the light of your countenance.  God is not searching for a religious ceremony.  He's searching for our heart.  As we wait for the final and last trumpet, 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 16.  For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command.  with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God.  And the dead in Christ, in Yeshua, will rise first.  Let's celebrate the Feast of Trumpets together and wait for the final call.  As we continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of Ahariye Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
