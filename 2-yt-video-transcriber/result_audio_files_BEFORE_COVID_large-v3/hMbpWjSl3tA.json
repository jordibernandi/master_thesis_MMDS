So when you head over there and subscribe, tell them that ABL sent you.  how's everybody doing?  my name is anthony brian logan and today we gotta talk about this video i came across on facebook.  that is totally ridiculous.  apparently there's this quote-unquote gender studies professor who says that black women's obesity is because of racism.  now i thought about Everything that I have heard related to racism, you know, economics, the cultural thing, but obesity and racism is really weird.  But before I even get into it, let's go ahead and roll the clip.  This comes from Oprah Winfrey's network.  No surprise there.  but in this video you'll see the so-called professor talking about whatever she says.  after we get done with that i'll talk about what she said.  give you my two cents and then i'm wrapping on up with a nice bow on top.  so without further ado let's go ahead and roll it.

The research says that black women, when we do the same diets as white women, we lose less weight and we lose it slower, even when we're following the diet than our white women counterparts.  And what public health practitioners think is that our stress responses in the body change our metabolism. ",

            "text": "It's literally that the racism that you're experiencing and the struggle to make ends meet actually means the diet don't work for you the same.  Okay, so you saw that, you heard what's going on, you see what's going on.  Now that was ridiculous.  I mean, I've seen some ridiculous things in my day, but that right there was right out there at the very top.  The first thing I wanna address is not exactly what she said, but the reaction to what she said from the crowd.  And she was like, well, we're in the Trump era.  And then the crowd was like, hmm.  I was like, really?  Like, y'all believing in this?  You understand what I'm saying?  You're not going to be like, oh, well, maybe racism ain't the reason why people are obese.  Just maybe.  Maybe I really don't agree with that.  You're like going along with it.  This is ridiculous.  This is totally absurd.  But how are you going to even mention Donald Trump in your argument, I guess, to say that obesity is not your fault?  By the looks of things, I don't think this young lady was slim, slender, fit, chipper, and all that kind of good stuff under the Barack Obama years.  I'm just going to go out on a limb.  I know I've seen her before.  I think I did a video about her.  And if you have seen that video I did about her or somebody that looks kind of like her, you let me know in the comments.  But anyway, I don't think she was like the face of physical fitness in 2014 or something like that.  This has probably been going on for a very long time, but I digress.  How are you gonna blame anybody else for what you have done to yourself or what you do not do for yourself, all right?  And we gotta talk about this argument of income inequality and poverty being kin to obesity.  When you don't have money, you're not gonna be able to eat.  When you go to third world countries, you don't see 400 pound people talking about I'm poor because they don't have money.  They don't have access to food.  If you're truly in poverty, you're not going to have food, period.  When I was really broke, didn't have money.  I was really slim.  Like right now, I'm probably about 225.  But back then when I didn't have any money, I'm like 180, maybe like 175, something like that, because I'm eating a small amount of food per day.  And you can eat healthy with a low amount of money, okay?  You can have rice, beans, broccoli, chicken breast, I've done it.  Been there, done that.  This lady here appears to be going to Golden Corral every day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, just scarfing, chowing down, okay?  If you're doing that and you wanna do that, hey, that's your business, I ain't judging you.  I think you probably shouldn't because of your health.  I want you to stay alive.  but beyond that i think you have enough money to be able to eat.  poverty is not even an excuse.  and when you want to talk about uh you know access to certain food i mean what kind of food do you need access to?  there's rice everywhere.  you can get rice in the middle of nowhere in third world countries.  so why can't you eat rice?  why can't you boil up some rice You know, get some broccoli or something like that.  It's not that hard to find.  OK, you can get rice shipped to you.  So I don't hear nothing about no food desert or nothing like that.  That's a total cop out.  One thousand percent cop out.  OK, you can go get your hair done, your nails done and all this and that.  But you don't want to take care of the most important thing that you have with your body.  I'm just not really with it.  I think a lot of black women have issues with obesity because of a cultural thing.  Eating food to have fun and partying and hanging out.  That's really what it is.  Also not really wanting to go to the gym, not working out.  That's a big thing.  Now I will not just say it's a black thing because you got a lot of other races that are very obese as well.  You have it a lot in some of these poorer areas in the country because they eat a lot of times for boredom.  You understand?  Like when you go to some of these bigger cities, people are walking around, they don't really have cars like that, and they're more preoccupied with their work.  they don't have that much time to just sit there and eat all day.  But when you're not working, you get access to government assistance, food stamps, WIC, EBT, TANF, SNAP, et cetera, you're gonna eat pretty much whatever is right there, and you're gonna have an abundance of time to eat whatever is right in front of you.  That's kind of how it is.  Oh, I'm bored.  Let me go to Applebee's and scarf down three hamburgers and wash that down with Coca-Cola with, you know, one cube of ice in it.  That's pretty much how these things are going.  Obesity, diabetes.  This is why these diseases are... really high among the poor is because they eat too much food.  you can eat food that is quote unquote bad for you once a day but you're eating that three times a day plus snacks even before you go to bed eating while in bed.  that's going to make you be obese.  it's very simple.  i used to weigh at my height probably about 280 so i know what it is to go down a lot and then to come back up into a comfortable weight.  i know how to eat food.  The main thing that you got to change is your eating habit.  Now, she said that black women can eat the same thing, the same kind of diet as white women and not lose any weight.  I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'm pretty sure there are other variables to talk about.  You got to control for other things like, I don't know, exercise, physical activity, even if not going to the gym.  How about, you know, walking a little bit during the day, you know, not parking in a handicapped spot when you're not handicapped.  Walking into the store and not use one of the little buggies to get around.  You understand what I'm saying?  Stuff like that.  Basic lifestyle decisions.  That could be a reason.  Culturally, you got to tighten up.  like i said it's not simply a black issue white issue and definitely not a political issue.  i think it's an issue of people that have access to things they probably shouldn't.  too much food too much time will equal an obese person if you are not regulating your time and your food consumption appropriately if you eat to have fun a party and stuff like that and there is no exercise No physical activity.  You just sedentary all day, every day.  You're going to balloon and get up there and wait.  You're going to be on 600 pound life before you know it.  Hopefully this lady, Brittany Cooper, does not end up on 600 pound life.  I think she's too busy going around the country doing these speeches on white privilege and stuff like that.  But I digress.  I think she's preoccupied, so maybe she won't get that big.  But I think I'll leave that right there for now.  And what say you?  Do you think that Ms.  Cooper, that's her name, Brittany Cooper, do you think that she was correct talking about?  we're in the Trump era and obesity really affects black women more and all of that and a third?  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  Or do you think that she is not Correct.  What I think as I close is that this is all just kind of a game to go out here and get money from doing these speeches, detox or whatever.  This is the same lady that said that somehow time is racist.  I think she said that white people own the concept of time.  And to break it on down to its core of what she was trying to say in the argument, to say that a black person is on CP time, color people time, or that black folks are late, or to even accuse a black person of being late might be kind of racist because white people on the concept of time, it's theirs.  So to have us adhere to their standards is bad.  Like the quote unquote white beauty standard is, People like this seem to be fringe.  They seem to be kind of far out there.  But this lady was on television talking like this.  OK, people like this get invited all over the country to Fortune 500 companies.  A guy named Tim Wise, who has this book called White Like Me, even though he's Jewish.  But I digress.  This dude is a total SJW, same as Sean King and the rest of them.  He gets invited to speak at Apple, if I'm not mistaken, or Google, or both.  Now, how much do you think he got paid to speak at Apple and or Google?  Okay, just think about that for a moment.  And then you're doing that consistently all day, every day.  You know, you might have five, six speeches a month, maybe more, maybe 10.  You're constantly in the airport.  How much do you make doing that?  I think this is what it's all about, not about anything real.  She can use her obesity and her gigantic size to somehow prey on your emotions and think that, oh, well, she's big like that because, you know, orange man bad, racism, slavery, just ridiculous stuff.  But whatever your comments are, please let me know in the comments below.  And that's all I got to say for this video.  If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share, and subscribe.  Peace.
