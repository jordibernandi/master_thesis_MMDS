            "text": "A lot of us woke up yesterday with the heartbreaking news that the McKeon family, Toby and Amanda and their children, were mourning the loss of Truett.  And so Truett, as a 21-year-old, passed away this week.  And it's so heartbreaking.  You know, parents should not go to their children's funerals.  Their children should go to them.  and for their funeral.  They should see their children outlive them.  And there's nothing more heartbreaking than when a mom has to get ready for memorial service this week.  And so we heard about that news, and we began to pray.  And I was talking to Toby, or just texting Toby yesterday.  It dawned on me that one of the songs, the last time he was here at convocation, that he had allowed me and Kevin to listen to on the back deck of my house at lunch was a song that his son, as an artist, was beginning to develop and work.  And so literally this morning, just in honor and in memory of Truett, I asked Sal if he would let Cody and him listen to it just for a few minutes.  And I kid you not, they listened to it in about two minutes.  In about two minutes, they began to just compose something.  And so they're going to use it as an introduction of a bigger song.  that really is the hope in a moment like this.  And so if Amanda, if Toby, if you're watching, your Liberty family is with you.  We're praying for you.  We mourn with you.  But here's the good news.  In all of this tragedy, we know that this is not an ultimate goodbye.  We know that Truett belongs to the Lord and that he's ultimately healed and he's in heaven.  And for us, heaven is an imagination of a preferred day.  It's a vision of where we end up.  But for him, it is right now a present reality.  And so I want to show you this video.  This was Truett's first and last concert as a solo artist.  It was last week in Nashville, Tennessee.  Here's just a little snap of when he was there so that you can see the song in its essence.  And then right after that, Cody and Sal are gonna together begin our time of just remembering them and really more than anything else, knowing that the gospel gives us hope in dark hours.  And so let's watch this together. ",

Toby and Amanda, brothers and sisters, who are today getting ready for just a really, really tough season, just know that we put our hands towards Nashville and we're praying for you.  Toby, you're not just a Liberty alum.  You're a great servant of God.  You're an evangelist.  God has used you to minister to so many people throughout the years.  Who knew that when you were a student in one of these dorms that God would raise you up to be such a strong, loud voice?  We've watched God use you to bring so many people home, to in tough hours give so many people hope.  And so, in this hour, brother, for all the people that you've ministered to, all right, it's your turn to let us minister to you.  And so I just wanna ask the 12,000 people in this room, if you've been ministered to in your past by that family, and it's not just Toby singing and entertaining and ministering, it's what Amanda and the family did by sacrificing to let him be out on the road.  If you've been ministered to by that precious family, will you just lift your hand as a testimony that God has used Toby in a great way in our lives.  And so Toby, it's our turn now to pray for you, brother.  Lord, we pray.  that although sorrow is deep, that God, through that, the worship will go deeper.  God, we can't imagine what it would be like to lose a child, but we can imagine that despite that, in the midst of that, that you have not left that family, and so we pray that you hold them dear and near.  We pray for stamina in the next few weeks, and we pray for strength.  And God, I pray that they would not waste this moment, that it would deepen their faith.  And I pray that, God, siblings won't get bitter, but they'll get better at their faith.  I pray, Father, for all those who are in this moment waking up to the reality that life is fragile.  It is a vapor here.  And I pray that, God, even in this hour, that through tragedy, you would create testimony.  That in the next few weeks, we'd hear about those who've come to Christ because Truett's death made them come face to face with the question of eternity.  Made them come face to face with the reality of heaven.  And so we pray for our brother and we pray for the ministry that will come through this.  Just lift them up.  We pray this in your name, Jesus.  Amen. ",
