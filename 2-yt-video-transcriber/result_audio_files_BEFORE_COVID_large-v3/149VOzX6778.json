            "text": "So here we are in an ancient Jewish settlement just south of Hebron in what is now the West Bank in the southern Hebron Hills just on the edge of the Judean desert in ancient Susia.  Here in Susia we find the remains of a Jewish town dating back almost 2,000 years.  you must think, well, yeah, it's a nice place.  It's some nice evidence of some historical Jewish communities.  But there's something of great interest here.  for us being here today because this community has all the usual stuff, the houses and everything, and a synagogue, but what is in the synagogue may well shock you, but it's pretty unknown to the general public just the significance of what we can find here in the synagogue.  Let's have a look.  So this is Aramaic, I believe, and it translates to remembered for good.  Yeshua, the comforter, martyr witness.  How amazing is this?  In a synagogue, from the year 300 to 400, probably around 350, just a few generations after the apostles and disciples and Jesus himself, just a few hundred years, we've got a messianic synagogue calling Jesus the Comforter.  martyr, witness, remembered for good, in a synagogue, in an ancient synagogue.  And then over this side, we have a scene that looks very similar to the book of Revelation, a scene from the book of Revelation.  These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks. ",
