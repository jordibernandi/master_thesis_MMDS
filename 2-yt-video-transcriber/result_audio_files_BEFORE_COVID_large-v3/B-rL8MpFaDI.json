            "text": "Yep, and I want to stop right there, because some people associate that, got to be with water, as you have to be baptized.  And that is the last thing that Nicodemus would have thought of.  Now, Jesus expected him to know the Old Testament.  After all, he's a Pharisee.  He's teaching the Old Testament, all right?  So, he thought that he would know this upside and down.  And let me give you two illustrations why this does not apply to baptism with water, okay?  because in the Old Testament it's never associated that way.  Water is associated with God doing something in a human heart.  I'll give you two examples, okay?  One is in Ezekiel, chapter 36, and the verses are 25 and 26.  God says, hey, I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean.  I will cleanse you from all your impurities, from all your idols.  Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you.  And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of  flesh.\".  Then let me give you another one.  That's Jeremiah 33, verse 8.  God says, I will cleanse them from all the iniquity they have committed against Me, and forgive all the wrong that they have committed by rebelling against Me.  So, here God says, I will cleanse you.  I will change your heart.  And that's what Jesus was expecting Nicodemus to get out of these words. ",

            "text": "And, John, to anyone who's listening, who depends upon baptism to be saved, their faith is spurious.  It is a wrong faith.  And it is not the faith that is necessary to get into heaven.  Now, let me be very clear.  Obviously, Nicodemus would have thought of those verses.  That's correct.  He would not have thought of baptism.  And furthermore, Jesus says He's not talking about two births.  He doesn't say, unless you're born of water and born of the Spirit.  He's talking about one birth where there is water and Spirit, the cleansing of the Spirit and the transforming work of the Holy Spirit.  In fact, John, it just dawned on me.  THAT IF JESUS MEANT WATER, THAT MEANT THAT.  HE WAS NOT EVEN PARTICIPATING IN HIS OWN TEACHING ABOUT SALVATION, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BAPTIZE ANYBODY. ",

            "text": "NO.  SO JESUS HERE IS TALKING ABOUT A WORK OF GOD IN THE HEART, OF CLEANSING AND OF THE MIRACLE.  SO HERE'S THE WAY WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT.  Human birth puts us into the human family, all right?  And what we need is a divine birth that is a miracle of God to make us members of God's family, children, sons and daughters of God's family.  And this is a miracle that must happen.  You know, Billy Graham was preaching in Europe, and a famous theologian, Billy, was preaching on this text, said, Billy, there's nothing wrong with your message, but I wish you wouldn't emphasize that little word, must.  And I heard Billy Graham in preaching saying, but I emphasize it because Jesus emphasized it.  You must be born again.  And Jesus goes on to talk about the fact that that which is born of the flesh is flesh.  We're all born of the flesh.  We're born into the human family.  And that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  So we have to ask those who are listening again, John, we cannot overemphasize this really, we have to ask them again, are you born again?  And don't tell me that it happened when you were eight days old and baptized, or when you were baptized as an adult.  It is true that in the book of Acts, baptism was often associated with salvation because it was assumed that if you believe, you'll be baptized.  But the thief on the cross proves to us that baptism is not necessary for salvation.  It is faith in a Savior who is actually qualified to save us. ",
