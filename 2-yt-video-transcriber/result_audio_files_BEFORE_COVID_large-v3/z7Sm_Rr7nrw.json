So if you have a suggestion for my next vlog, comment down below and let me know.  And who knows, you may just see it on the next vlog.  Okay, let's get into today's video.  First of all, let's talk about the ingredients that go into making this smoothie.  So the first thing you're going to need is two cups of water.  You're also going to need half of a lemon juice.  And you're going to need about two Honeycrisp or Gala apples, depending on which ones are your favorite.  I love either or.  These happen to be Honeycrisp.  And how much you put of the apples just depends on how sweet you want your green drink to taste.  I love it to be very sweet.  So I'm going to add about two apples, two full apples that I just sliced, as you can see here, and I'm going to add this to my smoothie.  You're also going to want a handful of kale for the extra punch in vitamins.  And I chopped off about a handful of parsley that I'm going to use for this green smoothie recipe as well.  You're also going to want ginger.  Now, you gotta be a little careful with ginger because it's very potent.  I don't like too much of a gingery taste in my green smoothie, so I'm only gonna add about two little cubes that I already chopped off ahead of time for my smoothie.  So just be careful with how much you're adding.  But ginger's really great because it's full of anti-inflammatory properties that are really gonna help you if you're dealing with any sort of inflammation in your body.  So make sure you add that as well.  Last but not least, you're gonna want a nice handful of organic spinach that is clean and washed and ready to go.  Okay, and now we're gonna go ahead and use our Vitamix.  that's back here.  We're gonna add it to the blender.  one by one.  So I'm going to start off by adding the two cups of cold water.  Next we're going to go ahead and add the spinach.  And also the kale.  Next we're going to add the parsley.  And now we're going to add the apples.  Next, we're going to add the ginger.  And last but not least, I'm going to add this lemon juice.  So I'm just going to go ahead and squeeze it all on the top of the apples, just like so.  Make sure you get that good juice in there.  Lemon is really great for detoxifying your body.  It's awesome.  And just juicing in general really helps you, you know, cleanse out your system, get rid of all those toxins in your body, and just really give your body a healthy start to start off your day.  And we are going to blend.  Okay, so you want to start on like a low speed.  So I'm starting at like the number two in my Vitamix.  And once I know it's really gotten going, then I'm going to move it up five.  Now I'm going to do six.  Okay, and you know that it's pretty much done when you see everything blended and all you see is the green in there.  And now I'm just going to pour it into this glass cup.  And there you have it.  Your green smoothie recipe from Nectar Juice Bar is all done.  Cheers.  It tastes so, so good.  I just love this green smoothie recipe because I love how it makes me feel.  And the great thing about making it on the Vitamix is that all the pulp and all the vitamins are still in your smoothie.  So this is great because the pulp is where all your fiber is and you need fiber to really flush out the toxins in your body.  So I actually prefer this over the one that they sell at the Nectar Juice Bar because the Nectar Juice Bar only has the juice of all these vitamins that, you know, all these vegetables that are in it.  So this is really great.  So cheers.  I hope you enjoyed this video.  And if you did, please give it a thumbs up.  Don't forget to like and subscribe.  God bless you.  See you next time.  Bye. ",
