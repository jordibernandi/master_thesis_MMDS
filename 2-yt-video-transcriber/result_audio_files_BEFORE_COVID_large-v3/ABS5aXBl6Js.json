            "text": "Thank you.  Yes.  You know what I noticed in places like that with aluminum?  Sometimes it goes up just so you can look down and everything.  Like it may not be a functional floor.  Let me see, I wonder what they make.  It's definitely interesting.  They make flowing catapult tiles.  They make who?  Oh, premium surfaces it says.  Huh.  Huh?  It does all of them.  Every one of them.  Huh?  You're a natural stone.  This guy's going really slow.  Hello.  Yes boss!  What's up man?  How are you?  What are you doing?  You want to take a snap?  Huh?  Take a picture?  No, this is a radio.  I want to give you a ride.  Oh, crossing guard.  Cool.  How are you?  It's okay.  So you don't shaken me?  No, I don't shaken you.  Why?  Because I don't know you.  Don't take a picture of this.  Oh, well, I'm taking a picture right now.  Why?  Why not?  Just a minute.  I take a picture of you.  Okay.  I don't care.  Why is he so angry?  Why are you so mad about pictures, man?  Your behavior is not good.  Huh?  Your behavior is not good.  Not good?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Really?  So who says?  You should turn it sideways.  You'll get a better picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Do you want me to stand in the light?  Or... Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here.  Go for it.  Go for it.  Okay, keep protecting.  You are a good person.  You are a very good person.  What's your moral authority to make such decisions, man?  That's hilarious.  Don't take pictures.  You're very bad.  I don't understand.  And then he drives away.  I mean... That was a little strange.  That was very strange.  I don't want to shake his dirty hand.  Did you see it?  It looked like a baby's foot that had been through the war.  Oh, he's going to his little security booth.  Hopefully he's got a flashlight in there.  Hopefully he's got a flashlight.  Oh, he's walking.  Look, look, he's walking fast.  He's mad.  This is hilarious.  Why do people, again, why do people assume that it's wrong to aim a camera at their building?  It's very bad.  Very bad.  Not a good person.  yes i mean he seemed like a nice guy at first.  oh there he goes.  oh the door opened for him.  it opens for everybody.  probably.  What's over here?  Oh.  This must be the stuff he doesn't want us to take pictures of.  Can't really see too much anyway from there.  There's like two security booths.  There's one inside.  That's weird.  Is that him down there?  Driving around the street?  Do you think he called that guy?  I mean, it's just a camera.  It's kind of hilarious actually.  Now he's back inside the fence walking fast again.  These mirrorless camera gatherings get low very often.  Make sure I put the right one in.  It's just a little bit low.  I'm gonna end up probably cutting most of this out.  The talking to myself and all that.  Oh yeah.  I should... Okay.  Do you have permission?  I do.  Oh my god, it's the 9-1-1 call of the year!  Oh, it's not against the law, she said.  Wow.  You're in public.  You're in public.  I don't need your permission.  I'm going to get the license plate of your car from the front.  So you learned something?  That's what I'm doing.  I don't need your okay.  I don't need your okay.  I wasn't stopping, dude.  Did you see me stop?  I don't care.  Why not?  You know, I wasn't even taking your picture until you came up to us and started talking to us.  You should just stay home and shut your doors.  You know?  Just stay under the covers in your bed if you don't want anyone to ever take your picture.  But I can hear the lady on the phone say, yeah, that's not illegal.  Yeah, I heard it.  I don't think the microphone picked it up, but I heard her say it too.  Sir, that's not illegal.  But you're taking pictures of the building without permission.  That was the best ever.  Now he thinks that we're stalking him, but we're just going to our car.  He did it.  Hey, you know what?  He did it to himself.  I pulled the pepper spray out because you never know.  I just had it in my hand.  I didn't aim it at him.  Took the flashlight out because he looked a little erratic, but didn't have to use either of them.  So that was good.  But there's two of us.  If it was just me, who knows?  all right look at that.  okay guys this is the ultimate walk of shame.  it was the drive of shame and now it's the sitting on a chair of shame behind his car smoking on his little lounge chair.  that's the the sit of shame right there.  i don't think there's been a set of shame before so it's a first.  i coined it he's starting new thing.  yeah i'm not even an auditor and i started a shame thing.  it's really dark.  i don't know if you guys can even see that car over there.  yeah i don't know.  see you later man.  hey temple of doom be cool.  good luck at the crossing guard thing.
