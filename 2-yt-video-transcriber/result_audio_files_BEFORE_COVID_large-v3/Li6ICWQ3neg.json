            "text": "How you doing, sir?  Good, man.  Everything okay?  Yeah.  We're just kind of curious on what you're videotaping.  Is there any reason why?  Just personal reasons.  Like?  Like my business.  I don't know.  Just personal reasons.  I like photography.  Okay.  I'm within the law, so I'm not worried.  I understand.  I'm not saying that you can't videotape.  I don't want to speak to you no more, though.  We're just trying to figure out what's going on.  I don't want to speak to you no more, though.  I have the right to record.  I can put SB-411 in my pocket if you want to read it.  You never said you couldn't record.  Well, I don't understand why you're bothering me, though.  Because it's kind of suspicious that you're out here videotaping all of us.  In a bright Sherbro on a bright day, then you shouldn't be a cop if you're that incompetent.  You think I'm a threat.  You're never saying you're a threat.  Well, then why would you stop?  You didn't stop for everybody else.  Stop for who?  Is there anyone else out here?  There's other people walking around.  You didn't stop for them.  Is that against the law, sir, since you're going to speak?  You want to be on Front Center, you too?  I'm just curious.  You're the smart guy, right?  I'm just curious.  Well, be curious.  Five cop cars just... Did I commit a crime, or... I just want to know your name.  What's your name?  I don't know your business.  You guys approach me different, it'd be different, but you guys come up all... I didn't approach you in any wrong way.  He did.  Who?  The gentleman that was over here.  Who was that gentleman?  Oh, you guys are all together like a gang.  I got his license, so it doesn't matter.  I'm going to cross the street so I can just disengage.  This is America, you know.  We're allowed to take pictures without being bothered by police.  Exactly, exactly.  So why are you wasting taxpayers' money and go do your job like you're supposed to?  You're not doing shit right now.  So are you.  I never had a problem with it.  You're the ones who have a problem with it.  Waste of taxpayers' money right here.  How's it going?  How much?  I just told them I'm taking pictures and they're trying to get my ID and all this stuff.  I don't understand.  Why am I doing nothing legal?  Because I can.  I mean, but the way they approach me, like I'm some kind of criminal or something.  Was it normal to take... cameras at a police department?  is it illegal?  is the question not normal?  is it illegal?  is the question is it illegal?  no but it's not normal right?  is it illegal?  it's strange.  which yeah which which is the legal part of it is illegal.  i already told you it's not illegal.  so then i tell you that as many times i ask i think no i don't.  well then don't answer common sense.  is it's not normal right?  No, it's not normal because you guys made it not normal.  Not because of us.  You guys put all the... Do we go to your house and... You can.  You can as long as... You won't give me your information, so how can I do that?  Why would I do that?  You guys are public officials.  Do I get my money from you?  No, you get my money from me.  I don't know.  Do you work?  Yes, I do.  Then obviously you pay taxes.  Yeah, well, check it out.  If I go in that store right there, I pay taxes.  Okay.  That's how it works.  He's not willing to give us his information or anything.  No, because the way I was approached by the first officer, you know, he would approach me different.  I would have just said, hi, how are you doing?  Hi, how are you?  Good, sir.  How are you doing?  What can I do for you?  Name's Phillip.  Nice to meet you.  What can I do for you?  Nothing.  I was just taking pictures.  Okay.  That's it.  And then the other officer was kind of rude to me.  Okay.  Can you tell me why you're taking pictures?  I tried that already.  Just curious.  I mean, but why here?  I mean, there's a lot of places.  We've been doing a lot of places.  We did a couple other places today, too.  Do you work for a magazine or anything?  No, I have a YouTube channel.  What's your YouTube channel?  Independent Journalist.  I really just keep it.  Maybe I want to go look at it.  I'll send you guys a message when it's up so you guys can check it out.  Alright, do me a favor.  Just watch out for the driveway so you don't get hit by a car.  I have no intentions of going on your property or anything like that.  Well, he's treating me like a criminal and he said it's suspicious.  I highly doubt that.  And, well, I can't show you the video, but I told him, how is it suspicious that I'm in a bright shirt?  Well, it's highly suspicious when somebody stands out at the side of a police station with a camera.  Really, sir?  I would debate that.  If I was hiding somewhere, then I would see the suspicious.  But if I'm in plain sight, in the sun, in the middle of the day, with a bright shirt, I think that you should put a little bit of your discernment in there.  I think it's just you trying to draw attention to yourself.  You know what it is?  You know what it is?  I think you just got owned, and that's what you don't like.  That you can't ID me, and you can't do nothing. ",
