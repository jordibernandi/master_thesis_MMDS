            "text": "This is important for Christians everywhere.  I had a vision that shook me, Pastor Jim, to the core of my being.  I had this vision before the mass shootings.  I believe it was about maybe seven days ago.  I was in prayer.  In my house.  And spending time with the Lord.  When all of a sudden.  I had a clear cut open vision.  And this vision I saw a goat.  I saw a goat.  And the goat was bloodied.  It had blood all over it.  Everywhere it would move, it would leave footprints of blood.  It had so much blood on it, you can hardly even see the skin of the goat.  But then I looked at the eyes, there was innocence in the eyes.  And I said, God, I looked at this goat, but I could see innocence in the eyes.  And I said, Lord, what are you trying to show me?  He said to me, Francis, this is the battle for 2020.  He said to me that the cabal that rule America, who have tried to get Trump out of the White House, first they tried to stop him from winning, and they've tried to get him out of office since then, and their hopes were hanging on the Mueller report.  And we found out that the Mueller report was nothing but a dud.  They realized that when Mueller came before Congress and it became clear Mueller knew less about the Mueller report than anybody in that whole place.  It became clear that Mueller never wrote that report.  It became clear that this thing is not going to go anywhere.  So the Lord said to me, is this God?  I said, yes.  He said to me, this strategy that the enemy is about to use against Trump to stop him from having another four years is a double-edged strategy.  He says, because this time, it's coming from the underworld and from the political establishment.  I said, what do you mean?  He said to me, a sacrifice has been made in the demonic world.  And the new strategy is going to be to make Donald Trump Bloody.  The bloodiest president in American history.  He says, how Lord?  He says, they are going to make him the scapegoat for every bloodshed that happens in America till 2020.  Oh my goodness.  He said, look at the goat.  He's bloody.  It's not his blood.  It has been put on him by those who want to make the God look guilty for things that God did not do.  That's the innocence you see in the eyes is the innocence of this man.  His desire is to serve his country.  He's a patriot at the very core of his being.  He loves America.  Yes.  But the cabal, no, since he has refused to play by their rules. ",

The reason they hate him is because the cabal has tested him and he keeps fighting back.  So they realized, okay, if you're not going to be one of us, we're going to destroy you.  So God gave to me and said, Francis, I want you to study the scapegoat in Scripture and prepare the body of Christ for the fight for 2020.  He says there is a solution to win the White House, but you need to understand that the demonic configurations around Donald Trump have changed and the intercessor cannot pray for him like they did in 2016 because the enemy has changed tactics.  You need to know what the enemy is doing. ",

            "text": "You see, God used the scapegoat strategy to rescue us from our guilt.  Jesus did not just pay for our sin on the cross.  Jesus was both the lamb of atonement, but he was also the scapegoat.  Because sin produces a guilt.  So just because you are forgiven does not mean the guilt has left you.  So God understood redemption must be two prong.  It must deal with the sin and your memory of your own guilt.  So God would have the scapegoat strategy where one died for the sin, but the scapegoat was the one where the high priest would come, lay his hands, because the scapegoat must do something the atonement lamb did not do.  Take away the guilt of the people from what they have done.  So I'm going to read you three scriptures that are very powerful, then I'm going to apply them to the fight for the White House for 2020.  And it says in Leviticus 16 verse 10, And then the Lord said to me, go to verse 21.  And in verse 21, Pastor Jim, here's what it says.  Very interesting stuff.  It says, He says, and Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live God and confess over it.  He shall lay his hands, both of his hands on the God and confess over it.  What was the confession about?  Is it confessed over it?  The iniquities of the children of Israel.  Notice that God didn't do anything.  What's being confessed, being spoken, being reported about the God has not been done by the God.  It's the iniquities of the people, but they're being placed on the God.  so everybody thinks the God did it.  He's guilty.  God said to me, Francis, those two hands is the progressive left and the publicans was. ",
