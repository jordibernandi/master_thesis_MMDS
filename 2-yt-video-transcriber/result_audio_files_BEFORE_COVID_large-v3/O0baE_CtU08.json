Today, in this special broadcast, we begin with the words of Frederick Douglass.  Born into slavery around 1818, Douglass became a key leader of the abolitionist movement.  On July 5, 1852, in Rochester, New York, he gave one of his most famous speeches, What to the Slave?  is the Fourth of July.  He was addressing the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society.

Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice embodied in that Declaration of Independence extended to us?  And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?  I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary.  Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.  The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common.  The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by me.  The sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me.  This 4th of July is yours, not mine.  You may rejoice, I must mourn.  To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems where inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony.  Do you mean, citizens, to mock me by asking me to speak today?  What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July?  I answer, a day that reveals to him more than all other days of the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is a constant victim.  To him, your celebration is a sham, your boasted liberty an unholy license, your national greatness swelling vanity, your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless, your denunciation of tyrants brass-fronted impudence, your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery, your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy, a thin veil to cover up crimes that wooded that would disgrace a nation of savages.  There's not a nation of the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour.  At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument is needed.  Had I the ability and could reach the nation's ear, I would today pour forth a stream, a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke.  For it is not light that is needed, but fire.  It is not the gentle shower, but thunder.  We need the storm, the whirlwind, the earthquake.  The feeling of the nation must be quickened.  The conscience of the nation must be roused.  The propriety of the nation must be startled.  The hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed, and the crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced. ",
