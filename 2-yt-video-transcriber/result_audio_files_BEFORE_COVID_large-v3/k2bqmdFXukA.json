            "text": "But first, water.  Hey guys, welcome back to Life with Donna vlogs.  If you are new here, I want to welcome you to my community.  And I want to encourage you to not leave without hitting that subscribe button and that notification bell, clicking to all so that you can be notified every single time I upload a new video.  You know, I really created this community to help you be successful in every area of your life.  And I have so much in store for 2020.  I'm actually on a like really natural high lately because I'm just so excited with what God is doing in my life and what God has in store for the future for me.  And he's already been revealing things to me just, you know, in this month in January where I know that I'm going places.  And I'm really excited because, you know, when God puts a purpose in your heart, he fulfills it until completion.  And I'm really excited to share this video with you guys today because this is something that I feel like we all should have.  And I'm talking about a prophetic word.  You know, in the beginning of the year, you should have a word that you can hold on to, a word that is prophetic in your life, that's really going to tell you, you know, what to look for in this coming year.  And I've been doing this for about four years now.  You know, it's something that's not that new to me anymore, but it was at one point in time.  I have no idea what that even meant.  What does it mean to get a word from God?  But actually one of my really good friends, she told me that in the beginning of the year, God would always give her a word.  And I thought, wow, that's so cool.  I wanted that, you know, and I started praying and seeking God about it and asking him, Lord, give me a word for every single year.  I want to know what to expect in the coming year.  And sure enough, you know, our God is faithful and he did just that.  And so if you want to know what my word for 2020 is, please keep watching this video.  Now, this is something that the Lord gives you.  You know, nobody gives you your word.  You have to dig deep within yourself and ask God, you know, God, what is my word for this coming year?  What can I expect, you know?  And in 2017, my word was excellence.  And, you know, he was kind of like almost like leading me to excellence.  He wanted me to have to have an excellent year, but it was almost like something that he wanted me to do.  You know, he wanted me to be excellent in everything that I do, to do things as unto the Lord.  And sure enough, I did.  And I had a blessed year, lots of open doors.  I traveled a lot that year and it was just a really great year.  It was an abundant year.  full of excellent things that happened in my life.  And then the following year, I didn't really like my word that much.  You know, the following year, my word for that year was proactive, proactive.  And I thought proactive, if I'm being proactive, that means I need to get ready for something that's not necessarily good, right?  And the very definition of proactive actually means that you are acting in anticipation of a future problems needs or changes.  And so I already kind of like, like was preparing my heart for what was to come in that year.  And I'm so glad that I did.  And I'm so glad that I grabbed a hold of that word.  that was for me because it was a rough year for me.  2018 was a very rough year, you know, not only in my professional life, but also in my personal life.  And had I not known, you know, what to expect or had, God not prepared my heart with that word that was proactive, I would not have been ready for what was to come.  And if I wouldn't have been ready for what was to come, I probably would have fallen apart, honestly, because it was such a tough year for me.  So I thank God so much that he gave me a word that I could hold on to, a word that was exactly what I needed.  And it prepared me.  It really did.  It prepared me for what was to come in 2018.  And my word for 2019 was restoration.  And I'm so happy that he gave me that word because it was, it was a promise that he gave me that I have, I still had to hold onto because the promises of God were not manifesting in the natural, you know?  So I really just had to grab a hold of that word and believe that God was going to restore me, you know, that he was going to restore my life again.  And surely, Slowly but surely, he began to do that in 2019.  He started restoring things that were taken away from me.  And they took a long time to come, but thank God that they finally did.  But also, it was a way that he was preparing my heart.  Okay, you're not going to see it right now, but it is coming.  So just hold on to what I'm giving you.  He said, restore.  Restoration is coming.  And I did, and I held on to that word.  And he's still doing it.  He's still restoring so many things in my life.  Okay, and now I'm going to reveal what my prophetic word is for 2020.  Are you ready?  Drum roll, please.  My word for 2020 is honey.  Woo, honey.  Can you believe it?  Oh, I'm so excited about this word because this is my promise that I get to hold on to for 2020.  This is what believing God to do in my life you know and let me tell you how it happened.  let me go back in time a little bit.  so in December you know one of my co-workers came over to my house and we had dinner and she brought me this exaggerated amount of honey.  and because she knew that I loved it I love honey.  I drink it with my tea all the time when I'm not fasting and I And it was just so much like there were so many little jars of honey that she brought me that they literally just ended up all over my house because if I was drinking tea in my living room, there was a jar of honey there.  If I was in the kitchen, there was a jar of honey or two, you know, they were just everywhere.  So it was like a constant reminder, there's honey all over the place.  And I was like, okay, that's kind of weird.  I've never had that much honey in my life.  You know, so that started.  And then after that, God gave me a dream.  And in this dream, I'm eating honey with bread.  So I'm like dipping the bread in the honey and then I'm eating it.  And if you know anything about, you know, revelation and the word of God and what things mean in the word of God, you know what bread means.  Bread is the word of God.  You know, that's why when Jesus was tempted in the Garden of Gethsemane by the devil, he said to the devil, his response to the temptation was, man shall not live by bread alone, but out of every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.  that was his response to the temptation that he was facing.  So we know that, you know, the bread of life is the word of God.  And honey, I looked up the representation of honey in the Bible and it says delight, joy, prosperity, abundance, and even fertility, which, wow, there's just so many great things all in one, you know?  And let me tell you that I'm ready for this word because I've had a few pretty rough years.  You know, these past few years have not been easy for me.  I've had a lot to deal with, a lot of trials and tribulations and things in my personal walk and in my family and just different things like that.  So I'm really excited about this promise that the Lord is giving me for 2020.  And I'm just so blessed.  And I wanted to share this with you more than anything to really just encourage you to seek after your own word And believe God for whatever promise he's giving you.  You know, he backed this up with scripture.  And the scripture is found in Leviticus 20, 24.  The word of God reads, But I have said to you, you shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess.  A land flowing with milk and honey.  I am the Lord your God, who has separated you from the people.  And I love this so much.  This is the promise that I'm standing on for 2020, that God will take me into the land flowing with milk and honey.  And I just love this promise so much.  And I want to encourage you that it's not too late to seek out your word for 2020.  It's not too late.  We're still just in January right now.  You still have February.  You have the whole 11 months of the year waiting for you.  Now the question is, are you going to be ready with your word?  Are you going to allow the Holy Spirit to just quicken you, to speak to you, to allow you to dream and to hold on to a promise or a word that's really going to help you bring out the best in you in 2020?  I believe that your time is now.  And if you're watching this, I want you to know you're not watching this by chance or coincidence.  God wanted to meet you right here on this vlog.  And he wanted to remind you that it's not too late to seek after him, to seek after his will, to ask the Holy Spirit, Lord, what is my word for 2020?  I want to receive a prophetic word for 2020, just like Donna did.  All right, guys, well, that is all for today.  I want to thank you so much for watching this video.
