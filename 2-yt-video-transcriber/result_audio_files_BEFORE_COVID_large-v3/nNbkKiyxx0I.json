            "text": "Hey guys, I'm at work, back again with another unscripted rant video.  I have the little lavalier mic.  If you can hear the truck in the background, there's nothing I can really do about that.  I'm driving around.  But basically, I wanted to talk about how a MGTOW man can never truly rest.  And by rest, I mean go back to the old way of thinking, you know, relieve himself of the things he knows now, which can disturb him, can, you know, ruin a lot of things, but also present a lot of new opportunities.  So, as you know, I've been grinding away with the team I put together on the Mouse Utopia game recently.  But I chose that topic because there's a lot of relevance between the real world and the mouse utopia, between the mice themselves and MGTOW.  And one of those correlations is the beautiful ones, which are mice that secluded themselves and basically... groomed themselves and became extremely clean.  and that's why they were called the beautiful ones and they totally isolated themselves and they didn't interact and they withdrew from their societies.  but the interesting part of that is that they took some of those mice those beautiful ones and they put them into other utopias that weren't as decayed as the ones they came from and they still had the same behaviors.  You know, once they became the beautiful one, they were that way for life.  And I do truly think that... the real MGTOW, and I'm not trying to put conditions on MGTOW, you know, you could be a monk MGTOW, you could be a bachelor, you could be anything in between, I don't care about your life choices, you shouldn't care about mine, but there are a lot of guys who are one blowjob away from the plantation, and what I mean by that is, again, you don't have to be celibate, but As soon as you get female attention and you revert back to your old ways, you weren't really MGTOW.  I'm saying the guys who have an understanding of female nature, truly, they can't unsee that.  So even if times were different, now that you know about female nature and hypergamy and all these things, You can't give that up.  You can't knowingly go back to sleep.  So I thought that this would be a good topic because it does give a different perspective going forward.  When people talk about change or societal reformation, a lot of us have already seen society's true cards, females' true cards, basically human nature.  And a lot of these things were suppressed by cultures that were healthy, but also the fact that we're now so interconnected.  Like in the old days... you'd be hard pressed to find so much information about female nature because you'd have to go to like men's clubs, you'd have to see it yourself, you'd have to read about it.  But now we can all share our experiences from different countries, different cultures and realize that it's all the same.  So I think that fact is very influential in the formation of MGTOW in the modern day compared to like historical MGTOWs because there's always been bachelors there's always been monk MGTOWs throughout history.  it's not a new phenomenon.  it is new in the sense that a lot more men are embracing it but it is has it.  it's always been historically there and I've covered that in one MGTOW of history book And I have to do more, but it's not a new phenomenon, but it's kind of being re-embraced.  It's like a rediscovering of the classical philosophies.  So, yeah, I just wanted to talk about that because sometimes I do wish that I could go back to the old days, but it's a very brief passing thought.  Because I look at what I've gained since I've gone MGTOW.  I found MGTOW at 19, which I think is pretty early to find this stuff.  But on my server, some of the guys that call in are way younger.  So a lot younger guys are finding MGTOW.  And I think that's a very interesting approach.  And since a lot of the MGTOW content creators and just the guys in the community in general are older guys, I don't think they fully understand how impactful MGTOW is for the next generation of guys.  It's going to totally reshape the landscape because women can be replaced.  And even though I'm not in monk mode, I understand fully that they can be replaced with many things, not only just the sex dolls, you know, because, I mean, speaking from experience, they can be replaced with sex dolls, or, like, the VR stuff, or even just video games, like... Get me some friends and get a good online cooperative game and I'm satisfied for interaction.  You know, like, that's great.  Or just go to the bar with some buddies.  Like, you don't need fucking women.  You know, those who choose to interact, like myself, like, that's fine.  You know, because I know myself.  I'm not going back to the fucking plantation.  So I don't compromise on anything, really.  So... But those guys who have that mentality, the uncompromising nature of MGTOW, which is what it should be, once you discover this, once you know the path, and I know a lot of MGTOW is kind of vague, and I'm putting together some ideas for some step-by-step guides.  I really don't want to do that because I don't want people following my path.  The whole point is to follow your own path.  But whatever the path is, once you find that, you cannot unsee that.  You cannot forget about the path.  So, ",
