I promised that I was going to take you to see some turtles and some seals, but instead I brought you to a cave.  Tink, show them where we're at.  I'm always saying that... So, you're at a cave called the Lady of Makua.  The Lady of Makua.  There's an interesting history about it.  You can see the segmented limbs.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and it just goes on.  These are the layers of lava flow.  Each layer is a different color because of the oxygenation that oxidizes the iron and gives it different grades of red.  Some of this is red, some are pink, some are brownish red.  That's what you see here, the layers.  If you look straight up, it's kind of dangerous because you can actually see, you can zoom in on it, Tink.  You see way up there in that ledge.  That is ready to fall.  And those ledges will fall right down on you.  So you always want to look for these fishers. ",

When I was a young age, we used to go down there with flashlights and had a saltwater pond where things would come in and out.  We tried to swim, but kind of like when you go in after it gets dark, so we came back out.  But he come out, as soon as he come out of there, turns into human and he'll walk the earth over here and does his stuff.  And then he come back, goes back into his hole and he goes back, swing back to Kauai.  And I guess it's a long journey that he did this for his lifetime.  And today, one of the royalty people's children got bite and they found the shark man with the, they went rip up his cape, they saw shark teeth on his back, and saw the blood, so they assumed that he would eat the child, so all they did was throw stones at him till the thing would fill up his puka, ",
