Call Sergeant Hernandez down here.  He knows me.  Is that one of your officers coming?  Code 3 for an emergency that I'm not doing anything wrong?  Okay.  You have a nice day.  Really?  You're calling emergency backup for me, standing on the sidewalk?  Well, he's coming with lights and sirens.  Well, don't follow me, because if you do, that's considered stalking.  This is not a supervisor, is it?  No, it's not.  Can you call a supervisor?  I'm going to remain silent at this time if the supervisor does not come.  Okay, guys, now we have code.  There is an officer right here.  I just claimed code 3 for no reason whatsoever.  Man, what is your name and badge number?  Man, what's your name and badge number?  Ma'am, what is your name and badge number?  This is my badge number right here.  Can you say it for me?  Oh, you can read it.  You can say it.  Okay, I'm going to open it.  I've been really trying, babe.  Trying to hold back this feeling for so long.  3-7-8-5.  Yes.  Did this officer explain to you the author's name?  You know, ma'am, it's freedom of speech.  You can't do nothing about it.  If you have a problem, you can call Sergeant Hernandez.  I already spoke with him a few weeks ago.  So, I'm in public.  This guy is obviously butthurt because I'm taking his picture.  I told him what I was doing.  No, no, no.  I'm going to speak.  I'm going to speak.  Well, did he tell you I was doing a traffic survey?  Did he not tell you that part?  Okay.  Apparently, he didn't tell you everything that I told him.  I'm going to remain silent.  I'm not doing anything wrong.  Do not touch me, sir.  Do not touch me.  Get on the ground.  Get on the ground.  Get on the ground. ",

And I don't think this guy was drunk, right?  He was just out filming in public and someone was offended.  Offended.  Wow.  What a fabulous word.  Offended.  I am so offended.  Oh, man.  Damn.  It's just so sad these days, man.  Our country is just so sad.  Citizens, and remember guys, I said that citizens are the worst about someone simply out filming in public.  I have said it so many times.  I am beginning to sound like a broken record.  You know, how many times can I say it?  so anyway guys if you want to see more of the video there's a link below.  go watch the whole video.  there's a lot of things left.  there's a lot of things left to see.  and uh thank you guys for watching thank you for your support and hopefully We can all come together, stop these divisive things, this division, and do not support division.  This is the Radical Reactor.  I'm out. ",
