Now, according to the Bible, according to the Torah, what color is Moses?  Huh?  He's what?  He's black, right?  So now, wait a minute.  So Moses was black.  Who are the people in Israel right now today that say they're Jewish?  Revelation 2 verse 9.  So who are the people in Israel right now saying that they are Jewish?  Can you answer that question?  Because the quiet people want to know.  You just admitted that Moses was a man of color, right?  Oh, he made a mistake and he made a sin?  Okay.  That's what he said.  That's what he said.  Revelation chapter 2 verse 9.  I know thy works in tribulation and poverty, but thou art rich.  I know the blasphemy of death.  Revelation chapter 2 verse 9.

What does the word invention mean?  When you invent something.  You make it up, right?  So what is the title of this book?  The Invention of Jewish People by one of your colleagues, Shlomo Sand.  Okay?  Also Jewish.  Okay?  So what did he say?  That the whole Judaism, Jewish thing was made up.  Because where in the Torah does it mention Jewish people?  Where in the Torah does it mention Jewish people?  I said, where in Torah does it mention Jewish people?  Where in Torah does it mention Jewish people?  It was what?  Jewish?  In Torah it says Jewish.  You said you read Torah, right?  When I asked you, I said, by who?  Who was it given to?  Who gave that name?  Huh?  Moses gave them the word Jewish?  I said, so where did Jewish come in?  Where did that come?  Where did Jewish start?  Where did Jewish start?  Where did it start?  Give me Genesis with Jacob and Israel.  Where you gonna find that?  Can you stand before the true sons of Jacob?  Okay.  And what color is Jesus?  What color is Jesus?  Does that matter?  It does matter.  The truth matters.  Really?  It does matter.  Really?  He said you must worship in spirit and in truth.  Yeah, that's a physical.  What about the spirit?  The spirit and the truth.  God is a spirit.  Again, what?  God is a spirit.  And what?  Let me say John 4.  Where's the physical?  Where's the physical?  Where's the physical?  Where's that Christ crucified?  Where's that Christ crucified?  Where's that Christ crucified?  Where's that Christ crucified?  Read, read.  We know what we worship.  We know what we worship.  We know what we worship.  For what?  For salvation is of the Jews.  For who?  For salvation is of the Jews.  For what?  For salvation is of the Jews.  For salvation is of the Jews.  Give me 24.  The judge of the father, 24.  Come on.  God is a spirit.  Come on.  And they that worship him.  They said they worship him.  Come on.  Must worship him.  Must what?  Must worship him.  Must worship him.  Come on.  Spirit.  And what?  And spirit.  And spirit, come on.  And in truth.  And what?  And in truth.  So why don't we bring up the truth of Christ and say it doesn't matter.  But as long as we say that Christ is a white man, everybody's happy.  As long as we say that Christ is a white man, everybody's happy.  For when we bring up the truth of Christ in the Bible, it's a problem.  Okay, all we're doing is bringing up the Bible as it is written.  we're not your crypto dollar your td snakes.  okay we're the true service of god teaching his bible in his last days.  that's right waiting for america to be destroyed by the most high god.  read that.  but the relationship before the 16th am.  i therefore become your enemy.  what am i therefore become your enemy and we become your enemy.  come on because i tell you the truth.  because what?  because i tell you the truth because we tell you the truth.  I claim to know the truth of the Bible.  They said, well, okay, you have your truth and I have my truth.  What's the truth of the Bible, sis?  You never read the Bible.  Never.  You ever go to church?  Never.  What about you, brother?  Never go to church either.  But that's not, it's not a bad thing.  Why?  Because the church is not teaching the truth.  You see where the truth is going?  Read that.  The book of Psalms chapter 119, 142.  Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness.  Come on.  And thy law.  And what?  And thy law.  And who?  And thy law.  The laws of God.  Come on.  Is the truth.  Is the who?  Is the truth.  Is the what?  Is the truth.  There's over 613 laws in the Bible.  Choose one.  Our people went into captivity, into slavery, because we broke the commandments of God.  Our people are locked up in all these prisons, why?  Because we broke the commandments of God.  We are the last high and the first fine, why?  Because our people continue to break the laws of God.  And we are God's chosen people, according to the Bible.  Give me Deuteronomy 7, verse six.  Deuteronomy 7, verse six.  The book of Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 6.  For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God.  Did you hear that?  The Lord God said we are holy people unto him.  Read it again.  For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God.  Come on.  The Lord thy God hath chosen thee.  He's what?  Hath chosen thee.  The Lord God chose you, sis, brothers.  The most high God chose you.  But are you going to answer that call?  Because many are called, but what?  Fewer chosen.  There's over millions and billions of Israelites in the world, but the Mosai called you tonight.  Read on.  But thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God.  The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people.  To be what?  To be a special people.  See, we are a special people, come on.  Unto himself.  Unto himself, come on.  Above all people.  What?  Above all people.  Above all people, come on.  That are upon the face of the earth.  So why do they say all men are created equal?  The Mosai God said that we are special people above all people upon the earth.  But we want to be equal with everybody.  We want to be equal with the white man, with the Chinese.  But they looked down on us.  They don't say they're equal to us.  Okay?  There's one law for the other nations and one law for the nation of Israel.  What's your problem?  What's your problem?  Give me Sirach 13 and 16.  Right?  Why do the heathens rage and imagine a vain thing?  Right?  The heathens, they're in rage right now.  Why?  Because their destiny is what?  It's slavery.  You might as well party like there's no tomorrow because why?  Your destiny is captivity.  Your destiny is destruction. ",
