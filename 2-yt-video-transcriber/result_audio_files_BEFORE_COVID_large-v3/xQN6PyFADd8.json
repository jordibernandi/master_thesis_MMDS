            "text": "Piers Morgan, he is known for quoting Jesus and quoting Scripture, while at the same time often speaking against those who hold to biblical values.  When I was on a show years ago when he was on CNN, he challenged me about what Jesus said concerning homosexuality.  Of course, I had clear answers.  It was an easy thing to respond to.  But recently, he had on his broadcast in England a medical doctor, and this medical doctor is under attack for saying that there are two sexes, male and female.  He's saying it scientifically, and he's saying it scripturally.  And Piers Morgan is calling him a bigot and then appealing to Jesus against this man.  You've got to see this dialogue here.  I want to read it to you, all right?  So this is on Pink News from the UK.  Dr.  David McIrith is a Christian.  And he told the news outlet, by changing the way we use pronouns, we completely change who we are as a society and who we are as a people.  As a Christian, I believe that you use pronouns in a way that is dishonest, and I cannot do that in a good conscience.  In other words, if he knows someone's a biological male, he can't call that person she or her.  I don't believe a person can change sex.  I don't believe that a person can change gender or that sex and gender are the same thing.  So Piers Morgan said, do you understand that makes you a bigot?  Isn't that remarkable?  For saying, I don't believe a black man can be a white man or a white man can be a black man.  I don't believe a tall man can be a short man or a short man can be a tall man.  I don't believe a woman can be a man or a man can be a woman.  Now that last statement, that makes you a bigot.  So, as to define bigot by Magareth, Morgan described it as someone who is, quote, woefully intolerant of people who go through an extraordinarily long and painful transition process, both physically and psychologically.  He continued, they do it because fundamentally they believe they were born in the wrong body, the wrong gender, the wrong sex.  Shouldn't you just find it in your Christian heart to actually respect that?  And the doctor responds, the Bible tells us that God has made us male and female.  He made us for his own glory.  Now, look, if you're convinced scientifically that you've got thousands of genetic or DNA markers within you that make you a man or that make you a woman and that you can't change that, we're not talking about someone that's intersex.  We're talking about someone who's a biological chromosomal male who now, quote, transitions to be a female.  If you don't believe that they are really a female, doesn't compassion call you to speak the truth to that person in love and to say to that person in love, there's a better way?  And to say to that person, look, you're going to be on hormones the rest of your life and you've had this radical sex change surgery and you're still genetically not who you want to be.  Doesn't compassion say there's a better way?  Isn't it Christian to help someone rather than affirm them in what is actually a mental or emotional disorder?  So the dialogue continues.  He says, if I'm a bigot, then the whole of Christianity throughout history is bigotry.  I don't believe that.  I believe Christianity is the truth of God.  So Morgan says, if you're going to take the Bible literally, the punishment for adultery is stoning.  And he said, given your self-righteousness, you wander around the streets of your city looking for people who are looking at people in a lustful way and stone them to death.  And if not, why not?  Jesus Christ told you, Morgan said, to be tolerant of people as well.  And you seem to have failed that test.  You were set in the Bible to defend your bigotry.  We have all moved on from large swaths of the Bible.  The doctor said Morgan was ranting at him, but the presenter finished the interview by saying, I think we're done here.  Let's get David some stones.  So remarkable.  First, the Bible that says God made us male and female is the Bible that Piers Morgan is now quoting to condemn the views of this doctrine.  That's the first thing.  Second thing, Jesus in Matthew 19 reaffirms that in the beginning God made us male and female, and yet Piers Morgan is quoting Jesus against this doctrine.  And number three, rather than recognizing there's a difference between being under the Sinai covenant, which we're not, where the penalty for adultery is stoning, the difference between that and Jesus now saying it's sinful in God's sight if you lust even in your heart and you commit adultery in your heart and that's worthy of hell.  Piers Morgan doesn't recognize that.  He just wants to throw out one thing and then coach Jesus saying Jesus has to be tolerant of people.  Now if you said Jesus said to love people as he loved us, true.  Love the unlovely.  Be merciful to the merciless.  Yes, be kind to the unkind.  Be generous to the stingy.  Be loving to the unlovely.  Yes, yes, yes.  Jesus taught us to do that and to lay our lives down to help others.  But Jesus was totally tolerant of other people.  He sliced through the excuses of people who were going to follow him superficially.  You know, let me just bury my dead father.  He said, let the dead bury their dead.  You come and follow me.  When he saw the excuses were just made up and superficial, he cut through them.  As far as being tolerant, he said, I'm the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me.  He said he was the only way to God.  His teachings are absolutely radical.  His teachings contradict what Piers Morgan is saying from beginning to end.  So yes, let us follow the example of Jesus and lay down our lives for other people's well-being.  But let us not accommodate social insanity.  Let us not accommodate someone's very real emotional and psychological struggles.  Rather, let's help them.  Jesus would look at a transgender, call that person who they are, and make them whole within their own body, and then die for their sins, your sins, my sins, so they could have eternal life. ",
