            "text": "So I'm probably going to butcher this pronunciation because it's a Japanese word, but the community of people we're looking at today call themselves yandere, I think.  Yandere.  Hey everyone!  We are back talking about yanders again.  Today, you guys asked for this second part of the video, or at least I hope you did because I'm making it anyway, so we'll see what happens.  Yanders, as we found out in the last video, are people who, mostly girls, mostly young women, mostly teenagers, who are romantically obsessed with someone to the point of using violent means to get them in their arms.  it kind of originated in certain types of anime and stuff like that but then people started behaving this way in real life roleplaying online and actually acting this way towards real people.  so today we're going to be taking a look at a few more yandere posts from tumblr and reddit and kind of talking about these.  and again the conversation isn't meant to shame these individuals but kind of talk about the whole issue talk about how this kind of community in general is unhealthy and it's promoting unhealthy behavior.  it's encouraging dangerous behavior and that doesn't help anyone.  so let me know down in the comments what you think of these posts.  let me know what you think of the girls acting this way?  how do you think society can help them?  how do you think they should help themselves?  essentially are communities like this that have these little echo chambers of people encouraging and sort of talking about unhealthy behaviors?  how do you think they impact society and real people?  we see it with the like yandere girls here.  we also see it with MGTOWs and incels online their little echo chambers and stuff like that.  What do you think we should do about it?  And also let me know, have you ever encountered any girls like this?  Or have you ever been one of these girls?  If you have, please share your story with me because I'd love to hear it.  But for now, we're just going to jump into looking at a few of these posts.  The first one we're going to look at is a kind of like typical Yandere reaction that simply says, I'd let you stab me if it meant you looking in my eyes.  as we spoke about in the last video.  no matter what your justification is and whether it's fueled by a mental health issue or not there is never justification for threatening violence against yourself or someone else or putting yourself or someone else in danger.  it's just not okay.  the main kind of points I want to focus on in today's video are from this one tumblr blog that gives yandere tips.  this one is a tip on how to tell your lover about your obsessiveness and yandere nature.  they write.  I don't suggest doing this in the first place.  if the relationship hasn't been more than a year you shouldn't tell them something like I am yandere but you should tell them about what you do because you're a yandere.  By that I mean you should tell them about the extent of your love.  Find something that really explains it.  For example, I would personally slaughter everyone in the world to spend one more second with you.  I need your love completely to myself because I love you.  I don't know about you, but if someone said that to me, I would get out of the room so quickly and never look back.  That is terrifying.  Absolutely terrifying.  And no matter how you justify it, there is never a situation where this is okay.  They acknowledge that from there, they would definitely question this.  And from there, you could explain the rest.  If they haven't left at this point, I'm shocked, but you know.  Don't worry about scaring them away because only your dare side has been probably, has probably been out in front of them.  I suggest doing this in a romantic setting.  Yeah, you know, you go out for a date, sat across from them at a table, candlelit restaurant, you know, he's eating a steak, you're eating... Something fancy that's also like a steak, but not a steak.  I don't know.  You can have a steak as well, it doesn't matter.  The point is, it's romantic.  There's music playing in the background.  He's looking across from you.  He confesses his love.  You stare in each other's eyes.  And you say, I would personally slaughter everyone in the world for one more second.  And then he gets up and bolts out of the restaurant because that's not normal behavior.  and you just ruin the night.  I don't mean to make light of this, but like, how else do you deal with this level of scariness?  It's, yeah.  Remind them that it's because you love them, not because of any other reason.  Being yanda is crazy because of love, not already crazy than applying it to love.  Not sure I agree with that.  I think there's got to be some underlying issues there to make people behave this way in the first place.  There just kind of has to be.  Because this isn't normal behavior in a healthy relationship.  Although if you don't like this method you could tell them that you have a confession to make.  From there you could gently explain the way you love him or her.  I would recommend finding some yanda quotes that are practical for a situation like this.  And then this person... tells a personal story from their past.  what is terrifying about this and from what i can tell it's real and it happened the person she's talking about john that she was in this like obsessive relationship with ended up committing suicide which is heartbreaking and the fact that people still coming to her and encouraging her behavior after this happened is very worrying and very concerning.  When I accidentally confessed to John, it was because I was texting him sweet messages throughout the day with a second phone number.  I knew where he was 24-7.  So when he would do something I didn't like, I'd text him not-so-sweet messages about what he was doing.  One day, he got me to confess that it was me sending these messages.  And by confessing, he knew that it was me who was his stalker for this vlog.  Another post from this same vlog giving Yandere tips says, how to make a secret shrine.  Again, not healthy behaviour at all.  Create a shrine.  This will definitely keep you happy and satisfied.  You could use a shoebox.  Tape a picture of him to the underside of the lid.  Write his name above it.  Fill the box with poems.  This is not a normal arts and crafts project.  Imagine seeing this on Art Attack.  This is an Art Attack?  This is an Art Attack?  This is Art Attack!  Also include items you take from him.  Tissues, bottles, more pictures.  Put them in separate bags and label them with the date.  See the TV series You because this is very reminiscent of that.  You know the bit where he has the box that he keeps in the ceiling of his bathroom and he has all the things that he's like stolen from the girl he's obsessed with including like her used tampons and stuff.  Very reminiscent of that.  Again, Not normal, healthy behaviour and this should not be encouraged.  Include quotes of him and your favourite things he said to you.  Decorate it with colours that compliment him and there you go.  Another tip, how to follow your lover home or any other place.  This is bordering on criminal now.  This can't, no, this can't be real.  Okay, this post makes me half wonder if they're trolling but at the same time, I've seen the comments and submissions, and even if the author isn't legit, the people who send her messages are.  And that's the worrying thing, because she's glamorizing and romanticizing this lifestyle and encouraging other people to do the same.  And that's what's the problem.  Calculate his footsteps.  Figure out the time it gets to the place he is going three times.  Find the average time it takes and start following him when he gets a quarter of the way there.  Always walk close to the wall so if he turns around, depending on where he is, he might not be able to see.  If you're following him home, walk on the opposite side of the street.  It's less suspicious and you are less noticeable.  The person isn't likely to think that you are following them, so calm down.  If you feel too anxious, you will look suspicious.  Good luck.  And when I said there are people who come to this blog and they like submit their stories and stuff and this person encourages them, here's just one example of that.  I'm a real life Yandere.  No, I'm not just saying it because I think it'll make me look cute or trendy.  I'm saying it because it's true.  My precious love is being so difficult right now, and I want him back.  Fortunately for me, his stupid girlfriend is already on thin ice for messing around with other guys.  Of course, she cried and cries, and my beloved, beloved... Oh, I think it's supposed to be, my beloved believed her lies.  She really was cheating on him though.  So if I fabricate another scandal, he might give her the boot.  Tee hee, but this will be hard.  And the blog replies with, yeet, I'm proud.  Even if the person writing this blog is... joking and whatever.  it's not okay to encourage this kind of stuff another one.  oh my god.  so when i mentioned that this person their ex-boyfriend ex-obsession john killed himself people have been asking about this saying what happened to john and she replies he intentionally shot himself.  on this date.  it's such a complex story.  another person asked how did john die if you killed him?  i want tips.  If someone else did, I want tips on how you killed them.  How is Tumblr still allowing this to happen on the site?  He killed himself, so I can't kill him for doing that.  But it's something you want to happen until it actually happens.  I wanted him dead until I found out he was suicidal.  So ironic, right?  Lol.  Literally terrifying.  This is kinda like the heart of where I'm getting at with these posts, like, It's very easy for us to sit here and be like, ha ha ha, it's so crazy, it's so weird, look at this.  But there are some people who are going to read this and be encouraged by it and be like, oh, if this person's doing it, I can do it too.  Or if this person's justifying it, I can justify my behavior too.  Or if this person got away with this, maybe so can I. The fact that they're giving out tips to impressionable young teenagers is horrifying.  And again, I don't know why Tumblr's allowing this.  Tumblr cracked down on all kinds of posts and stuff like.  I think they cracked down on like weird porn content and stuff like that.  if they can do that why can't they crack down on the actually damaging stuff like this?  so I don't want this video to be too long.  I want to be kind of like short and impactful because I really want to hand this over to you guys now and like I was saying in the beginning let me know your thoughts on this.  what do you think we should be kind of like doing in these situations?  how do we get people who believe this stuff and read this stuff and write this stuff and see this stuff?  how do we get them to actually get help and want to get help?  when you have these kind of toxic online communities and echo chambers?  how do you get through to them and how do you help the individuals in there who are suffering and seeing this negative unhealthy behavior be glamorized and justified and encouraged?  how do we help those people?  genuinely like let me know down in the comments what you're thinking.  i'd love to hear from you and like i say if you have any of your own stories of people like this that you've experienced or if you've been like this please share your stories.  and if you would like me to like share your stories in another video i'm more than happy to do that.  if you want me to look at this stuff again i'm more than happy to do that.  it would be great if again we we could kind of like take some of your ideas that you write in the comments and maybe I'll make a video response to them, and again, we can kind of properly have a conversation about this, because I do think it is a very serious issue.  And with that, I'm going to end this here today.  This is bizarre, and again, I think I said it in the last video, but I don't get why more people aren't talking about this.  It's, yeah, intense.  It's very intense.  Yeah, but anyway, that's me done for today.  Thank you for watching.  I appreciate you guys so much, and hopefully I will see you again soon.
