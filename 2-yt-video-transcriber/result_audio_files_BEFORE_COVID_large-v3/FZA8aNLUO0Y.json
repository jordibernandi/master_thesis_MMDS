We are here in beautiful Portsmouth, New Hampshire, outside of an event center which will remain nameless.  And we are waiting for Kamala Harris to arrive.  Now, Kamala Harris claims that she was smoking weed back in college to Pac and Snoop and Dre.  But those people, artists, weren't even out when she was in college.  Then later in her career, she locked up thousands of people for smoking weed, and then she laughed about it.  She also claims that she's going to disavow any lobbying money or any money from Super PACs.  However, she's taken more than any other Democratic candidate.  So as soon as she gets here, we're going to ask her the tough questions.  The media won't.  Stay tuned. ",
