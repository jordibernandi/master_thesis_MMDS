I think you guys are going to really be floored by this fact.  I'm going to bring to you a fact.  It's not really even based on my own interpretation at all.  just the facts is what I'm gonna bring to you and I found something just incredible unbelievable.  okay.  so at the end of this you guys are gonna decide for yourself if this is somehow some way a coincidence.  but I was running just some different numbers by what we're watching.  I'm watching second Passover and the tenth day of the second month which has to do with the triumphal entry leading all the way up to Resurrection Day on Second Passover is May. ",
