            "text": "News Now.  KC, Yukon, Oklahoma, known for their large flour mills.  City Hall, Yukon, Oklahoma.  Hello?  There must have been a bank at one time.  Okay.  Hello.  Can I help you, sir?  Oh, no, I'm just looking around.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  I'm not doing anything.  How y'all doing?  Do you need some help?  No, I'm fine.  Sir, we're going to call the police station.  Why?  What the hell have I done?  Did I violate the law?  Who are you?  Oh, that's me right there.  All right.  So I'm just hanging out, getting videos of this area, which is legal, right?  I guess so.  It is.  It is.  There's nothing wrong with it.  They can video.  Yeah, I can video.  It's legal.  Yeah, it's fine.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  She's calling the law on me.  Why would you call the police on me for being on my phone?  Well, we're not used to.  it's something different coming to our offices.  Okay.  Can I video you?  Yes, you may.  You sure may.  We're in a public area.  You have the right to do that.  We have the right to be on our phones in America.  I believe that.  We've had phones out in public for, what, 15 years now?  All right.  Well, here come some more people.  I'll just step out their way.  Excuse me.  Y'all bet.  Y'all have a nice day.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  This is interesting artwork right here.  That's what Yukon's famous for.  Can I take your name tag?  No, I don't have to do that.  I haven't asked anyone for their names or IDs or anything.  No, we're going to let them just turn it closed now.  All right.  You had your name tag out.  Yeah, I did.  I'm actually not supposed to show that.  Appreciate you reminding me.  it was there Mike, I've got to see Cheryl in a minute.  Excuse me.  How are you?  Doing great.  How are y'all?  Oh no, I'm just walking around getting video.  For what purpose?  I like architecture.  Looks like it's an old bank from the 50s.  Probably 50s, early 60s architecture here.  Repurposed as a city hall now, so I find that interesting.  Are you from here?  Do you remember when it was a bank?  No, I don't remember.  No, it just looks like it.  Yeah, it used to be First National Bank.  Okay.  It was here, and it had a big teller counter that it followed the bow, the arc.  But, you know, that's why there's a big vault door.  Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks like it's from the 50s, probably late 50s, early 60s design.  Early 60s.  Yeah.  Because I've lived here since 70, and I want to say this building, the bank built the building in the mid to early 60s.  That's kind of what it looks like, the architecture.  Pretty neat.  There's been some upgrades and changes.  It used to be our library.  Oh, really?  To the library.  From the library to being City Hall.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I appreciate it.  I'll just walk around a little bit.  Head out the back door, I guess.  No, that's restricted.  Oh, is it?  Okay.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  I saw it said exit.  I guess in a fire you could leave.  In a fire.  Yeah.  All right.  You all have a nice day.  Thanks.  You too.  News now, KC.  At the outside of the city hall.  All right, guys.  Looks like a somewhat successful audit.  Seems like the officer was the most agreeable to me auditing their building and giving everybody a tour.  Everybody have a nice day.  This is News Now KC. ",
