            "text": "Oh, it seems that there is some problems in the Houghton household.  Yes.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is a true show.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  I mean, this is a true show.  Oh, yes.  Okay, it has been leaked that Adrienne is living above her means.  Now, to understand the situation, we need to go back.  Oh, and please note that I did a video about her and their relationship.  We'll leave the link below or you can just click it at the end of this video.  With that being said, let's go back.  First, she was engaged to long-time boyfriend, Leni Santiago, and she literally announced their engagement in February of 2015.  Then in September, later that year, she caught off the engagement.  But keep in mind that at this point, she was staying in a condo.  It was beautiful.  And she had some money, but she wasn't living large and taking charge like she is now.  Also note that she was dressing very revealing and stayed in the club.  Oh, and her ex knew what she was wanting from him because he used to hang with Jay-Z and all of those ballers.  And he never wanted to marry her in the first place.  He was pressured into proposing to her, which is one of the reasons she called it off.  Of course.  Israel Holton divorced his ex-wife in February of 2016 because, of course, cheating, but also because he got fired from the church of Joel Osteen for embezzling money from the church, among other things, I'm sure.  And also, note, because he started dating Adrienne in February, and she is not welcomed by the church, but the streets talk, and it was told that they were dating long before that.  They just went public when his divorce was finalized.  which was in February.  And then she posted all of their glamorous trips to Paris, Venice, and more, and plenty parties.  Then she got engaged to Israel in August of 2016.  Then she quit, you know, wearing thought outfits, you know, tight dresses, and well, you know how she's dressed.  Anyway, and started wearing more demure outfits.  I mean, you have to play the part, right?  And she posted their new house.  Then the gray hair on Israel's face and head started multiplying.  Then she drops their dual album together.  Then her and Jeannie Mai YouTube channel came out.  Then we hear that Tamera and Loni's salary was more than hers and Jeannie.  Then Israel career, let's be real blunt here, hasn't been the same since.  Now back to the present.  So what do we see here?  We see a man that is almost 50 years old being used by a young driven hot tamale who only see dollar signs and the idea and image of being married, glamour, and opportunities.  Oh, you better believe that she's sexually frustrated, hence her weight gain since being with him.  Oh, and her lies about not being able to have kids.  That's the same BS.  Khloe Kardashian pulled on Lamar.  I did a video about them as well.  I will leave the link below.  Anyway, in the video, I pointed out that Lamar wanted kids and Khloe was lying because she didn't want any kids with him.  so it's rumored that the whole doctor scene visit was off stage and we all know that adrian and she and the rest of the kardashians are still friends.  you see adrian isn't in love with israel.  she hasn't ever looked at him like she's in love with him and we all know that look unless it's staged for a picture.  i haven't seen her look at a man like that since robin kardashian.  so you see adrian will either stay with israel out of pure desperation and the fact that she's getting old or bleed him dry and then move on.  you know pull a tamar if you ask me.  i think israel career will Strive again without the Selena Kandania wannabe blocking it aside for the comer from cheating on his wife and blowing their money and not to mention a church.  who knows?  tell me your thoughts below.
