You just hear the one.  yes.  Right.  But I said, I don't wear the nose, because I'm gonna run through that.  In this business, you have to have... It was a good conversation.  I was with Jimmy Iovine and, uh, Zane, Zane Lowe.  He does the thing.  He was in there.  And me and Jimmy... We think alike.  I love talking to Jimmy because he's fearless how I am.  So we was talking about new artists and putting them out and going for it.  And Zayn was like, yo, but what if that fails?  Like, I'm not scared if it fails.  And Jimmy was like, no.  I'm just gonna try it again with somebody else.  And that's just my mindset.  Like, I have made some mistakes.  I have definitely failed a million times. ",

You know what I'm saying?  For, like, three years, I was... That was high.  All of those great records, though, we made highs and motherfuckers.  Right?  So not saying to do that, children.  Don't do it.  That's just me.  You know what I'm saying?  So I got off the phone.  I got into an argument with Tommy Mottola about Ain't It Funny, about Cadillac Ty, and them not servicing the record with Cadillac Ty on it.  So I'm going in on Tommy.  Tommy says some shit.

So the phone rings, and it's Elle magazine.  And they said, we want to get some quotes, you and J-Lo.  And I said, wow.  And she didn't deserve that, because J-Lo was like one of my.  What did you say?  I knew he was going to ask that.  They asked if I'm Real was about Diddy.  And J-Lo told them it wasn't.  And I was like.  Yes, it is.  And I call her the B word.  Like an idiot.  I was like, that bitch is lying or whatever.  Have y'all ever healed from that?  No.  Did she call you?  I send her flowers and roses and I apologize and I will continue to apologize for the rest of my life and I will say I'm a fucking idiot.  But if she never trusts me again, I can't blame her.

When the feds raided me January 3rd, 2003, if you look at my history, Ashanti was selling, like, six, seven million.  Ja was selling, like, six, seven million.  I was doing, like, for two years, I was doing, like, 120 million in business.  and billing, right?  So I was due, like, a $60 million to $70 million check, because I owned half of that money was supposed to come to me.  So when the feds raided, it was a strategic move on them.  If you look at the dates, I didn't go to court and trial till two and a half years later.  But they did that because they knew I'm about to get $60 million.  Mm.  For the sales.  So when they raided me, like, a week after they raided, they sent a letter to the Universal Music Group, said, if you give Irving Lorenzo $1, you're gonna be his co-defendant, because you gave him all this money that he's praying with.
