I want you guys to get a pencil and get a paper.  First, we're going to go to Jeremiah 17 and 5.  I got to tell you guys something.  Jeremiah 17 and 5.  Jeremiah 17 and 5.  Jeremiah 17 and 5.  Thus says the Lord.  Curse be the man that trusted the man.  Curse be the man that trusted the man.  Curse be the man that trusted the man and make it flesh his own.  Right now, we cannot put our trust in any man.  Right now.  What I'm talking about, listen to me real good.  There's about to be an event that's about to take place in America And they're going to try to do their best to get you guys to flee the country.  Other countries are going to open up their doors for you guys to go to.  Some of them are going to be free airplane flights to get out of here.  Don't go.  Do you hear me?  I'm going to say it again.  Don't go.  When this event happens, stay still.  Did you hear what I said?  When this event happens, it's about to be an event, a major event within the borders of the United States of America to attempt to get the American people to flee and leave this continent.  Don't go if they try to get you to evacuate to a FEMA camp. ",

Now we're going to go into Hebrews 2 and get confirmation of Jeremiah 17 and 5.  Now we're in 2 Nephi 28 and 31.  Cursed is he that put his trust in man.  Cursed is he that put his trust in man or make it flesh his arm.  Stop.  I'm going to say it again.  There is about to be an event within the borders of the United States of America that's going to cause hysteria and mass panic.  People are going to attempt to flee over the Mexico border to their own demise.  People are going to be wanting to leave their homes, their premises, to go to some place.  What they're going to be told is going to be safe, a safer place than where you live.  Don't go.  Go with me to Psalms 91.  Psalms 91.  Psalms 91.  Hear me talking.  Psalms 91.  He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  Where is the secret place?  Under his law, statutes, and commandments and under his blood.  I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress.  My God in Him will I trust.  My God in Him will I trust.  My God in Him will I trust.  My God in Him will I trust.  Cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his own.  My God in Him will I trust.  You guys are going to have to put all of your trust in the Most High and not man.  Once again, there's about to be an event within the borders of the United States of America that's going to attempt to get you guys out of your comfort zone and flee to your own demise and your own destruction.  Because if you put your trust in man, then you are out from under the protection of the Most High God.  I'm going to say that again.  If you put your trust in man in this time of crisis, the Most High will not be there to help you.  The Bible teaches us to be still and see the salvation of the Most High, this Eldar year.  The Most High is prophet, prophesying right now to all of you out there.  There's about to be a major nuclear event within the borders of the United States of America.  I'm not telling you this for you to get scared.  I'm telling you this.  So that you don't put your trust in man after the event happens.  Stay still.  Go gas up your vehicles.  Now, fill up your tank.  This is El Dario from One Nation, One Power.  Bringing a prophetic word from the Most High Himself.  Shalom. ",
