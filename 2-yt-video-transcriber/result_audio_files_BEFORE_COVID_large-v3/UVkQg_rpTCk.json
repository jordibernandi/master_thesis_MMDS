            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we return to talking about that DNA ancestry test girl, Nia Hope, from YouTube.  Last time we went over her awkward and embarrassing reveal video, where she opened up her DNA test results live on camera.  And needless to say, things didn't go as expected.  Basically, Nia was hoping she had all this African ancestry, but as it turned out, she actually is pretty European, at least on her mother's side, that's for sure.  I'll put a link to that original video I made below, if you want to catch up.  And let me go ahead and thank everyone that watched it already, too.  We've already got over 700,000 views on that video, so, yeah.  I thought it would be a good idea to do a follow-up on it now and see what's been going on. ",
