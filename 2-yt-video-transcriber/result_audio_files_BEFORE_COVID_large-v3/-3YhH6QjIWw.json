            "text": "Horrifying video shows a pit bull pounce on a six-year-old boy and knock him to the ground.  Little Mason Lindeman was playing in his driveway with friends when the pit bull escaped from a neighbor's home and attacked, clapping his jaw down on the boy's head.  The boy's friends run for help as Mason struggles to break free.  Suddenly, a hero comes to the rescue.  The teen who heard the boy's screams runs right into the path of danger.  Watch as he deliberately diverts the pit bull's attention.  Now the dog goes after him, giving the six-year-old kid a chance to run home.  The hero neighbor is also attacked when he loses his sneaker and falls to the ground.  Here's young Mason today.  His mom, Jillian, shows us his injuries. ",
