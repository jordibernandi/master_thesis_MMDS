            "text": "Bueno?  Eh?  Look at numbers, I don't know.  that's how I answer a phone.  Should've went right over there to that bus stop.  Right there.  He's almost done.  He's almost done.  1 Adam 12, 1 Adam 12, see the man.  Call us a backup.  I hope she didn't give consent for that search.  She can resend that.  so so Thank you.  .  .  .  Thank you.  We'll be out here all night watching you guys.  Hey, shut up.  Don't talk to me.  Shut up.  Don't fucking talk to me.  I'm right here at the fucking bus stop.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm not talking to you.  I didn't say a word to him.  You shut the fuck up.  Go back to your phone.  You're interfering with me.  Hey, sit on the fucking curb until I'm done with my investigation.  You're interrupting his investigation, okay?  You're interrupting.  I've already asked you twice already, okay?  The next thing I'm going to do is... Where do you want us to stand?  You're too close to his car.  Where do you want us to stand?  Where do you want us to stand?  Can you please go stand in that corner over there?  Oh, hell no.  Hell no.  Sir, we don't need you reporting this close to the investigation, okay?  I'm on a public sidewalk now, dickhead.  You're welcome.  It's fine.  We like you.  Hey, Corpo.  Hey, you and I have always been pretty good with each other, man.  You've been around a long time, man.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Come on over here, man.  I'm pretty good, man.  Yeah, it's been a long time, man.  I mean, I see you out here every now and then, but I don't think I ever film you much.  Just one time at Taco Cabana about four years ago.  We, you know, prior to walking up, we didn't say a word to anybody.  You know, we know where that comes from.  First thing we tell them is don't talk to us.  We don't want to hear from you.  Get away from us.  That kind of thing.  Then he interjected the whole safety thing.  My first response to him is, where do you want us to stay?  And that's going to be a reason for me to cross the street.  Or, you know, where it's like, okay, go stand over there where you can't, you know.  There's plenty of reasons and places to stay.  You guys know that?  You know, like I said, never been fired.  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I'm saying that a lot of this is coming from DPS.  So they're telling us how much we can do and we cannot do.  And like I said, I've never had any problems.  We did the right thing.  Yeah.  The only officer we ever had problems with is not working for you guys anymore.  That's very true.  Officer Santana.  I have no problem with you asking about it, you know.  No problem at all.  We're just looking for that part.  wherever when somebody's like, you know, I don't want to talk to you.  I don't want to discuss my day.  I'm not having a good day.  And that you're like, okay, is there anything in the law that lets me make them show me, no, there's not, okay, I'm going to abandon it or whatever.  Maybe that's how their day's going or whatever.  And you did great, man.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  I like what you guys do.  I'm not going to show that either.  Yeah, that's all right.  I'm too tall.  I'm not going to show that.  All right, guys.  You be safe.  I think we're good, too, man.  I think we're good.  Yeah, I want to... Thank you.  This is how we do it.  This is how we do it. ",
