            "text": "There are the new digital media which enable people to form communities defined by specific ideological interests.  Communities where they can exchange news and opinions outside a unified public space and where Conspiracy theories and so on can flourish without constraints.  Just look at the thriving neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic websites.  And here, don't you think that you are the only bad guys?  In Europe now the situation is getting even worse.  I found, when I was just browsing the web, three-fourth, well-organized, ten-hour miniseries documentaries which, not between the lines implicit, but fully, explicitly rehabilitate Hitler.  They bring together all these elements which echo even a little bit in Jordan Peterson and so on.  First, this idea of cultural Marxism, the idea that... Frankfurt School and critical Western Marxism came to be because when communists realized in the early 20s that there will not be a communist revolution in Western Europe, they saw why this is happening.  They saw that... That's alt-right reading.  They saw that Christianity is too strong among ordinary people and that you only can have successful revolution if you first destroy the moral foundations of a society.  That's why, and here comes the paranoia.  Bolsheviks, Stalin, and so on, directly through this detour of Argentina, financed Frankfurt School, Adorno-Horkheimer, and so on, to destroy moral foundations of the West.  And then this culminates today with political correctness, transgender, and so on, and so on.  So... Again, it's horrifying to read it, and I don't know if you know these conspiracy theorists.  They are so crazy that they almost, but it's horrible, it's a dangerous game to play, they almost fascinate me.  For example, according to these theorists, this idea that Middle East is in a conflict, Jews against Palestinians, they claim this is just a false conflict to seduce us.  They claim that in reality they are working together, to destroy Western Europe.  What's their proof?  They claim, okay, immigrants are penetrating, Muslim immigrants, Europe.  But they say this cannot happen by itself.  This is not spontaneous.  This is incidentally where those leftists who claim Palestinians are today's Jews or immigrants, the foreigner to be excluded, are are wrong.  Because Jews in the Nazi imaginary were by definition more or less invisible.  They were the secret masters.  While refugees are all too visible.  We are obsessed with how they just walk with their women faces hidden along our streets.  So they claim that they are too visible.  so there must be a secret master behind them.  And these are Jews of course.  So they claim it's a shared Muslim-Jewish plot to destroy our civilization.  What I'm saying is something very simple.  It's that, and everybody knows it, what happened in the last 10, 15 years is that this kind of conspiracy theories were all the time here.  But what's so sad is that what was still now Constrained to this, we go after a talk like this today, to a bar, restaurant, and all the dirty talk, rumors, now it's becoming part of our public space.
