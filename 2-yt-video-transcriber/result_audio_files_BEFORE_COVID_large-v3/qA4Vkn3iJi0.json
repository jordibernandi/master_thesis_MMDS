Do one or both of you have time for an interview?  I'm doing some street epistemology.  Have you heard of it?  Street epistemology is where you.  it's a conversational technique where you you figure out.  a claim that somebody makes because they think that it's true.  Like you might think that, I don't know, everything happens for a reason.  Or if I bury the statue in my backyard, it's gonna help sell my mom's house faster.  Or that wall at the border's a really good idea.  Karma, whatever.  Ghosts.  Lucky numbers, I actually just talked to a woman about lucky numbers.  She was born on the 14th, so she thinks that that number has some sort of special meaning, and she has a tendency to win at carnivals more when she goes with 14.  So it's just stuff like that.  And I set a timer for four minutes, and I ask you questions to gently challenge you in a respectful way.  what you think is true, why you think it's true, and how you're so sure that your reasons warrant a high degree of certainty that it really is true and real.  Do you, either one of you? ",

And then you were saying, well, I might actually find something that could bring me up to 100.  Yeah.  But now you got me wondering if it really would, because now I'm thinking... If you did a DNA test, it could be an indication that there are other family members that could be the candidate and not really the woman who's saying that she's your mom.  So I'm wondering, would that move you to 100, a DNA test?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  So I really appreciate you thinking about it.  And that kind of reflectful thinking is exactly what we're looking for.  And moving off of ledges of certainty, like I'm 100% sure that this is true.  Well, after a few questions, maybe I'm willing to be a little bit more open to the possibility that I could be mistaken on it.  And I thought that was a really good example of how to go about doing that.  And you were fantastic.  You were natural at this, by the way.  So let me give you a sticker.  And this is your time to ask me any questions that you'd like.  If you want to know where I stand on the same claim or if you want to ask me more about what I'm doing, that's fine.  Here's a card.  Street epistemology is a hobby of mine where it's a way of engaging in a conversation where you're challenging a person's claim that they make, where it's respectful.  you're asking questions, you're listening, you're not misrepresenting, we want to actually steel man your view.  We don't want to make a straw man out of it and knock it down.  We want to build the strongest argument for your position with you and then see if you can still be 100% sure that that's the case.  So it's a tool.  It's a tool that I hope you look into and maybe end up using it going forward in your career because it won't be long before you guys are going to get jobs and you could probably use this in the workplace.
