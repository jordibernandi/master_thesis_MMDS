            "text": "What I'm about to show you is going to make your stomach churn like it did mine.  Representative Ilhan Omar is under fire for telling the truth.  People are claiming that she's an anti-Semite because of some comments she made about a pro-Israel lobby, a very powerful pro-Israel lobby that spends gobs and gobs of money on Congress in order to make sure that they get their pro-Israel agenda through.  And she told the truth about them and now is completely under fire.  So, what happened was, Representative Kevin McCarthy, he basically threatened congressional action against Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib for criticism of Israel.  When Ilhan Omar saw this and heard about what Representative Kevin McCarthy was saying, she tweeted a response quoting Puff Daddy, saying, it's all about the Benjamins' baby.  Then the editor at The Forward, which is a Jewish publication, asked Omar who she was referring to as who she was insinuating was paying off these Republican congresspeople.  And she responded, AIPAC.  which is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is the United States' most prominent pro-Israel lobby.  Since then, she is being completely drug around.  People are saying that she's an anti-Semite, that these comments are unacceptable.  All she did was say, You're bought by this pro-Israel lobby, and when asked who was paying, all she said was AIPAC, and this is somehow anti-Semitic.  I am not connecting the dots here.  I don't understand how calling out a large lobbying group... is somehow anti-Semitic.  This makes absolutely no sense to me.  This is similar to saying the reason why we won't go hard against Saudi Arabia is because they buy a lot of weapons from us.  It's all about the Benjamins, baby.  Is that now somehow anti-Muslim to say that?  to say, well, you're only pro-Saudi Arabia because they're buying weapons from us and you want the money?  Is that pro-Muslim?  I mean, anti-Muslim?  So I don't really understand how saying this organization, which is spending a lot of money, in a variety of dark ways to influence Congress.  I don't understand how that is somehow anti-Semitic.  And she's now being called out.  Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer.  Many, many Democrats are calling her out.  Many Republicans are calling her out.  She's since had to come out and apologize.  She's saying, yeah, you know, I'm sorry for my, what I guess seemed to be insensitive anti-Semitic comments.  People on Twitter are dragging her around.  I mean, this is just absurd.  for calling out a lobbying group, for calling out a lobbying group.  And it gets worse.  There was actually a documentary series that was done by Al Jazeera.  This was actually done in 2016.  It was finished in 2017.  They were unable to actually publish it.  It ended up being censored by KADAR, which is the gas-rich Gulf Emirate that funds Al Jazeera.  They actually came under intense Israel lobbying pressure, so they did not release the film.  But The Electronic Intifada actually got a hold of the film and released this four-part documentary series.  And you have to watch it.  It will make your stomach churn.  What I did was I took clips from the series and I condensed it down into a four-minute piece.  So I'm going to show the four-minute kind of clips that I compiled for you.  And this kind of gives you an idea of what Ilhan Omar was talking about.  Here it is. ",

At that point, we're talking anywhere up to a quarter million dollars.

And we're hearing about this over and over.  It's all about Iran right now.  And this is what they're saying in this documentary series, which was finished in 2017.  This was filmed in 2016, finished in 2017.  And here we are, here we are, we're still talking about Iran.  So this is very scary stuff.
