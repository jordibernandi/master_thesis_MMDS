            "text": "meeting with Logan Paul came about for a series of quirks and coincidences.  really, because Logan Paul, of course, I'm aware of who he is, he's like a crossover phenom.  That's what someone said.  he is, he's a YouTube phenom.  Firstly, I didn't know this, but he's sort of a manager-type figure.  I don't know if he formalises things in his life as tightly as, you're my manager, and that's a business being in a contract.  But the person that was functioning in that way, a fella called Andre.  Andre, who's referred to in the podcast frequently as a sort of a mysterious shapeshifter, mover-between-dimensions-type character.  Look, well, this side of the table, we're exploring it more, aren't we, Andre?  We've got some flowing garments, we've got some mysticism, we're a couple of little Rasputin monks out in the... So, like, I'd run into his girlfriend in a, obviously, vegan restaurant called Crossroads.  It's delicious, by the way.  And where I'd been unofficially anointed.  Like, his girlfriend and another woman came up to me, this Andre's girlfriend.  Like, they were wearing, in my mind, I don't know, you know, sometimes how you, in your memory, you sort of edit things to make it more convenient and cinematic.  Well, as I remember it, they were wearing, like, blue flowing gowns, like saris.  And they came over to me, and this bit definitely did happen, anointed me with sort of gold leaf on my own forehead.  So there was a moment where some people were coming and striping me down the middle of my head with gold leaf, which is the sort of thing I always anticipate happening.  And when it actually does happen, I think, good, this is what should be happening to me in a vegan restaurant.  Thank God someone's come over and anointed me with gold leaf.  And then, like, you know, they were really lovely, and then off they went.  And I thought, this is... I obviously read too much into it, you know, being a sort of a pseudo-spiritualist, living in between dimensions type guy.  I was like, oh, this is an anointment.  This means I've got great responsibility.  Anyway, Kylie is in the back of this vehicle now.  She's friends with that person, Andre, and arranged for Logan Paul to do my podcast Under the Skin, which took place in Hollywood, Los Angeles.  You're famous in a new way.  You're YouTube famous.  You're a type of famous that 10 years ago didn't exist.  I'm in my 40s.  I've come through conventional media, but I know the young people.  I've seen it.  I've seen it all.  You've seen that stuff.  I got to say, I got to say, I'm a fan.  All right.  I'm a fan.  This is getting more relaxing for me by the second.  No, no, no.  Trust me.  When Andre brought your name up, I was like, I'd be in honor to sit down with him.  And now, I'm on my way to Houston.  What I can only understand is some sort of mad frat house mansion of content providers.  In my mind, it's half a dozen millionaires sat around smoking weed and eating potato chips and making videos and laughing at each other's farts.  It might not just be that, because they're potentially, you know, like, they're obviously very innovative and talented young men.  And when I met Logan Paul, what I thought was, oh, this is... Even though when someone gets famous in a novel way, you think, this isn't famous.  It should be from gramophone records.  Really, the world is continually changing.  And the type of stars that it sort of throws up, I've noticed that there are some archetypal qualities.  While I was interviewing him, I thought, yeah, he's a little bit like Elvis or a little bit like Eminem.  You know, sort of like a kind of, he's wholesome and like sort of decent and, like an inquiring and sort of bright and i watched much more of his content after i met him like video is like uh i suppose like.  i said that call out cussing video for his brother.  his brother called jake is right isn't it?  he's also super famous.  you know this already because you're connected to this world.  well i watched some of them videos and they were really funny.  himself whatever he is actually very funny and You can see why he's successful.  Anyway, so I met him.  I really, really like him.  He's very interested in the negative impact of fame.  He's very interested in mental health.  He's very interested in unstitching himself from the material world while still having objectives and goals within it, which is a complication that most of us face.  And now I'm on my way to this sort of millionaire, fart-filled frat house of marijuana.  I feel like there's not going to be enough furniture.  That's what I'm anticipating.  They need a woman's touch, this place, is what I should say.  Oh my God, they're like Mrs Doubtfire.  Come on, boys, let's get some curtains up.  Drapes.  Let's get some drapes up.  Put some bowls of potpourri around the place, which they'll probably eat in smoke.  Were you surprised by him in any way?  I was surprised by Liverpool because I thought he had a lot of warmth and sweetness and self-reflection.  Like, I always feel that people that are successful, my assumption with anyone that's successful is that they're basically going to be an asshole, that they're going to be just sort of a glacial, indefatigable personality that isn't porous enough to be present.  He's very present and inquiring.  You get used to, if you've been around famous people for a long time, and I have, you get used to dealing with that.  You just think, oh, you're a famous person, you're going to be sort of cubic and unapproachable, I'll just be ready for that.  But actually, then, you meet people and they're generally lovely, given that we're all born and we're all going to die and all of the basics, you know.  Anyway, he was surprising in that he seemed sweet and open and inquiring and bright.  I saw that!  You want it?  Well, yes!  Wait, really?  Well, I think I do, just because it's your offspring, Nicky.  I mean, it is very big.  Which one, mate?  The big one.  What's happened to it?  What?  Is it cursed, Ed?  No!  What's happened to this Buddha?  Nothing's happened to it, I just don't want to do it.  Is there a subplot to this?  Is this boy concealing a subplot because I know he's a prankster?  What's he doing?  It seems like everything's soft apart.  I don't think it's Buddha.  Okay, fair enough.  That's a lovely gift.  It's one of the most impressive and amazing things I've ever seen.  And I accept.  Thank you.  You really?  Thank you so much.  Yeah, so, like I said, because... Yeah, thank you.  Thanks for the Buddha, you beautiful young man.  For giving me the biggest Buddha I've ever seen in my entire life.  I mean, funnily enough, when I came into your garden earlier, I was like, wow, that's awesome.  I saw this, my eye fell upon this mighty, joyful Buddha.  I didn't imagine that I would soon be organising the shipping.  No way, no way.  Beautiful thing.  That's amazing.  Thank you again.  Really appreciate it. ",
