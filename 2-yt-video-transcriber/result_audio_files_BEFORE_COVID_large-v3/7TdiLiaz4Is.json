            "text": "Gentlemen.  Excuse me, officer.  Excuse me, officer.  Ask your question.  You always park on the sidewalk like that, bro?  Yeah.  So, I'm doing an investigation right now.  Give me a favor.  Okay, I'll wait for your investigation.  I'm sorry, what was you about to say?  Do me a favor.  Let me deal with it.  All right, I will do that, but I'm going to hang around and keep an eye on you.  Oh, you're going to keep an eye on me?  Yeah, I'm going to keep an eye on you.  You don't like it?  Keep an eye on me.  Sounds great.  You can hold that attitude, bro.  Can I ask, what are you investigating, bro?  It's none of your business.  Sure it is.  I live around here, bro.  How would you know that?  I'm not your bro.  I'm Sergeant.  You was just bro, Sergeant.  Smartass.  You was just... You keep the attitude, bro.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Come on, come on, come on.  Don't do that one, bro.  Okay, okay, okay.  Why are you on school property?  I'm on school property.  I'm on school property.  No, no, no.  We're trying to dismiss the kids.  Well, you can't recall, okay?  Sure, sure, okay.  It's illegal to recall kids.  Excuse me?  I will, I will, thank you.  What's your point?  You're within a thousand feet.  You think a thousand feet is school property?  Yeah.  It is.  It is.  No.  It's a law.  No.  You need to leave.  You need to leave.  No, no.  Hey, Sergeant Gonzalez.  Yeah, Gonzalez.  You want to explain to these cats that I'm breaking no laws?  Listen.  No.  Let us do it with our investigation and have a good day.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah.  What's your matter?  What do you have to do?  What's your interest?  What do you want?  That's just a simple question, bro.  You got angry, yo.  You a cop?  Yeah, I'm a cop.  Would you outdo yourself, sir?  Yeah, yeah.  Feel me.  Yeah, I'm a cop.  Yeah.  You gonna outdo yourself, bro?  No, I don't want to.  I know.  Chicago cops don't do that shit at all.  Have a good day, sir.  I will, Gonzalez.  But, uh... Have a good day.  I'm gonna have a good day.  Thank you for your concern, bro.  What?  I can't ask you a question, Joe, like why you parked on the sidewalk like that with kids down here, bro?  Okay, I said okay a long time ago.  Why don't you just leave, man?  Because I live around here.  I can go where I want to go, bro.  Why you staying by the school?  Because I want to know what it's like parking on the sidewalk.  It has nothing to do with you.  You got to ask us.  Come on, man.  You don't even have a car.  That's why you want to know why somebody's parking down here.  Right on, right on, Gus.  You're a clown, though.  Makes two of us, yeah?  I'm not a cop.  I can break your shit.  You can break my phone.  Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I agree.  I just asked you why you're here, bro.  Because I just told you.  Okay, you know, you're trying to find out why I parked on the sidewalk.  That's what I asked you, yes.  Right, because there was a huge fight on Friday, okay, and I'm trying to prevent another fight.  All right, can you do that legally, Joe, by not parking on the sidewalk, by not breaking laws?  Please, please.  You don't like that, do you?  It has nothing to do with that.  Okay, well, answer my question.  Makes two of us prick and Godzilla's.  You have the 50?  Yeah.  All right.  Appreciate you.  Okay?  Yes.  Yes.  If you need anything, look me up, please.  I will.  I'll be down there, bro.  Gee.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Thank you.  Thank you much for that, kid.  Thank you much.  Thank you much.  These niggas ain't gods.  See?  Okay. ",
