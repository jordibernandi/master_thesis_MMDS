            "text": "Greetings, this is Indian in the Machine.  Today I wish to talk about the blood of Jesus.  This is sometimes a confusing area for people.  Let's face it, there are some churches out there that drink the blood of Jesus.  metaphorically.  If you've gone to the Catholic Church, you've seen the priest drink the blood of Jesus.  Is that a good thing?  Let's imagine instead of Jesus, that it is you or someone that you know.  And you are watching the priest drink their blood.  So, taking things further, why would humans want to drink the blood of Jesus if they consider him to be their friend?  Does God want us to be drinking our friend's blood? ",
