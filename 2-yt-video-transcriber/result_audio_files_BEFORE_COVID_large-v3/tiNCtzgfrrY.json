I wanted to be one of the best basketball players to ever play.  And anything else that was outside of that lane, I didn't have time for.  I made that deal with myself at 13 years old.  So everything I saw, whether it was TV shows, whether it was books I read, people I talked to, Everything was done to try to learn how to become a better basketball player.  Everything.  Everything.  And so when you have that point of view, then literally the world becomes your library to help you to become better at your craft.  So at 13 years old, I had a kill list.  And so, you know, they used to do these rankings.  It was Street and Smith basketball rankings.  And I was nowhere to be found because I was like 6'4\", scrawny, like 160 pounds soaking wet.  So I was like 57 on the list.  And so I will look at 56, 55, all the way up to number one, who these players are, what club teams they played for.  So when we go on an AAU travel circuit, I got to hunt them down.  Right.  And so that became my mission in high school is to check off every other person, all those 56 other names, hunt them down and knock them down.  You know, you got to look at the reality of the situation.  You know, like for me, it's not, you know, you kind of got to get over yourself.  Like, it's not about you, man.  Like, okay, you feel embarrassed.  You're not that important.  Like, get over yourself. ",

Get over yourself, right?  And then after that, it's okay.  Well, why did those air balls happen?  Got it.  High school, year before, we played 35 games, max, right?  Week in between, spaced out, plenty of time to rest.  In the NBA, it's back to back to back to back to back to back to back.  I didn't have the legs.  So you look at the shot, every shot was online.  Every shot was online, but every shot was short, right?  I got to get stronger.  I got to train differently.  The weight training program that I'm doing, I got to tailor it.  for an 82-game season so that when the playoffs come around, my legs are stronger and that ball gets there.  So I look at it with rationale and say, okay, well, the reason why I shot air ball is because my legs aren't there.  I go, well, next year they'll be there.  That was it. ",

My vertical was a 40.  It wasn't a 46 or a 45.  My hands are big, but they're not massive.  So you've got to figure out ways to strengthen them.  so your hands are strong enough to be able to palm a ball and do the things that you need to do.  Quickness, I was quick, but not insanely quick.  I was fast, but not ridiculously fast.  So I had to rely on skill a lot more.  I had to rely on angles a lot more.  I had to study the game a lot more.  But I enjoyed it, though.  So from the time I was, I can remember when I started watching the game, I studied the game, and it just never changed. ",

But it's a balancing act.  And that's the thing that's important is understanding that we have to have so much energy.  because for like Natalia and Gianna, when they were babies, especially Natalia, because there's doing prime years.  And I go to practice and I train and I play the game and I come home and I'd be sore and I'd be tired.  And she wants to go swimming.  She wants me to take her to the park.  She wants to just jump on my back or whatever the case may be.  You can't say, I'm too tired.  I'm going to lay down.  That's not fair.  She don't know what the hell's going on.  Right?

We actually had this happen.  We had a game against Toronto in 2000.  And Vince was tearing the league up.  My back was jacked, jacked.  But like the perception of that, like what?  Kobe's missing the game against Toronto and Vince Carter because, you know, my back was really spasming.  But people will be like, what?  Oh, he's ducking Vince.  Excuse me?  No, I don't think so.

Soccer, basketball, volleyball, whatever it is, can't do anything.  Doctor tells you go home, sit up on the couch, rest your hammy, right?  Stay off of it.  Don't get up.  No sudden movements.  You're at home, all of a sudden a fire breaks out in the home, right?  Your kids are upstairs, you know, wife is wherever she may be, you know, shit's going down, right?  I'm willing to bet that you're going to forget about your hamstring, you're going to sprint upstairs, you're going to grab your kids, you know, make sure your wife's good, you're getting out of that house, right?  Hamstring be damned.  You're not going to feel your hamstring, right?  And the reason is because the lives of your family are more important than the injury of your hamstring.  And so when the game is more important than the injury itself, you don't feel that damn injury.  Not at that time.  I went in the trainer's room, my kids are in there, and they're looking at you and stuff, and I'm looking at them, and I'm like, it's all right, dad's going to be all right.  It'll be fine.  It'll be all right.  It'll be all right.  It'll be all right.  As a parent, you've got to set the example.  You got to set the example.  This is another obstacle.  This obstacle cannot define me.  It's not going to cripple me.  It's not going to be responsible for me stepping away for the game that I love.  I'm going to step away on my own terms.
