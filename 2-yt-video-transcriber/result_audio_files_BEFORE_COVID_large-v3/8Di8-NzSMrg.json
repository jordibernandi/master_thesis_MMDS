            "text": "Thank you.  I want to talk to you about a really great French film from the 70s called La Valais.  Now, it seems like some kind of hippie film but it's actually got an important message.  It's about a bunch of hippies basically who go on a trip in Papua New Guinea deep into some jungle to go and meet tribal people.  They're actually hunting out for a kind of a lost valley.  But the actual meaning of the film is about how these hippies are in their alternative lifestyle rejecting the Western traditions that they were raised in.  These French and Australian people, they're looking for an alternative life.  something they find is lacking in the West, so they believe they find it in the company of the primitive people, Papuan people, the tribal people.  Now, of course, people still think like this.  In fact, this is something that went back to Rousseau and the ideas of the noble savage.  The idea that people look on primitive man and they see a kind of, you know, the remnants of Eden in the savage.  And this happens now, of course, and it happens with, you know, hippies, like left-wing people who go traveling and, you know, think that, like, you know, these women who want to have their photo taken with lots of brown children and stuff like that.  But it also happens among people who project this onto their ancestors and they want to believe that there was some kind of, you know, harmony with nature in pagan times or whatever that we've lost.  Now, of course, it's mostly fantasy, but even what if it is true is also important, I think, to hear this clip of the film.  I just want to play to you because the guy here, the Australian guy, tells this French woman why you cannot recapture this lost innocence that we feel that we might have, we've left behind somewhere along the way in the March of Progress.  And he even says that the way to return to something authentic would actually be to take another bite of the apple, using a biblical metaphor.  You know, we've lost Eden through knowledge.  In that sense, if we take that in the metaphor of progress, we have lost the innocence of savagery through science.  the next step is not to go try to return back because you can't regain innocence once lost but it's rather to carry on forwards and with the knowledge that we have and try to reconcile what we of Westerners have created in the form of you know the materialist viewpoint and the progress of science with religious or a spiritual perspective on life and that's what I try to do myself.  that's something I try to do.  I'm not advocating that you take all your clothes off and run around like a savage.  I am very conscious of the fact that I live in the modern world and you should be too.  So this point in the film occurs after they've been staying for a while with a certain tribe and the woman is very very happy, she feels like she's built a real rapport with this tribe and that she's entered a special kind of state of existence and harmony with these primitive people and with nature around her.  But she gets slapped down by the Australian guy who tells it like it is.  And I'll just leave the clip to speak for itself because it's great.  And I recommend you watch the whole film too when you've got time. ",
