            "text": "we are the god culture a group of independent researchers with no affiliation to any denomination nor organization whatsoever.  we read the word and we test it as first.  thessalonians five twenty one tells us prove all things hold fast that which is good a new song a new sound.  will we be seeing this in this age in this era?  we believe so and from the philippines especially according to scripture.  we'll show you this video will review scripture which supports this and end with an incredible story from the philippines of an instrument maker who dreamed of an ancient Philippine instrument lost in modern times, yet confirmed.  Watch this and see what you think.  Is prophecy beginning to play out?  We thought you would enjoy especially this authentic story from a worshiper at heart.  Enjoy the journey.  First, some foundational scriptures.  In our last video, we drilled into the language of this particular passage.  But for this purpose, regarding a new song from the Isles of the East, we see this as appropriate for this topic as well.  The King James says, Wherefore glorify ye the Lord, Yahuwah, in the fires or light?  Even the name of Yahuwah, God of Israel in the Isles of the Sea.  The NIV renders this in the east instead of fires or light.  Why?  Because that is the region of light.  And it's a reference to the light of creation, not even the sun.  But the light before the sun was created, which wasn't created until day four.  Yet there was light.  Think about that.  In the islands of the sea.  The NLT also.  Eastern lands.  Lands beyond the sea or Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea.  What islands are east of Israel?  In the region of light, beyond the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, that would be the Philippines.  And they will glorify Yahuwah, but it gets more specific.  Isaiah 42, sing unto the Lord, Yahuwah, a new song and his praise from where?  From the end of the earth.  Who is that?  Ye that go down to the sea south and all that is there in the isles and the inhabitants thereof.  Isaiah keeps mentioning these isles of the east where the sun rises, where the region of light is, the light of creation at the ends of the earth, south of Israel and east.  The Philippines is going to sing a new song, a new sound.  will come from this nation.  not karaoke nor cover tunes even in worship but a new authentic sound that will astonish the earth and we can't wait to hear it.  let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice The villages of Kedar, which means dark skinned.  We covered that before.  Doth inhabit.  Let the inhabitants of the rock sing.  Let them shout from the tops of the mountains.  Let them give glory unto Yahuwah and declare His praise where?  In the islands.  Now, we are going to play a clip for you.  We'll let him tell his story.  But this is authentic.  And we hope you will find it amazing as we have, as his story really blesses us much.  Ladies and gentlemen, the lost instrument of the Philippines.  This will bless you. ",

            "text": "Back in 2013, I had a dream and I woke up from the dream.  What I saw in the dream was a tribe of people, and I asked them what their names were, and they said that they were the .  And then I also saw this musical instrument.  I'm an instrument maker, so I ended up getting, in the dream, a full download of the instrument, you know, the measurements and how it was tuned and how it was played and everything.  So I ended up making it, ended up researching, trying to find this word .  but could not find anything on the internet, could not find anything from all of my anthropologist friends around the world.  They did not know the word .  Actually, after six months or so, ended up running into a person actually from that tribe.  And I ended up going with this man to his people group called the Tinenanen people.  I ended up taking the instrument, the exact thing that I saw in the dream, I took it with me to the Tinenanen.  And I felt from the Lord that I needed to give it to the chief of the tribe.  He was absolutely amazed by this instrument and he ended up talking with his other chiefs and they were saying, this instrument, where did you get it from?  I said, oh, I just kind of made it.  They're like, no, I'm serious.  Where did you get this instrument from?  They said, we got to show you something.  They ended up taking me to their house of prayer, showing me that they have different instruments that worship different gods.  Many, many years ago, they had this one instrument called the salimba.  And this instrument was the instrument that they worshiped the God of all gods.  And they said that the day that I brought that instrument to them, I brought them the salemba.  And they believed that there was a lament that came out of that time that says the enemy has taken away the salemba, therefore one day God is going to restore it back to us.  And the time that God redeems it back to us and God is going to call all the righteous people to him.  The thing is, is that... We see that the gospel has been hidden in their culture for centuries.  We have just not even realized it until now.  And same for them.  They haven't realized it.  But the gospel of Jesus Christ has been hidden in their culture and in their belief system.  And now it's being revealed.  And so they're wondering who this Jesus is. ",
