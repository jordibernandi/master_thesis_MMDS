Gold has broken out from the bottom of a six-year trading trough, and now over the last... month and a half or so has been above what was previously like a no-go zone beyond where it had been trading for all that time.  What do you see as driving the action of gold?  And as you watch it on a daily basis, what do you think is different about how it's behaving now? ",

And since then, the gold price has rallied more than $100.  And I've never seen anything like it before, having watched it for 20 years and trading commodities in a pretty big scale over a period of time.  Everything's changed.  And I think it's because the gold cartel, as we call it, the bullion banks, central banks, U.S.  government, and so on, are running out of enough physical gold to take on all the buying that's coming in all over the world for the right reasons.  And yes, there were a lot of these reasons before, but now they've hit the wall on physical supply.  It's there, but it's dwindling.  And every time they attack nowadays, the gold price comes right back in a day or two, or hours.  In the old days, it was dead for a month or two.  It didn't have a chance.  It's totally changed.  Gold has reached all-time highs in 73 different currencies.  I don't see any reason in not too long coming up that we don't make an all-time high in gold, because I think it's something so powerful going on behind the scenes that the bad guys are just in big trouble, and we're going to soon get what we call a commercial signal failure, in which the shorts, the commercials, the gold cartel actually get beat, and they're not used to that hardly ever.

One thing from my standpoint, I don't believe anything the central banks say or do because all we've found them to do is to lie for 20 years, never give out the truth, never answer questions.  So it's very difficult.  to know exactly what's going on.  But we heard of a tight physical gold market a couple of years ago, and it didn't mean anything, or nothing happened.  It went on and on and on.  And then we've had this phenomenon for a couple of years, exchange for physicals, which is a rare thing on the COMEX.  We exchange the futures contract for physical, and they've been enormous at times.  And nobody quite knows exactly how it works or a positive of it.  But I think it's all about a tightening physical gold market that is really in scarce supply.  And they may have done something because they know it's coming and they can't stop it.  Certainly, they can.  And we know it's them trading because nothing else is going on.  So it's very possible there can be some kind of default, especially because there are so many claims on a physical ounce of gold.  You know, 10, 11 years ago, it was supposed to be 100 to 1, and people say it's much higher than that.  If you have a Deutsche, interesting enough, gold started to take off around the time Deutsche Bank had its restructuring program.  and possibly there's a lot of defaults out there on physical on physical claims of gold and it's just reverberating and it's got the people that need gold in there buying it because they have to get it back.

And this is what was being done in the gold market.  And we think to a big degree.  And if that's kicking in gradually and they're scrambling to get gold back to to get back to clients because they, for example, say a Deutsche Bank retail sales operations closing down.  Well, they've got to get the gold back to the people.  They can't just say, well, it's not there.  So it's it's.  what we do know for sure is.  Something major is going on behind the scenes.

I still hold out hope that myself or my daughter will reap the benefits of a higher silver price.  But man, the criminals have taken over every aspect of this government.  Nobody goes to jail.  You hold out hope that somebody's going to come in and drain the swamp, but they just changed the color of the alligators from blue to red.  I hope I live long enough to see some of these criminals in jail and the system change back to the way it used to be, signed old school.

So me being about as old a school as you can get to, all I can say is, and I was around for the hunt fiasco.  and what a disaster and unfair thing that occurred.  And the irony is now, as well as gold is acting, which I just went into, silver is the most boring, worst acting market I've ever seen in my whole life.  J.P.  Morgan has it under total control.  They've lost control of gold.  They're going bonkers trying to keep the silver price down.  The open interest on the COMEX is 100,000 contracts plus more than it was when gold went to $50 an ounce in 2011.  And it's the most aggravating thing I've ever watched in all my life.  You walk come in, it just sits there for like at one price for like four or five hours.  as active as gold is.  They somehow, to me, I think they have a big problem.  Gold's going to go bananas.  And now the gold silver ratio is about 90 to one.  It's a joke.  Silver should be about 25 bucks right now if it was equivalent to gold, in my opinion.  So I think what's going to happen is Morgan, JP Morgan is trying to figure out what to do.  Gold market is going to take off.  And at some point, they're going to have to make some kind of adjustment.  I don't know, buy all kinds of over-the-counter options or do something to get themselves out of their short trap in the futures market.  And it's only a matter of time.  and it gets more frustrating every single day because I'm somebody who probably mentioned you some time ago, I'm looking for silver to go to 100.  It can't even get past 1660.  You know, and it's them.  It's exactly what the old school is talking about.  It's the most corrupt thing I've ever seen.  And it's so obvious. ",

Everything is there in every reason for the gold market to soar.  And what people don't understand is, many of your people do, but it was artificially suppressed all that year to an artificially low price.  Pardon me, it was suppressed to an artificially low price.  It wasn't artificial suppression.  And that's all that power has built up in the gold and silver markets because it was kept too low for too long.  And now it's been let out of the cage, so to speak.  And that's why gold is trading so differently because of the physical market, as I mentioned.  And silver, when it ever does take on JP Morgan and make the big move will be spectacular.  People know that have followed silver, people that have followed the silver market, when silver goes, it moves up faster than on almost any other market there is.

Eric Sprott remarked a little while ago that in the Silver ETF, there was 11 times the normal amount of buying.
