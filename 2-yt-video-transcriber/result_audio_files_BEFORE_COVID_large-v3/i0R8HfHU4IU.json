It's almost like there's this giant vegan bible and everyone is an expert gospel preacher.  We're going to take a look at a young lady's vegan week of eating.  And what I want you guys to notice is the similarities in the food she's eating and the things she's saying.  We have seen this in dozens and dozens, pretty much every single vegan out there to some degree.  Interestingly enough, the main thing here is the response to this girl's video from other people.  Anytime a vegan doesn't look healthy, is a little skinny, seems to not be eating a ton of food, they start blaming the person that they have an eating disorder, that they're not doing the vegan diet right, as to deter people from the negatives of the vegan diet.  This falls in line with the no true Scotsman fallacy where if someone isn't doing something in line with what you believe, you try to discredit them as opposed to blaming the true cause.  hey guys welcome back to my channel.

She's already claiming a plant-based diet is healthy, just repeating stuff ad nauseam without actually giving any sort of resources, proof, saying that vegetables, the more fresh and colorful, the healthier they are.  To me, the fact that these people are able to speak about these things off the top of their head as if they are assumed and that everyone knows them is a problem that falls in line with conventional wisdom and culture.  We have been told our whole lives that fruits and vegetables are good for us.  So when these vegans come and say that this plant by sight is so healthy, people believe them. ",

Guys, if you think something is going to detox your body, That is what the liver is for.  That is what water fasting is for.  If you think lemon is going to alkalize your blood, that is not true.  Your stomach is acidic and it will always remain at an acidic pH.  Your blood is always slightly alkaline and your body will do its best to maintain homeostasis by keeping your blood at a slightly alkaline pH.  pH.  And lemons don't specifically stimulate bowel movements.  It's going to be a matter of hydration.  So if you needed water to push the digestive waste through your system, obviously drinking water with a little bit of lemon in it is going to stimulate your digestion. ",

This is another one of my pet peeves with vegans.  They use these words, these buzzwords before and after.  they say things like cleansing, alkalizing, detox, fresh, vibrant, colorful.  They use positive associations of words with food.  They use emotion.  They are driven by emotion as opposed to fact.  If she actually had any semblance of understanding of nutrition, well, first of all, I wouldn't be critiquing her video because she wouldn't be following this crazy, ridiculous vegan diet.  But if she could actually address and assess every single one of these foods individually on a nutritional standpoint, what the availability of the vitamins and minerals are, then we could be having a conversation.  But this is the key thing here, guys.  These vegans don't actually have an understanding of nutrition.  They just heard things from their friends.  They see people doing other things in videos, and they repeat things over and over again as opposed to doing research themselves.  And by research, this is very simple stuff.  If you Google broccoli and you look at the nutrition profile of broccoli and you see what vitamins are in it and then you look up, okay, vitamin A broccoli, you might probably find that vitamin A in broccoli is actually in the form of carotene.  And then if you look up, okay, carotene digestion or carotene absorption or can we utilize carotene, you'll find data.  So this is not something that's incredibly complicated to figure out.  It's just these people are \u2013 they either don't care or they're.  I mean I can't blame them.  you know most people don't really like putting a lot of time and effort into things and they'd rather be emotionally driven and be happy.  and you know on one hand I I wish I was stupid and happy like that.  it's.  you know I'm like a cynical pessimistic person but what are you gonna do?

            "text": "So that was her Monday day of eating.  And in regards to that last meal, a couple things to touch on.  Avocados never really had a lot of fruit or flesh on them.  Modern avocados are far different than what used to grow in the wild.  And tying back into the idea that vegetables are so healthy for us, just by having a huge plate full of vegetables that don't really have any semblance of nutrition, once you actually look into the nutrient availability, It really is damaging people's health.  And if this girl ate like this every single day, I'm 100% sure she would develop goiter because cruciferous vegetables have various anti-nutrients in them, such as goitrogens, that inhibit your thyroid function.  not only that i don't believe this is what this girl ate today.  i believe that this girl is cheating on her diet and misleading her viewers and this is probably one of the most important messages that i'm going to get out in.  this video is just because you see someone do something on camera.  It is not an indication of what they are doing in their day-to-day life.  In the case of a vegan diet, if someone cheats on a vegan diet, they're misleading people because when you cheat on a vegan diet and you eat animal foods or any other high-calorie foods, you're saying, okay, this is healthy, but I can't actually follow this diet because I'm missing something or there's actually something wrong with it.  In the case of me following a carnivore diet, if I cheat on the carnivore diet, there's no real... so to speak, because my claims in regards to the nutrient content of the carnivore diet, there's nothing missing.  You can get every single vitamin and mineral on a carnivore diet.  In the case of a vegan diet, we know there are a lot of nutrients that are deficient.  Vitamin A in the form of retinol is not present, and carotene has a limited availability.  Some people can't even convert it.  Vitamin K2 is not present in most people's diets in large amounts.  It is present in fermented foods and high-quality animal foods.  We have DHA omega-3 fatty acids.  something that's usually swept under the rug in the context of a vegan diet.  I mean, algae supplements tend to be polluted, and vegans definitely don't get enough DHA.  B12, of course, what's most associated with neurocognitive issues.  And if any of you vegans are out there and you think blood levels are D12 indicative of tissue levels, you might want to do a little research on that because even if you do take B12 supplements, I would personally be concerned about your mental health and well-being.  Overall, guys, I don't think this is all this girl consumed during the day.  And this is from a caloric standpoint.  You know, we could safely say that She's not really consuming enough calories or as many calories as she should.  But in regards to the food volume, the food volume is so high, I don't think this lady could actually consume any more than she is right now.  That shake and that salad are so voluminous that... to eat any more than that and to put any more than that in your digestive system is a testament to what foods humans are supposed to be eating.  If you compared a human's digestive system to a cow's digestive system, cows have five gallons of liquid fermenting in their stomach at all times.  And this is five gallons.  as if I was a human.  Cow stomachs are much larger than five gallons of fluid.  So imagine you drank five gallons of water and that was what was in your stomach.  That is the digestive capability of what we would need if we were ruminant animals.  Their bacteria can literally ferment cellulose into... Fact, humans literally evolved because of our ability to procure high-calorie, low-bulk foods that were giving us nutrition.  And we didn't require large stomachs.  We didn't require large muscles to procure our food.  This allowed our brain growth and development.  So thank you guys for watching.  I've touched on a few points I might not have in this video, and I could probably touch on dozens more, but I'm going to leave that for you guys to explore.  my other vegan day of eating videos, vegan critique videos.
