And they'd poke fun at the president, but it was nothing super vicious or... or malicious.  It was just kind of like a different environment in comedy clubs.  Today, comedians, literally full-blown Trump derangement syndrome.

It's like, I look at it like this, everybody that's calling other people racist, they have to check their self in America.  Like I had this one girlfriend, she kept accusing me of cheating on her.  What?  Right?  Yeah, she kept accusing me of cheating on her, find out she was cheating on me.  And then I got another relationship, I was accusing the girl, then she was cheating on me.
