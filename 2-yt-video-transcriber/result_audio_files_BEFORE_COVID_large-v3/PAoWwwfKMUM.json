            "text": "So Nicholas Sandman settled his lawsuit with CNN, and what does it all mean?  I gotta go to the dentist, so we're gonna do this over there, and I'll tell you my thoughts.  Viva Pry, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber, and for anybody who has been around this channel for a while, you know that I have done quite a few videos on the Nicholas Sandman defamation lawsuit.  We've analyzed the lawsuit itself paragraph by paragraph.  We've analyzed the Washington Post's motion to dismiss of Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit.  We've analyzed the judgment granting the Washington Post motion to dismiss, and we've analyzed the judgment retracting the judgment granting the Washington Post motion to dismiss.  This is another vlog that keeps on vlogging, and people are going to be studying this defamation lawsuit in years to come.  Oh, there's a dog here.  So starting from the beginning, I take for granted everybody knows the situation, but in a nutshell, Nicholas Sandman and other kids from the Covington Catholic High School are at the Lincoln Memorial for a March for Life event.  A situation arises with another group of people who happen to be on site known as the Black Hebrew Israelites.  Enter into the scene a Native American named Nathan Phillips and there's a snapshot of this kid, Nicholas Sandman, wearing a MAGA hat staring at Nathan Phillips.  A short video went viral which appeared to show these kids surrounding the Native American man.  To say that mainstream media picked up and ran with the story would be an understatement.  They ran a two minute mile with that story.  They ran a one and a half hour marathon with that story.  Mainstream media picked up that story and ran with it incessantly for at the very least 24 hours.  Above and beyond actually naming Nicholas Salmon, who was a minor at the time, mainstream media were branding these kids as racist, Trump's America, this is the face of hatred in America.  It turns out that the story was actually 180 degrees inverted.  When people actually took the time to watch the full video of the event, which had been online from the very beginning, it became clear that it was actually the black Hebrew Israelites that were hurling insults at the Covington Catholic kids.  It equally became clear that the Covington Catholic Kids did not approach and encircle Nathan Phillips either.  Nathan Phillips, in fact, approached the Covington Catholic Kids and went up to Nicholas Sandman's face, banging his drum.  It turns out that a number of the interviews Nathan Phillips gave in the wake of the event were totally inaccurate.  But in the age of viral videos and social media, the damage was done and these kids were not only doxxed, but totally defamed in the public's eyes.  Nicholas Sandman ended up suing a number of media outlets, in particular CNN, Washington Post, and NBC Universal for over $250 million each for defamation and pain and suffering.  The other Covington Catholic kids ended up suing a number of celebrities and politicians for their role in tweeting and retweeting false information as relates to the event.  Incidentally, I did a livestream with Robert Barnes, the attorney for the Covington Catholic Kids.  I'm gonna link that video right here.  If you have a couple of hours, give it a watch.  It's a darn good livestream.  So that is the factual context.  Now, the legal context.  The Washington Post, at one point in time, filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and I did a video on that as well.  In their motion, which I predicted had zero chances of success, they alleged that Sandman failed to state a claim that was actionable in law.  I said I would eat my shorts if the Washington Post motion to dismiss was granted, and lo and behold, Washington Post motion to dismiss was granted.  And I did, in fact, purport to eat my shorts.  I put them in my mouth.  I didn't actually eat them and digest them.  Basically, this motion to dismiss seeks the premature dismissal before any hearing on the merits, before any witnesses have been heard.  It seeks the dismissal of the suit and the preclusion of the plaintiff from ever suing on the same or similar basis again.  Chances of that happening?  I will eat my torn Tommy John underwear.  How's that?  After the Washington Post motion to dismiss was granted, Nicholas Salmon filed something of a motion for review.  And that is basically a request to the judge who granted the Washington Post motion to dismiss to review his decision.  And lo and behold, the judge actually reviewed his own decision and granted the motion in part and reinstated in part Nicholas Salmon's lawsuit against the Washington Post.  Now admittedly, the lawsuit was only reinstated in part, meaning that Nicholas Salmon lost a substantial portion of his claim against the Washington Post.  But he nonetheless preserved a certain portion of his lawsuit in defamation against the Washington Post, which means that the lawsuit can go on and proceed to discovery.  And January 7th, 2020, the news breaks and my inbox goes wild.  Nicholas Sandman has settled his lawsuit for defamation against CNN.  The amount is as yet undisclosed, and I strongly suspect will always remain undisclosed.  But the headline is there nonetheless.  CNN agrees to settle Nicholas Salmon's defamation lawsuit.  Now, pundits are pundifying, spinners are spinning that this is a massive victory for Nicholas Salmon, but is it?  I've got to tell you, anybody spinning this as either a massive victory or a crushing defeat is making certain assumptions on the quantum of the settlement.  And what do I mean by this?  Let's start with the basics.  Settlements, what are they?  Settlements are basically the parties deciding that they are not going to go to judgment, they are going to resolve their dispute amicably.  Now, opening up a parenthesis, everything I'm about to say now is based on Quebec and Canadian law, because that is where I'm certified to practice.  But I strongly suspect the procedure is the same in other jurisdictions.  If the parties settle out of court, what they're going to do is file what they call a declaration of settlement out of court.  And it's literally just a piece of paper, a procedure that goes in the court record to identify in the court record that the file has been settled.  Unless the amounts at issue are absolutely insignificant or the parties have totally incompetent attorneys, they will draft settlement documents between the parties.  But those settlement documents do not need to be filed in the court record and oftentimes are not and are kept confidential.  Alright, opening up a slight parenthesis here, sometimes it will happen that the parties actually file their settlement agreement in the court record and there are a couple of reasons why this may be done.  If the settlement agreement contains certain conditions and either or both of the parties want to make that settlement document sort of enforceable in law, they will do what is called homologate the settlement agreement by the court.  The parties will file the settlement documents and ask the court to give that settlement document the force of a judgment.  And that is called homologating a settlement agreement.  The court gives those settlement documents the force of a judgment, and if either of the parties fail to respect certain terms in that settlement agreement, they can be held in contempt of court.  Now the parties don't have to homologate their settlement agreement because that does involve making it public.  The only downside is if that settlement agreement contains certain conditions that the parties must do or must not do, and the parties do or do not do those things, They are not automatically in contempt of court.  in the same way they would be had they violated a court judgment or a court homologation of the settlement agreement.  Highly technical reasons why parties may want to in fact homologate their settlement agreement, which makes it public, versus keeping it private but not giving the settlement document an actual force of a judgment of the court.  Back to the video.  So while there is a declaration of settlement out of court filed in the court record to let the world know that the parties have settled, the terms of the settlement oftentimes remain confidential to the rest of the world.  But filing a declaration of settlement out of court is not the only way to settle a file.  Sometimes a party can simply discontinue or desist from its lawsuit against another party.  And that is simply to say that for whatever the reason, the party that was suing the other party says, I don't want to sue anymore, I am withdrawing, discontinuing, or desisting from my claim.  Okay, you need to go back down.  Now, at the very least, in Quebec, there is a big difference between settling a lawsuit by way of discontinuance versus declaration of settlement out of court.  Technically speaking, if a party discontinues or desists from its lawsuit, in theory, it can refile on the same basis to the extent that they fit within the statute of limitations to file that claim.  And just to clarify what that means, if a party says, okay, I am withdrawing my proceedings, they can nonetheless sue again on that basis if it's within whatever time frame applies to that cause of action.  Whereas if the parties file a declaration of settlement out of court, the petitioning party cannot ever refile on the same or similar basis ever again.  The lawsuit is done and typically the settlement documents specifically provide a full and final release for any and all claims directly or indirectly related to the basis of that lawsuit.  Another huge difference is that when the parties settle out of court, typically they provide that each party pays its own costs.  Court costs, bail of costs, filing fees, etc.  Whereas if the plaintiff discontinues or desists from its lawsuit, the defendant hasn't necessarily given full release for court costs that the defendant has incurred in defending against that claim.  So in theory, even if a petitioning party decides to discontinue or desist from its lawsuit, the defendant can say, okay, you can desist from your lawsuit, but I am nonetheless going to claim court costs from you as a result of your discontinuance.  All that to highlight the difference between a desistment or a discontinuance on the one hand and a settlement on the other.  In the Sandman situation, we know that the parties have settled out of court.  They filed a declaration to that effect in the court record.  We just don't know the quantum, if any, of that settlement.  And I am saying, if any, not to suggest or imply that nobody changed hands in the context of this particular settlement.  I'm saying it only to illustrate the fact that even in the context of a declaration of settlement out of court, it's not always the case that the defendant pays the plaintiff.  There are an infinite number of reasons for which a plaintiff might want to settle a lawsuit.  It might be costing them too much money.  It might be too stressful.  They might be too tired.  They may have just realized that certain information is going to become public, and they don't want that information to become public.  They may have come to the revelation that their case has absolutely no chances of success, and they want to avoid the potential for a cross-claim.  Now, I'm thoroughly convinced that none of these hypotheses apply to the Sandman-CNN lawsuit, but these are nonetheless things to consider.  A settlement between the parties doesn't necessarily mean that the defendant has agreed to pay massive sums of money to the plaintiff.  So, Nicholas Sandman and CNN have agreed to settle the dispute.  What do we make of that information?  Unless we know the quantum of the settlement, we can't make very much of that information.  We know that Sandman was suing CNN for a massive amount of $250 million, but there is not necessarily any correlation between the amount claimed in the lawsuit and the amount of the settlement.  We know that Sandman was also suing Washington Post for $250 million.  But we also know that a judge dismissed a substantial portion of Nicholas Sandman's lawsuit against the Washington Post on the basis that he failed to stay the claim in law.  Although that judgment was rendered in the Washington Post file, it nonetheless gives a flavor to the parties in the Sandman versus CNN file as to where that file might go.  Nicholas Salmon just saw a substantial portion of his claim dismissed on a summary motion to dismiss.  He might be more inclined to settle with CNN for a much lesser amount to avoid the potential for that happening in that lawsuit.  Now, I personally happen to think that that is not all that likely.  I think this is a question of principle for Nicholas Salmon and he is eager to get to a trial on the merits before a jury, even if it is to lose the file.  Alright, and I have to open up another parenthesis right here, because even in the context of these types of lawsuits, one does not only need to consider the plaintiff's intentions.  One must also take into consideration the nature of the relationship and the mandate between the plaintiff and his attorneys.  If a lawyer is taking the case on contingency and incurring substantial costs in the interim, they may have an incentive not to wait for trial.  They may have an incentive to agree to a settlement because money now is better than potential money later.  It's very easy for a plaintiff who may not be paying their attorneys to fight on principle alone.  Their attorneys, however, still have rent, payroll, other expenses, and may not take a three-year file on principle alone.  I have no idea what the payment arrangement is, what the nature of the mandate is between Nicholas Sandman and his attorneys.  And incidentally, this is one of the fundamental perils and pitfalls of an attorney taking a file on contingency.  Sure, you may not have to pay your attorney, but they may have a vested interest in settling the file and taking good money now as opposed to potential money later.  Back to the video.  Oftentimes in the practice of law, people just want to tell their story even if a judge or jury says they're wrong.  They want their day in court, they want to be heard, and they want the world to hear them.  But not knowing the quantum of the settlement, we are not going to be in any position to draw any conclusions as to whether or not this was a victory or a defeat for Nicholas Sandman.  And you have to establish your numbers for what you would consider to be a victorious settlement.  If the settlement is for a million dollars, would you consider that to be a victory for Nicholas Sandman?  First and foremost, I strongly suspect that CNN has liability insurance to cover this claim if they don't have defamation insurance outright.  And this is a very interesting question in law because you can have liability insurance, you can have defamation insurance.  But typically, the insurance will not cover deliberate acts of malice.  Typically, the insurance will cover defense costs, it might cover settlement costs, but it will not cover the cost of a judgment, if the judgment comes to the conclusion that the defendant acted deliberately, maliciously, and willfully.  In theory, in the Sandman v. CNN lawsuit, it is conceivable that the judgment on the merits comes to the conclusion that CNN is in fact liable without coming to the conclusion that they acted maliciously or deliberately.  In which case, in theory, it would probably be covered by the insurance policy that I believe they probably have.  So as far as the insurance goes, in addition to potentially being ordered to cover the judgment on the merits, they would necessarily have to cover the defense costs, which themselves could be in the millions.  I would be surprised if the quantum of the settlement were for anything less than $5 million.  Bear in mind, by way of comparison, Bill O'Reilly settled one of his sexual harassment lawsuits for $32 million.  That being said, I would also be tremendously surprised if the quantum of the settlement were over $20 million.  So my window for the quantum of the settlement is anywhere between $5 and $20 million.  I may be totally wrong, and I guess the only plus to making a prediction based on a confidential settlement is that if the settlement remains confidential, I can never be proven wrong.  But that is my window of the settlement amount, anywhere between 5 and 20 million dollars.  Assuming the number is right, would that be a victory, would that be a defeat, or would that just be justice?  Now despite the fact that the quantum of the settlement is likely to remain confidential, at least to the rest of the world, one thing you can be sure of is that the parties will talk amongst themselves.  I guarantee you that the Washington Post and NBCUniversal know exactly the amount of the settlement.  And if they don't know the exact amount of the settlement, they have a darn good idea of the ballpark figure.  People always talk, always gossip, always share secrets, even when they know they are not supposed to.  And I think this might give us a good indication as to the quantum of the settlement and whether or not it was a victory or a defeat for Nicholas Sandman.  If CNN in fact settled for a relatively nominal amount, this will be an indication to the Washington Post and NBCUniversal that Sandman might be inclined to settle for whatever the reason.  In which case, you might see those other two files settle in short order as well.  If CNN settled for a much larger amount, you probably will not see the Washington Post settle because Washington Post probably feels a lot stronger in its case, given the state of its case.  Always bear in mind that the Washington Post had a substantial portion of Sandman's case tossed.  CNN did not have any portion of Sandman's lawsuit tossed and therefore faced the lawsuit in its entirety.  One final thought just to hammer home that we really cannot draw too many conclusions from the settlement not knowing anything more.  Oftentimes the insurance companies that cover these types of claims can settle the lawsuit without the consent of the insurer.  So we don't even know if this lawsuit was actually settled by the insurance company to the protest of CNN.  It is entirely conceivable that CNN said, no, absolutely not, we don't want to settle this.  But the insurance company says, too bad, we are taking carriage of this matter and we decide when it settles and we might just want to settle this to avoid all of the costs.  Certain insurance policies require the consent of the insured in order to settle, others do not, and we don't know what, if any, insurance CNN had in this file.  There are just too many factors to consider and not knowing the quantum of the settlement, we are not going to be in a position to determine if this was a victory or a defeat for Nicholas Sandman.  But I think we can reasonably predict that both parties are going to be posturing to position this settlement as a victory for each side.  Or, who knows, maybe they're not going to talk about it at all, and the next thing we're going to hear in this file is another settlement by WAPO and NBC Universal.  So those are my thoughts.  Don't believe the hype.  A settlement does not necessarily imply tens of millions of dollars of payment from the defendant to the plaintiff.  Incidentally, if you need to bone up on defamation law or the Sandman lawsuit itself, I'll post the playlist right here.  Give it a watch.  There's some good videos in there.  And, now you know you vlog.  Peace out.  Booyah! ",
