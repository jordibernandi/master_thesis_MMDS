Link will be in the description box below as usual.  Go get it.  PayPal link.  They also asked me to put it up, so I'll put it up.  Thanks everybody for supporting.  But this video though, this video is entitled The Hypocritical Disrespect of the Educated Lame.  I thought I did this before, but I guess not.  I did a lot of videos.  Here's the thing.  You know, when people consider somebody to be quote unquote educated lame, um, It's looked at like, you know, the guy straight laced, he went to school, he didn't make any mistakes in life.  But at the same time, he's whining about not getting the women that he wanted.  And he's, in some ways, part of the stereotype is he's not looking at himself to self-improve.  And if he dates other people, he's dating people who are, let's just say unattractive, right?  Now, part of that stereotype can absolutely fit.  You know, we know guys who are quote-unquote educated lames that don't want to self-improve their image.  You know, we do.  We know guys who... How can I put this?  Who may be a little bit socially awkward or whatever.  Yeah.  Or people who are just upset that the only thing is they're just educated and people looked at them as a backup plan.  They're pissed off about that, which is absolutely true, but But this aspect of their whining now I'm gonna do this from from a male-to-male standpoint As far as a black community in this and then because on the flip side of that is the pookie and ray-ray, right?  Now the educated lame is not looked at as a degenerate.  the pookie and ray-ray stereotype is.  but The problem with that is also the hypocrisy of how much you revere the Pookie and Ray Ray type.  Oh, man, if he was a criminal once in his past, that's okay.  Yeah, he was a drug dealer.  He was a pimp.  He was a gangster.  Yeah, he shot a couple of people up.  He went to jail.  All our best and brightest black men are in jail, but at the same time, You look at those type of guys as the best and the brightest because they're, first of all, criminals or criminal-minded, or they're just so stupid that they got caught.  But they're the best and the brightest.  But when they say something or the things that they have done in the community are just overlooked.  If they were selling drugs, that might have affected your family in some way.  If there was a gangster, that might have affected your family in some way.  The type of people that you say you dislike and have a disdain for and who might be a detriment to the community are the same people you're propping up as good people.  Who is the white man?  Well, it's not really the white man.  And the reason I'm bringing that part up is because, you know, when they speak, they're not whining.  They're aggressive.  They're the soldiers.  But, like, you know, I could have swore I said this before.  A lot of these Pookie and Ray Ray types are very much so afraid of white folks.  They're the very type of guy, we need people to fight white supremacy.  They're the very type of guy that'll pull a gun out on a black person and then when a white person show up, yes, sir.  I won't do that, sir.  I'm sorry, sir.  I will never, sir.  No.  No.  No, I'm not like that.  I promise.  Don't lock me up, sir.  See, that's the problem.  And that's the hypocrisy of part of this stuff.  Now, let me fast forward a little bit to the gender part.  Educated, lame is somebody who's educated.  Now here's the problem with educated lames and gender.  If you look at our women, we're highly educated.  So the highly educated people don't want educated people.  They don't have enough swagger.  So this kind of plays into the ideology of these educated lames.  Because a lot of these women who say they're educated, they're educated lames.  Just saying, even by definition.  They're educated, they went to school, they got a good education, and they stayed out of trouble.  Right?  But the same way, they have a lack of working on self-improvement too.  Because when guys talk about the dating market, what do you hear?  I went to school.  I got an education.  But you're overweight though.  But I got a degree.  I don't have to fix this.  But you take care of your weave more than you do your natural hair.  But I got a degree.  I don't have to fix that.  Your attitude sucks.  But I got a degree.  I don't have to fix that.  right right okay but because i'm educated you need to do all these things for me.  oh okay okay.  now what is the problem?  you know i'm not trying to say i'm not.  you know we're having problem finding good men.  But see, we're just talking about relationships and sexual market value and dating in general.  Now, if the men are having their issues and their complaints, they're whining.  If the women are having it, they're just speaking their mind.  They're speaking their truth.  Now, if the poogies and ray-rays are having complaints, they're not whining.  They, you know, they G-checking these girls.  This is a problem.  Big, big problem.  Because whether it's the men, it's only one group that can't complain.  That's the educated lame.  But everybody else can complain.  You know, educated lame complains, he's a whiner.  Everybody else is just a complainer.  Now, the reason I'm talking about this is because people don't want to take the time to think about or admit that you just don't want the educated lame to talk.  The educated lame is not supposed to have a voice in our community.  He don't have enough swagger to have a voice in the community, but he's the very person you need to fix the community.  So how can, you know, and the reason I'm making this video is because if the quote-unquote Pookie and Ray Ray guy was so damn good... ",
