She also, um, you know, what I really love about her is she's such a fighter and she doesn't back down.  Um, And, you know, as a woman, it's really, really fun to watch other women do that and take the stage and really kick ass.  So I'm super excited to see her on stage.

So Representative Tulsi Gabbard obtained 3% in an Iowa poll released today that was conducted by Quinnipiac University.  She's now obtained at least 3% in four polls in the early nominating states or national surveys, meeting the debate criteria.  And so this is a huge momentum for Representative Tulsi Gabbard.  Now, why is this?  And why is this important?  Well, number one... She managed to knock out former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when Clinton basically assumed or made this arrogant, insensitive comment saying that Tulsi Gabbard is a quote-unquote Russian asset or is being groomed by the Russians.

Her campaign is still gaining momentum.  And look, we even covered this some time ago with an article from The Washington Post, even though The Washington Post was \u2013 really smearing Tulsi Gabbard supporters.  she is gaining momentum in Iowa so it kind of goes back to this argument that myself and Daniel and Paul have mentioned and Kira I think you've mentioned as well and that is Tulsi Gabbard is going to be a wild card in this race.  she's not going anywhere.  um you know her campaign isn't slowing down and it's you know, so far she is being unapologetic and she's continuing to gain momentum.  And I feel that her voice and presence is needed because let's remember during the fourth democratic debate, she was censored a lot.  And when she even tried to call out Senator Elizabeth Warren, the moderators were quick to censor her.  So there's two things that Tulsi Gabbard needs to be aware of.  One, dominate do not back down when they censor you.  and then number two call out the moderators and those who are who've been challenging you during this race because this is the time now more than ever where you got to take the gloves off.  people are watching your supporters are watching and look.  we're going to be critical of all the candidates and we'll call out all the candidates if they have a week night.  but for representative tulsi gabbard this is going to be the night where you have to bring your a game and start swinging daniel real quick.

I still remember the day when Kamala Harris looked down on Tulsi Gabbard from her 10-point lead and said, I only talk to people at my level.  Now Tulsi Gabbard is ranked higher than Kamala Harris.  So with that being said, I'm excited as hell to see it.  I'll speak for myself.  Tulsi Gabbard's the strongest fighter in the race.  She has the strongest backbone, and she has a real ability to go against people and really take them down very quickly, very succinctly.  In a way that I don't think I've seen in debates.  I mean, how many times has Tulsi talked to someone and then their polls dropped by half?  Many times.  So we have in the first debate, what was it, Tim Ryan? ",

And finally, you know, and there's going to be an exclusive video later on in Hard Lens Media where she even challenged the people on The View.  Because let's face it, look at day one when Representative Tulsi Gabbard entered into the race.  she constantly was called a russian asset an assad apologist or they were saying that she was jill stein 2.0. well in an earlier live stream that i covered um the dnc chair even confirmed that no she is not running as a third party candidate.  she's not going anywhere.  she's all into this race.  she's not even going to run for her election.  so what does that tell for re-election in congress?  so what does that tell me?  and what should i tell all of you?  that she's all in this race from the beginning all the way to the end.  and Let's just be real.  She has carved a name for herself in American politics that people who are independents, Republicans, Democrats are going to have to take notice of.  And she has remained strong and vigilant ever since then.  So I am glad that she has qualified for the fifth Democratic debate stage.  And I am glad that we are going to hear her voice.  I think it's something that all Americans need to hear.  But again, she is going to have to be aggressive and take command of the stage and not let the moderators or anyone else censor her.  This will be her night, and if she cannot pull it off, you know, hey, we're going to have to call it out.  Yeah, well, when those mics go down, there's not much choice, dude. ",
