So there is no really true way to prove, other than by hitting me, obviously, that I am right here, if it is only us two talking.

            "text": "OK, so here's my problem with that particular argument.  The answer is that in 99.8%, 99.9% of cases, you absolutely can gender somebody based on looking at them.  Like really, if you're going to use intersex people as an example of not being able to do that, this does not obviate the biological duality of sex upon which all progeneration is based for all of human history and for all mammalian species.  So intersex people do not invalidate the concept of sex as a generality.  Intersex people are people who have a biological anomaly And by the way, in most cases of intersex, those people still manifest as either a male or a female.  So the idea that intersex exists does not invalidate the idea that there is a male and that there is a female, or that in nearly all cases, I can tell the difference between a male and a female.  Again, I'm not saying, by the way, that if you can show me your chromosomal charts that you are actually not a male when I say that you are a male, that I should stick with that biological objective standard.  correct enunciation of an objective standard.  So the objective standard, here's the deal.  For all of human history, there was an objective standard between male and female.  It was, for nearly all of human history, out of partial ignorance and partially because this is usually true, it was out of simply looking at people's genitals and assessing them based on their outward appearance, which is still true for nearly all human beings on planet Earth at all times.  What was that? ",

            "text": "Well, I mean, you can based on primary sex characteristics if you can see their genitals.  Doctors do this literally at birth all the time.  But your point is correct.  If somebody was male dressed as a female and I misgendered them and then they said, oh, look, I'm male, zip, then I would say, correct.  Then, correct, I would say... For all of human history, you were male.  Now the standard is chromosomal.  It's the SRNY gene and all of this.  There is some objective standard, in other words, by which we can determine sex.  The problem I have with the transgender argument is that people are arguing that there is no objective standard, that no objective standard exists by which I can determine sex.  And in fact, sex is completely subjective.  I can determine my own gender based on no biology, and in fact, in abeyance of biology.  I can have every single biological characteristic of a male, and if I say I am female, then I am female.  This is anti-scientific nonsense.  Yes, Caitlyn Jenner had every biological characteristic of a male.  There is no evidence whatsoever that Caitlyn Jenner was a female, because Caitlyn Jenner was an Olympic athlete as a male.  with all of the chromosomes and all of the junk and all of it.  That is it.  That is a biological male.  And then we are supposed to believe that Caitlyn Jenner is female.  Listen, I'm happy to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn because people can legally change their name.  If I were out to dinner with Caitlyn Jenner, I wouldn't go out of my way to say Caitlyn Jenner is a he because why would I want to have a bad dinner with somebody?  But if I'm speaking in public with folks and I'm talking about the presence of sex, there is not a biologist worth their salt on planet Earth who would say that sex does not exist.  So if sex exists, then what are the characteristics of sex?  And the problem with biological anti-realism or scientific anti-realism, as you're suggesting, is that there is no actual standard of sex, that it's completely malleable.  It's OK.

Because if we are talking about certain characteristics to which we attribute to masculine or feminine, if you want to say that there's a genetic male with feminine characteristics, we're fine.  That's a male with feminine characteristics.  Fine.  That's fine.  I mean, okay, so you're a man with feminine characteristics.  That's cool.  Who cares?  Okay, but that doesn't make you a woman.  In other words, what we are now doing is we're playing a semantic game where we say a male with feminine characteristics is a woman.  That's nonsense.  Or a woman with male characteristics, masculine characteristics, is a man.  That's nonsense too.  And by the way, it actually ends up misgendering a lot of people who are just butch women or effeminate men.  Yeah, I agree.  So in other words, by trying to separate out gender and sex completely, and then by using terms like male and female or woman and man that are innately connected to sex, what you are doing is deliberately, not you, what people are doing is deliberately confusing the issue such that you get idiocies like Ilhan Omar writing to the power lifting association of the USA saying that a transgender woman who is a biological male should be able to compete against biological women because it is a myth that men can pick up heavier objects than women.  That is not a myth.  That's called science.  Thank you. ",
