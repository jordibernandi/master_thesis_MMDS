            "text": "Let's recall Churchill, who first hated the Soviet Union, then called Stalin a great revolutionary when it was necessary to fight Nazism.  And after the Americans received nuclear weapons, he called for immediate, in fact, destruction of the Soviet Union.  But as soon as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons, Churchill became the initiator of the co-existence of two systems.  And not because, I think, he was not such a proponent, but he came from reality.  He came from reality.  He was a smart man.  We must just keep in mind, understand in what world we live in, what threats and dangers await us.  If we do not keep this fire snake under control, if we let it out of the bottle, God forbid, it can lead to a global catastrophe.  Everything will end in the first year.  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there will be no instruments that limit the arms race at all.  This means that each of us will have nuclear weapons hanging over our heads all the time.  All the time. ",

And this global catastrophe that he talks about could lead to nuclear catastrophe.  In fact, Putin goes on a little further in the meeting to state that he doesn't plan on re-signing the treaties, nor does President Trump, if other countries don't get involved.  Take a listen. ",

            "text": "My last conversation with President Trump I must say that he still has a certain optimism, because Donald told me that he is also concerned about this.  He understands what expenses the United States and all the other countries of the world have to spend on arms.  This money could have been spent on other purposes, but I completely agree with him.  When the Secretary of State came to us, we met with him in Sochi, he said the same thing.  But if they think so, then it is necessary to take some practical steps towards joint work.  I personally believe that all nuclear countries should be involved. ",

            "text": "All of them.  In other words, if other nuclear power countries are not taking part in any quote unquote disarmament treaty, then what is the point of the US and Russia doing it?  Well, good question.  The truth is the nuclear war threat is real and it impacts countries all across the globe.  And if one ever were to get released, we're talking hundreds of thousands to even millions of deaths as a result of nuclear war.  That said, this isn't the only time that Putin has issued such a warning about a coming global catastrophe.  Back in December of 2018, he issued a similar warning.  Take a look at this article on mirror.co.uk published December 2018.  Vladimir Putin reveals nuclear war fears and warns of global catastrophe.  USAnews.com, Putin issues ominous warning on rising nuclear war threat.  Obviously, Putin has been attempting to send a message since December 2018, and that message, a global catastrophe is coming, and it could lead to nuclear catastrophe.  Now, that's not the only warning he sent recently.  According to a recent article that you're about to see, he's also warning that tensions with the United States are worsening.  Take a look at this article on Reuters.com published June 12th.  Putin says U.S.-Russia relationships are getting worse and worse.  The article goes on to state, they, our relations, are going downhill.  They are getting worse and worse, Putin told MIR TV channel, according to a Kremlin transcript.  The current administration has approved, in my opinion, several dozen decisions on sanctions against Russia in recent years.  The Russian leader contrasted Moscow's troubled relationships with Washington with what he described as its blossoming ties with China, a deepening strategic friendship that has alarmed the U.S.  policymakers.  On the brink of global catastrophe, why are tensions with Russia and the United States rising?  Well, the answer is obvious, because the Democratic Party has been pushing the Russia hoax narrative against the president of the United States of America, forcing tensions between Russia and the U.S.  to embolden, and even forcing more sanctions there on Russia as a result of the Democratic Party and their fake narratives.  You see, Russia is a nuclear power, and I believe we need to play our cards safe.  But obviously, that is not the main line by the Democratic Party.
