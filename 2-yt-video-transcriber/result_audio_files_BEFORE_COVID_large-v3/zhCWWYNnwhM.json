            "text": "What's up, everybody?  It's your girl.  back for another video.  So, y'all, in this video, I'm going to be commenting on a story that blew up on Twitter yesterday regarding the couple from Texas that posted their gender reveal on Twitter.  It offended so many liberals.  It went viral almost instantly.  As of yesterday when it was posted, it was at 10 million views.  Today, it's probably much higher.  It made it to Fox News.  I saw all kinds of different media outlets that did a story about it.  But it sparked outrage, and it's because two reasons.  One reason is because part of the gender reveal was the father feeding a hippopotamus at the zoo, which they worked out with the zoo ahead of time.  The zoo was part of it.  He fed a hippopotamus a watermelon filled with blue jello indicating they're having a baby boy.  they filmed it they posted it on twitter and as the hippo is eating and the blue jello comes out the father hugs his wife and he says thank god that you know they're having a boy.  he was excited jokingly said oh thank god.  and it's because if you read the whole story they had been struggling for a long time after having their daughters have a little boy and they always wanted to have a little boy too.  nothing wrong with that and they're being attacked and there's outrage all over the internet behind it.  so I just want to comment on the story.  I am currently pregnant myself.  we are expecting our third baby getting close to the end of the pregnancy.  it's the 10 week countdown and we found out we're having a little girl a few weeks ago.  we already have a little girl and a little boy.  It really wouldn't have mattered to me this time because we have one of each.  And after having a miscarriage before this baby, you know, we just wanted a healthy baby, a healthy sibling, you know, for our children.  And, you know, a third baby to complete our little family.  So, yeah.  But let me just say this before I, you know, get into my opinion about it.  We are living in a time where you know, created by these Democrats, created by these progressive liberals.  We're living in a time where you have to watch everything you say.  Everything is offensive.  Everything is racist.  Everything is sexist.  There's so much division going on.  People can be a victim for whatever reason they want.  People can get famous and get media attention for victimizing itself for any reason, you know, and You know, you've got to walk on eggshells.  You've got to be careful with what you say to people.  Your jokes or anything you've said in the past that somebody has on tape or can make up about you will have repercussions.  You could lose your job.  You can get banned from all the liberal platforms because they own them all.  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.  You know, you just, we're living in this time where everybody's got to be careful and you got to watch what you say and everybody's a big motherfucking crybaby.  You know, and I just, I just wish we could go back to when I was growing up in the 90s.  Everything was just so different.  I know the government was still corrupt as shit, but people were different.  um people cared about each other and that it's just so bad now and it's just really depressing when you think of it.  and this is the world these liberals have created.  and it's only getting worse.  i do not get on twitter.  you know it's bad enough.  i'm still on youtube.  you know i was on youtube watching videos when it first came out and youtube used to be the bomb.  now they're making its way.  you know if you say the wrong things they'll delete your channel demonetize you they'll shadow ban you.  that's what they've done to my channel.  It won't allow your channel to grow.  It won't allow new people to see your channel.  But Twitter, they would have kicked me off of Twitter.  Because if you disagree with a liberal on there, they kick you off.  They ban you.  And I also don't want to be in a place where there's too many liberals at once.  Twitter is a place where... They fester.  They colonize.  It's like going into the sewer and seeing a bunch of roaches and rats colonizing together.  I don't want to see that many of them at once.  Bad enough when you just see one.  I don't want to see millions of them.  But I read about the story on Fox, and I read some of the comments that they posted from Twitter.  I mean, just endless comments calling the father a sexist.  a bigot a nazi a racist.  it's toxic masculinity that he was excited he was having a son.  um constant attacks that oh what's wrong with having a girl?  girls are better and how dare they hurt an animal?  they exposed an innocent hippo to blue dye from the jello.  tons of comments about animal abuse.  let me tell y'all something.  in america we feed our children jello.  You know, they give jello to our kids at school.  They give jello to sick people in the hospital.  It's advertised and marketed to children on television.  The government says it's safe for us to eat it.  Why is it so bad to give a hippo a little bit of blue jello inside of a watermelon?  You know, what did that do to the hippo?  The hippo is a mammal just like us.  So if it did something bad to the hippo, then that's doing something bad to us and our children shouldn't be eating it.  You know, but liberals don't care about children.  They were posting memes of people feeding children to wild animals and hippos and talking about how much they hate male babies and white babies.  and oh God, y'all, these liberals are sick, sick, sick.  This is the thing.  There is nothing wrong with a father being excited that he's having a son.  In fact, that indicates healthy male behavior.  You know, men were biologically made to be sexually attracted to women to reproduce to continue the species and you know to spread their seeds and make their copies of themselves and to spread their DNA their genetics.  and there's nothing wrong with the father being excited and wanting a son.  a son passes on his family's name.  you know.  there's nothing wrong with that.  that doesn't mean he hates his daughters.  that doesn't mean he Doesn't care about his daughters.  You know, it just means he just really wants a son.  There's nothing wrong with that.  When I had our first child, I'm not going to lie.  I wanted a son.  I always wanted to be a mom to a bunch of little boys because I was a tomboy growing up.  I played sports.  I like to hunt.  I like to fish.  I still like to do the things.  Yes, I do love my makeup and hair products and my fingernail polish.  but I'm a tomboy at heart and I always thought I was going to have a bunch of little sons to take, you know, to play football with and sports and fish.  When I found out I was having a daughter at the gender ultrasound, I remember crying about it.  I was very upset because I remember what a hard time my mom had with us girls with the talking back and the fighting and oh God, I was just like, I don't want to deal with that.  But when I had her, You know, I was just so in love and protective over her.  It just didn't matter, you know, once you have the baby.  But there's nothing wrong with the initial wanting, you know, a little boy or a little girl.  There's nothing wrong with that.  In fact, I see more women upset that they're having a little boy than a little girl.  In fact, I've never seen a woman saying she's upset that she's having a girl.  But I see tons of women saying they're upset that they're having a little boy.  I'm on a... Fertility app called glow.  I joined the app after I had that miscarriage in December 2017 Just for support they.  it's an app for women that have had miscarriages or trouble conceiving or staying pregnant and there's millions of women on there having miscarriages and struggling to have children.  and And I've seen post after post of women upset that they found out on an ultrasound that they're having a little boy, that they don't love the little boy, they don't feel connected to the, they don't want the little boy.  I mean, it just goes on and on.  And to me, those kind of comments are offensive.  But just to say you wanted a little boy, I mean, you wanted a little girl, there's nothing wrong with that.  But to sit there and say you don't feel a connection, you hate your baby, you wish it would die, you want an abortion because it's a little boy, You know, there's something wrong with that.  You know, once a woman has a baby, she's going to bond with that baby either way if she's somewhat normal.  But we know liberals are not normal.  You know, and liberals really at heart hate children.  You know, that's why they're, you know, they push for abortion and the killing of innocent babies.  But... Anyway, it is not toxic masculinity for a father to be excited that he's having a son, a son to pass on his family name, a son to teach, you know, all the things his father taught him.  Nothing wrong with that whatsoever.  That just indicates he's a healthy, heterosexual male, just the way he was created to be.  But again, liberals think that The way we were created naturally, everything biologically natural about us is wrong and offensive.  So, but that's my opinion about it.  What do you all think?  Do you think it's toxic for a father to be excited that he's having a son?  You know, what are your thoughts on that?  And I'll see y'all back on my next video.  Bye. ",
