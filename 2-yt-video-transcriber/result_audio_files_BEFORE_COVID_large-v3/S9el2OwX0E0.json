            "text": "Bad news for Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other Democrats after an email backfired.  that was sent by the Florida Congresswoman's office to her own constituents, which shows less Democrats supporting the impeachment against President Trump.  This comes as House Democrats did approve two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump today.  Looks like this could actually be bad news for the next election for Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other Democrats.  Also happening today is a federal court-ordered hearing against one of Debbie Wasserman Schultz's former IT aides, Imran Awan.  This is an ongoing case.  Judicial Watch is pursuing the release of important documents in this Awan Brothers Democrat IT Pakistan scandal.  That hearing is happening today, expecting more updates soon.  Wasserman Schultz, at the same time, has been making more comments on the so-called impeachment inquiry.  A few days ago, before this poll backfired on the Florida congresswoman, She was going to media outlets saying that President Trump would be cowering in a corner due to his guilt.  That's what Florida Congresswoman, Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz had to say on CNN.  Then just a few days later, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was embarrassed by the results of her own poll, which shows that the public is not supporting the impeachment against President Trump.  This was sent to her own constituents, which would be Democrats or mostly Democrats.  So Debbie Wasserman Schultz emailed this survey from her legislative office, asking her constituents to share their thoughts in the poll.  Wasserman Schultz states, quote, recent allegations against the president say that he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son.  I believe such actions undermine our national security and should alarm every American.  I fully support Congress moving forward with drafting articles of impeachment.  No individual stands above the law, even the president.  Again, Debbie Wasserman Schultz probably not very happy with the results of her big push for impeachment.  This email sent to her own Democrat following shows that 46% who took the poll did not support the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.  54% did, but this is her own Democrat.  following that she's polling against.  This article is assuming that the majority of those listed in Wasserman Schultz's email database are Democrats that took the very unscientific survey, but this does look like some pretty terrible results for Wasserman Schultz.  Also looks like Wasserman Schultz does not want to comment on the poll after these results didn't turn out the way that she wanted them to.  They reached out to Wasserman Schultz's office for clarification on whether all those emailed were predominantly Democrats, but Wasserman Schultz did not reply.  Now, again, to go back to this other news related to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, this hearing taking place today, we should soon have more updates.  Federal court hearing on the Awan brothers who worked for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  congressional democrat it scandal have covered it on this channel.  there's a lot going on in this case.  former democrat it staffer imran awan allegedly leaked secret data from house offices to a secret server and dropbox.com.  there is a ton of more evidence on other schemes as well.  One of the many big questions about this case is exactly why Debbie Wasserman Schultz continued to keep Imran Awan on her staff and pay him up until he was arrested in July 2017, yet Wasserman Schultz was still paying Awan after he had been banned from using the house computers and couldn't even effectively do his job.  Judicial Watch dropped this press release that announced this federal court-ordered hearing for Friday, December 13, 2019, today on the congressional Democrat IT information technology scandal involving the Awan brothers.  The hearing was ordered in accordance with a November 2018 Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, which was filed after the FBI failed to respond adequately to two separate FOIA requests.  Judicial Watch's first request that was filed on May 26th, 2017, sought all records related to any investigations or preliminary investigations involving former congressional IT support staffers Abid Awan, Imran Awan, Jamal Awan, and Hina Aralvi as part of this request.  Searches should, of records... should include, but not be limited to, the FBI automated indices, its older manual indices, and its electronic surveillance data management system, as well as cross-referenced files.  Also, all records of communication sent to or from FBI employees, officials, or contractors involving the subjects in bullet item 1.  The timeframe for those requested records is May 2015 to the present.  Judicial Watch's second request, submitted July 3rd, 2018, sought all records related to any investigations or preliminary investigations involving former congressional IT support staffers, Abid Awan, Imran Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Ar-Alvi, and Rao Abbas.  As part of this request, searches of records should include, but not be limited to, the FBI automated indices, its older manual indices, and its electronic surveillance data management system, as well as cross-referenced files.  They also requested all records of communications, including but not limited to emails, whether on .gov or non .gov email accounts, text messages, instant chats, or messages on the link system sent to or from FBI employees, officials, or contractors involving the Awan brothers, Ms.  Alvey, and Mr.  Abbas.  Records of communications searched should include but not be limited to those between the FBI officials, employees, and contractors and officials with the Capitol Police, the Office of the Inspector General of the House, and the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer of the House.  More recently, in August of 2019, the DOJ told the court that it would begin producing records by November 5th, 2019.  After producing no records on November 13th, 2019, the agency told Judicial Watch that it was having technical difficulties, and in a recent email, claimed that difficulties with the production remain.  In a joint status report filed on December 5th, 2019, Judicial Watch reported to the court that the DOJ claimed in a phone call that it was now unable to produce any records to either of the FOIA requests, quote, because the agency was waiting for some unspecified action by the judge.  in some other matter so as to avoid having to produce records in this case.  In that same report, the DOJ told the court that the judge is, quote, presiding over a related sealed criminal matter that prohibits the government from releasing the requested FOIA information.  Again, Judicial Watch reminds us how Imran Awan and his family were banned from the House computer network in February of 2017 after the House's top law enforcement officer wrote that Imran is an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems.  and that a server containing evidence had gone missing.  The inspector general said server logs showed unauthorized access and procurement records were falsified.  Imran Awan was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Florida Democrat's top information technology aide.  Most lawmakers fired Awan in February after he was banned from using the House computer network.  when they knew this investigation was happening, but for some reason, Wasserman Schultz kept him on until he was arrested in July 2017, trying to board a flight for Pakistan.  In July of 2018, Imran Awan was given a plea deal and pled guilty to federal bank fraud, but prosecutors found no evidence that Awan violated federal law with respect to the house computer systems, There's a lot of controversy over this.  At the time, people thought that the court was soft-pedaling these charges against Awan.  This is one of the reasons that Judicial Watch is continuing to pursue these records.  Press release concludes, noting that the Awan brothers reportedly were not given background checks before being given access to highly sensitive government information, and no explanations have been given as to why.  Additionally, If they would have run this background check, it would have found out not only multiple criminal convictions, but a $1 million bankruptcy, a dozen lawsuits.  It would have found a whole host of major red flags, and the Democrats did not do any of those checks.  The Juan Brothers IT scandal implicates national security and involves a cover-up by House Democrat leadership.  And now the Deep State DOJ.  Please leave a comment and tell me what you think about any of this.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz not getting the results that she wanted with this impeachment survey that she sent to her own followers.  Also, the Awan Brothers hearing that is taking place in court today should have more updates on that soon.  This also ties back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
