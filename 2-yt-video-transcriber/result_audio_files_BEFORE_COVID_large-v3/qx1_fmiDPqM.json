He will most likely call for backup.  He's just that way.  Running a tag.  Will most likely definitely give him a ticket.  Once again, he's that way.  Starting to get hot out here, guys.  See if I can find some shade.  Got him a little PT Cruiser there.  He's at the shabby shack.  Used to be a little nice little used furniture store there that they went out of business.  Guy does it all.  He was just over at the burglary scene, I believe.  And now he's collecting revenue. ",
