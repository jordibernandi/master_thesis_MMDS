At the end of his life, not only did Dr.  King get murdered in Memphis, where he was not on a quote-unquote civil rights effort, he was standing with some of the most exploited black workers in America.  Absolutely.  And he said, I'm going to go down there and help you form a union and get decent wages and decent working conditions.  That's where he was murdered.  And at that same time, what he was also doing, he was trying to put together a poor people's campaign.  Absolutely.  Bringing together blacks and poor whites and Native Americans and Latinos to say, you know what?  We have got to march on Washington.  We have to encamp ourselves in Washington.  We have to demand a fundamental change in national priorities.  Instead of continuing spending billions of dollars on a war in Vietnam there, we got to invest in housing, in health care, in the needs of poor people and working people.  What a profound, think about it for a second, what a profound and revolutionary concept that was.  I concur.  And that is the moment that he was killed.  And in a sense, that is what we are trying to do today.  This is the richest country in the history of the world.  OK.  And we forget about that.  If we're a poor country, you and I have a certain type of discussion.  We are the richest country in the history of the world.

So then we can ask the question, how does that happen in Canada?  They pay 10% for insulin than we pay in the United States.  That's one issue.  Here's the other issue.  Of that 7.5 million Americans who are using insulin, it turns out, this is unbelievable, one-quarter of those people are rationing their insulin.  You got that?  Yeah, that's right.  Rationing their insulin.  On this trip, and I'll never forget this as long as I live, young guy and his mother, I don't know, mid-20s.  Guy was a former football player, okay?  Good guy.  He lied to his parents when he was in college in telling them that he had enough insulin because he didn't want to put more financial pressure on them, okay?  He became sick.  When you don't take your insulin, you become sick.  And obviously, if you continue doing that, you die.  One quarter of the American people are rationing their insulin.  Last year, Mike, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit.  So the issue that we throw out there, the policy issue is, is the function of health care to provide quality care to all, or is it to make huge profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies?
