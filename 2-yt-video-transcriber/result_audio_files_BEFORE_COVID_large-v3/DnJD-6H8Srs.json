And hold me over for videotaping his crimes.  All right.  All right, all right.  Poor little butthurt baby.  That's hilarious.  So we'll see what Mr.  Butthurt wants to do.  So again, giving them your registration, insurance, and driver's license, which is all just policy, really doesn't allow us to stand up for our rights.  Not that I have anything wrong with my insurance, my registration, and my driver's license.  They're all fine and up-to-date and paid for.  But, you know, I shouldn't have to be forced to give information that could incriminate me.  And we have every right to not self-incriminate ourselves.  But yet, this illegal corporation called USA  Inc.,  all in capital letters, has enacted policies to trump over our God-given rights, which in itself is treasonous in hearsay.  So you wonder why I'm out here fighting for our rights, where everybody else submits to nonsense or just gives in.  So looks like I'll be going to court again to fight a trunk at that point, catching him, I'm going to say one, no turn signal, following too close, tailgating, speeding, swerving, driving recklessly.  No seatbelt and talking on the phone.  There's a lot of violations there.  So I caught him doing all that.  And that's when he decided to pull me over for catching him.  Come on, come on, come on.
