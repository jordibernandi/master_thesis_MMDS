            "text": "Imagine a group of people who work to destroy Italy, because they claim Italy's origins are illegitimate.  Imagine further that these people maintain that of all the countries in the world, only Italy doesn't deserve to exist.  And then imagine that these people vigorously deny that they are anti-Italian.  Would you believe them?  Now substitute Israel for Italy, and you'll understand the dishonesty and absurdity of the argument that one could be anti-Zionist, that is, against the existence of a Jewish state, but not anti-Semitic.  But that is precisely what anti-Zionists say.  They argue that Israel's existence is illegitimate.  They don't believe this of any other country in the world, no matter how bloody its origins.  And then they get offended when they're accused of being anti-Semitic.  How can they make this argument?  First, they change the topic.  They say it's unfair to charge those who merely criticize Israel with being anti-Semitic, But criticism of Israel is fine.  Denying Israel's right to exist isn't.  Anti-Zionism isn't criticism of Israel.  Anti-Zionism is opposition to Israel's existence.  Zionism is the name of the movement that advocates for the return of Jews to their historic homeland.  Over the past 3,000 years, there were only two independent states located in what is called Israel.  Both were Jewish states, and invaders destroyed both.  No Arab or Muslim or any other country ever existed in that land, which was only named Palestine by the Romans to remove all memory of the Jewish state they destroyed in the year 70.  Second, anti-Zionists claim they can't be anti-Jewish because Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism.  That's equally false.  It is the same as saying Italy has nothing to do with being Italian.  Judaism has always, always consisted of three components\u2014God, Torah, and Israel. ",
