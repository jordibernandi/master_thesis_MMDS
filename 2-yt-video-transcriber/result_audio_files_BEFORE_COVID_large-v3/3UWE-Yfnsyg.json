            "text": "This is Dabu7.  I want to bring to your attention here a document and some things that have just went into motion per October 3rd where the military apparently has signed off on what they're calling manpower guidance and activation and deactivation of reserve component Marines or RC Marines ordered to active duty ISO defense support of civil authorities.  Now, to break that down to you, this is basically saying that these guys are going to be moved to active duty here on American soil to protect civil authorities.  Something huge is brewing.  There's no other way around it.  They are basically saying from this point forward, this is authorized.  They also go on to state, which is pretty crazy.  They say that all of this can happen very quickly and it will come with little warning.  They say that requests for federal assistance will come with little warning.  As required, the Marine Corps must rapidly mobilize RC units and personnel, IAW, in this order to respond to threats in the homeland.  This is nothing to do with overseas.  Every bit of the writing says point blank.  It has to do with homeland right here.  People have tried to scoff at things in the past, like Jade Helm or other big military things that have went down, but this is not one to overlook.  They are putting it right there, front and center, making the statement and This means that they are anticipating nothing short of a civil war, an asteroid impact, an earthquake, tsunami, eruption from a volcano, some kind of major disaster is going to end up hitting that they see coming in the often.  I lived through that fateful September of 2001.  I don't forget.  I sat here on this platform for years trying to tell people to get it together before the next one goes down.  I hope you have a plan, folks.  I'll leave links below.  A lot more interesting talk in here.  Where they start to say that global sourcing request cannot be considered by DCMRA due to rapid deployment required to prevent the loss of life and non-applicability of dwell.  Dwell time is the amount that a person gets to go home to friends and family to get a break from war zones.  They're basically saying loss of life and non-applicability of dwell.  Like they're not going to get it?  Very interesting piece that was just put out here through the DOD and effectively, it's the Navy making the call on this one for the Marines in the Navy units.  You can see right here, it says that this is a memo established from the Department of Navy Policy.  So, Couldn't leave a link.  You can read into this more.  This is from Marines.mil.  Follow me on Twitter for more, y'all.  It's been Dabu7.  Eyes open. ",
