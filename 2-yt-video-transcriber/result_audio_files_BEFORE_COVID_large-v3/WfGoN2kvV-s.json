            "text": "I'm 38 weeks and five days pregnant.  Let's see if I can schedule an abortion.  We are looking at what we call a labor and delivery process this time.  We would be going through two days of preparation of the body and we would induce labor.  So you would be going through active labor and delivery, but it would be in the stillborn.  We're probably looking at a seven.  Recently, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act, the controversial abortion law that makes it so that women can have abortions up until the minute they give birth.  This new law opens up loopholes so that women and abortionists can exploit these loopholes, allowing for the infanticide or killing of unborn babies.  This abortion law allows for abortions under three conditions.  One, if it is performed earlier than 24 weeks of pregnancy.  Two, in the absence of fetal viability, which is vague and ambiguous.  Three, if necessary. ",
