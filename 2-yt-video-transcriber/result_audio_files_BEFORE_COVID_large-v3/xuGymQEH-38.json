            "text": "Hey, it's Tyesha with two great holsters from one great company.  This is the Tactica Defense Fashion and I will be reviewing their concealment leggings and their in the waistband holster made specifically for women.  This is their in the waistband holster made specifically for women.  Yes, it contours to our bodies and our unique shape.  This product is listed on their website at TacticaFashions.com and you also get free shipping.  Now first off, I absolutely love the Kydex holster top.  It's molded to your particular firearm so make sure that you specify that when ordering.  This also includes an Allen wrench so that you can adjust the tension on your holster and it holds very smoothly.  It will not fall out no matter what.  I really love how you can adjust this.  And it's going to take a little bit of breaking in for me to get it where I want it.  Now what I do is just put on a pair of pants with belt loops and secure this in the waistband holster wherever I want to carry it.  It can be at a 430 position on the side on my hip just like this or carry it like a pancake holster in the back.  The choice is yours.  It's so adjustable and it's so comfortable.  This is where I wanted to carry this holster.  And this here is an empty weapon.  I'm going to show you that.  it is clear.  Please obey the Carter safety rules when dealing with firearms.  And I'm going to just show you how this sits because I'm going to put on a jacket and show you some dry fire.  This is a Glock 27 with the 22 magazines and the X group.  Check out my video on that.  Now I'm going to show you some dry fire with this holster.  and like i said it comes out perfectly fine.  i'm able to get on target return to the holster and this is normally where i would carry my duty weapon on my hips.  so this kind of like like muscle memory for me.  so it's not like learning a completely different holster.  I must say with just these few rounds of dry fire, this may be my most favorite holster in my collection.  Yes, don't judge me, but I've been looking for a Kydex holster, but something that's in the waistband.  And yes, this has just checked off every requirement I had as far as in the waistband holster.  Now, one thing that I really like about this holster I'm going to show you is that it can be completely concealable when I'm wearing, let's say, an overcoat or a jacket.  It does not bulge out.  And that's one thing that I was trying to get away from when wearing holsters that are made for men because they're not contoured or does not, you know, adjust to our unique shape.  Tactica Defense Fashionwear, it caters to if you work in an office or if you're a stay-at-home mom or if you're busy on the go.  They want you to have so many options to carry concealed and be safe.  It is amazing.  I highly recommend you go to TacticaFashion.com and check out their amazing line of jackets, sweaters, holsters, other types of pants, and definitely, definitely check out the many ways that you could be fashionable and also carry concealed.  Now I'm going to show you their concealed leggings.  These can also be called yoga pants.  But I like this because the holster is actually made into the waistband of these leggings.  And you actually have two holsters or you can use the other one to store like a cell phone or some kind of like money clip.  Just anything you can put in that other pocket.  I wouldn't necessarily go out with two guns, you know.  But it just shows you the versatility.  Now I have my Ruger LCP380 in the small of my back or where I would normally carry a small in the back holster.  And up front that is my Smith & Wesson 38 Special Hammerless Revolver.  And just to show you the versatility that you can wear these leggings and the different types of firearms that you can conceal in these pants.  Now I did order a size small.  Normally in yoga pants I wear a medium size.  However, I don't know why I got a small, but I must say it actually worked because it kept the firearm snug to my body.  I know I showed you that video earlier on my channel.  I'll link it here where I ordered a medium carry concealed shirt, and even though it was medium, it was a little bit baggy on me.  One great thing about Tactica Fashions is that they give you a 10-day test run with whatever you order.  If you're not pleased within 10 days, return it for a full refund.  I have absolutely zero complaints, zero negative reviews about these two products that I tested from Tactica Defense Fashion.
