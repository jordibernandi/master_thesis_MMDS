            "text": "Overthinking, overthinking, how to control obsessive spiraling thoughts.  I hate that when you're getting a sort of an endless helix of thinking.  It messes you up, doesn't it?  I do it generally when I'm worrying about things.  I'm always sending someone a message, they don't respond to it.  Oh no, that message has not responded to it.  Shit, what did I say?  One of the times I most vividly noticed it was once when I took LSD as a teenager and I noticed I went into a circuit of terrifying negative thoughts and it was really, I suppose the only thing that was good about it is part of my mind was watching it happening, not from a sufficient enough distance to feel safe from it.  I still felt really trapped in negative thought and often I do.  Now what the greats will tell you is i'm talking about muji most likely sad guru all these sort of enlightened masters that are marching down that path on invisible little tutsis made out of pure consciousness.  they'd say the awareness is everything.  who is aware of these thoughts?  when you're thinking oh god oh no i shouldn't have said that.  oh god i bet i'll lose this or i bet i won't get that.  it means we have.  what Mooji would say is we've combined with the thoughts we've combined we've become wedded and embedded to the thoughts when the thoughts are something that we must observe these days several times a day.  let's say there was a moment where I was going in the jiu-jitsu class and had to walk along this uh little external corridor thing.  I'm in Los Angeles like sort of part of a sort of a landing an external landing And the journey between the toilet and the jiu-jitsu class, I was sort of regarding it as dead time, just like, well, this is meaningless, I'm not doing anything now.  And I was just in a sort of a solipsistic amble through sort of meaningless conscious activity, thinking, dredging about in there.  And I thought, stop, look around.  And I looked and I could see the hills.  the green and beautiful hills in the distance and I could feel the warmth in the air on my face.  Eckhart Tolle would say use your senses to re-engage you with the moment.  feel the feeling of your hand.  even now my hand isn't touching anything.  I can feel the sensation that I have a hand.  the hand is aware.  that is a type of awareness that is not thinking.  if you find yourself thinking all of the time One of the things that you all try is meditation, but then you all say, meditation?  I try that meditation.  I just sit there thinking.  Meditation seems like this at first.  You sit down, you try to, you close your eyes.  Oh, I'm just thinking.  I'm just basically just thinking stuff.  I'm just thinking, how is this even meditation?  They say, don't resist the thoughts.  Don't have an attitude towards the thoughts.  allow the thoughts to come and go.  people often use the metaphor of the flow of ocean waves or a shoreline the thoughts come the thoughts recede.  however started to through meditation you start to develop a stronger connection with the witness consciousness the awareness.  so When I am doing something like worrying or I'm afraid, I have a sort of a stronger connection.  I suppose it's like, I don't know, we've got a weaker hand, isn't it?  Unless you're ambidextrous.  If I use the left hand all the time, I've got capacity that I can hold things with the left more.  I don't always have to just habitually grip the right.  And my bias towards the right will have a muscular component.  It will have a neurological component.  There'll be neurological pathways that I continually walked around.  So the right hand feels like a more, it feels like the dominant hand.  The constant ambling thinking mind feels like a dominant pattern.  But if you learn to witness it more and more, that pattern, whilst it's not immediately going to disappear, its dominance starts to be subsumed.  Its dominance starts to seed.  I feel like they're right, these great masters.  Focus on your awareness.  Focus on your awareness.  Some people will tell you to get some CBT, like, you know, if you're constantly anxious.  Someone talked to me about it.  It was Blind Boy from Rubber Bandits.  He goes, what they teach with CBD, if you're anxious about going out, they'll go, what are you anxious about going out for?  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, am I going to get beat up, murdered?  Well, how often does that happen?  You know, they start to use rational tools to... unpick your neurotic, circumambulating mind, is that what I want to say?  Circambulating, I'm sure that's the right word.  Either way, you don't want to be constantly caught up in bloody limitless thoughts and the way out of it.  The way out of a tendency that you've mistaken for yourself and mistaken for your nature is to transcend your nature.  And the way you can do that is through meditation.  And the way you can do it in the moment is watching now.  Oh, I'm literally sitting and worrying.  Why am I worrying about it?  Let me just sit back.  Let me just sit back and observe.  Step outside thoughts.  Recognize that you're not your thoughts. ",
