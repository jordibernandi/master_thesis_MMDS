            "text": "Well, like a choice between Pepsi and Coke.  I mean, what kind of choice is that?  It's just window dressing.  I mean... You know, I think the situation in the States, from what I can tell to all of Europe, even under quite right-wing conservative governments in Europe, is that we have had for quite a long time big concessions to working class protests, to the Labour movement.  It's precisely because the powers that be are nervous.  and have been consistently nervous at least since the turn of the 20th century.  But what we have as a result is a kind of strange mixed hybrid.  It seems frighteningly kind of brutal, the situation in the States in comparison.  You know, again, going back to my own experience of healthcare in the States, I remember speaking to a nurse, black gentleman who, obviously from a southern working class background, you know, God knows how much hardship and probably racism the gentleman experienced, lovely chap, talked to him about our healthcare service and how it was free, you know, and he was like, yeah, it'd be nice, but in America, it's not how we do it.  Like, you have to pay for everything.  We want to pay for everything.  Now, that's going to be a big kind of psychological hurdle for a lot of Americans to get their head around, I imagine.  But, you know, health care is seen as a human right in this country. ",

            "text": "And my last question, when you look at America, Bernie Sanders in particular is described as socialist, in some quarters a communist.  He's described as radical.  He's described as he will bankrupt America.  Obviously, you can't speak for all of Great Britain, but to you, Bernie Sanders is essentially just kind of trying to extend what Franklin Delano Roosevelt put.  Does he seem radical to you or does he seem kind of in step with a lot of the things you're talking about? ",

            "text": "He seems entirely in step with a lot of the things that we're talking about.  Jeremy Corbyn, let's be clear, seems quite radical in Britain at the moment because we've had ruthless neoliberalism since Thatcher, very close to the neoliberal governments in the States, of course.  But lots of his policies, lots of his manifesto in the current election is stuff that is actually already quite normal in other European governments that you wouldn't necessarily think of as kind of socialist.  I mean, don't forget there isn't any kind of really existing socialist states in Europe anymore anyway.  So this idea that he's some kind of mad communist, no, he absolutely doesn't look like that.  He does, however, in comparison to the rest of the mainstream American politicians, Hillary Clinton and Trump and so on, does seem refreshingly different.  I mean, one of the things that really struck me and I thought was really wonderful to see was that Bernie Sanders, I've seen him appear on picket lines with striking workers.  Now, from over here, from all of this far distance, I can't imagine ever seeing, remember rather, ever seeing an American politician of his standing do something as radical as that.  Now, maybe they have in the past, but they certainly haven't for a bit.  So I think he's very good news.  I think his campaign's been very positive and compassionate and exciting.  Something's got to give.  I think one last thing, if I can.  The reason why I think Hillary Clinton didn't do so well and why kind of centrist formulations, Ed Miliband's leadership in the British Labour Party here, isn't doing well is people have, for obvious reasons, had enough.  They want change.  They want an alternative. ",

And if we can't put arguments for a compassionate alternative, they'll go in the direction of a Trump-style alternative, which is ultra-right, fascistic-leaning.  Trump isn't a fascist.  Well, there are camps for some people.  Let's be clear, you know, he's still absolutely a frightening man.  And it's because people are tired.  We can't give them more of the same.  We have to give them some real radical alternatives.  And in the States, that looks like Bernie.  Over here, it looks like Jeremy.  And I think we've got a really good chance for both of our nations to improve working people's lives.  One would hope. ",
