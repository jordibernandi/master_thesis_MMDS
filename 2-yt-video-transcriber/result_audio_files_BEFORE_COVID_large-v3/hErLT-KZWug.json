When I first started on YouTube, you know, while dinosaurs still ruled the Earth, one thing that was very common were questions for Raytheus videos.  I miss those.  Of course, they weren't real questions.  The ones asking them, usually Christians, didn't really want to know anything.  They were gotcha questions, or what they thought were gotcha questions, designed as attempts to refute atheism, or at least to make it look ridiculous.  This guy isn't much different, and he even says that these are rhetorical questions designed to make us think, so he probably doesn't care what the answers are, but I'm gonna answer them anyway.  Like I said, I miss questions for atheist videos. ",

Answer, they're not actively making my life worse because of their beliefs.  I don't have to debunk their crapola because they're not shoving it down everybody else's throats.
