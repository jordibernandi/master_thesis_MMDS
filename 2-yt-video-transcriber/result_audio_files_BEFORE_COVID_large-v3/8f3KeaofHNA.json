Peter Schweitzer naming the person working for the Ukrainian company Burisma, golfing with Vice President Biden and his son Hunter at the time, 2014.  Giuliani comes on later and says, guess what?  We're going to drop a lawsuit in Adam Schiff's lap.  Bill O'Reilly, can you break some news for us?  I mean, you're going to go work for Media Matters or something?  What?

The president of the United States believes those three individuals acted unethically, perhaps illegally, in an attempt to derail his campaign and his presidency after electing.

In discovery, he can ask a lot of embarrassing questions.  And that's really the goal of the lawsuit is to compile information about how corrupt Adam Schiff allegedly is.
