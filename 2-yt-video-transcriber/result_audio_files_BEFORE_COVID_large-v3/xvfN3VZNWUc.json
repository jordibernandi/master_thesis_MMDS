This man is allowed to live in her home, drive her car, pick her up, live off of her.  Losers that she chose.  Now, this guy, You're going to also hear that she's going to be complaining about him whooping the girl too hard.  She still stayed with him.  You're going to hear that he was giving this little girl baths and he wasn't supposed to.  She still stays with him.  Do you know when she finally decides to call him up and say I'm done?  When she called him with sending penis pictures to another man.  That's what she's finally done.  No, she wasn't worried about this.  Look at the pictures of this little girl.  Allegedly, from alleged fall, this little girl gets her skull cracked under their care, under the mother and the boyfriend.  But protective services allowed for this little girl to go back home to this situation.  They dropped the ball, no question.  Look at these pictures of this little girl.  Four years old.  Look how badly she looks beaten.  And she was allowed to go back to that situation.  That's the tragedy here.  I'm gonna bring you guys this so-called press conference.  Brother Quinell X out of Houston.  And it's making a mistake.  Drew Darion Vince is now locked up for the disappearance.  They've got more than enough evidence.  The blood inside the apartment that was found comes back to Malia.  They have the videotape surveillance of him buying bleach, bringing it back to the home.  They have him walking outside.  They have her right there coming back to the home.  Remember, he was claiming that three Mexicans he pulled over to check a tire.  When he had to go pick her up while she works and he at home with her daughter.  Horrible, horrible decision making.  I'm going to bring you guys to.  people are protesting now outside of her job.  And I'm going to bring you this.  She can't squeeze a tear out.  She's trying her hardest.  But she could have stopped this months ago.  How did the little girl's head get cracked?  How did you know this guy was whooping your little girl and you knew about it?  How did you know that this man was picking up your daughter instead of taking her to the daycare, taking her back home?  When did you decide?  enough was enough?  This is my life in the show. ",

In that video, it shows the stepdad after mother had left the city.  It shows the stepdad coming out or walking back into the apartment complex with a big bottle of Clorox that he had just bought.  And it shows him coming out with a bottle of Clorox, a big laundry bag, and a black garbage bag stuffed inside the laundry container that he was carrying out of the home.  It was strange when he told the mother he was cleaning the house with Clorox, for there was no reason for him to be cleaning the house with Clorox.  They already had a small thing of Clorox in the house.  He thought it was necessary to clean the house with Clorox.  We know for a fact that police did take forensic evidence out of the apartment that indicates a crime took place inside that apartment.  Do you know the nature of that evidence?  I know that they tested for blood samples.  human tissue samples.  We also have a container inside the apartment that they left where they were testing for blood and luminoleums.

I see several videos where he's too, you know, news articles where he's just too broke up to even And so much in the court system.  do you see that the courts still don't release the child to the father.  A lot of court cases, it's alleged abuse.  And, you know, they have to investigate so much until they drop the ball in so many cases.  I mean, you have so many.  You know, I'm not putting the blame all on protective services.  However, this little girl's head was cracked.  Look at those pictures.  How did they release that child back into this home where a boyfriend was allowed to have this little girl while a mother go to work?  And I talk about this constantly about decision making.  Choosing a man.  Once you have a child, you have to make better decisions in men, especially if he's going to be around that child.  And never let them alone.  How would you leave a boyfriend home alone with your child?  Then he's bathing your child.  Then he's whipping your child.  Hitting her way too hard.  The little girl's head come up cracked.  Then he's taking her home when she's supposed to be in daycare and you stay with her.  And the only time you feel the need to leave is after he allegedly dude is also sleeping with me.  Sending pictures to me and allegedly.  That's when you decide to leave?  Hell out of here.  Girl, guilty to the mofo.  Stop it.  Get the hell out of here.  Hopefully she gets to justice.  She needs to go to jail.  She's trying to sit up there and act like she's all innocent and all broke up.  Stop it.  You know it.  What did you think was going to happen?  What did you think?  You get into an argument with this man on the phone while he's at home with your daughter.  He's got your car to have to come pick you up.  No crib, no car career.  So many times you see... Decision making, you grab a man with no crib car career, he gotta live in your house.  He don't work, so he at home eating up your kids' foods.  Let the home alone with your kids because you got to go to work.  Somebody got to pay the damn bills.  And you see abuse from these no good boyfriends that don't work.  Stay home with your kids.  Anyway, that's all I got with this.  I hope justice is served.  Hopefully they lower dude's bond to $45,000.  I don't know what that's about.  Dude needs to have a billion dollar bond.  Hopefully he never see the light of day.  Hopefully they give this dude the death penalty.  Anyway, I want you guys to like, comment, let me know what you think about this video.  Peace, peace. ",
