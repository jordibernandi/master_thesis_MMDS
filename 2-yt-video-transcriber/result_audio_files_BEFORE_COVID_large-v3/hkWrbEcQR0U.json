Mr.  Trevino ran three stop signs in a row just about 30 minutes ago.  So that's the dash cam footage I'm looking for.  He says, I don't think I did.  I said, you kind of did.  It's on my dash cams.  You know, I would just ask you to obey those stop signs.  It's dangerous when you're running.  We all know that.  You've been doing this long enough, you probably know the problem with running a stop sign.  Where do you run on that?  It causes deaths.  I have to look at my dash cam and get the exact streets.  I was hoping that he would just say, no problem, you know, like a lot of officers do.  They're like, hey, no problem, I will.  They know they got busted, and they're just like, no problem.  Just stop it.  And I'll do that and just leave it at that.  But he seems to be kind of in instant denial.  So whenever they're in instant denial, then I just go a little further. ",

Yes, sir.  The law is that you stop at the stop signs.  And then at least for just like everybody else, just like me, we start stopping at the stop signs for a little bit.  Eventually, we probably get complacent and start running them again.  But in the time that the officer starts stopping at the stop signs after I contact them, in my opinion, I just enforce that law.  I didn't have to write a ticket.  Couldn't write a ticket if I wanted to, but I definitely enforce that law in a way.  Okay.  Innocence, right?  Oh, oh, oh.  Innocence.  I told him I don't want him running a stop sign.  I told him I did not want him running a stop sign and getting T-boned and hurt. ",
