            "text": "It's like reacting, but to the news.  Okay?  Yeah, exactly.  People arrive, baby.  Come back in.  Quit burping into the mic.  I will never stop burping into the mic.  You will never stop me.  Milo redemption arc?  Fuck no, okay?  Alright, let's get started.  I want to show you guys the fucking leaked audio of Richard Spencer, but I'm worried because there's a lot of slurs in it, okay?  A lot of slurs.  But it's, like, really important and it's probably contextually appropriate to watch, uh, especially because, like, the way he talks in this thing is insane.  Um... How about don't?  Okay, I'm just gonna read it out.  If we can only find... No, no one has bleeped it.  Like, literally no one has bleeped it.  Okay, here.  We'll... I'll... I'll show you guys and then I'll stop before it gets to the part.  that's really bad.  So this is a leaked audio of Richard Spencer, famous Nazi, white nationalist, the founder and coiner of the term alt-right, founder of a think tank.  You might know him from like all of the news appearances that he's done.  This is him after Charlottesville malding in a recently leaked audio recording.  And this audio recording was leaked by the fellow alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos, an ex-pal of Spencer, even though I guess they're no longer pals and Milo's, I guess, trying to get on the good graces of the media.  He leaked this audio recording.  And on YouTube, and he claimed that it was recorded on the summer of 2017, not long after the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville that he organized.  The audio is terrible, but it's also hilarious.  And there's a lot I want to talk about.  So let's take a look at what he is saying as he mulls over this.  I am so mad.  I am so fucking mad at these people.  They don't do this to fucking me.  We're going to fucking ritualistically humiliate them.  I am coming back here every fucking weekend if I have to.  This is never over.  I win.  They fucking lose.  So, this is hilarious for a multitude of different reasons.  Like, he says a bunch of different, like, really racist slurs.  Like, my man says the term, and I will use it here because it is relatively contextually appropriate, but he uses the term that most of you have probably never even heard before called Octoroon.  Now, this is... A term for one-eighth black, okay?  The only reason why I know this term is because it was still used until last month to designate mixed-race couples in the state of Virginia.  A bunch of mixed-race couples in the state of Virginia sued the state of Virginia.  So that they would no longer have to put in their races.  And we looked through that before.  We looked through that list before.  And I had to Google half of the terms.  Because they were insane.  Like... So... When you start getting math involved... That is next level racist.  Okay?  That's like... you're you're a nerd for the n-word.  basically like you you are a racist nerd like you are a nerd for racism like you're getting mathematics involved in this equation.  so uh he said that he used the k word for uh jewish people uh anti-semitic slurs and he even proceeded to say that um here they get ruled by people like me a little effing little fucking.  uh that octoroon is not like uh i mean it's like racially charged but that's um.  they didn't even uh what do you call it?  they didn't even censor that.  i fucking my ancestors fucking inflate those little shits here.  They rule the fucking world.  Those pieces of shit get ruled by people like me.  They look up and see a face like mine looking down.  so the one really important thing that i have to note here is that uh destiny has to defend him here because he did say this in private.  so this was a totally private conversation.  he's just saying it to other friends.  so um technically it's it's totally morally in the right here.  um now But beyond the memes, beyond the N-word memes, of course, the other thing I got to mention here is that, like, this guy is the perfect representative of those, like, Kekistan, pasty little bitch-ass nerds who think they are descendants of Vikings.  Okay?  Like, he is.  so, like, he's screeching with his voice breaking.  Like, this is exactly how those fucking little 14-year-old shitters Sound in Xbox lobbies when they're screaming the N-word, okay?  It is so insanely pathetic that Heil Tittler over here would be crying like this.  Okay?  It's so perfect.  It's so fucking perfect.  Like, God, this is just incredible.  Incredible shit.  And... what's of course really hilarious about all of this?  about him, like invoking how he owned these people and blah, blah, blah, and all this other shit.  Uh, it's just like, it's very, it's very indicative of like where that white fragility is coming from.  Okay.  This is what they want.  Like he wants to fucking go back to a time where he could own people.  Like he hates the fact that, uh, black people and Jewish people have equal rights.  that he does.  He thinks that this is bad.  Let's keep going with the rest of the audio.  Anyway, so... It's just... It's hilarious.  It's hilarious how pathetic Richard Spencer is.  But it also makes you think... What does it make you think, you might ask?  It makes me think about a lot of things, about how right the left was the entire time.  It makes me think about the many different instances where mainstream media literally fucking platformed this dipshit didn't believe us when we said he was a Nazi and consistently put him on the news and normalized him so much so that he actually was able to go to college campuses.  and there was a point where right-wingers were defending his freedom of speech and even liberals were defending him.  Liberals were defending him when he got punched, for example, by a brave, anti-fascist, black bloc troop.  Okay?  Remember that?  Remember that conversation that took place?  A literal Nazi.  An actual Nazi.  He got punched and everyone was defending him.  Let's take a look at this fun little throwback here. ",

            "text": "so uh you know.  interesting that amir had a take like that back then about a nazi getting punched.  uh interesting that more often than not uh it's the the centrist libs uh feel some type of way about a nazi getting punched like who's gonna get punched next if a nazi's getting punched?  anyway?  that was great.  uh just to relive that beautiful moment i just want to play this again.  um just you know.  so this is what happened.  um you know.  uh terrible i just for those of you who don't know i just wanted to showcase that like this is the.  uh this is the action that they're referencing.  um Isn't there a remix to it?  There was another remake.  Hold on.  I just, I don't know if you... So that's what happens when, um, a Nazi gets punched in the, in the side of the dome.  So, you know, I just, it just, you really can't tell what's going on here, but like... Um, anyway, I hate Nazis too, but that was a sucker punch.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  so um anyway so that's what happened.  um terrible terrible accident.  where this guy terrible accident where this random onlooker just falls um he just like falls in the direction of richard spencer.  poor guy richard spencer It's just like really... He just tripped over in the marketplace of ideas as he was about to say like, Hey, sir, could I interest you in a round of rowdy debate?  And then he had to run away because he was so embarrassed that he made a fool of himself by engaging him in physical altercation rather than a robust debate.  So... I mean, he got away.  He got away terrible for the Nazi movement.  Poor Nazis.  I guess Richard Spencer won that debate.  Now, aside from all of this, the point I wanted to mention is that these fucking dipshits in mainstream media kept defending Richard Spencer over and over again because... He dresses up this way because he presents himself in a certain type of way because he won't come out and say it.  He only says that he says it in private.  Okay?  So... That's why a lot of people in mainstream media were like, oh, no, it's fine.  Like, he's not a Nazi.  We should have him on.  He was on a Jake Tapper show literally two months ago, dude.  Two fucking months ago.  Okay.  Long after the last remaining people were like, yeah, he's a Nazi.  Like, even fucking Lauren Southern had stopped defending him at this point.  Now, he's worth $40 million.  Is that correct?  He's worth a lot of money.  He is, of course, a beneficiary of intergenerational wealth.  And that's why he was crying like the chicken tendy boy that he is in this fucking racist speech that he gave.  I just want to run that back again.  These are, like, two things that I just love.  Also, a descendant of slave owners?  Yeah, a lot of people are.  But, like, you're not supposed to be proud of it.  You know what I mean?  Like, Richard is proud of it.  Like a times.  I am so mad.  I am so fucking mad at these people.  They don't do this to fucking me.  We're gonna fucking ritualistically Yeah.  So, you know, ritualistic humiliation has not happened.  And if there is one person that you would like to if there's if there is a group of people that you would like to thank for this kind of Nazi momentum not taking hold in the way that it was slated to in the aftermath of Charlottesville, it is going to be the brave counter protesters who go to all of these Nazi rallies and tell them that they are not safe.  that their ideology is inherently violent and that if they have an inherently violent ideology... And no, I'm not referencing, like, fucking, you know, universal healthcare.  I mean, like, hey, white people and black people need to be separated from one another.  That's a violent ideology that is inherently violent.  And... If... If that is what you espouse, then you're not welcome in this community where there are plenty of diverse individuals.  If that is what you espouse, then don't feel safe to show your face in our stores.  Don't feel safe to show your face in our communities.  Excuse me.  That is definitely an idea that I am on board with.  I think that Nazis do not deserve the same kind of free speech liberties.  that, I mean, government prosecution is one thing, okay?  But community organizing against Nazis is an entirely separate thing.  And if you're running around with a swastika on your arm and you get punched, I'm not going to shed a tear.  You see what I'm saying?  I'm not going to shed a tear at all.  As a matter of fact, the only tears I will shed if I do shed them will be tears of laughter.  So, RIP to Richard Spencer.  I mean, he was over already.  So... I mean, he's been done.  And thank you to the brave anti-fascists who have done everything they can to expose him every step of the way and have protested him at every step of the way.  Very good.  So that was the Richard Spencer story.  Fuck Jake Tapper for having Richard Spencer on his show.  Fuck everyone in mainstream media for offering a platform to Richard Spencer.  Fuck them all.  And a big fuck you to Richard Spencer, you piece of shit Nazi.  Fuck you.  You deserve all of the terrible things that have happened. ",
