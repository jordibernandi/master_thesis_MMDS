            "text": "For over 130 years, the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor has stood as a symbol of freedom, the torch in her outstretched arm illuminating the way for immigrants seeking a new life in the United States.  Now, we all know the backstory.  It was a gift from France designed by Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel.  And if you're wondering, yes, that Eiffel.  The statue depicts Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty who became politicized during the late Republic and was even prominently featured on Roman currency.  It was completely constructed in France in 1884 and then dismantled and shipped piece by piece to New York in 1885.  President Grover Cleveland dedicated the Statue of Liberty on October 28th, 1886, and since that time it has attracted millions of tourists every year.  But here's where things get a little strange.  Some people claim they can remember touring the statue and going all the way up to the torch.  The National Park Service does allow visitors to tour the inside of the statue and go all the way up to the crown, but access to the torch has been completely banned since 1916.  So how do people alive today remember going up to the Statue of Liberty's torch when it's been closed for over a hundred years?  Some people cite this as clear evidence of a phenomenon known as the Mandela Effect, which was identified around 2010 by self-proclaimed paranormal consultant Fiona Broome.  This phenomenon was named after Nelson Mandela, the famous anti-apartheid revolutionary and former president of South Africa.  Mandela's death in 2013 came as a shock to people like Fiona Broome, who claimed to have remembered Mandela passing away much earlier in time, at some point during his 27-year imprisonment between 1962 and 1990.  Proponents of the Mandela Effect believe humanity has been sliding back and forth between alternate realities without noticing it, thus explaining why some people have different memories of past events than others.  However, it's important to point out that the scientific community doesn't give any credence to the Mandela Effect.  Instead, researchers have linked it to the psychological phenomenon known as false memory, which was investigated by pioneers in psychology like Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud.  Rather than turning to pseudoscience explanations like alternate realities and other dimensions, researchers of false memory have proven that memory recall can be influenced by a number of external factors.  In one experiment, the choice of a single verb in a memory recall question caused a group of 45 participants to remember something completely different.  This is the reason why lawyers are prohibited from asking witnesses leading questions in the courtroom.  So here's the official reason why the Statue of Liberty's torch has been closed for over a hundred years.  In 1916, World War I had been going on for two years, and the U.S.  chose to remain neutral, even though it was a major supplier of munitions which were being shipped to Britain and France, both of which were fighting Germany.  Most of this munition was stored on Black Tom Island, which was located just off of Jersey City, New Jersey, only about 2,000 feet away from Liberty Island.  Upset that the U.S.  was supporting its enemies, Germany sent agents to the U.S.  who started a fire on Black Tom Island during the early morning hours of July 30, 1916, resulting in the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions to have ever occurred in history.  In all, 2 million pounds of small arms and artillery ammunition, along with 100,000 pounds of TNT were detonated.  and the Statue of Liberty sustained heavy structural damage, specifically to the torch and skirt, when debris from the explosion struck the statue.  This prompted officials to close off access to the torch, a ban that has not been lifted to this day.  After the incident, fingers were pointed in every which direction, and the International Secret Service went so far as to blame mosquitoes.  Many people feared a possible German involvement, but at the time, the U.S.  lacked a formal national intelligence service, which made investigation very difficult.  It wasn't until the Lehigh Valley Railroad successfully sued Germany in 1939 that the country was declared officially responsible and ordered to pay $50 million in damages.  But in 1939, Germany was controlled by the Nazis, and the Nazis refused to pay.  Finally, in 1953, the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany finally settled the suit and agreed to pay $95 million in damages.  The Black Tom explosion is considered a key incident that contributed to a shift of public opinion against Germany, resulting in the US officially entering World War I. It also led to the establishment of domestic intelligence agencies in the United States and even influenced US response to military conflict.  FDR specifically cited the Black Tom incident as part of his rationale for interning hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Before you go, I'm curious to hear from you.  Does the Statue of Liberty's torch support the Mandela Effect, or can it be explained by the concept of false memory?  I do think it's worth noting that if it were open, the Statue of Liberty's torch can only be accessed by a narrow ladder in a tight, compacted space.  This seems to me like a big detail.  people would remember if they actually went to the torch.  Anyway, let me know what you think in the comments down below.  And as always, remember to never stop exploring. ",
