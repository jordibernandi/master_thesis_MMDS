Now this has gotten a lot of attention all over the internet.  It's kind of gone viral at this point.  People are trying to say, ha ha, look at Ben Shapiro.  He's a snowflake.  You couldn't handle the heat this day.  and the third.  We're going to get into all that.  But first, we got to see the clip in question.  Now, there is a full 10 minute interview and I'll place that in the description box.  So you're able to see the entire thing in context.  But for now, I'll play about two minutes or so of the actual clip.  So you get a general gist of what's going on.  You see the kind of questioning that was going on and also Ben Shapiro's response.  Then you'll see the moment when he walks out.  So after we get done with that, I'll talk about what was said in the clip.  I'll talk about Ben Shapiro, Andrew Neil, give you my two cents, then I'll wrap it on up with a nice bowl on top.  So without further ado, let's go ahead and roll it. ",

What about this?  What about that?  You're not thinking it's going to be antagonistic in nature.  But Andrew Neal does that.  That's what his job is.  That's pretty much his whole shtick is being the antagonizer.

Now, I've had interviews with guys over in UK and I kind of know how they operate.  I've not had anybody really go.  and depth for a full interview like Andrew Neil do with Ben Shapiro or anyone else.  But I have had little things said.  I'm like, Mr.  Logan, you don't really believe that, do you?  You know, that kind of stuff.  You know, they do that, but it's not really like they're trying to attack you or trying to debate you.  It's just kind of like how they interview.  And the way you respond is just the way you respond to any other interview.  You respond to a question framed in a negative way the same way you would respond if it was framed in a positive way.  Just respond with the truth.  Respond with facts.  And they may try to dig up dirt on you and throw it in your face, but you gotta respond with facts.  That's the same way that anybody would do.  When you're online, a lot of these trolls do that.  They'll say, hey, look at this clip of you.  You look real stupid in this clip.  What about this?  That's how they do.  But you gotta be able to respond The same way.  you respond to everybody else, which is in the calm way.  If they're not trying to hear you, like if they ask you that and you're responding and then they cut you off, they ain't trying to hear your answer, then that's not really a serious interview.  However, if they ask you the question and you respond and they allow you to respond, okay, now you got a serious interview.  Your answers to the questions will be almost as important as the interviewer.  Now, some may not look past what the interviewer said.  They may see what Andrew New was saying, talking about, oh, you said Arabs are dirty.  They're living in open sewers or whatever.  They may just look at that and be like, oh, I didn't know that about Ben Shapiro.  You're a racist.  You're a bigot.  You're a hater.  You are a white supremacist, even though he's Jewish.  But that's a different story.  They may say all those things, but it doesn't even really matter.  People that want to learn more about you, Ben Shapiro, and learn why they should kind of be on your side or support you are now hearing a reason why.  They heard the opposite.  Now they hear yours.  They're hearing from both sides.  It's not an echo chamber.  And some people, well, many of us, I think, appreciate that.  So, yeah.  That was the whole idea of the interview.  Now, Mr.  Pirro did come out and apologize.  He was like, well, I'm sorry.  I didn't know it was a antagonistic interview on purpose.  And that was his style.  I thought it was just being a liberal.  And, you know, that's pretty much what it was.  Like I've said, I've gotten this before from people.  Sometimes they're not serious when they do it.  So that's why I understand, like I said in the beginning, why he walked out.  Because sometimes they're just trying to debate you and trying to shout at you and not really trying to get you to really answer the question.  They're trying to embarrass you and they're trying to devalue your opinion.  They're trying to make you become irrelevant.  They're just trying to stomp on you.  I don't think that was Andrew Neal's point.  And if it was the way you responded, didn't really help.  But like I said, I've been there.  I kind of I want to say I responded similarly, but I didn't respond the way that I should have responded.  I should have responded with more of a clear and calm tone that has all the information in it, all the facts in it.  rather than kind of being defensive.  So that's pretty much all I got.  What say you?  Do you think that Andrew Neal is a big-time leftist, a big-time liberal, and he was framing his questions in an antagonistic way because of that?  Or do you think, like I showed earlier, that he won't pick a side personally and inject his own feelings into it?  Now, like I said from the jump, I think he is a liberal.  He'll say he's center left, but that may be the European scale.  And I'm not quite sure he'd be considered center left in Europe either, but he definitely would not be center left over here in the States.  He'd be like a regular leftist, in my humble opinion.  But it's his personal opinion and his personal viewpoint is the reason why this interview with Ben Shapiro went the wrong way.  Or was it because Ben Shapiro was not really prepared to have an antagonistic interview.  He was looking for a standard, you know, question, question, answer, nothing really off the top note, nothing really crazy.  They may have a certain opinion about you, but they ain't really trying to say it.  Was he prepared for that?  And then was kind of shocked by what actually happened.  and misunderstood what the intent was.  whatever your comments are please let me know in the comments below.  and that's all i gotta say for this video.  if you like what you heard please comment rate share and subscribe peace.
