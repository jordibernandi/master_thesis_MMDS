I seriously feel like I need that disclaimer in all of my videos.  Conservapedia was not a troll.  The pussy church of witchcraft was not a troll.  The woman who said being straight is a choice was not a troll.  This unfortunately is just the world we live in today.  So I actually found this person because they have been literally harassing a YouTuber, Calvin Garrah, going onto his Instagram and telling him that he's a traitor to womanhood for being a trans man.  Yes, today we are dealing with a TERF.  Wait, I'm sorry, that is a slur.  A trans-exclusionary radical feminist.  If you don't know what a TERF is, check out my video on TERFs linked below.

The reason this is so crazy to me is because like five years ago I used to be like haha stupid feminist not shaving haha hairy feminist.  but now I'm like hey if you don't want to shave that's your personal choice that's fine.  This person is the complete 180.  I shamed women for not shaving, and she's shaming women for shaving.  Both of these mindsets are incredibly cancerous.  Let people do what they want.  As long as it's not hurting anybody, who cares?  Why is that such a difficult concept for some people to grasp?  Why?  So before we go, do you have any closing statements? ",
