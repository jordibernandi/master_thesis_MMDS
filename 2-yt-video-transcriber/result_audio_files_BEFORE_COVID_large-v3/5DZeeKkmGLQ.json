            "text": "Thank you.  The Million Man March, which, in all honesty, we never really were given the credit for what God allowed us to do on that day.  And even some within the mainstream media and some within the black family played down the value of the march as a feel-good something.  But when you've lived in America for 400 years, and you have never in 400 years seen black men come together in the way that we came together on that day.  They say Farrakhan is a divisive force, but there is no leader that you claim is not divisive.  that had the power to call all the denominations, all the various factions in the black community, call them all together and they came many and they left one.  My dear brothers and sisters and members of the press, that was a miracle.  To see black men who don't talk to each other, being respectful of each other.  If they stepped on one another's toe, you could hear, excuse me, brother.  when one brother got sick in the crowd or needed to go to the restroom but they were packed together in the same manner that we came in the holds of ships but this time This time we were packed together with a bond between us.  They would lift the brother up and pass him right over his brothers so that he could use one of the port-a-johns.  Somebody that you see on television all the time, Brother Will Smith, rapper, actor, when he saw what he saw he fell down on his knees and started weeping uncontrollably.  Maya Angelou a black poetess extraordinaire could hardly speak her lines and broke down crying because she saw what she never thought she would ever see black men standing together, declaring that they would no longer destroy each other, affirming their love for God and their love for one another.  Now I'll tell you some of the accomplishments.  That itself was a major accomplishment.  At the end of the day, I asked, listen carefully, all the black men that were present, I said, I want you to go and join an organization that is working for the uplift of our people.  SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, had to put on new staff to handle the men that came to SCLC.  The NAACP benefited.  Even CORE benefited.  There is no black organization that did not benefit.  I also ask these men, join a religious house that is preaching spiritual values.  Join the mosque, the church, the temple of your choice.  And I'm proud to say that many pastors say that men came back and joined the church.  Excuse me.  Men came back and joined the mosque.  Under the leadership of Imam W.D.  Muhammad, men came back and joined the nation of Islam.  Men came back and joined the Hebrew Israelites.  I take pride in that accomplishment.  1.7 million new black male voters came on stream.  as a result of the million man march.  There were 25,000 black children in need of finding adoptive homes and parents.  I'm proud to announce that nearly all 25,000 of those children have found homes in this last five years.  Listen to the accomplishments.  Many of those black men went home to their wives and began to rebuild their home life.  Many pooled their resources and went into business.  These are things that are very real.  that went on.  And guess what?  The crime rate fell in every major city in America.  Now, of course, the FBI and the police can say that they had something to do with that.  I'm not going to take it away from them.  They did have something to do with it.  But the Million Man March had a lot to do with the attitude that those black men who were in gangs went back home and worked for peace in their communities.  And the effect of the Million Man March, I say it's still going on because there are mentoring programs.  There's one man in Washington,  D.C.,  His name is Ken Amos.  Media, go and check him out.  The man had one or two schools under his supervision when he came to the Million Man March.  Now he has 12 with thousands of students that they have literally taken over schools.  This happened from the Million Man March.  There's a multi, the tag team.  One of the largest black-owned distributorships in the country started from the Million Man March.  These things keep going.  In fact, to be very honest, I really don't know all the benefits.  I'm just giving you the few that I know.  But that is significant.  Some have said, well, I'm not going to march because those men spend an average of $500 for each person.  So if a million came, that's $500 million that could have gone into some economic pot.  to do some economic development for our people.  You're right.  But you can't get 500 million dollars from a million men unless you first pull a million men together to put it in the pot.  The same people that talk about conventions and gatherings and how much money is spent.  How much money is being spent on this election?  And will you as black people get out of the election what we got out of the Million Man March?  I mean, just think about it.  We can point to what we got out of the Million Man March.  What did you get out of the Clinton-Gore administration?  Talk back to me.  You got welfare reform.  See how many in the community are suffering.  You got the loss of affirmative action all this under Clinton Gore.  You got a crime bill passed That have very negative effects on our community.  You got the uneven Sentencing for crack cocaine as as it relates to powdered cocaine.  You got the growth of the prison industrial complex.  You got the brand new slavery that's going on now.  Three strikes and you're in for the rest of your life and some of our babies have two strikes on them before they get to be 21 years of age.  All of this you got from the political giant but you come to Washington with me.  I'm telling you 1 million of you get behind me and I will change the way you live in America.  See, what you need is bold, uncompromising leadership that will not compromise what is in the best interest of us as a people.  Can't nobody buy me.  I'm on board.  Nobody boss me but God.  I'm the freest black man in the world!  In the world!  In the world!  Now you think about that!  All of you, the press, You're not as free as I am, white, black, Jewish.  No matter what you are, you're not free as I am.  You gotta answer to somebody.  And even though I tell you the truth today, when you go back, your editor will change what you say.  And you can't say nothing about it.  Show me Show me one politician.  Show me one politician that's not bought and paid for.  This is why they can't talk like I talk.  They can't represent you.  I'm free and I drive the best car.  I live in the best kind of home.  Because you help me.  The Muslim community helps me.  I don't have any personal need.  I got what I need to live.  What I need to see is the liberation of every black man, woman, and child in America and throughout the world.  I close on that one by just saying this.  See, the reason they don't like me is because they can't control me.  What white America wants to know is can he be controlled?  That ain't never going to happen.  Never, not in this life or in the next one.  I'm under control, all right, but it's not yours.  And I love that feeling.  They sing a song, oh, I wish, I wish that I knew.  what it meant to be free.  I know that feeling.  I know that feeling.  And you know what?  I want you to know that feeling.  I want you to know that we can bust the glass ceiling that corporate America has over your rise and advancement.  We can bust the power ceiling That says you can only be this but not that.  We got the power to bust it all up.  That's why I'm asking a million of you.  Just get behind Farrakhan.  You don't have to change your religion.  Just get behind me.  Back me.  And I will show you.  We can be free overnight.  Now those are big words.  Try me and see then.  You tried everything else.  Try me.  I believe that God is with me to help us to be free.  Not only us, but all those who suffer The lack of advancement because somebody else determines how high they can go.  No human being should suffer that humiliation.  Only God should be able to determine how high we go.  And God has set no limits on the human being.  God has set no limits on us.  Only sin limits us.  when you're dealing with God.  Think about it.
