            "text": "Hey guys, you've probably heard about the celery juice craze.  We're now.  celery is the Kanye West of vegetables.  So I decided I would try it for seven days and I want to share with you what happened.  But first a couple of thoughts.  There's a health phenomenon that happens where if everybody's doing a thing and then I start doing that thing, my health will improve.  That's how health and nutrition works and stuff.  It's like being a sheep without the meat.  Hashtag vegan.  And that's why I want to try celery juice for seven days.  Celery juice really does so much.  It's kind of miraculous.  It cures skin issues, digestive issues, narcissism, bedwetting.  It kills pathogens.  gives you more energy, makes you more beautiful, and strengthens your bones.  So here's how you do celery juice.  You want to drink 16 ounces first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.  So all you need to do is buy it, wash it, and then because nature is stupid and accidentally puts the juice inside the celery, you'll need to use a juicer to correct nature's mistake by extracting the juice.  And you'll love how quick and easy celery juice is too.  It only takes two minutes to wash the celery, five minutes to juice it, two minutes to drink it, then about 90 minutes to clean your juicer.  But hey, a little time-saving tip, don't wash your celery or clean your juicer.  And it is important to drink your celery juice out of a jar because it'll make you feel like you're from Portland.  And that's cool.  So watch and see what happened to me on my seven day celery juice journey.  Okay guys, so day one, I've just made my juice and I'm about to try it for the first time.  Wish me luck.  Oh my god, it's not that bad.  It tastes nutritional.  You know like the juice that comes out of the bottom of a garbage bag on a hot summer day?  It kind of tastes like that, except like the garbage of people who eat organic a lot.  I already feel more energy and like 11 times more purified.  Hey guys, it's 15 minutes later and I'm getting a little urgent surprise.  Ugh.  I'm getting even more benefit from the celery juice because now I have diarrhea and I usually just have normal healthy poop.  So I guess the juice has cured me of that.  Oh my God, just two days in and I am feeling so well hydrated.  It's shocking to think that drinking a bunch of liquid could hydrate me, but that's one of the magical properties that only celery juice has.  Also kind of exciting, things changed up a bit where the loose stools didn't come on the toilet.  Hey guys, it's happening again.  Locked, damn it.  Ah, ah.  Dammit!  No toilet paper!  Well, I don't need the toilet anymore.  JP, I'm done with the bathroom if you need it.  Too late.  So day three, I decided today to use a nut milk strainer and a high speed blender to show you how easy it is in case you don't have a juicer.  And I can totally tell my skin is getting so clear.  It's just fabulous.  Look.  And I also feel a lot stronger.  Like, I think athletes should just drink celery juice instead of taking steroids to get stronger.  It'd probably work a lot better.  Okay guys, day four.  Now, usually it's important to use only organic celery because non-organic celery is one of the most heavily sprayed foods with pesticides.  But because my self-worth is a little bit low today, I decided to use non-organic celery as a way of saying you to me.  The celery is so anti-inflammatory, I think it just cured my autism and it's only four days into it.  Do my bones look denser to you?  I think they're getting denser.  Oh my God, guys, today the store was completely sold out of celery.  That's how popular this cleanse is, which really reaffirms how effective it is.  So accordingly, I didn't drink any celery juice today and I kept feeling even better.  That's how powerful celery juice is.  But my diarrhea did go away for some reason.  That's probably the only negative.  Scored more celery today, guys.  Back on the juice.  Hey, now because celery is such a powerful purifier, today I'm feeling a lot of detox symptoms.  I have a headache, my stomach really hurts, really low energy, brain fog.  Feels like I'm losing my health, but I know I'm getting healthier because I've learned how to call these negative destructive symptoms detox reactions, and that makes them healthy for me.  Oh, and even better, my diarrhea came back today.  It's the final day of drinking celery juice.  It has completely transformed my life.  I feel like the celery juices help me weave right into the fabric of nutritional pop culture, and that makes me feel included.  Today I noticed I don't have elephantiasis, so I think it's safe to say that celery juice prevents elephantiasis.  I also think I don't have polio, so you can just drink celery juice instead of getting vaccinated if you want.  So in conclusion, you gotta try celery juice for seven days, guys.  You're gonna love it.  I just wish they discovered celery before 2019.  I have felt more energy than a cocaine addict working on Wall Street.  I think clearer, and it's killed more pathogens that I haven't seen than I can count.  I can honestly say celery juice has changed my life.  And it also forces me to change my pants often, too.  Hey guys, thanks for watching.  Please leave a comment below sharing what kind of miracle celery juice has done for you. ",
