            "text": "This is my testimony on everything that led up to this moment.  I'm not going to do detail by detail, but it's going to be in there.  You're going to understand why, how I found this ministry.  It's through a prayer one night of wisdom and knowledge and asking the Lord diligently about him giving me someone that I can look up to to receive knowledge and wisdom from and to follow him.  He gave me this ministry, Revelation of Jesus Christ.  which used to be ghetto gospel, but, you know, through changes and, you know, them talking to the Lord, they changed it to Revelation, Jesus Christ.  That's a story for them to tell.  But, you know, I've, you know, one conference call, you know, and this man with so much zeal in his voice says to Brother Works that he wants to get baptized.  And that he was driving down that night.  And so he just, it touched me.  It touched me.  It was like a flame, you know, that just lit inside me.  That I said, okay, you know, I spoke up too.  And I acknowledged that I wanted to come out here too.  You know, but I booked a flight.  And my flight was... You know, we will get to that.  And, you know, it's like soon as I acknowledge that I wanted to give my life to the Lord, everything just started dumping on me.  You know, everything in the book started just dropping on me like heavy weights.  You know, my car broke down.  My bills are stacking up.  My boss, my job, you know, it's like everything.  You know, I was oversleeping, you know what I mean?  And I knew I was going to sleep at the right time.  You know what I mean?  And it was like, one, I felt like I was getting attacked in the spirit realm with my body, my soul.  You know, I was getting these perverted thoughts like, you know, a woman would, you know, walk past me, you know what I'm saying?  And they'll walk past me and I'm like, I'm fighting it, I'm fighting it, you know?  Or I would get like, you know, blasphemous thoughts, you know, in my mind, you know what I mean, towards God.  And it's not me, you know?  It's not me that wants to blaspheme God, you know what I'm saying?  And I cast the thoughts down, but sometimes they just seem to come back.  you know first you know it's so I come out of here.  I come out here right now.  I'm in Atlanta Georgia.  you know see I'm in Atlanta Georgia.  you know I never heard of this place out in Michigan.  that's where I'm from.  I'm from Detroit Michigan near Dearborn kind of sort of Inkster Eastern Dearborn, around the Canton, Westland area.  You know, I know I described a big, you know, long majority of the city, but, you know, just saying in that area, Michigan, from Michigan.  And flew all the way out here to Atlanta, Georgia.  And in the end, you know, when it all came down to it, everything just made sense.  Everything just made sense, and my ticket ended up being $48.  You know, let that sink in.  And that's God.  Regardless of anything anybody got to say, that's God.  And I know it was God, because you know how God just... has this way of letting you know that it's him.  That what just happened, happened because of him.  Like he has this certain signature, like signature touch, like because he's perfect.  He loves you perfectly.  He does things perfectly.  He destroys perfectly too, you know?  And so he has a certain type of signature and touch to him, you know?  And it was just perfect, like $48.  All of my prop, my shop, my cars in the shop, you know, just happened to just, everything just happened just made sense and i just i ended up like my.  my job you know usually is in my business.  they're like they'll be like okay you know.  um so where are you going?  you know all of a sudden he's like i don't need to know where you're going.  that's on you.  i'm like Just everything just happened so perfectly.  Glory to Jesus Christ.  And so I'm on my way out here and I haven't really had to come out of my pocket at all.  You know, glory to God because of the Jesus Christ through the ministry.  You know, they had my back, you know, with ride, with pretty much food, you know.  people across the hall came from the same, for the same reason, man.  They, uh, you know, bless their heart, man.  You know, they, uh, you know, took me to Hibachi and I really, really appreciate that, man.  Cause they didn't, they didn't have to do that at all, but they did, you know, because of Christ.  through them, you know, and it, uh, I'll keep them in my prayers.  You know, and I always wanted to, you know, fellowship with people out here, you know, anywhere, just, you know, with the same like-minded mind, soul, you know what I mean?  Have the same willingness for God as I do, you know?  And it just is a blessing, you know?  May I... decrease and you increase.  love, you know, and just giving their whole entire being and being totally sold out to God.  So I came down here to get baptized.  Are you committed to living the rest of your life and salt down from the heavens and the earth and claim to everything that you are the servant of Christ?  Amen.  Father, is there anything you want to say to the Lord?  Thank you, Father, for this moment.  Anything that led up to this moment, Father.  Praise your holy name forevermore.  Lord Jesus Christ, make me an object of your power.  Lord Jesus Christ, that you will feel your presence.  Holy Spirit, we love you so much.  That you would descend upon these precious people here, Lord God.  Lord, open up the door.  Many of those that were baptized into Jesus Christ.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  So in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, I am now going to baptize you, my brother.  In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Son of the living God, Yeshua the Messiah.  Are you ready for this?  Call on his name.  Jesus!  Jesus!  And get delivered from these demonic entities and you know.  and give my life to God.  give my life to Jesus because You know, I don't want to live unsaved ever ever again.  and i want to you know be that person to be unsaved.  uh you know and and gratefully through the gracious of god you know i was wearing this necklace and you know brother works pointed out man you know that that necklace um that stone on that necklace has some um some uh Negative energy, you know, negative powers from coming from it, you know, and, you know, I was delivered, you know, I rebuke.  I denied that stone.  I cast it down at the cast that had casted that threw it away, even though I had sentimental value.  But still, I love Christ more than anything.  That's how serious I am about it. ",
