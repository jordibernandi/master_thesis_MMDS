            "text": "Hello, everybody.  Borat is here with me.  Hey, what you doing?  Oh, thank you.  He's here with me to let you all know that on October 12th in Saskatoon, I will be attending a question and answer panel discussion after a screening of the feature-length documentary Erasing Family.  It's produced and directed by Ginger Gentile, who I interviewed on my channel just last week.  And I will leave the link to that in the low bar.  I will also link to the Eventbrite details of this screening in the Low Bar.  It's going to be held at the Broadway Theatre, which is, I think, in downtown Saskatoon.  Alison Tiemann will be there, as will Brian Martinez and Lindsay, his wife, Lindsay Martinez.  And I will be dragging with me Nick Redding, who had better not decide to eat blue cheese crumbles in the back of my car, because then I would have to kill him.  who is camera shy, but usually much more enthusiastic than he is at the moment.  I may be bringing him as well.  So to keep Brian's dog Jojo company.  So if you all want to hang out with us in Saskatoon, which is the metropolitan cosmopolitan hub of Canada, It's taken over that position from Toronto.  You can just go to Eventbrite through the link in the low bar and we'll see you there.  So I hope to see lots of bums on seats and I will talk to you guys all later. ",
