            "text": "This is a brief response to the release on May 3rd of the unemployment numbers in the United States, about which a great to-do has been made.  I want to analyze it, I want to respond to it briefly, because the hoopla and the hype should not distract people from the reality of where the American economy is today, and that reality is grim.  First, let's give credit where it's due.  Unemployment is lower than it has been in a long time.  But let's remember what unemployment measures and what it doesn't measure.  Unemployment measures the number of people looking for work that is in the labor force of the United States as we define it and as the U.S.  government defines it.  The number of people in the labor force looking for work but unable to find it.  And that is at a record low, and that, in and by itself, is good news.  At least it's better than if the number were higher.  But we have to understand that people in the labor force is not a fixed number.  Let me give you an idea.  Back in 1999, roughly 20 years ago, the labor force participation rate in the United States was 67%.  That was the percentage of the people of the right age,  etc.,  who are looking for work or holding a job.  Over the last 20 years, and right up now until 2019, the labor force participation rate has dropped drastically from 67%, actually a little bit above that, back in 1999 to under 63% during 2019.  Okay, that's a drop of 4%.  Since our labor force is about 150 million, we're talking about six to seven million Americans who not only don't have a job now, and they did back then, But they're not even looking anymore.  That's why they're not in the labor force and why the labor force participation rate has come down.  The basic explanation for why six to seven million people left the labor force, don't have a job and aren't even looking, is because the jobs they can get are not attractive.  The cost to them overwhelms whatever poor earnings they can get.  So they left.  Those people are not employed.  By any normal sense of the term, they are unemployed.  But because of the way the United States government measures unemployment, they're not counted as unemployed because they're not in the labor force.  So part of the nice low number that is being hyped by Mr.  Trump and the Republicans and the leaders of big business is a number that does not convey what the common sense of the people seeing those numbers would teach them.  We ought to count those people who left the labor force as unemployed, because it means a much smaller percentage of our people are working to produce the goods and services that all of us want and need to consume.  And that's not a sign of economic health in our system.  But the story is worse.  Many of the things that are going on with Americans are not about whether or not they have a job.  It's about how much they're getting paid, and there the numbers are not at all good.  Wages have been stagnating in this country for 40 years.  The real weekly wage, excuse me, the amount of money a person takes home per week on average, adjusted for the prices they have to pay, is lower today than it was back in the 1970s.  That is an extraordinary statistic.  you should never Let's stray from your mind.  Meanwhile, things have been costing more that we used to not have to worry about.  I'll give you just two examples.  One, the amount of deductible we have to pay for medical expenses for those of us that are insured at our job.  Most Americans are, even though millions are not.  Those deductibles have quadrupled in the last 11 years.  That changes our economic situation.  The cost of colleges and universities has driven millions of American families into debt to pay those costs.  That has to figure in.  And many of the jobs that people now have pay much less than the jobs they lost in and after the crash of 2008.  Look, here's the bottom line.  Most Americans are anxious about their economic situation.  Most small businesses have announced they're expecting a recession.  The overwhelming majority of people are workers and consumers and small businesses.  They think the economy is in deep trouble.  They're closer to the reality than the hypes from Trump, the Republicans, and big business. ",
