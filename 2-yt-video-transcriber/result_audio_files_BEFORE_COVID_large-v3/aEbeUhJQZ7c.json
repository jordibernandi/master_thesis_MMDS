            "text": "Well, you say, Joel, are you one of those prosperity ministers?  No, I don't like that term.  That sounds like somebody that only talks about finances.  Prosperity to me is having your health.  It's having peace in your mind.  It's being able to sleep at night, having good relationships.  There are many things that money cannot buy.  While I don't like the term prosperity minister, I must say I am not a poverty minister.  Amen.  I can't find one place in the Scripture where we are supposed to drag around not having enough, not able to afford what we want, living off the leftovers, living in the land of not enough.  No, we were created to be the head and not the tail.  Jesus came that we might live an abundant life.  We represent Almighty God here on this earth.  We should be examples of His goodness, so blessed, so prosperous, so generous, so full of joy that other people want what we have.  But you've got to fight a religious spirit that says you're supposed to be poor, broke, and defeated to show God that you're really humble.  No, when you're poor, broke, and defeated, all that proves is that you're poor, broke, and defeated.  It doesn't bring any honor to God.  If I brought my two children up on the platform today and their clothes were all raggedy, worn out, holes in their shoes, hair not combed, you would look at me and think, what kind of father is he?  It'd be a poor reflection on me.  Listen, when you look good, dress good, live in a nice place, excel in your career, generous with others, that brings a smile to God's face.  It brings him pleasure to prosper you.  My father was raised during the Great Depression. ",
