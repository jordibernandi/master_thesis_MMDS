            "text": "Impeach Donald Trump now!  Not that catchy.  Not that catchy.  The drums escalate things.  You push your hands on me, you get knocked the f*** out.  Hey guys, it's Fleckus.  This week we are in L.A.  for a Trump protest.  People want Trump to be impeached.  We're going to find out why.  Fleckus Talks.  Hello, sir.  Can I ask you a question?  Sure.  What does the sign say?  I have no idea.  I'm not really here to talk.  But you're at a protest and you have a sign.  I'm not here to talk to you.  I'm just not.  Are you here to get cars to beep?  I'm just here to hang out.  That's cool.  I respect that.  Do you hope Trump does well?  No.  No, I hope he goes down in flames.  Do you hope he fails?  Yes.  But he's kind of like flying the plane as the pilot, right?  I would never hope Obama failed.  I would want Obama to do well.  But, you know, to want Trump to fail means the country fails.  Isn't that kind of short-sighted?  Well, the country's failing already as far as I'm concerned.  It's the.  Donald Trump is worse than Hitler, girl.  Donald Trump is worse than Hitler!  Hello, how are you, ma'am?  Can I ask you a question?  What brings you out here today?  Freedom.  I'm Austin Fletcher from Fleckus Talks.  From what?  Fleckus Talks.  Fleckus?  Fleckus Talks.  What is that?  What does Fleckus Talks mean?  Don't even talk to them unless you know what it is.  Yeah.  What is it?  This is a wooden spoon, and this is very cool on it.  That's something I say in my videos a lot.  It's a YouTube channel that I have.  I work by myself.  I've been trying to convince people that Trump's not that bad lately.  Oh, yeah.  Well, good luck with that.  Well, I'm not saying he's the best or the worst.  I'm saying he's not that bad.  And I want to unite the country around that because we should get behind the president no matter who it is.  No, absolutely not.  That's what a democracy is.  A democracy is that when a president is a criminal, they are a person.  That was very nice of you, ma'am.  Well, in peace for what, ma'am?  I wanted to have a conversation and get some dialogue.  Look at this sign right here.  It's all there listed for you.  You can take a picture and post it on your whatever.  But a lot of the things don't make sense.  Trump brought out all the cockroaches from the darkness into the light.  Because I had no idea that we lived in a country full of... racist, bigotry, ignorant people that stand by and let the crimes of the Trumps exist in our country.  What percentage of Trump supporters would you say are racist and horrible?  Four out of ten are sticking with him no matter what.  Four out of ten.  Look around.  So 65 million people voted for him.  You would say like 30 million or so or 25 million?  Well, there are 300 million people in this country.  So like 100 million people in this country... are sitting by.  okay with what he's doing.  So you think 100 million people in this country are racist white supremacists?  I guess so.  That's the only explanation I have.  Doesn't that not make sense?  Makes sense if you see four out of 10 people sticking with Trump.  100 million people is like a massive number.  That's like one in three people in the country.  Four out of 10.  That's a lot.  So you think that's the truth?  More than I ever believed it.  I thought we were way far along.  How did Obama get elected twice?  Because there's still more better people, right?  I mean, a lot of the same people voted in both elections.  A lot of the same people voted in both elections.  I'm smart.  I'm not stupid.  Trump can fool other people.  He can make fun of other people.  He cannot accept that they're smart and just try to make them sound like a fool.  But I'm pretty smart guy.  I can reason.  I listen.  And when somebody says there's good people on both sides and people are marching on one side, you know, chanting the same thing neo-Nazis chanted.  No, there's no good people.  Why did he qualify it with not the white supremacists and the neo-Nazi KKK?  They should be disavowed completely.  Tell me if he disavowed it.  It wasn't until a long time later.  It was in the speech you're talking about.  All right, it was.  All right, let's cut to it.  You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.  you had people in that group excuse me excuse me.  i saw the same pictures as you did and you had people and i'm not talking about the neo-nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally but you had many people in that group other than neo-nazis and white nationalists.  okay hello sir what's going on?  what's the sign about?  treason requires impeachment.  yeah what are some of the treasonous things you think trump has done?  He's released classified information on his open Facebook page.  By the way, who are you guys?  I'm Austin from Fleckistalks.  From what?  Fleckistalks.  It's a YouTube.  Oh, okay.  I work really hard on it.  So you guys are pro-Trump?  I'm pro-Trump, yeah.  So, okay, let me just say, anybody listening to this and paying for it is a stone-cold loser, and I sure hope you find something better to do.  All right, we're here with Benny.  Benny, what brings you out here at the impeachment protest today?  I'm out here supporting my great president, Donald J. Trump.  That's what I'm doing out here, man.  Hell yeah.  What's some of the misinformation going around?  What are people saying?  that doesn't make sense?  Oh, I don't know that Trump, obviously he's inciting white people to go kill Mexicans.  That's what they've been telling me out here.  White supremacists killing Mexicans?  Are you insane?  This is so funny.  I'm a senior.  I wouldn't get out of my house.  I'm an army veteran.  I fought for this country.  You didn't.  You don't know anything about... Tell me about your education.  I mean, I want you to learn.  I want you to listen to facts.  I listen to Fox.  I listen to NBC.  I listen to all sorts of people.  Fox News will tell you the guy who killed... who shot those people in in in uh in el paso was shooting at mexicans.  that's what he said.  i mean he admitted that.  so i mean if you could deny that.  but do you think trump is behind that and supportive of that?  i think trump enables that.  it's unfortunate he enables that to.  he quote of course.  do you think trump is happy that that happened or sad that that happened?  i don't think he cares.  In California, as a Trump supporter, what's some of the backlash you get?  Oh, man, it's an everyday fight.  But you know what?  I'm in the fight just like my president, man.  He's been in there almost close to four years.  He's been rolling with the punches.  I'm here fighting every single day for Cali, for my president.  You just have to listen to the facts.  Just know that if you were in that mall... You look, you look, I don't know what you're, what you are, but you look Hispanic.  That guy would have targeted you.  You know what they do right here?  They can't stand the argument, so they just start blowing a whistle in your face or put a sign up to your face or start doing, you know, just petty kid stuff, man.  We can't be trying to drive.  We can't be trying to drive.  Everything's been good, peacefully, you know?  But it's been good, bro.  Well, thank you for being out here.  Appreciate the support.  I'm glad you're out here.  I'm a big fan of Flecker's Talks, you guys.  Subscribe, hit that sub button.  Let me ask you a question.  Are you okay with Trump?  I love Trump.  Okay, so, I mean, there you go.  So when I describe the cockroaches... It was nothing personal to you, but I guess that would include you.  Oh, I just think you're kind of misinformed, and you believe the media, and I think the media kind of tricked you and duped you a little bit.  Because like five years ago, ten years ago, were you fighting Nazis and upset against Nazis?  There was nothing like that going on.  Yeah, five years ago, I didn't like Nazis either.  Was there a Nazi problem?  I still don't like Nazis.  You told me before 100 million people you think are racist, white supremacists.  Where were they ten years ago?  In the dark.  You think so?  One in three?  Hiding.  Well, that's interesting.  The real journalism at Fox that I watch has just left.  So all you have left.  So that's, yeah, see, because he talks about news and facts.  Throw up.  Is Trump a good idea?  He's not.  that bad is what I've been saying.  Yeah, well, I think that you're not in touch.  You don't want to be in touch.  You got some other ulterior motives.  Sir, you're hanging out with some people who are yelling and shouting in the street, blowing whistles and banging drums.  I'm not the one who's out of touch.  No offense.  I'm a Biden.  No, I know.  We're having a conversation.  I was very nice and I told him right away.  I'm very nice.  Okay.  But to be fair, you probably shouldn't stand right where the camera's going.  I was here before you got here.  Who are you going to vote for in 2020?  Whoever the Democratic nominee is.  Oh, who do you think is going to get it?  Elizabeth Warren?  At the moment, I think Elizabeth Warren.  You think Hillary might run again?  No.  Would you vote for Hillary?  Yes, I'd vote for anybody who is a Democratic.  I'd vote for anybody who wasn't Trump.  Isn't Hillary the swampiest person you've ever seen?  No, absolutely not.  You think she's a good leader and a strong person?  Yes, absolutely.  Let's go over here.  Women have the right to their own bodies.  And you guys gotta stay out of our vagina.  I actually identify as a woman.  Well, good for you.  I'm glad you do.  And I'm glad to have the conversation.  And you have the right.  Yeah.  You support my right to get an abortion?  Yes, I do support your right.  Thank you, and I respect that.  Thank you very much.  Do not cause one.  Do not get one.  If I don't get one, it doesn't mean... No, no, no.  That's a baby.  That's a life.  That's a life.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  That's a life.  That's a life.  It needs to be protected.  Shame on you.  Would you agree that abortion is not good?  Okay, that's nice.  We agree there.  But it needs to be safe and legal because it's going to happen anyway.  It's a medical procedure.  It needs to be safe and legal.  Would you agree that abortion lately has kind of become like birth control in a way?  Mostly people are doing it out of convenience, not ready to have a child.  It's not like medical conditions.  I don't know.  Absolutely not.  You don't think that's true or you don't agree?  I don't agree with your statement.  It's absolutely incorrect.  As a child, why are you f***ing people that may have a baby?  Yeah.  What?  What are you doing?  f***ing people who are fertile if you don't want to have a child?  Well, what are they doing?  Why is it always up to the woman?  Because, well, your same argument can be applied in the same way against you, where it's like, why are you having sex if you're not ready to have a child?  Who does?  What percentage of the thousand abortions a day do you think are rape?  Give me a ballpark.  Ballpark, man.  You said it's a rape problem, and you said that you rape people to me.  What percentage of the thousand abortions that happen a day do you think are rape?  Well, I'm trying to talk to you guys because you're here publicly protesting.  I thought it was very polite.  You called me a p***y. You said I rape people.  What do you think he should be impeached for?  Well, for Ukraine.  And, well, let's just stick with Ukraine.  I only want to go with one.  Is that the transcript?  Did you read the transcript of the call?  I haven't read it.  I'm sorry?  Oh, no, I haven't read it.  Well, why should he be impeached then?  It's treasonous.  The penalty for treason is death.  Oh.  You think what Joe Biden and Hunter Biden did was sketchy with getting all the money from Burisma and China?  That's not great, right?  Let's be fair across the board.  All I know is that it was investigated and nothing was found to be illegal.  That's what I know.  It was investigated.  What about when Joe Biden said on camera in front of all those people, yeah, there was a prosecutor that wanted to investigate us.  We said fire him, and then they fired him, and then they got their money.  I am not so sure that happened.  I don't believe you.  Okay, well, if it exists, maybe.  I don't believe you, and I don't want to get into an argument.  Let's go show it real quick.  Listen, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.  I said, you're not getting the billion.  I'm going to be leaving here, and I think it was, what, six hours?  I looked, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Got fired.  What'd you say?  Dude, I love this.  That's great.  That's what I'm saying.  ShopFleckus.com.  You can get your own.  It says very cool on it.  It has Fleckus Talks logo.  Ah, an advertisement.  Yeah, you brought it up, so I might as well plug.  Who are you voting for in 2020?  Um, I don't know yet.  Probably Elizabeth Warren.  Okay, that's pretty good.  Who are you going to vote for in 2020?  What?  Who are you going to vote for in 2020?  Um, I haven't decided yet.  Who do you hope makes it?  I like Pete Buttigieg.  I like Elizabeth Warren.  Those are my top two, probably.  Yeah, right on!  That's good.  Good luck.  Yep, you too.  100.  Alright, who are you voting for in 2020?  Uh, I like Elizabeth.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like Elizabeth.  All right, have a good day.  100.  Do you think Elizabeth Warren would beat Trump?  Yes.  Do you think Pete Buttigieg would beat Trump?  Yes.  Do you think Joe Biden would beat Trump?  Yes.  Hillary Clinton?  Can't say.  She's not in any of the polls.  Cory Booker?  Likely, yes.  That's pretty good.  Today, today.  That's pretty wild.  That's pretty wild.  Yeah, we completely disagree, but... Okay.  I can't believe you think Pete Buttigieg would beat Trump.  That's so crazy.  No one would vote for him.  All right, another Fleckus Talks in the Books.

A golf cart gained a lot of public attention by spinning around in circles at the airport this week.  After a few spins, a well-dressed airport worker stopped it by ramming something else into it.

Welcome to McDonald's.  Fleckus Talks wouldn't wear something like that.  Fleckus Talks doesn't roll up his jean cuffs.  No offense.  Outfit of the day today is the burgundy velour track suit.  My biggest fear is high school kids.  High school kids trying to impress a girl and their parents aren't around.  Like they're in like the street or at a movie or something.  I'm terrified of high school kids.  Here's an example of a piece of fan art that I got.  Very nice.  I mean, some work went into it.  It's a little different than I thought I looked.  But, you know, woo, woo, woo.  more inflated than i thought i looked in real life.  um but i gave him some notes.  here's picture number two.  here's the edits.  a little more of a personal trainer.  vibe tell us about your trip.  you went to minneapolis uh for the trump rally and everyone got assaulted in bear mace and things got lit on fire.  how'd that go?
