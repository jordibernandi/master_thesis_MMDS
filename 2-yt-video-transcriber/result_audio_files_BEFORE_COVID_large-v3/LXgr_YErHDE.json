And so the Army's doing this training now with the 82nd Airborne here at Fort Bragg.  We're here to check some of it out.  So here at Fort Bragg with the 82nd Airborne, where that training comes down to the troops.

I mean, brigade after brigade, some have already received this training, some will receive this training.  It's building blocks, it's introduction.  Much of it is very similar to what they might see in some standard urban training or close quarters battle inside buildings and around buildings, but they've got to take in all these other limiting factors, Think about using enablers such as dogs, robots, chemical detection, welding, breaching, all these different add-ons in that very tight, confined, kind of scary environment of subterranean.  So this is a real-world situation.  I mean, there are places in Korea, near Israel, Eastern Europe, locations, even cities in Iraq and Afghanistan, cave systems, tunnels, sewer systems that have to be dealt with.  They are a feature of the modern battlefield, and these brigades have to be ready for them.  This is a beginning step toward that, and there's a lot more to do that these commanders have to think about. ",
