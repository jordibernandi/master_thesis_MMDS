            "text": "Join me as we travel the country and explore licensing to see what it means for the everyday worker.  I'm Dick Carpenter and this is License to Work.  Occupational licenses are often justified out of concern for public health and safety.  Restaurant cooks are almost entirely unlicensed, yet the public health and safety implications of preparing food for paying customers are pretty obvious.  Why are cooks unlicensed?  Because there's a different way to protect health and safety that's just as effective, but not nearly as restrictive as licensing.  Inspections.  To ensure public health and safety, municipalities routinely inspect restaurants instead of imposing onerous licensing on food preparers, wait staff, and dishwashers.  This more effective and efficient alternative to licensing is not limited to restaurants.  Many licensed occupations could also be regulated by far less restrictive means while still protecting public health and safety.  In fact, there is a whole menu of alternatives to licensing.  These range from market mechanisms involving no direct government intervention to regulatory alternatives that, though they involve government, do not stand as barriers to entering occupations as licensing does.  Here are some of the more prominent ones.  The first and least restrictive is market regulation.  Until recently, the city of Savannah, Georgia, required that one have a government-issued tour guide license to tell tourists.  the famous Mercer House was never actually owned by songwriter Johnny Mercer.  Or to show them where a wise person once observed, life is like a box of chocolates.  The license required aspiring guides to pass a test, pay a fee, pass a physical examination, and pee in a cup as part of a criminal background check.  But most tourists didn't know and likely didn't even care whether their tour guide was licensed.  Tour guides like Savannah Dan, who's leading a tour.  Hi, Dan. ",

            "text": "Right.  Consumer reviews offer a wealth of information about providers' reputations in a wide range of occupations.  Consumers use this information to weed out businesses that fail to provide safe or quality service.  Companies with poor reputations either improve or go out of business.  But some services are harder for consumers to judge.  Take auto maintenance.  Here, a consumer or employer might want some insurance.  the mechanics know what they're doing.  For that, there's voluntary private certification, which has worked effectively for years in the auto maintenance industry.  This alternative signals to consumers and employers that a mechanic has a certain amount of education and experience.  It does so without creating barriers to entry or stymieing consumer choice because it allows for freedom of occupational practice.  Anyone is free to work without a certificate, and consumers can choose whether certification matters to them.  The next alternatives have some form of government involvement.  As we discussed earlier, inspections are pretty common, but mandatory bonding or insurance is another.  We've come here to an auction to talk to an expert. ",

            "text": "Even jobs like this can be regulated with alternatives to licensing.  Sometimes consumers fear that they'll be harmed by fly-by-night providers, that is, people who promise to start a service and maybe even start a service, but then skip town with the dough.  This risk can be addressed through registration, such as what Kansas requires of roofing contractors.  With registration, service providers must notify state officials of their name and contact information before they can begin work.  The simple act of registering with a state ensures that service providers can be found if necessary.  The idea of registration may also deter bad actors.  A final alternative is state certification, such as Certified Interior Designer.  This is like private certification, except under state certification, the certifying body is a government rather than a private organization.  A shiplap on the left walls.  Gotcha.  Under state certification, like private certification, anyone is free to practice in an occupation.  Let's do subway tiles on the backsplash.  You got it boss.  The key difference is that under state certification, only those who have completed prescribed requirements are allowed to use a designated title.  California, for instance, restricts the use of the title Certified Interior Designer only to those who have completed several years of schooling and apprenticing and passed an examination.  Licensing is the most restrictive form of occupational regulation.  It should only be used when no other tool will do, when there's real proof of harm that can't be mitigated by a less restrictive option.  Too often, occupational regulation results from economic protectionism.  from special interests trying to use government power to shut down competition.  And that leads to a host of ills, from fewer jobs to higher prices, and it tramples on the fundamental American right to earn an honest living.  Instead, lawmakers should demand evidence.  They should only impose regulation upon proof of a real problem, and even then, they should look for the least burdensome, most targeted tool to solve that problem.
