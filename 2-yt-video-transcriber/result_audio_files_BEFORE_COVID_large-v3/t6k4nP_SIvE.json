Well, last time I didn't go inside, but this time we're going straight inside.  Let's do it.  SGV News First is.  I don't know if that's supposed to be true.  oh oh And what are you guys doing for?  Excuse me.  Hi, Christian.  Hello.  All right.  All right.  All right, guys, so this is La Habra.  Post office wasn't that bad.  They went in the back.  I'm sure if the postmaster is here, postmaster was notified that we're out here, and I think he just told them to go back to work, he or she.  So that's a good thing, first off.  We're just on the gate right here.  Cars coming in and out.  At the end of the day, it's pretty hot, so... Let's see how long we hang out here for.  I'm sure the same thing will happen here.  Or they might not even interact at all.  What do you guys think?  What's about to happen here?  Is Greg going to interact?  Or is he going to walk by silently?  They were coming quickly if you seen it first.  Here comes another one.  Okay, so I guess it's still on.  Did you guys figure out if this guy's going to give us a walk by or if he's going to say something?  Let me know in the comment below.  Give me a comment below if you believe that, you know, what you think is going to happen here.  You can just leave a comment down below saying if he was going to pass by. ",
