So I went to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, once home of Bethlehem Steel.  For 140 years, this corporate giant supplied steel for the Empire State Building, the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge, and all sorts of other things, and employed up to 30,000 members of the community at once.  But in 1998, the plant closed down.  You're fired.  The bankrupt company was bought and then dismantled by Mr.  Wilbur Ross, who now works as Mr.  T's Secretary of Commerce.  The factory grounds were completely abandoned until 2009.  In went the Sands Casino, hotel, and restaurants, sitting amid the rusted ruins of the once mighty Bethlehem Steel.  If steel's coming back, I wonder what's going to happen around here.  I wonder if I can get to the bottom of it.  Maybe I'll even meet a real-life steelworker.  We'll see.  I found out that Bethlehem has a university in town.  You know, I figure what better place to learn about steel than a university sitting down with a professor who's an expert on things.  I bet he'll know when these steel jobs are coming back. ",
