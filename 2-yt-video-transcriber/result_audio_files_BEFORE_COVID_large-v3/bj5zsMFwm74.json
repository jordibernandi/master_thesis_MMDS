            "text": "Jesus, Yeshua, Christ, light, love, say it with me, love, peace, joy, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, mercy.  We welcome you.  into our land at this time.  Do it.  Doesn't matter who you are, where you are, raise your hands and thank him.  Worship him and say, I love you.  I worship and honor you.  I pray that you would keep the heart of America in sacred chastity for you, the Lord that made us.  I pray that you would anoint our head with oil and let that same oil be the healing balm to heal the wounds of the nations.  We lift our hands and receive the healing in our homes, in our bodies, in our souls.  We lift our hands and receive restoration now.  We lift our hearts and receive forgiveness of sins.  Remembering that we were created, his handiwork, in Christ Jesus for good works.  which the Father prepared beforehand, that we should walk therein.  I pray today, Lord, that as our hands and our hearts are united, that the washing of the water of the word take place now.  Sprinkle in every home and on every doorpost, may your words and laws be written in the streets of America, in the streets of England, the streets of Europe, the streets of your nations.  sprinkle the blood on the doorposts that the angel of death that has desired the nation.  may that blood cry out.  may that blood cry out from every doorpost of your people.  May your blood cry out of better things than that of Abel.  I pray, stop the division and the discord in this nation.  and hear the prayers of your saints even if it's just today as hundreds of thousands will draw together all over the earth.  our one goal is to praise you and to lift you up.  it doesn't matter if I don't preach or do anything.  what we will do today as nations is worship you.  we will lift you up Lord From this den and from our homes, be glorified, O God.  Let your glory cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.  Let your glory be above the heavens.  Let your glory fill the earth, I pray.  I pray that your presence, Lord God, would drive back our enemies.  I pray like Jehoshaphat prayed as he stood before the nations and he said, here they have come to take us away from our possession, which you have given us to inherit.  Lord, we have an inheritance.  We have an inheritance.  And that inheritance we will receive.  That kingdom that you have promised to us, we will receive.  Kingdom come.  Kingdom come.  Kingdom come.  Kingdom come.  Come!  All over the world there are people standing under the power of this Holy Spirit that is present.  Say it with me.  Kingdom come!  Come!  Come!  Come!  Come!  Come!  And your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread.  Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us.  Deliver us from evil.  Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  For yours is the kingdom, the power, the glory, forever and ever.  And everybody watching me that has been influenced by the power of the prognosis given by our news media, I break the power of that now.  What you have is a permeating of hope.  coming to you from one who has stepped into the future as far as 2019.  That's what I've done by his spirit to tell you that a season of war cannot remain a season of war.  Seasons change.  This will come to an end.  And rejoicing and celebration will once again be on the streets of Jerusalem and in the streets of America.  That is all I have to say about that. ",
