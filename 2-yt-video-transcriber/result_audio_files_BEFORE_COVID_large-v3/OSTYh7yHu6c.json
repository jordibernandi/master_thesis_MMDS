            "text": "By the 1880s, erotic dance styles were exhibited by East Asian women shipped into European capitals and the dances became cosmopolitan.  By the 20th century, European dancers began copying the dances and stereotyping exotic modes of dress for their own shows.  Various white women, like performer-turned-spy Mata Hari, pretended to be exotic East Asian erotic dancers.  These dances were considered to be authentic representations of other cultures and therefore weren't considered scandalous for Europeans to view.  With the proliferation of film technology in the early 20th century, stacked film producers began capturing dancing beauties, and some of these undated films still exist today.  A prominent erotic dancer from the 1920s is Josephine Baker, whose topless banana costume dance made her a star in Europe.  During the years of the Great Depression, traveling fairs were common.  It's there that performers of all kinds would use the pole that propped up tents in their shows, but erotic dancers began using them too, and this is how pole dancing got its start.  In the 1930s, the Jamal sisters were Egyptian belly dancers who introduced a sexier dimension to the centuries-old style of dance.  The first prominent black burlesque star was 1950s Jean Idel, who was hired to be in a white troupe and was described by Jet Magazine as putting three locks on her dressing room door because fresh guys try to crash her dressing room and date her.  Two of the most popular exotic dancers of the 50s were Tempest Storm and Evelyn West.  Tempest earned about $2,000 a week, or about $19,000 in today's money, Meanwhile, as early as the 1940s, the black community had shake dancers, or women who did near nude strip teases and burlesque shows.  In an October 1953 issue of Jet, the magazine attempted to explain why girls become shake dancers.  Almost without exception, shake dancers point to the money involved whenever more inhibited people question them about their careers.  Sound familiar?  One woman was noted as making 500 a week, or about $4,745 in today's money.  Keep in mind the average black woman earned between 13 to $24 a week in 1953.  Carol Doda is noted as the first dancer of the modern era who performed the topless striptease without pasties at Condor Club in San Francisco.  As a result, the Condor was raided and Doda was charged with public indecency, but she was found not guilty. ",
