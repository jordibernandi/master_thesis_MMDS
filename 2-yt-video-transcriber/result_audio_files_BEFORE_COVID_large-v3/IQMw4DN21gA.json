            "text": "All right.  I got other things coming today, but I felt a ramble coming on.  So I'm going to inject it here.  It got.  Activated by a couple of things.  But yesterday I was listening to Kevin's live stream and he was talking about, I think it was called Young Women, You Don't Owe Older Women Anything.  And he said he was getting a lot of messages from younger women about getting married and about getting a mate.  And they needed advice.  And they realized that competition is getting stiff out there.  And they needed a leg up.  They needed to improve.  So I got to thinking.  I'll put the link in the description to Kevin's video.  It's actually one of the better ones he's done that I've heard.  I may be mistaken.  Kevin, don't shoot me, okay?  Don't shoot me.  It's just my opinion.  But it's one of the better ones that I've seen Kevin do, and he really got intense.  I saw him come out in father mode.  But it kind of got me to thinking about stuff I've been seeing over maybe the last couple of weeks.  And it's something that I didn't think I would see probably ever, but especially not this soon.  Because, you know, I was saying that women are actually controlled by the environment.  And... I was saying like, well, going back maybe three years that eventually the environment would change and black women's attitudes would change, right?  So at times black women had this haughty attitude that they were better than everybody else and they didn't have to speak to black men and they looked down their noses at most black men.  They had that look where they didn't want to engage.  And I thought eventually that the environment, the economic environment would make black women more sociable and more cooperative, right?  A little bit more humble, take them down a peg, right?  So I thought, you know, eventually two, three years, you know, maybe four, that it would slowly erode on that fake self-confidence that black women had about themselves.  And, you know, last year you could start to see it kind of take a step back kind of erode.  But what I've been seeing for the last couple of weeks, and maybe it's because of the economy actually descending faster than I thought and actually combined it with automation.  Maybe it's falling in on itself faster than I thought.  But what I saw for the last couple of weeks, I didn't think I would ever see.  And, you know, I was looking at it, and it just kind of puzzled me until Kevin spoke about it yesterday.  Kevin talked about the numbers, talked about the numbers.  of how many men of value and how many black men, period, there were, and how there wasn't enough to go around, and how black women, period, need to wake up.  And from what I saw, they not only have woken up, they look like they've woken up to a nightmare.  And I noticed it.  I was like, you know, I frequent the 99-cent store.  I'm an old man.  I'm not ashamed of it.  and uh it used to be poor.  you know poor women maybe with their kids and stuff like that and old folks right.  but lately i've seen younger and younger women in the 99 cent store and it's not nicole ali.  she says she never goes and i suspect that she never will.  but I've seen them in the 99 cent store and I see this look in their face.  I see this look in their face of sadness.  And I couldn't put my finger on it until Kevin's dream.  And... I'm waking up putting two and two together and I said, oh, that's the look of defeat.  And it's sad and it's disheartening because I know people think and women think that I hate women and I hate black women especially because I'm so harsh.  And actually I'm not.  I actually, you know, I've got two daughters.  I actually love my women.  Probably to a fault.  And it bothers me to see this look on their face.  And it bothers me that there's nothing that I or anyone can do about it.  Because in economic downturns, especially for black people, and not only do those numbers get worse, I mean, the numbers are going to be numbers, but the thing is the numbers get worse for what they used to call viable black men.  Because as the economy erodes, it takes viable black men away.  And so now those viable black men or the black men that are on the edge, they think about their own survival and the extra money that they would have to acquire a woman they don't have.  So I'm looking at a lot of hollowed out black women and I'm seeing some nice looking hollowed out black women like, you know, they're They're just alone.  You know, some of them with a single child and some of them by themselves.  They just have this look of defeat, like the look of hopelessness.  Now, maybe it's just me.  Maybe it's just my area.  Because this is Los Angeles and this is a gentrified area and things are getting a lot tougher a lot sooner here.  But it fascinates me.  You can tell.  You can tell when you see that there's a stair.  I know people say it's the thousand-mile stair.  But there's that look, and I've seen it in people, but I've seen it in people that were You know, I've seen people that are homeless and they were just defeated, where life was just not viable anymore, that look of hopelessness.  and as i've been looking back over the last couple of weeks i've seen you know i've actually started to recollect seeing that in more and more black women's eyes because before that you know they were smiling more they were talking to you more they're greeting you more they were.  Their attitudes were a little bit more receptive.  And that's a good thing.  But what I'm seeing now is disturbing.  Because I don't think I've ever seen it in my entire life.  And I don't think I've ever seen that look.  amongst black women.  Black women normally have the fortitude to have, no matter what condition that they're in, have that look of pride or that look of haughtiness.  And then more and more women of all ages, I mean, you know, we've seen it from women in their 50s down to women in their, you know, in their 20s.  Just that look, that defeated look, you know, it's like you see those old World War II pictures when the Germans got defeated.  And they're just, you see the soldiers just wandering through the woods.  You know, they're starving, they're hungry, and they've laid down their arms and they've taken off the insignia on their on their clothing, and they have that blank stare like, no, it doesn't matter what happens after this.  It's like I've always wondered what would happen if black girl magic actually wore off.  And that hope wasn't there anymore.  I've always wondered, how would women react?  And I personally never thought I'd see black women react this fast to an environment.  It's not like we're in a total economic collapse where we have the Book of Eli or something like The Walking Dead where people are just gone.  There's total anarchy.  So what I'm wondering is, you know, what is it like in your town?  Do you see the same looks that I'm seeing?  And I'm starting to believe so because I don't hear the complaints about or the same complaints about black women that I heard maybe four years ago or five years ago or even 10 years ago.  What I'm starting to hear more from black men is that black women are starting to become a burden.  So what I'm starting to hear is that black women are needing to be managed.  So I'm assuming that black men are starting to get more attention because more women are coming to them.  I've been hearing that over the past couple of years anyway.  that men were getting these random Facebook messages, these random calls and text messages, even random knocks on the door for them.  old past flames that they couldn't get along with them that all of a sudden try to renegotiate.  It's interesting.  You would think a person like me that saw this coming would be laughing and enjoying the moment.  And that is part of being able to see what's just over the horizon.  I'm not a fortune teller, but you can speak about where things are going.  And when you peek over the horizon, you always hope that you're not correct.  Maybe you can kind of sense something that's going to happen, but you don't want to be 100% correct, especially about something like this.  And to see that in your sister's faces is just like, I don't know.  It's just, I don't know.  It's just, I don't know.  It's just sad.  It's just sad.  I hope this is just temporary.  I hope this is just something I'm seeing locally and it's not something that's widespread.  Because I would, you know, I don't mind seeing sisters come down a peg and getting their minds right.  But I don't like this defeated look that I'm seeing.  But maybe today will be a different day and I'll see something different and the women will be back smiling and happy and back ready to do their thing.  But anyway, this is just a short ramble.  Something that was on my mind that I needed to kind of get off my chest.  I got at least one thing coming today.  And maybe two, if I can speak it out.  We'll try to start doing more recorded videos rather than live streams.  Live streams kind of wear me out.  And with live streams, it gets contentious and then The past two or three live streams, people have lost their freaking minds.  So, with that, I'm going to jump off here.  I'll see you guys later.  This is BGS out, and I'll have something up later on today.  Peace. ",
