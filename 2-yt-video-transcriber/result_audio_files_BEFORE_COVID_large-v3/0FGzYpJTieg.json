            "text": "Yeah, listen, I think there are two reasons.  One, this isn't a very strong case.  if you're going to court in a jury in New York City or Washington, D.C.  It has some complexities to it that doesn't make it easy for a jury to understand.  But the bigger question here is, is the FBI director's testimony about the FISA process and the Russia investigation accurate?  Did he do his job when he signed the FISA warrant?  Is that FISA warrant false?  Was there a fraud perpetrated on the court and the American public to get access to the Donald Trump campaign and target it for surveillance?  Those are the bigger, way more important, weightier questions that Attorney General Barr and John Durham and Inspector General Michael Horowitz are weighing, and we should look for it.  Here's the thing for everybody to watch.  If this is going to get serious at some point, John Durham is going to have to impanel a grand jury.  The thing we should all be watching for, does a grand jury get impaneled?  Do subpoenas go out?  That'll be a sign that the Justice Department is looking at criminal activity.  Right now, there's no sign of that.  That's the thing I'm going to be watching for in the next few weeks. ",

            "text": "But usually they try to hide the fact if they have, in fact, impaneled a grand jury.  There were two paths to spying on the Trump administration, though.  We know James Comey was literally warned on multiple occasions.  You broke at least one of those stories, and that was the case of Kathleen Kavlik at the State Department about 10 days before Comey signed the first FISA warrant in October 2016 before the election.  That's right.  He was also warned, we now know, by Bruce Ohr, as was everybody else.  There are potentially other cases where he was warned about the dossier, about it not being verified, about it being political.  But that's only one path.  Now, in the Mueller report, correct me if I'm wrong, the professor, Joseph Misfud, he was, in fact, they thought he was a Russian agent.  We find out he's a Western intelligence guy.  Now, also, then you have Stefan Halper.  He's spying on Carter Page, Sam Clovis and Papadopoulos.  Who set that up?  Who do we know?  who was involved in that?  And was intelligence farmed out to other countries, allied countries, because it would have been otherwise illegal to do it in this country, and they were circumventing American law to do so? ",

I can also confirm that the Senate Judiciary Committee has also obtained the same deposition.  So you now have the Senate and a federal prosecutor.  Are there tapes of this, John?  Excuse me? ",

My sources tell me there's a big problem for the FBI there.  That happened on James Comey's watch. ",
