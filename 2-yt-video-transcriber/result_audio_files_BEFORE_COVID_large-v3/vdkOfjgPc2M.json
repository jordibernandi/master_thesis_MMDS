He had a lot of money on him at the time period and one of those young Caucasian cops saw this brother putting money in his pocket and I imagine he's a police officer at the police training facility.  Understand this is not somewhere just random in the streets and he decides to start running up on him and profiling him.  Let's go ahead, roll the clip.  That's crazy. ",

            "text": "Now, his response in the first part of this piece, where he said, you treated me like an in on the street, that's exactly what he said.  That comment is actually a problem for me.  Because what do you mean by treating me like an in on the street?  I mean, do you have an elitist mentality?  Do you think you're better than the brothers on the streets?  because you hold that badge because understand something.  They all look at us as in words, brother.  It don't matter if you walk around with a badge.  It don't matter if you're the president of the United States.  Matter of fact, it don't even matter if you have a white mother.  and a black father, they still going to call you the N word.  And I mentioned Barack Obama.  when I said the president United States, that man bent over back was for them folks and they still called him the N word still had a lynching effigies and all kind of threatening things to our Barack Obama.  And he knew he had a white mother grew up with her and his white grandma and he still treated him that way.  Don't let you know.  So if they didn't treat Obama, decent.  Why would the world, they treat you decent being a brother here in America.  Now you making that comment for me, maybe just maybe it could be that wake up call for you to not look down on the brothers in the streets.  by making that comment.  Now what that cop did to you was wrong and I would never, never side with that cop because you know, good and well is racial profiling because if he saw a white cop putting money in his pocket, he wouldn't have had no issue with it.  He wouldn't have thought twice about it.  There's no law out here saying that you can't carry money.  Now me personally, I don't believe in carrying cash.  I don't do it because it's just no, because if somebody wants to get you and rob you, then you can't recover that money back.  But if money is taken out of your bank account, it's easily for them to put that money right back into your bank account.  I always tell people I'm not the guy to run up on because I don't carry money like that.  The only thing I carry cash wise is haircut money.  That's it.  And you know, haircuts is not too expensive, so you're not gonna get much out of me if you try to do that.  If I would have sold that house, that money will stay right there.  If I had to pay some bills, it's going to be online.  It's going to be able to fall.  It'll be something.  I don't do too many cash transactions and if I'm going to do some sort of transaction, it has to be some sort of cash.  It's going to be a cashier's check.  I don't want nobody running up on me like that.  Talking about some money.  That's kind of old school.  I'm not saying that, you know, what that guy did was right.  And I believe a hundred percent is racial profiling.  It is.  But in this day and time, don't carry cash.  There's no reason to put in your bank account, put it in your cash app.  I don't know where you're going to put it, but put it somewhere.  I sell a house.  Okay, well give me my cashier's check and I'm about to go deposit that in my bank and whatever else I need to do.  I've got my debit card, I got whatever else.  So this little cop be on the street.  Hell no.  Hell no.  Matter of fact, if you have a predominantly African American city, then the cops need to be predominantly African American.  because you won't have as many problems, but the problem you do have that assistant police chief.  Now, if I was the assistant police chief, I would be pissed off because they wait a minute.  You sit up here and ran up on a veteran of the force and you want to act this way with him and start roughing him up behind some money.  And you know, you had a police training facility.  You can at least ask, was he a police officer or anything before you put your hands on him?  But no, what did that boot?  licking, shucking and jiving?  homogenized, uh, person, say it.  Not to say another word like Khalid Muhammad called him.  He's shucking and jiving for the Caucasian cop.  It is sickening.  You know, we have to recognize brothers and sisters this.  We got to say that the people like that cop, the assistant chief in this video, the Candace Owens, all of them, we have to really label them as mentally ill.  They're seriously mentally ill.  because if you would side with people who have a historic history, way of harming you, killing you, beating you, stealing from you.  That's the first thing you do and you so against your own.  Notice how other groups of people don't do these things.  but we are quick to do this.  We are so quick to do this.  This is why I say it is extreme mental illness and we got to call that as such because trying to speak to them and rationalize with them, it doesn't make sense.  I even wasted our energy on them.  I mean, I shake my head at them.  They is a great symptom of America itself, but also that same symptom is in Africa.  If you watch the King Gonda episode, about how white people are treated in Africa, man, my God.  That episode just really floored me about the mentality.  But that same mentality is here in America too, so you can't just talk about them.  That police chief is exactly about that King Gonda episode.  It's the same thing.  We have a global mental illness, a sickness in black people.  Sick, sick, sick nature in your mind.  You worship them people.  They can't do no wrong.  No matter now, if that police would have killed that dude, he'd be like, well, he should have identified himself.  Well, you know, that's all he was saying.  He would have covered for that.  But nobody covers for you though.  When you do something, they let that police chief do something against somebody Caucasian.  What?  They're not gonna come out and defend him.  They go, they go want something done.  Remember Muhammad Noah, right?  What he had right now, 12 years in jail.  They didn't come out defending Muhammad Noah back to blue.  They don't back that.  when it come to you.  No matter where you come from, America, Somalia, Ghana, wherever else you come from, you steal the N word to them.  And they gonna treat you as such.  And then you're so silly to listen to the game they play.  Well, you know, you're not like the African Americans.  You're a little different.  You get what I'm saying?  I mean, y'all fall for some of the same tricks.  Same tricks.  And sometimes it frustrates me because I literally see the same tricks, the same things.  I see how some of y'all respond to them.  And then y'all get mad when we point something that you got.  black folks get mad with me for pointing this out.  I'll have, especially some black males have been mad with me for pointing out these sort of things.  mad, but I have to understand they have a sick mental illness too.  They're very afraid in their cowards because only a coward would bow his knee and act that way.  See a lot of the women like Candace Owens, like what did you actually show them to be a great example to see?  a lot of men are afraid.  Too many men are afraid.  Look at some of your comments to me.  Phil, you can't be saying that man and white people like really bro, you that scary.  That's why you have a police chief like that.  Them kind of comments creates a police chief like that.  I'll create those tiny, the same two black dudes that you saw at their reparations hearing.  They don't need reparations.  It is real sad.  It's real sad.  But this brother, what happened to him is extremely wrong.  But that first comment, brother don't have to lead this in mentality because them folks just showed you in that one moment.  you ain't nothing but what you just said to them.  leave me a comment let me know.  think about the situation that would happen to this police officer.  listen i have a lot of black police officers that have watched my channel.  i'll talk to you brothers and many of you have told me behind the scenes exactly how you've been treated.  the thing is don't let these folks treat you like that.  you got the same authority they have.  Check them.  You have to check them.  If they fire you, well, they'll fire you with your dignity intact that you bow on your knee looking like this assistant police chief. ",
