He's got an AR in here.  Of the vehicle?  Well, I'm not worried about it.  Game warden truck.  Yeah, they had someone steal one.  Game warden.  He's got a lot of shotgun shells and tactical stuff in here guys.  He's a game warden, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma State.  Oh, no, that lady was just coming out of it as we were crossing the road.  she was driving off.  Yeah, you can't go in there.  No, you've got to get buzzed in.  Yeah.  I don't know if you're paying attention in there.  There's a drug box, guys.  You put your drugs in there, we'll find somebody else later.  Mm-hmm.  Correct.  Yeah.  Cameras, probably on the computer, probably on Facebook.  Probably holding cells right there, wouldn't you imagine?  No.  You don't think those are holding cells?  No.  Employees only?  Yeah.  No cameras, cell phones, tablets, or computers during processing?  It's good.  Yeah, that's awesome.  He just, he saw us.  He looked, he saw us.  It's all right.  I think they're holding stolen property, guys.  I just love the position of stolen property.  I believe those things are stolen.  Yep.  Red Cross trailer.  Maybe it was stolen from somebody and they stole it from you people.  Hell, I don't know.  Look at that boat.  That boat.  That's a boat.  Nope.  That's not a boat trailer.  They what?  Oh really?  Maybe it has proximity.  A lot of agriculture out here, guys.  Soybeans and cotton and not really so much wheat, but this agriculture area.  Altus, Oklahoma.  And we're at this detention facility.  I'm going to go ahead and just pause the video until we get some more action or nothing.  73.  Don't walk into here.  Oh, is that your property?  Huh?  No, this is county.  Right, where's your property?  Yeah, so... We don't want you close to the fence.  Can you show me the no restricted access?  I'm not going to go into that.  All right, have a good day.  They just don't want you standing by the fence.  We were walking.  We weren't standing.  Well, they don't want you by the fence.  Tell them to come out of here.  Tell them to come out of here.  Because obviously you're all right with it because you said they... Okay, well, we don't want you standing by the fence.  We're away from the fence now.  Yeah, we're away from the fence.  We already walked around, you know.  Yeah, we're walking.  We're leaving.  We got a radio.  We're rolling.  Yeah.  You like being a jailer?  Yes, sir.  I was a jailer.  For a bunch of years, yeah.  No, this is a commie killer.  Yeah, kill Antifa and communists, you know.  Yep, ex-military.  Oh, thank you.  We're just outside here, you know, catching video in public areas.  So... Yeah.  They got the Sally Port right here.  So... It's where cars roll in and they let the inmates out.  You've got the lockers.  you put your gun in if you're carrying.  Y'all have a good day.  Keep us safe now.  Keep us safe.  Thank you for the safety.  I couldn't get my video running.  I kept hitting the button and it wouldn't turn on.  We can look in these windows, right?  Well, it's not a fence.  Okay.  I'll stand here and look around.  Meet you on the other side, I guess.  Contact.  Right here.  Coming out of the door.  UPS, thank you for your brown service.  Appreciate it.  Bringing all the good stuff here.  Yep.  Yeah.  Hello?  Huh?  Yeah, I see that.  That's okay.  Good.  Are you with the First Amendment Free Press type deal?  Yeah, we go around filming out in public.  Oh, okay, cool.  I'm going to tell you their only concern is they have had escaped attempts before.  They just want us to identify you and move on.  I'm not even trying to get in there to escape.  Fair enough.  Can I just identify you so we can get on our way?  We don't need to identify me.  I've committed no laws.  In Oklahoma, there's no failed ID statute.  There's no reason to compel.  I'm sorry?  In Oklahoma, there's no reason to... Anyone?  There's no law compelling me to ID.  Okay.  Yeah, we're just walking around in public areas. ",
