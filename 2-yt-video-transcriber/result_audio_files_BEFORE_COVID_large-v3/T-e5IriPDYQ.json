            "text": "oh ?  ?  ?  ?  Thank you.  So the horse-drawn carriage has to get out right in that center lane, and the other traffic has a red light, but luckily these horse-drawn carriages can't turn left on red, which normally you could turn left on red there because you're turning from a one-way onto a one-way.  But I think they're prohibited by their company policy for doing that.  But other cars can turn left on red, and if they turn left on red, they immediately have to merge with oncoming traffic two lanes over.  All because this guy doesn't want to park on the next block.  Somebody new today?  Is this your car?  Is that your car, sir?  Yeah, so the law says you can't park there.  Y'all actually have designated parking on the next block.  Do you know that?  There's a... Yeah, so you're just going to like... I mean, I'm not trying to start anything with you.  Lieutenant Bergen, I'm not trying to start anything with you, but you guys have a designated sparking block on the next block.  Is there a reason why you guys don't use that?  It's the same distance.  Any reason whatsoever?  One more question.  Can I park here and go to Hard Rock?  If I have my hazards on?  Hey guys, can I park there too and leave my hazards on?  Please press the button to your right for a second.  Please wait.  How you doing?  Officer Johnson?  I have a question.  Lieutenant didn't want to answer me.  He didn't want to talk to me at all.  You guys have a designated parking spot.  that's the same distance, almost exactly, at where he parks.  And then over here on the corner, I'm the one who had those signs put in.  The one on the inside of the gas pipe?  Yeah, yeah, right over here.  There's a green sign.  Yeah, and that was put there for you guys to park that vehicle over there or the transport man or whatever.  I was the cause of that.  So, I asked the lieutenant, is there any reason why he can't just park over there where it's legal?  Because over here, it technically is... I know, he's driving his supervisor vehicle.  Right, so I asked him, is there any reason why he can't... And then you have additional spots upstairs for other city vehicles.  The point is that transportation safety code makes it specifically illegal for what he's doing, even if he puts his lights on.  Unless he's in pursuit of a violator, responding to a fire, not returning from, or doing an escort.  Those are the only three reasons you can ignore parking laws.  And I tried to ask them, like, what's the deal with that?  And there's just like no response from you guys whatsoever.  And all I'm doing is I just would like you guys to follow, you know, whatever laws there are out there.  That's all I'm asking.  And so what's... Can I park my vehicle there if I put my flashers on?  And go to Hard Rock and not get a ticket?  No, absolutely.  Why?  Because... Right.  Okay.  Is there like a specific... Okay.  If I park there and throw my hazards on, is there like a certain amount of time I need to come back?  You don't tell anybody?  No.  Okay.  So I parked it.  I understand that.  Nobody's arguing that.  But have we shown discretion?  and somebody says, hey, I didn't pick up a box in the office?  It's possible.  Really?  So I throw in my hazards and I come in and I say, hey guys, I want to run over to Hard Rock and grab a hamburger to go.  It's going to take me 10 minutes.  So I'm out there filming right now.  I've been out there for about a half hour.  And I'm filming cars taking left from Cressa.  on the market and twice I've had two cars honk at each other because they're both trying to merge into that center lane where the car on press set could have gotten to that left lane but he can't because the patrol vehicle's there.  So they're trying to merge and they're honking at each other because they're both trying to occupy the same lane.  And it seems to me that that patrol car being there is creating a traffic hazard.  and I can.  I can even go further and just say that I suggested that they put police-only vehicle parking out there.  So traffic engineering... Right, and traffic engineering has decided on it and emailed to the chief saying that it would be a hazard to allow vehicles to park there, so they're not going to do that.  That's why they put the sign over there.  I mean, they actually did a study on where to put the signs.  They were going to put more than... Right, so the city does have the right to put specially designated parking.  But when they do that, sir, when they put, let's say they were to designate that as parking for an event, they're also going to take other traffic safety control measures to keep this left lane from trying to merge in there with oncoming traffic.  They're going to close the lane here, not allow any left merging, or detour Market Street to the right.  But they're not going to create a situation where they're causing two cars that have to merge into the same lane with no kind of traffic signal warning, no type of control, no nothing to warn these drivers.  When you're coming off of Cresta, you have no warning until you turn and see the car there.  And that's a problem.  It's a problem.  Again, like right now, that space over there has been unoccupied for at least 45 minutes.  And he's been parked there for at least 45 minutes.  Why can't he just go park over there or park upstairs?  I get the van is huge and it's hard to get in there.  I don't know.  Well, okay.  That's why it's there.  I will take your... No, no, I'm not asking that.  What I'm asking is that he take the car, he can fit in there.  and take it upstairs to one of those six or seven parking spots.  And then, of course, keep that open for the van.  I wasn't aware that it couldn't fit.  I just figured if it could fit, it would be extremely hard to get it in and out of there.  That's ridiculous.  I would be the first one to complain to the city and say, why are y'all making these guys drive that van in and out of there?  But now that I know it doesn't fit, that explains it.  Nobody's ever said that.  But still, with his car sitting there, maybe you can be the first one, if you're driving a unit, to not park there maybe.  Not only that, but it just looks bad.  If somebody looks and says, well, it says no parking.  Why are they parking there?  It gives a concept that the police are just ignoring the law.  I do not want you guys with that style to be looking like that.  That's all, man.  So anyway, I just started coming in and asking about if I could park there or whatever.  I wouldn't do that, except for when they're parking there and I'm addressing it.  But I appreciate your time, Officer Johnson.  Mr.  Miller, you have a good day.  Thank you.  All right, guys, so he did move the vehicle.  The lieutenant was parked illegally, and he did move it, so that's good.  That's a step in the right direction. ",
