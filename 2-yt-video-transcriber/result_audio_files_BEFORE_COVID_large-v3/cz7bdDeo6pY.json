They got to get broke in with the Donald's, so here we go.  Don't fret.  Well, we start.  Magician.  Two of Cups and Justice.  So, someone around him come December is whoever the manipulator is that he knows personally.  The person he's in agreements with.  some justice shall fall.  So we're going to see maybe a possible indictment or maybe a, um, at the very least a investigation or some sort of strong line of questioning, but there will be a case or investigation brought upon someone he's doing business with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So 10 of Pentacles, which is my GOP card, Is coupled with the will of fortune.  Now, there is a turning of the fate or there is a turning of the money.  Something is changing.  Seven of Pentacles.  So there are some assets being frozen by someone and maybe not necessarily assets, but assets.  Maybe a flight risk or something like that.  Because there's somebody he knows.  This is involving money.  This is involving big money.  So there may be a revelation of money since it's right underneath the magician.  There may be a revelation of money.  And whoever he's entangled with right above or right below this is the Wheel of Fortune.  So that person's fate may be changing and justice is centered around the Seven of Pentacles.  Now the Seven of Pentacles is like a... seeded money, like investments, waiting on something to grow.  So this is where I get the freezing of the assets because you don't actually have that big money anymore with the Ten of Pentacles.  Now it's sort of frozen.  And so someone is going to get the courts after them and possibly a freezing of their assets or a flight risk or something to where they can't leave the state or the country.  There's the hermit.  underneath the Ten of Pentacles.  So, whoever he knows, or it might even be him, but whoever he knows that is a manipulator of money, or a manipulator in Congress, or a manipulator of his situation, because all of that is under the magician, then this is the person we're talking about here.  Five of Wands, that is underneath the Wheel of Fortune.  So, here comes. ",
