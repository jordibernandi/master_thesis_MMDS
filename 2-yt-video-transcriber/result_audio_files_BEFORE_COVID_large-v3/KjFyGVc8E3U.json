And he says to me, he says, like, I don't think that Democrats care about people like me.  And he says that to me while I'm in his truck.  And I'm just like, I can understand why he feels that way.  But that's... incredibly destructive because there is a point at which Democratic Party used to be very, very heavily aligned with working class Americans.  The savings from robot trucks are estimated to be $168 billion a year.  So I'm running for president in large part because I think we need to get in front of this set of problems.  We have to say, look, if we're going to save $168 billion a year, maybe some of that should go to the truckers and give them a soft landing. ",

They don't ever do that.  And they just don't seem to remember that, hey, it's the little guy like us, the blue collar worker that built this country.
