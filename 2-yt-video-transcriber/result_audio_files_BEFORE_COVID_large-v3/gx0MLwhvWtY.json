You promised you would love us but you knew too much.  Goodbye, Dr.  P. You had all the answers, but no human touch.  If life is subtraction, your number is off.  Your love is a fraction, it's not adding up.  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.  So busy showing me where I'm wrong.  You forgot to switch your feelings on.  So, so superior are you not?  You love a little bit but you forgot.  Goodbye Dr.  P. You promised you would love us but you knew too much.  Goodbye Dr.  P. You had all the answers but no human touch.  If life is subtraction your number is off.  Your love is a fraction, it's not adding up.  Goodbye Dr.  P. Goodbye Dr.  P. Goodbye, Dr.  P. The world was full of wonder till you opened my eyes.  Goodbye, Dr.  P. Wish you hadn't blown my mind and killed the surprise.  Goodbye, Dr.  P. You promised you were lost, but you knew too much.  Good for Dr.  P. You had all the answers but no human touch.  Oh, if life is subtraction, your number is off.  Your love is a fraction, it's not adding up.  Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
