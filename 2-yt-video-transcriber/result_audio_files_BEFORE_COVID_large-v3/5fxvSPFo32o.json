So I'm more interested in how quickly they do it and how effectively they do it more than the number.  So if this is the right person to do it, more power to them.  There's an easy roadmap to follow, Sean.  We know the origins of the Russia probe, what Russia did to us.  I want to know the origins of when the bureau began to intermingle the Trump campaign with the Russia probe.  You just quoted Lindsey Graham as saying they want to stop Trump.  All Lindsey was doing was quoting Peter Strzok.  That's what Peter Strzok said in the text.  No, we'll stop it.  So what are the origins?  Then I want to know, how did the FBI assess Christopher Steele?  They have their own internal documents.  Part of what Lindsey wants to make public are the internal FBI documents where they did their own assessment.  And I think you'll be surprised at whether or not they viewed Steele as being credible.

Instead, he's shifted to the destruction of the president.  And for your viewers, one thing that I think they all have to understand is Congress does not have oversight authority because of the Constitution.  We have it because of the necessity to know things in order to legislate.  And as a result, the courts have always held that there has to be a legislative purpose.  Simply wanting to poke into the president's tax records to see if you can find a crime where the IRS hasn't or demanding that the attorney general break the law and give them openly information that should not be made public has no legislative purpose.  And I think Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler and others are ill-served to keep demanding things they shouldn't ask for.
