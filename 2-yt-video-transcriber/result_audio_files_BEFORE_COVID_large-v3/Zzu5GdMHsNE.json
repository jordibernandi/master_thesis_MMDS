            "text": "Where are you guys taking me?  We're taking you to get some help, Nancy.  Help?  You're trying to help me?  The only help I need is help trying to impeach you.  She doesn't know what year it is, does she?  No, I don't think she does.  Come on, Nancy.  Let's go.  So, are you guys going to let me listen to some relaxing music now?  That's me, Nancy Pelosi.  And this was the day that I finally stopped trying to impeach Donald Trump.  But before I tell you about that day, I need to take you all the way back to the first day at the hospital.  Where the hell am I?  You're in Rainbowland.  Rainbowland?  How the hell did I get here?  I don't know, but do you want to go see my magic walnut?  Oh my gosh, I gotta get the hell out of here.  I gotta impeach Trump.  Nancy, I don't know how to break this to you, but Trump is no longer president.  Are you serious?  Donald Trump is no longer president?  Did we impeach him?  Uh, not exactly, Nancy.  I don't know how to break this to you.  Donald Trump was president for eight years, and now his son, Donald Trump  Jr.,  is in his second term as president.  What?  Are you being serious?  I don't know if it's the medication or not, but yes, I'm being serious.  How did this happen?  Who is responsible for this?  Well, I was always under the assumption that it was your fault.  My fault?  Are you serious?  No one wanted Donald Trump in peace more than me.  There she goes again.  It's always about Nancy.  I sure hope it's pancake day today.  I could really go for some pancakes.  Everything was Nancy this, Nancy that.  It was never about what we wanted.  Oh, somebody put me out of my misery.  I'm thinking that Bernie was a little zealous that I was Speaker of the House, and he wasn't.  I should have been Speaker of the House.  I'm the only one that could have impeached Trump.  Gosh, damn it, Bernie.  If anybody deserved to be Speaker of the House, it was me.  I'm the only one that could have impeached Trump.  I should have been Speaker of the House.  I could have impeached Trump within seconds.  If I was Speaker of the House, I could have impeached Trump.  If I was Speaker of the House, I would have impeached Trump.  Guaranteed.  You guys are all crazy.  If I was Speaker of the House, I could have investigated Trump for two more years.  If I was Speaker of the House, I could have done so much more.  Benghazi and my emails would have been chump change compared to what I was capable of.  Oh, I wish I could get out of here.  Y'all crazy.  Nobody wanted Trump in peace mode than me.  And if I was House Speaker, I guarantee you, Trump would have been in prison.  Nancy messed it up.  This is all Nancy's fault.  So is that what you think, Maxine?  Huh?  Oh, Nancy messed everything up?  Well, I mean, uh, you know, uh, I don't know.  It's all Maxine's fault.  Damn it.  We should have fired Maxine.  Honestly, that's what I've always thought.  It was all Maxine's fault.  I didn't want to say anything, but I always felt it was Maxine's fault, too.  Oh, I think this medication is kicking in.  Ugh.  I always felt like it was Maxine's fault.  So is anyone else not going to eat the Tide Pods that I brought?  Come on, Maxine.  You got something you want to say to old Nancy, girl?  This is hilarious.  This is actually quite a show.  I don't want no problems, girl.  Get the hell out of my face.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  You better back the hell up.  Old Maxine got served.  Shut up, Chuck.  This is all your fault.  Gosh, damn it, Nancy!  What are you talking about?  This isn't my fault!  Oh, yeah?  Well, if it's not your fault, then whose fault is it, huh, Chuck?  I always kind of felt it was Chuck's fault, too.  Oh, why don't you just shut up, Jerry?  Yeah, Jerry, shut up!  To be perfectly honest, you were both at fault for this.  What are you talking about?  We didn't do nothing.  Yeah, we didn't do nothing.  All we wanted to do was impeach Trump.  Yeah, Jerry, don't be stupid.  If anybody's to blame, it's you.  Oh, whatever.  Everybody knows it was you.  You know nothing, Jerry.  Yeah, Jerry, you don't know nothing.  I know more than both of you.  Yeah, we'll see about that.  Yeah, we will.  I believe it's Jerry's fault.  I believe it.  I think Trump would have been impeached if it weren't for Jerry.  Yeah, that's what I've always said.  It's Jerry's fault.  How come Mueller wasn't investigating Jerry, huh?  Wait a minute.  You guys told me to investigate Trump.  You should have known better.  You're supposed to be an investigator.  You really screwed this one up, Mueller.  Yep, we should have been looking at Jerry the whole time.  And what about you, Barack?  Huh?  What's your story?  I don't know what you're talking about.  You know what I'm talking about.  I think we all know it was Barack's fault.  I have honestly thought it was always Barack's fault.  I did too, but nobody listened.  Seems you had a little bit of experience with you.  Mr.  Obama?  I knew it!  It was Obama!  Was it, Bernie?  Or was it you?  It was you, Nancy.  No, it was Hillary's fault.  No, it wasn't.  It was Alexandria's fault.  I'm telling you guys, this garbage disposal thing, it's got me worried.  the world is going to explode in two years.  Well, it looks like Alexandria's mad.  Hey, Hillary.  Yeah?  Pull my finger.  No thanks.  So I guess this is a line where all our dreams will come true?  I guess so.  I don't feel so good.  I hate being married to Hillary.  Yeah, she seems like she comes with a lot of baggage.  I can hear you.  Good.  I want a divorce.  This is all your fault.  Do you mind if I cut in front of you, Hillary?  Nope.  Don't mind at all.  Well, good.  I'm going to go enjoy myself in this luxury room with headphones.  So there I was, in the magical room with my special headphones, trying to figure out whose fault it really was that Donald Trump did not get impeached.  And while I was laying there in my slumber, I realized this was all Trump's fault.  Trump!  Good night, ladies and gentlemen. ",
