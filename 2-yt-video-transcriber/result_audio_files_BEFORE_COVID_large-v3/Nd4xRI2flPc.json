            "text": "Well, good morning.  It is right before 5 a.m As a farmer, we put in a lot of long hours.  And, yeah, it's a good job, though.  Pays the bills.  But right now we're getting ready to go haul some seed bean to a seed company.  And just got my lunch packed.  Got some hot chocolate.  It's pretty cold outside.  About 10 degrees right now.  What do we got?  January 21st, I think.  As a farmer, sometimes your days just run all together.  So, this is the start to the day.  Onwards and upwards and safe driving.  Here we come.  So here we are at my semi.  I've done my pre-trip walk around, check my tires, oil, so forth and so on.  It's still cold out.  Climb up in here.  Put on some switches.  Let's hear some fire.  Looking good on oil pressure.  Air gauges are coming up.  Feels good to roll.  I got my field tag and my slip for them.  We're ready to roll.  See you guys in a little while.  Well, we made it to our destination here.  Load number one underway.  We'll get some drops and get back for another one.  As you can see, the sun's just coming up.  It might be a little bit loud in here, I apologize, but this is what we're doing.  Dropping some seed beans here momentarily to a company here that processes them and bags them up for upcoming farming seasons from all over the world.  It's cold out here, so I'm going to hop back in my truck.  But load number one about to be dropped.  Talk to you soon.  So we're headed back to the interstate.  Headed back to where we need to grab our load number two.  Seed beans.  We have somewhere around 60,000 mussels seed beans.  So, theoretically, that would drive me 70 semi loads.  It's going to take a long time.  Maybe anywhere between a week and a half to two weeks, depending on how many semi loads we put on.  We have three that we put on.  So load number two is actually on its way up here.  It's, I don't know, theoretically probably an hour behind me.  Coming early here, I don't like getting up early in the morning.  When the sun gets up, it puts you in a real nice, All right, so we are about to be pulling up here and we decided to get a load of seed beans from the company.  A little bit of background about myself is.  I'm 39 years old.  I have a 17 to 14 year old son.  He got there in Hawaii.  He's coming here in April.  He's starting my 10th year here.  80% of the time I'm driving this here truck.  20% of the time, and that's split to 10 and 10%.  Most of the time during that time, I am planting season for spring and then harvesting.  Harvest season is extremely long hours.  We've probably, I don't know, average 700 plus hours harvest season.  We farm quite a bit of land.  Yes, we do.  It takes about a month and a half to get it planted.  It also takes probably right around three months or so, depending upon weather, to bring the field in.  and work the ground.  Pulling up here at the bed site.  Got another truck in there.  Load out of bin into a belt.  That way the beans don't get damaged.  Damage, kind of lose money.  We have some of the better means that people raise.  This bin site sits on Amish Persians land.  So we got a little bit of a tight deal here going on.  Got a circle around a forest pasture that has a bin in the middle of it and so forth.  It's just another day at the office.  It's right here.  It's my office.  I've driven truck for many, many years.  well over a million miles underneath my belt.  I used to transport cars all over the country.  And when I did that, I was lucky to see the house four days out of the month.  But now I'm home every night, operate heavy machinery, drive semi.  It's a lot of fun, a lot of work, a lot of fun.  That's the story of that.  So we're in position here to get it loaded.  Let's go fire up the belt.  Since the other truck was just here, we don't have to let the belt warm up.  It was just being used.  Let's flip on the switch.  This is gravity fed out of the bin.  It's not hooked right here.  All you got to do is pull this slide out and adjust the flow.  Get that out on there.  We're making beans.  We don't have time at all to get loaded.  This is what it looks like going into the trip.  The minute that it's loaded, it'll be about 15 minutes.  We'll be loaded and rolling back to where we just came from.  And it's still cold, by the way.  Well, we're almost completed.  I'm loading the truck with another load of beans.  Almost.  Well, we're loaded.  Ready to rock and roll onto the interstate here momentarily.  We're going out of the vent site right now.  Headed back to where we came from, where we started off, dropped the first load.  I really thank you guys for watching.  This is what we do.  A lot of hard work and time and effort, time to live for family and so forth and so on goes on when you're farming. ",
