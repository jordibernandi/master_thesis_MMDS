We ask the experts what you need to do to take prudent and responsible action to safeguard your family's wealth and well-being and what basic first steps will help you to be aware and prepared.  Hey, Reluctant Preppers, we look forward to meeting you in person at the Red Pill Expo hosted by G. Edward Griffin, June 7th through 9th in Hartford, Connecticut.  If you register using the keyword Preppers, you get $30 off registration.  See you there.  We've been interviewing Robert Kiyosaki outside the Red Pill Expo in Hartford, Connecticut.  Robert, one follow-up question for people who've already taken the plunge and really believe that we are on the cusp of a major collapse.  potentially in our financial system.  You've mentioned the importance of owning real money rather than fake money.  And is there any other consideration for people who are already of that mindset, any other considerations that they should be, actions that they should be taking now so that they're not caught unaware with the rest of the herd if the whole financial edifice does come down around us?

I only go to the bank for one thing, to borrow money.  I don't save money there, because they can shut it down.  Number two is called the five G's.  The five G's are, you should own gold, grub for food, gasoline, you know, you can travel, ground or real estate, and number five, guns.  So if there is a collapse, those things will become a value.  I hope it doesn't happen, but the five G's again is, you know, what did I say?  Gold, gas, runs, all that stuff.  So I've been doing that for like 40 years.  So I have a lot of guns, gold, ground, gas, grub.  I'm just prepared. ",

            "text": "risk.  Well, risk is a very, very important word, especially, well, in life, but also in the world of finance and money.  And the thing that I was taught in the Marine Corps, we're all pilots, and they said, when you look in the mirror, you'll see a risk.  See, the only risk there really is, is you.  And that was kind of how we were taught.  So we couldn't say that the risk was outside of us.  The risk was in us.  And, um, what that did was like, I practiced crashing, you know, you got to practice what you're afraid of.  So as a Marine pilot, every single day, we had the emergency after the emergency after the emergency, at least once or twice a day, we killed our engines.  so we could fly without an engine.  So that's what I mean by when you look in the mirror, that's the risk, it's you.  And so it's all relative to the person looking back at you.  And I hate to say this, but many people, I don't know how they get around every single day.  They're looking for risk outside of them, but the risk is inside of them.  So, commercial message, one of the reasons I created the cash flow game is so you can make as many mistakes as possible without risking money.  But what most people do is they risk money, but they don't practice anything.  And my whole shtick is the worst.  financial advice is invest for the long term in a well-diversified portfolio of stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs.  And that's good for the average person.  I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole.  Why would you invest for the long term with this high-frequency trading?  You know, you have no control over the asset.  It just doesn't make sense to you.  But for the average person, that's what they should do.  Another risky bit of advice I always hear, somebody says, you know, like, live debt-free.  And most people just eat that up.  Oh, yeah, that makes sense, live debt-free.  but it's not realizing that the US dollar became debt and all currency today is debt.  You know, yen, euro, peso, yuan.  So money is debt.  So I chose to learn to use debt.  Now, if you don't choose to learn debt, then live debt free, but debt is money.  And so it's really a matter of looking at you in the mirror.  What don't you know?  But more importantly, what are you willing to learn?  As the thing they taught me in the Marine Corps, there's two kinds of discipline.  There's discipline and self-discipline.  So for most people, discipline is when mommy and daddy spank you for doing something or the market crashes and you lose everything.  Well, that's external discipline.  And the way to mitigate or minimize external discipline is self-discipline.  And I would say that's, I mean, for myself too, I could always use more self-discipline.  Like when I get up, do I go to the gym?  When I get up, do I meditate?  When I get up, do I eat better?  Do I drink alcohol less?  Do I smoke and all these things?  But most importantly, do I study?  And most people don't have that self-discipline.  So I'm not the guy who should be talking about study, but I hated school.  But I studied like a wild man.  I got up this morning, I was reading this pamphlet on debt.  Now, do I know a lot about debt?  Yeah.  But can I learn more?  Yes.  But again, that's a function of self-discipline.  And the more self-discipline I have, the less the world disciplines me, the less punishment I'll have.  So if I could just leave it with that thought is the biggest risk you have is looking back at you in the mirror.  And that way you don't blame anything.  You can look at yourself. ",

            "text": "And a very practical form of that education that you enlightened us about earlier was that practicing of failure.  In other words, running through the scenarios of what will we do if we don't get the electric car?  What if we do if we don't get water?  What if we do we don't have food?  What are our plans?  Making sure that people are practicing the skills, educating themselves and their responses to be able to handle those risks.  We've been speaking with Robert Kiyosaki.  He's the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad and his newest book, Fake, which makes a grand distinction between the fake money and fake situations that we're presented in our economy versus the real thing.  And we're outside the Red Pill Expo in Hartford, Connecticut.  Any final thoughts? ",

            "text": "No, I thank people for listening to this little piece of stuff, you know, a bit of wisdom.  But I know for me, my personal problem is extreme laziness.  And that's self-discipline.  You know, everybody's lazy to a certain degree, and I accuse other people of being lazier than me.  But I can always be less lazy.  I mean, I can be more self-disciplined.  You know, like right now I watch too much TV.  I gotta cut that out, you know, but replace it with something else.  So there's always something we can do to mitigate risk, to lower it and improve our returns.  So that's really it.  Next biggest thing is, you know, be careful who you take financial advice from.  That's fake teachers.  I mean, most people handing out financial advice are fake.  They're called financial planners, stock brokers, real estate brokers.  The reason they're called brokers is because they're broker than you are.  They need your money.  I don't need your money.  I got my own money.  But most brokers, be it financial planners, stockbrokers, real estate brokers, insurance brokers, they need your money.  And anybody who needs money, there's something weak inside of them.  They're not complete.  I don't need money.  I got millions in gold and silver, real money.  I can also make money.  But be careful who you ask for financial advice from.  And the final thing I'll say, I hear this all the time, is I get these letters.  I got $10,000.  What should I do with it?  My reply is, if you don't know what to do with your money, keep your mouth shut.  Or just go on television and say, hey, I'm an idiot.  I know nothing about money.  I got $10,000.  What should I do with it?  Well, you'll have a billion.  You think your Facebook page will blow up?  You'll have new friends?  They'll all tell you what to do with your money.  Give it to them.  And that's, I mean, I hear it all the time.  I just say that because I get really tired and almost sad when people keep asking me, what should I do with my money?  And the reason for that is what I do with my money doesn't mean you should do that with your money.  Because I have different skill sets, different experiences, you know, different levels of abilities.  And if somebody doesn't know how to do anything, then buy gold and silver.  That's it.  That's all you can do. ",
