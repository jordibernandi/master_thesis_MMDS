At Crazy Leftists.  Which is, believe it or not, one of my favorite things to do.  We have a long history of that here.  So today I thought we could take a break from all the seriousness in the world.  because it's depressing, to laugh at some dumb things that I found on the internet recently.  You know, like how we should be eating other dead human beings in order to fight climate change.  That's not a joke.  Or how someone created a chair for bisexual people because they can't sit straight.  Also not a joke.  Or how the city of Perth in Australia has decided to make Christmas less Christian.  because that makes a lot of sense.  I'm actually kidding, it makes no sense at all.  Even Monopoly made a version of the game that is designed to help women get further ahead than men by giving them more money.  In the game, of course.  They don't try to do that in real life.  But rest assured, none of this was quite as dumb as a video that NowThis News released recently.  In this video, they claim that referring to women as guys in the sense of using the colloquial term to say like, hey guys, or whatever, is apparently sexist and I guess offensive to women.  I mean, cause really, what's not offensive to these people these days?  Hey guys seems innocuous, but here's why you might want to try a different greeting.  This should be good. ",

So just breaking down the logic here for a hot second, because guys has historically referred to men, now it can't be applied to women.  But equally, by that exact same logic, Every person ever who has been referred to as a guy could be offended because historically, the word also meant someone who was grotesque in appearance.

And apparently, by the early 1930s, Americans were only just beginning to use guys to refer to both men and women.  When you then look at the frequency of the word's use in television and media, you find that it really didn't become popularized until the 1970s and onward.  So really, if you think about it logically, which I know is not a feminist strong suit, we really started to use the term to refer to everyone, including women, well, into women's suffrage.  I mean, if you're looking on the bright side of life like I like to do, you could even say that the reason the word became so popular is because women were being included in... like societal discussions or whatever.

            "text": "I am powerful.  My goodness, that was remarkably difficult to watch.  I guess the idea of this video is that referring to women as guys somehow marginalizes us.  Fun fact.  It doesn't.  Truth be told, I sincerely doubt that this is even a thought for any strong, self-respecting female.  And I mean, let's be honest here, the internet never forgets.  And apparently the girl in this video used guys in a tweet.  So there's that.  When I looked into this a little bit more, for the first time ever, I was surprised to find it's only a fraction of women who are actually offended by the term guys.  Three guesses who they are.  But something that did surprise me is that apparently the greeting, hey ladies, is sexist.  What?  Ladies, though, opens up a new can of worms.  Caroline Howard, Forbes woman deputy online editor, who is herself guilty of you guysing, even in our 100% female office, has noticed that some women find hey ladies to be just as sexist.  Honestly, I found this sentiment all over the internet on a bunch of different forums and things, and... I don't really know what to make of that.  I just, like, I don't get it.  We are ladies.  Further, apparently referring to women specifically as girls is also hugely problematic and offensive.  Outside of groups of friends, calling a group of women girls could be taken as condescending or worse.  I'd, uh, I'd like to purchase a ticket off of this planet, please.  Now, because apparently dealing with other human beings in this day and age is just fraught with danger, I'm here to help.  In case you do, in fact, feel offended by these words, and wish to use other words to avoid offending others, I have compiled a short list of alternatives for you to try.  I mean, I did find a pretty comprehensive list of gender-neutral terms that you could use, but it included things like yins and cohorts.  But here are my suggestions instead.  In the event that you have to put down your smartphone and actually interact with another group of people, try calling them sentient life forms or beings.  And if those are still too offensive, you can also try entities and conceptual units.  And if those are still too offensive, you're always safe with the term addressees.  And you know, failing that, Burrs is universally acceptable.  Jokes aside, I really do dislike language policing of any sort.  It's totally unnecessary, and it doesn't even help the people that it's supposed to be representing.  Like in this case, women.  And non-male lifeforms.  Videos like this one, as stupid as they are, promote the idea that everything, including innocuous words, need to be examined, picked apart, and aggressively criticized because they don't represent or reflect every single shade of political correctness.  Which basically just gets worse daily, as we all know too well.  I personally hate these kind of videos because it makes us women look like victims and like we're far too weak to deal with hearing things that might offend our fragile female sensibilities.  And in the end, saying guys is perfectly fine.  And you scholar campers from the Bay Hive have my seal of approval.  So what do you all think?  Is this video actually insane?  Or is there some truth to the claim that using male-orientated terms eventually hurts women?  As always, if you like the video, hit subscribe and the thumbs up button.  If you want to leave a comment, feel free to do so.  Just be respectful about it.  And I will see you guys next time. ",
