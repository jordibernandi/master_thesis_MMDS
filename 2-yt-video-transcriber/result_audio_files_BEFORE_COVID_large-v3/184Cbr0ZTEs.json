And literally no one takes advantage of that fact because of how fucking creepy and off-putting he is.  Everybody's just like, so it'd probably be really helpful if we understood the Night King's, his full plan.  You know, maybe we should ask the all-seeing, all-knowing emo bird boy about it.  No, man, no, no.  You do that, he's just probably going to bring up seeing your parents get murdered in a dream or some shit.  No, we'll figure it out.  Although I will say, even though Bran tries his damnedest, for me personally, this show's real king of creepy-ass one-liners is Qyburn. ",

I like to imagine the writer's room when they came up with this scene.  Hey, you guys know that classic romance trope where the couple kind of flirtatiously chases one another around on horseback as a metaphor for their ongoing romantic pursuit of one another?  Yeah, well, I was thinking we do one of those, but we make ours metal as fuck.  Huh?  And it worked.  I fucking love that shit.
