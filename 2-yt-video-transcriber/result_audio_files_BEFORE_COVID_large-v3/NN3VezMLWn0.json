            "text": "Hey everybody, Greg Laurie here with a few thoughts about basketball legend Kobe Bryant.  It certainly has been a shocking event for so many people in our culture today.  I would compare it to an earlier generation seeing President Kennedy assassinated or later Princess Di dying in a car crash.  It just impacted people and I think for many people today it's hit them in that way.  He's such a vibrant figure.  a well-known figure, even if you're not a Lakers fan, you're aware of Kobe Bryant and his great accomplishments and all that he's done and all of his success.  And he had retired 41 years old, starting into a new phase of life.  You know, I would see him around town.  One time I saw him at 31 Flavors with his kids, another time walking through the mall.  And the place he went to before that horrible helicopter crash that morning was church.  He went to church with his daughter.  And then he boarded that helicopter and he was taken from us.  And when an event like this happens, we wonder why would God allow something like that?  And why would all the folks in that helicopter pass into eternity and then so many others would wake up to a new morning?  Well, we don't know the answer to that question.  But I think there's three things we can think about in the light of Kobe Bryant's passing.  Number one, life is precious.  Don't take it for granted.  I have an Apple Watch here, and there's a feature on it that says breathe.  It's a funny thing.  Sometimes it says that when I'm working out, breathe.  Well, I am breathing, aren't I?  But it's a good reminder.  Breathe.  Enjoy the moment.  Every beat of your heart is a gift from God.  Every breath that we draw in our lungs is also a gift from God.  You know, the Bible says, teach me to number my days that I may apply my heart to wisdom.  I think what's being said there is, you know, help me to live in light of eternity, to not take this day for granted, to not take my health for granted, to not take my family for granted.  I'm sure that Kobe would have given everything he had for another day with this family.  He wasn't given that choice, but value your family, value your life, breathe.  Number two, don't ask why, ask who.  The first thing we wanna say at a time like this or ask is why, why did this happen?  I don't think there's any easy answers to those why questions.  I know that I asked it 11 years ago when our son Christopher died in an automobile accident.  It was a lot of whys to God.  You know, frankly, I think if God even answered that why question, we wouldn't be satisfied with the answer anyway.  So we shouldn't spend too much time wondering why.  Besides, we live on promises, not explanations.  One day we'll have the answer.  So instead of asking why, we should say who.  As in, who shall I turn to?  The answer is you turn to God.  You know, sometimes people say, well, Christianity is a crutch for weak people.  Oh, I beg to differ.  It's not a crutch.  It's a whole hospital.  And I'll tell you what, after the Lord called my son home, I needed intensive care.  I needed every bit of help God could give me.  And I'm not embarrassed to admit I needed God.  And I'm not ashamed to say I need God.  But guess what?  You do too.  So turn to the Lord.  The Bible says he's the God of all comfort.  And we want to remember to pray for Kobe's family, his wife, Vanessa, his children.  We want to pray for the other members of the families of the folks that died in that tragic helicopter crash.  One last point, we must prepare.  That's point number three, prepare.  Be prepared for eternity.  Listen, death is no respecter of persons.  It doesn't matter if you're famous, infamous, or unknown.  Doesn't matter if you're rich or poor.  Doesn't matter if you're young or old, a man or a woman, death knocks at every door.  So we want to be prepared for eternity because after this life comes the afterlife and we determine where we will spend eternity by what we do with Jesus Christ.  I heard a story of a man who was walking through a graveyard, and he came across a tombstone, and on it were inscribed these words, \"'Pause now, stranger, as you pass by, as you are now, so once was I. As I am now, so you shall be, so prepare for death and follow  me.'\".  The man was overheard to say, \"'To follow you is not my intent, until I know which way you  went.'\".  So heaven, it's a prepared place for prepared people.  Are you prepared?  I hope so.  Because none of us know when that day will come.  So get right with God now.  You say, well, how do I do that?  It's as simple as praying a prayer.  And you say, Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.  And I know you're the Savior.  And you died on the cross for me.  And I turn from my sin.  And I ask you to come into my life.  And I choose to follow you from this moment forward.  If you'll pray a prayer like that, God will hear it and answer it.  I hope you will.
