            "text": "Greetings, my friends.  What does Little Red Robin Hood, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the Three Little Pigs, Donald Trump's so-called Russian collusion, and Prime Minister Netanyahu's so-called corruption in Israel have in common?  They're all fairy tales.  Understand this.  God raises up and chooses whoever he wants to run the earth, to lead his chosen people, Israel, And God will make sure that they get through and make sure that it happens.  You see, with all this stuff against Donald Trump and against Benjamin Netanyahu, the odds are heavy in the favor that they would just be out.  They'd be out the door.  There's no way he'd get reelected.  No way Trump would still be in office.  But see, he continues to come and find out with all these investigations that they're lies.  And the same will happen with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  It'll all come out.  It was all a big scam against him.  The media is behind.  99.9% of everything, and in the governments, the other 0.10%.  And it's terrible.  But you saw what happened.  Even with all this hanging over him, even with all of the hatred and the anger and the vitriol around the entire world against Prime Minister Netanyahu, what happened?  He got re-elected.  He's back in office.  He is going to run the country, and I believe that he is God's chosen man, the man that God has personally chosen to lead Israel through the tribulation and great tribulation.  I'm not jumping on the bandwagon.  I'm not new to this.  I'm true to this.  I've been saying this for the last 10 years, last 8 years, however long it's been since he's been in offense, since I've been on social media.  He's God's man.  He's God's chosen man, and I believe that he will Again, lead Israel to the Tribulation and Great Tribulation.  And that shows you how close we are to the imminent rapture catching away at Harpazo.  No one since David Ben-Gurion, the founder of Israel, the original Prime Minister, no one has served anywhere near the time he served other than Prime Minister Netanyahu.  It's very odd for the Prime Minister to serve that long.  We have so much going on, my friends.  Everything on this thumbnail, the tribulation events, it's all happening right now.  And we're right on the threshold of the rapture of the church.  And those who are ready will be, praise the Lord, caught up in the air with Christ, the dead in Christ first.  And those of us who are living with Jesus for seven years, getting crowns, though I don't deserve any crown, whatever the Lord decides to give me or others who give to us, being at the wedding supper of the Lamb and Christ's wedding supper.  And it's going to be just amazing.  While the earth is just pummeled into the middle section here of seven pure years of hell and tribulation and great tribulation, where 100-pound hailstones will fall out of the sky and crush you.  The sun's so hot it'll kill you and make you wish you were dead.  200 million man army coming down and wiping out billions of people.  Of the... An asteroid, a heavenly body coming out of the skies.  It hit the earth, wiping out billions.  A plague, pestilence, disease, wiping out billions.  Hunger, thirst, homelessness, joblessness, suffering, anxiety, depression.  Things like you wouldn't even imagine.  a million times, a billion times worse than you are right now for seven pure years of hell.  You take the mark of the beast, it allows you to live.  You'll be able to live for a little while, but you'll spend forever in hell in the lake of fire and eternal torment with a perfect body, feeling pain a billion times worse than you've ever imagined.  Refuse the mark.  Find Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.  You'll be hunted down and captured and tortured and beheaded, but you'll be with Christ as soon as you die.  And right now is the time to find Christ because the Holy Spirit is here to guide us.  I can't imagine trying to find Jesus without the Holy Spirit on my side.  Things are happening so fast, my friends, and times are so short.  This election, I believe, was a referendum on everything in times, and Israel is the key sign for everything in times, and Prime Minister Netanyahu is their man, and you watch.  He'll cobble together a government soon, and he is the one who's made the decisions through God guiding him.  He has not allowed anything to happen yet because God hasn't wanted it to happen yet, but in his time, God's going to have Prime Minister Netanyahu Do whatever he needs to do, including having a temple built, having a seven-year peace treaty that will be broken halfway through, and we are just on the cusp, on the threshold of eternity.  Don't let all the false media, don't let all the lying politicians fool you.  God's in control.  Things are happening so fast.  If you've never been saved, you're backslidden.  Pray the prayer.  Do the six steps I have in the box below the video.  No one's guaranteed more time in your life.  And again, many Christians don't believe.  you can backslide or you can lose your salvation.  The Bible has hundreds of scriptures that says otherwise.  Believe what you want to believe.  If you end up in hell, don't blame me.  I love you all so much.  And if you need prayer for anything, contact me.  I pray for you every day.  Share this video with everybody you possibly can and look up True Christians or Addiction to Earth and I. We fly soon.  Exciting times.  Take care.  Bye. ",
