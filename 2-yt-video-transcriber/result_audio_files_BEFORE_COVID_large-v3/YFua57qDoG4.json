Is there a book and page number you can reference me to, please?  I don't have a copy of the report in front of me.  Volume 2, page 90.  But I simply ask you, is it correct that as reported in the Mueller report on June 19th, 2017, you met alone in the Oval Office with the President?  Could you read the exact language of the report so I don't have it available to me?  I don't think I need to do that, and I have limited time.  Did you meet alone with the President on that date?  Congressman, I'd like you to refresh my memory by providing a copy of the report so I can follow along.  Hey... You don't have a copy with you?  I don't have a copy of the report, Congressman. ",

            "text": "Well, hello folks, Matthew coming at you for your TNFM report, 18 September 2019.  Thought I would do a Quick report considering the fact that I'm heading back to the grind.  Also wanted to talk a little bit about the last interview I did.  Touch on it.  Appreciate all the comments, good and bad.  And, you know, go over some of the headlines.  So without further ado, let's get started.  and folks listen before we get into the headlines that i've got for you gun control 5g and also more shenanigans by the fed and some other headlines.  listen um i want to get something straight.  uh with all of you out there especially the folks commenting and also address the tnfm patriots out there who i continue to.  uh thank for all the support.  but listen It's real simple.  I don't make the news.  I just touch on it.  I'm not even going to say report on it because I'm not a reporter.  I cover it.  And I'm going to go ahead and say this again.  I don't have anything against the Q Team or its followers.  I have questions.  But that's about it, folks.  I even saw a comment labeling myself and others, including my friend Mike with SpaceShot76, disinfo.  Folks, let me get something real clear to those folks making those kind of comments.  Big shout out to my brother from another mother, Mike with SpaceShot76.  We've been friends a long time, ever since Trump got into office.  Listen, Mike had nothing to do with my interview with Cody Snodgrass.  And some of the claims against Cody in the last video in the comment section are ridiculous.  And I bet you wouldn't ask those questions or claims speak them in front of him directly.  folks again you have a right to speak granted to all of us by the constitution But I'm going to report the truth, not fiction.  Because it does matter.  And as I said in the live stream the other night, I don't care who it is.  Including President, including, excuse me, President Trump.  If I see an issue, I'm going to notate it.  That goes for any body.  with that being said all the information that we discussed can be vetted.  as far as mr aj Look, he's done a lot of awakening in the country's masses, if you will.  But he's also done some very questionable things as well, like questioning and making outrageous claims.  about the president and others.  Example, the strike on Syria.  Anyone remember that?  I know I do.  So let me prove my point.  A headline back from 2018, folks.  You can question me all you want.  But you can also go back and do your own research and see some of the information that I'm talking about.  So let's get right into it.  Like this recent headline here.  Saudi oil attacks came from southwest Iran, U.S.  official says.  Neokinds pushing for war with Iran, folks.  Let's check this headline out.  2-28-2018, folks.  Trump, take the guns first.  Go through due process second.  I like taking guns early.  like in this crazy man's case that just took place in Florida.  To go to court would have taken a long time, Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence.  Let me highlight it, folks.  Take the guns first.  Go through due process second.  President Trump said.  White House considering phone app for background checks as part of gun control proposals 15 September 2019.  Folks, don't bash me.  Do your own due diligence in research before you make outrageous claims.  Here's another headline.  Hot off the press, folks.  White House intervenes in General Motors strike.  Starting to sound like 2008 to anyone.  It's on the website, truthnotfictionmatters.com.  Read it for yourself.  The effort would effectively put the White House on the side of the United States' auto workers.  The White House is seeking to end the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors.  Didn't we bail them out not too long ago?  With an agreement that would reopen an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that GM shut down in March.  The effort described by Politico by two people close to the matter would effectively put the White House on the side of the UAW, a left-leaning union.  Some 48,000 GM workers went out on strike Monday demanding higher wages.  More generous health care benefits and more job security than management has been willing to offer in new contract.  Wait a minute, they're not signed up with Obamacare?  You kidding me?  Here we go, folks.  Check this out.  Headliner out.  Get rid of that ridiculous ad.  Fed jumps into market to push down rates.  Where have we heard this before?  A first since the financial crisis, meaning, can you say 2008?  Federal Reserve stepped into financial markets on Tuesday.  That was yesterday, folks.  Keep short-term interest rates from rising.  The first time the central bank has had to carry out this type of market operation since the global financial crisis.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York had to spring into action, they claim, to keep the effective Fed funds rate in line after it rose to the very top of Fed's range of 2% to 2.25%.  The central bank branch, which acts as an intermediary between the Fed between the Fed and the financial markets, meaning Wall Street, announced on Tuesday that it would conduct its first major repurchase.  Market operation.  Repurchase.  Tax dollars at work, folks.  My dollars and your dollars.  Lining the pockets of, you guessed it, banking cabal.  will conduct its first major repurchase, they claim.  The Fed changed its policy-setting approach during the Great Recession.  Let that sink in, folks.  Do you think I might be disinfo?  Or what's your opinion now?  Wake up.  Do your own research.  Let that sink in.  Swiss revolt against, oh, another hot topic that I'm going to cover.  Against 5G over what?  Health fears.  Maybe one of the reasonings that it's not allowed within so many miles of elites' areas.  one being Mari Lago.  Check it out for yourself.  Switzerland was among the first countries to begin deploying 5G, but health fears over radiation, let me highlight that, radiation from the antennae that carry the next generation mobile technology have sparked a nationwide revolt.  Folks, It's all here.  Demonstrators against the technology due to fill the streets later this month.  Already a number of protesters, cantons, have been pressured to put planned constructions by the protesters of 5G capable antennas, they claim, on ice.  Check this headline out, something vaguely close to what we covered in my interview on Monday with Cody Snogress.  Check this out, folks.  The intelligence community is exploring long-range biometric identification.  Check this doozy of a headline out, also available on truthnotfictionmatters.com.  A new... program aims to build biometric technology that can identify people using cameras stationed on far-off rooftops in unmanned aircraft.  Does that sound like something that abides by the Constitution?  I don't think so.  The intelligence community is working to build this biometric identification program system that can single out individuals from hundreds of yards away or more a feat that's virtually impossible using the technology that exists today.  ultimately the tech would let spy agencies.  let me highlight that folks.  Another point.  Spy agencies rapidly identify people using cameras deployed on far-off rooftops in unmanned aircraft according to the Intelligence Advanced Research Project's activity, the research arm for the CIA and other intelligence agencies.  Wow.  Well, there you go, folks.  Again, I don't make this stuff up.  I just touch on it and bring it to all of you.  In closing, I'm going to continue to do so.  Why?  Because it makes me sleep at night knowing, as I mentioned in the interview with Cody Snodgrass, him as well, the betterment of our country in waking up as many people as we can in questioning everything.  Folks, I've said it a million times, probably will continue to say it a million more.  Trust nothing but God.  Period.  God bless all of the TNFM patrons and new subscribers.  I'm not upset.  I'm just making a point.  Well, folks... Continue to pray for the United States of America, President Trump, all veterans, law enforcement, blue and gold star, moms, long live 1776, support our vets, patriots, stand tall together for the anthem.
