            "text": "Where's Romeo's semen?  He's an anagram for here's some more news.  That news being that they're remaking Face Off for some reason.  And like, I don't know, I guess I'd be up for it as long as Ben is also interested.  I certainly wouldn't forcibly take his face is my point here.  That would be rude.  But also this is a thing that is happening now, two faces.  So you're a huge Bravo fan.  Who was your favorite and least favorite housewife of all cities?  My favorite is probably Lisa Vanderpump.  Why?  Why?  Why must this be our future?  In case you're brand new, the video you just watched and possibly had a sexual awakening to is called a deep fake.  Simply put, a deep fake is that scene in Forrest Gump where they meticulously reanimated JFK's face to interact with Tom Hanks, only in a terrifyingly accessible program available to literally anyone.  It's the push of a button technology that 90s movies about hacking and espionage pretended that video manipulation was like.  So now that the future is today, what do we do with such a powerful new visual trickery?  Digitally graft our faces onto Leonardo DiCaprio?  Yeah, that's what we do.  Also, non-consensual porn.  Fast, easy fodder for the rubber of one out on the go.  Because obviously, since, you know, that's literally how we evolved.  every single new technology out there, can't crank out a hearty come to it?  No thank you and goodbye forever.  It's a deviation from the point of this video, but I'm not even kidding here.  The invention of the printing press almost immediately led to erotic engravings, and we've been consistently exceeding that pervert yardstick ever since.  Also, you never wanna touch the pervert yardstick.  It's exactly as disgusting as you think.  What were we talking about?  Deep fakes.  A concept so new that it had an annoying red line under it in the script for this video.  The surface level problem with this is immediately evident, as deep fakes allow weirdos to slap any celebrity's face onto porn, or a normal person they hate's face onto porn.  Combine this with VR, and we're but years away from making passionate love to Amelia Earhart like we, as a society, always wanted to.  And of course there's the political aspect, a world of sophisticated smear campaigns that put fake words in the mouths of public figures, or easily dupe people with deep fake scams, as explained here.  But how we move forward in the age of information is gonna be the difference between whether we survive or whether we become some kind of fucked up dystopia.  Thanks, Obama!  Anywho, those are the most obvious two threats you've no doubt heard about.  Porn of people who do not want to be in porn and political propaganda.  And as of right now, you're most likely on the fence about whether deepfakes are a dystopian harbinger or just another media scare.  The answer is less about the technology itself, or even the implications of the technology, and more about how we choose to react to it.  After all, deepfakes exist now.  There's no going back.  They're not hypothetical and preventable like a face-off remake no one asked for.  So the first question is, are deep fakes legal?  The short answer is, mostly yes, depressingly so.  In terms of the criminalization of non-consensual porn, aka revenge porn, deep fakes don't apply because they technically aren't nude images of the person in question, but rather images doctored to make them look nude.  It means that in order to take a deepfake down from a website, you either have to shame that website or file a false light or defamation claim, which puts the burden of proof on the victim and possibly creates a long and expensive legal adventure.  Ironically, the people with the power to remove a deepfake are the ones whose face isn't in the video, as the pornography itself could be flagged for copyright violations, assuming the copyright holder even cares.  And that's pretty much it for the moment.  And that... That sucks a lot, and it needs to be fixed, but also it needs to be fixed correctly.  And this is where we get into a difficult discussion, because even though deepfakes seem like the beginning of an inevitable dystopia, our reaction to deepfakes, as well as our attempts to regulate them, might actually be worse if we're not careful, because we're talking about a problem that A, brushes very close to the First Amendment, and B, is currently being fast-tracked by multiple terrible proposals in Congress.  You know, the place that is filled with very smart people that Americans all super love.  Two that come to mind are the malicious Deepfake Prohibition Act of 2018, and the slightly less jazzy Defending Each and Every Person from False Appearances by Keeping Exploitation Subject to Accountability Act of 2019.  You can argue that both of these proposed bills have their heart in the right place, except neither of them introduce anything besides harsher punishments mixed with extremely broad definitions of what deepfakes are.  The big idea in the latter act being mandatory watermarks on deepfakes, something that totally solves that problem of online porn harassment and political propaganda, but it can get even worse than simply being broad and ineffective, such as last year's proposed New York State Assembly Bill A08155, which, to quote, Because while that would certainly make deepfakes illegal, it would also technically make every biopic and documentary illegal, unless specifically approved by the holder of the copyright.  And by copyright, I mean the existence of a person.  This might have something to do with why every film studio came out against the bill.  And while you might think, Big deal!  They can't make The Imitation Game 2, Turing's Revenge.  The idea that an individual's persona is a freely transferable property also means that studios could essentially own the image of a person if that person stupidly signed their image over in a moment of financial weakness.  In other words, it's the exact dystopia that these laws are supposedly trying to prevent.  So yeah, it's tricky, man.  As of right now, we have the technology needed to successfully detect a deep fake.  So considering that they aren't completely convincing just yet, figuring out the exact law to stop them feels more important than finding an immediate solution, especially when the root of the problem might not even be deep fakes themselves, and deep fake detection is kind of just another distraction from that.  What does this rambunctious news god mean by that?  Will we ever crack the enigma of my words?  Who do we talk to about putting me in a remake of Face Off?  Two of those three questions will be answered right now.  While the primarily dark implications of deepfakes do involve the concepts of porn and misinformation, they actually have little to do with celebrities or politicians, and more to do with social media and the way we consume facts.  What I mean is, the sad truth is that we don't need deepfakes to be completely convinced by blatant lies.  You know, as evidenced by just turning your head slightly and looking around at the world.  After all, the most effective video propaganda of late isn't a deepfake, but rather this doctored speech of Nancy Pelosi, edited to make her seem drunk.  And then he had a press conference in the Rose Garden with all this, um, short sort of visuals.  Now the doctored video in which she appears to be impaired.  And then he had a press conference in the Rose Garden with all this short sort of visuals.  That was shared and watched thousands if not millions of times on both Facebook and Twitter.  And another doctored version was of course shared by our totally not incoherent president, who certainly isn't projecting his own mental erosion on others.  Neither was done using deepfakes, the latter of which actually being a deceptively edited Fox Business segment, clearly designed to hate orgasm tired brains of the most racist and aged viewers.  Once again, shared by our president and his tippy top brain.  My point is, even though there's clear video evidence that this speech was doctored, it didn't stop Trump's most feverish fans from sharing it.  After all, there is an entire subsection of supporters who believe he was sent from God to dissolve a secret cabal of satanic pedophiles based on a series of anonymous 4chan posts.  In a country where our highest of leaders are sharing fake grandpa memes on social media, we don't really need deepfakes to trick people into believing propaganda.  In fact, the biggest threat of deepfakes aren't the videos themselves, but more likely the introduction of the concept.  as one more tool for the lexicon of dumb people justifying their beliefs.  There's already a giant post in the Donald subreddit about how Killary and her death squad of satanic Hollywood elites secretly invented deepfakes as an excuse for future video evidence of their guilt.  While no doubt future undoctored videos of Trump tripping over words or accidentally supporting genocide are like, getting his dick stuck in Air Force One, whatever nightmare comes next, they will be written off by his supporters as deep fakes.  Deep fake!  They will howl from their foul guts, pointing an accusatory digit at whatever supreme dumb fuckery births from the warbling throat hole of our defective president.  Oh, how fun the next election will be.  Meanwhile, it's far more likely that actual deep fakes aren't going to affect the powerful and famous nearly as badly as they will affect everyday folks, aka the ones with fewer resources to combat them.  Like, if a video came out of James McAvoy the flared end of a clarinet, he would have a lot of ways to deny that.  either by trusting his die-hard fans to know that he would never make love to a woodwind, or, and this would be the more conclusive answer, by publicly having sex with a second clarinet in order to comparatively prove the initial video was fake.  Either way, this would surely satisfy his fervent following of what I can only assume are called maniacavoids.  But let's say you're not JVOY, but rather a journalist trying to hold powerful people accountable.  Someone like Raina Ayyub, whose recent book accused India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, of being complicit in deadly riots that happened in her country.  This reporting has resulted in constant harassment on the internet, including countless threats from people of opposing political parties.  And part of that harassment was a very disturbing deep fake video editing Rana into pornography, leading to a massive smear campaign and doxing.  When she went to the police, she had to threaten media exposure to even get them to file a report.  To this day, the video has not been taken down from the internet, what with the fact that social media doesn't give a big wad of about the truth so long as people continue to use their platform.  And this is the real problem.  The rotten root.  Not deepfake specifically, but social media's depressing complicity with bullshit in the interest of increased engagement.  That Dr.  Nancy Pelosi video, for example?  Facebook refused to remove it even after it was proven to be fake.  After all, there's nothing technically illegal about it, and we just have no way to flag or pull content for simply being propaganda.  And when a company like Facebook is called out for their bullshit, they often give an answer like this. ",

            "text": "I... AI will solve everything, you guys.  And by solve everything, I mean solve everything specifically for social media companies who don't wanna get in trouble.  It's an extremely broad concept used to shut up old politicians, and as I already mentioned, is currently what's being proposed for combating deepfakes.  Facebook is already telling the world that AI, AI will solve this problem, because much like how adding more armed people will totally solve mass shootings, piling on more algorithms will totally get rid of bullshit on the internet.  You know, especially since those detection programs are already becoming outdated to more sophisticated deepfakes, at least according to the people making them.  It might seem weird at first to compare this problem to gun control, but it's shockingly similar in that there are a lot of people who don't want you to think about regulation.  Facebook wants us to believe that their AI will solve this when the problem is a lot larger and mostly centered on them as a company.  And what if we really wanted to solve deepfakes?  We need to accept that they are merely a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that can only be cured by taking drastic measures against social media companies.  Like, Like breaking them up, or issuing age restrictions, or adding warning banners, or creating careful rules about privacy, or really just having any discussion about what to do with Facebook that is framed by the accepted reality that they are doing more harm than good and need to be regulated.  like guns or cigarettes or alcohol or weed or anything that's generally awesome, at some point we had to face the cold hard truth that it's killing us and needs to be controlled to some extent.  Not abolished, just controlled better.  Social media is no different.  It's been hurting us for a while, sometimes subtly.  Deepfakes are just the obvious hacking cough to the larger affliction.  a hard-to-ignore reminder that there is now an entire industry of fake journalist grifters who create deceptive narratives on social media and are actually taken seriously.  That anonymous message board posts and unsourced memes are being accepted as facts by vulnerable, isolated people.  That we've created a mainstream system designed to give propagandists a very loud voice unlike ever before and have yet to do anything substantial to stop that.  Deepfakes are just one more unregulated and toxic aspect allowed to be spread freely on major social media websites who don't care about your well-being.  Because they don't.  Their only goal is to keep you engaged, to keep you sharing information, whether or not it's true, and clicking on content.  And the best way to do that is to bombard you with emotional stimulation, be it in the form of outrage or complete and total hogwash, objectively the worst kind of wash.  It doesn't matter to them.  And if it weren't for the public outrage, they would happily fill your timeline with Nazi stuff if it got them more views.  And... Sometimes that's what they still do.  And I guess we can't blame them for being a business, but we sure as can regulate them due to health concerns, which is what this is.  I know it's easy to feel like Facebook and Twitter are your friends, something you've been intimate with for a long time and probably even helped you out in your darkest of times.  Lord knows it's great for self-promotion and connecting with loved ones.  But somewhere down the line, something very sinister took over.  like it took it took the face took Facebook off like the face of Facebook came off and switched with the villain.  and we've been trusting it this whole time and had no idea that that that the face came off.  like that movie the circle.  you remember that movie.  remember the circle.  it's just like that.  I haven't seen the circle. ",
