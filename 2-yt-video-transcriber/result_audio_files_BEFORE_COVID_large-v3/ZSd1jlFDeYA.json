            "text": "all right good morning good evening good afternoon ladies and gentlemen citizens of youtube.  this is pastor dowell.  i told you it was going to happen.  i knew it was going to happen and i knew it was coming.  and now that it's here now we can see the underlying motive of the reason why a lot of these politicians and those in the upper echelon want to do whatever they can to take the guns out of americans hands.  let me say this before i start.  in this video and this is a news source posted by the washington post Who is going to police the police?  Well, an armed sentencing is going to police the police because the police is not going to police the police.  As a matter of fact, every man back in the day used to be his own particular sovereign and he didn't need any police and he didn't need no government to tell him what was right and what was wrong and how to lawfully defend.  Here it is.  Headline, Washington Post.  At least 24 officers injured in Memphis unrest after U.S.  Marshals fatally shoot young black man.  All right, I want to see how people are going to spin this one.  Let me put my peeps on right here so we don't miss nothing on this one.  Here it is.  All right.  Also, June 12th, brothers.  News that a US Marshal Service officer had fatally shot a young black man in Memphis triggered chaotic protests late Wednesday that caused widespread property damage and left at least two dozen police officers injured by thrown concrete rocks.  Let me be clear, the aggression shown towards our officers and deputies tonight was unwarranted.  Said Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland, stop, time out.  Okay, I understand that.  But what about the aggression that is shown against American citizens that end up in fatalities?  You know, people losing their lives because of the misjudgment of allegedly so-called trained officers, who I might add is never designed to protect you.  The police is not designed to protect you.  I know that many times you seek to serve and protect, but that protection is for themselves and not you.  They are not, according to law, designed to protect you.  So I understand his perspective and point of view, but I also understand the perspective and point of view of citizens who are dying disproportionately because of the miscalculation and misjudgment of untrained police officers.  So let me go on with this.  Other local politicians, though, urged patience and demanded a thorough investigation into the killing.  The community wants answers into tonight's incident, says State Rep.  Antonio Parkinson, Democrat.  who also called for a complete transparency in the investigation of tonight's officers involved shooting.  Now, you know, you've got the police investigating the police.  You have the people in the same system investigating allegedly the police.  And that's the reason why too many times more often than not, we see these people constantly getting off the hook because they are paid by the same government extorting taxes from us, the citizens, to pay their paycheck, and then people die on the street shooting a young black man.  I wonder what it was.  I wonder what it was.  We don't know everything, but let's go on.  The shooting happened around 7 p.m.  Wednesday night in Fraser, a neighborhood less than five miles north of downtown Memphis.  The man killed, who was identified by family members, a local officer, or local officials, as 20-year-old Brandon Webber.  was being served multiple felony warrants by U.S.  Marshal Service Gulf Coast Region Fugitive Task Force and other law enforcement agencies, according to the police.  All right, now they say it's multiple, what was it, fugitives warrants, felony warrants.  Okay, we don't know, do we?  We don't know the story.  This is what they say.  I mean, you get a felony today just by disobeying a police officer.  So what is it?  Am I... Going against the police?  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  But I'm telling you what, something is to be said about the response of the people in Memphis.  Because whatever they are reporting is totally different than the action that is being taken by the people.  That's why I hold reservations allegedly for the official story of the report.  Weber rammed into the marshal's car and then displayed a weapon, said Callie McAllister, a spokeswoman of Tennessee Bureau of Investigation in a news conference early Thursday.  She added that it was unclear how many marshals had fired at the 20-year-old.  The Memphis Police Department said none of its officers were involved in the shooting.  This remains a very fluid situation, McAllister told the Washington Post.  Demetric Skinner, a cousin of Weber, of Shelby County Commissioner Tammy Sawyer, each said that Weber was shot as many as 20 times before dying in his front yard, according to the Daily Memphian.  Yolanda Holmes, his aunt, told the Daily Memphian that the family was trying to confirm what exactly happened.  This is crazy, Skinner's cousin, his cousin, told the outlet.  Early on Wednesday night, a man who claimed to be close to Weber posted a video to Twitter of him confronting police officers that had formed a barricade in the streets.  My cousin down there, lying in the street, the man yelled, laying in the yard.  As the night fell, the news of the shooting began to spread through.  Frazier protests broke out, resulting in a standoff between authorities and hundreds of inflamed residents.  On one side, police stood shoulder to shoulder holding riot shields, and on the other, were angry crowds shouting at officers.  Some protesters hurled bottles, rocks, bricks, police said.  In one instance, captured on social media, protests used a chair to smash out the back window of a police car.  Another man appears to spit at officers.  Police eventually fired tear gas into the area, which dispersed the crowd.  A late night rainstorm furthered empty the streets.  In a statement released early Thursday, Strickland said that at least 24 officers and deputies were injured, with six taken into the hospital for treatment.  He added that two journalists were also injured.  WREG's Luke Jones said that he was knocked to the ground after a man ran up to him and punched him in the head, while Rebecca Butcher of Local 24 News tweeted that her photographer was hit by someone in the crowd.  Strickland said multiple police cars were also vandalized, a concrete wall outside of a business was torn down, windows were broken.  At the local fire station, the mayor praised first responders.  I'm impressed by their professionalism and incredible restraint as they endured concrete rocks being thrown at them and people spitting at them, he said in a Facebook post.  A community of national leaders called for healing and justice.  The NAACP said it was closely monitoring reports out of Fraser.  Sawyer, a Democrat and progressive activist who is running for mayor in October election, pleaded for the public not to pass judgment on Fraser without asking a community how it feels to mourn their youth over and over again.  Why do people or what people do with their pain and trauma When it gets to be too much, when the city has ignored them, when their loss is too great and they can no longer yell at the sky, she asked.  But sadness and anger served as the overwhelming feelings for community activist.  Hunter Dempster told the Memphis Commercial Appeal that Wednesday night shooting should serve as a reminder of a broken public safety system.  Every time I turn around, I saw another person in tears, in their eyes, with tears in their eyes, furious at another life lost, Dempster said.  Well, anyway, I've got my own particular sentiments about this, and I guess you could say that I can understand the people side of the story because we always supposed to exercise restraint and all this other stuff, but the same judgment or the same attitude or the same things that we supposed to be doing, the police don't have it.  Am I fond of the police?  Not quite.  I really truly am not.  I'm fond of professional police officers who know that their duty is to defend the Constitution and who know how to do their jobs.  But as we say, there's always some bad apples falling for it all.  I don't know this whole story.  I just know what they report that the police said.  And how many times have they reported what the police said only to find out that the spin is in?  Now, I'm telling you.  And I know what a lot of people are going to say.  The first thing they're going to do is they're going to rust the judgment and condemn all the protesters.  In Memphis, the police officers are fortunate that bullets wasn't flying all over the damn place.  Now, that is the truth, because I'm telling you, I told you already years ago, when black men, young black men, young black boys was dying at the hands of the police officers, officers and different types of law enforcement, that there's going to be a retaliation by gunfire.  And we've seen that in Dallas.  We saw that in California.  And we're seeing people that, man, emotions are running high.  And this is the reason why they want the firearms out of the citizenry's hands.  Just like Edward Longshanks over in Braveheart, they don't want you to be able to defend yourself from all enemy, foreign and domestic, even if it's the so-called government or the law enforcement officers.  But, so, excuse me, I'll give you some of my thoughts.  I don't know the whole story.  I just reported it, and I inserted my opinion, just like the news media inserts their opinion.  And, hey, you can either choose to hear it or not.  After all, all it is is just an opinion.  But I wanted to get out here and report this because that's just the truth.  That's true straight away.  Stuff is happening. ",
