Through the grace of God, it did.  And guess why?  That's because I know my right facts.  When you know something, you can't do nothing.

Was I fearful for my life?  Yes.  Am I still fearful for my life?  Yes.  This is a dangerous game that I'm playing.  People get mad when they look stupid.  I got these cops all over the world looking crazy.  Looking crazy.  Looking crazy.  Looking like they tuck their tail.  Yes, I'm afraid for my life.  Will I still stand up for myself?  You damn right.  Every time. ",
