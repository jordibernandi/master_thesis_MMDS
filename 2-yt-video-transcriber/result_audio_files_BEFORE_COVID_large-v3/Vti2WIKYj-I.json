            "text": "I don't care what you heard.  I'm not slacking.  My name is Alan Roberts.  This is Every Day Fitness.  Like, subscribe, click the notification bar over there.  Share my video.  Subscribe to my second channel, Alan Roberts.  And my opinion, of course, is going to be the bum blow at the end.  Thank you very much.  That was Chris Heria of Official Thenix and of Chris Heria Music and Chris Heria everything.  And for those of you that are new to the channel, I'm going to do a little recap.  You see, last year, about this time, I made a few videos on Mr.  Heria because he is an amazing bar athlete.  And Anything where his hands are the focus, like if he's doing pull-ups or if he's doing handstands or handstand push-ups or planches, all that stuff, he is absolutely amazing, great athlete.  If he's on his feet, he's barely an intermediate.  I would still call him almost a beginner from looking at the video we're about to talk about.  He is not an athlete on his feet.  He's thin, lean.  His nutrition information is what got him in view with me.  because he was doing videos on how to target belly fat and arm fat.  There was an arm fat video on the Thenx channel, and the belly fat one is hilarious.  And I pretty much said it was a shame that he was giving advice because he has no idea what the fuck he's talking about.  He got really triggered and called me an old, bald, fat, salty clout chaser who needs to do his workouts because I'm out of shape and blah, blah, blah.  Meanwhile, when it would come to anything on our feet, this kid would be my bitch, 10 out of 10.  He made a video on the Chris Heria channel.  The video we're talking about here is on the Chris Heria channel.  Pretty much trying to come back at me and a few other people and Austin Dunham and a few other people.  That video you can't find because he pulled that video because he basically showed himself to be a fucking idiot again.  And the, his, the Fenix fans, thousands of them coming over to my channel.  Well, you just are jealous of him and blah, blah, blah.  And you, you probably can't even do a pistol squad or you probably can't blah, blah, blah.  You can't do this pull-ups, but you can't do this.  You can't do that.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Uh, and then this happened.  And that's when thousands of 13- to 17-year-old Chris Heria fans shut the fuck up in unison because they realized that Chris really is just kind of intermediate on his feet.  And I left it alone because, very frankly, point proven, and saying he's dumb over and over again is not going to make him any smarter, and it's not going to point out any more that he's dumb.  We've proven that with Vince from V-Shreds.  How you doing, Vince?  But I saw a video on my buddy James Winker from Treaded Sports Science, and I'm going to link that above at the end.  You should go watch that because Chris still has been doing some stupid shit.  I don't understand why this young man talks about being, you know, talks about squats under a barbell and deadlifts and shit like that when he clearly, as you can see here, clearly has no fucking idea what he's talking about.  And to... What makes this worse, what makes this really, really, really bad is nobody that watches Chris Heria's channel is advanced enough to really do his workouts, in my opinion.  Anybody advanced enough to do his workouts don't need Chris Heria to do them.  He should not be talking about, you know, He did one on drop set squats where he had people stripping weights off the fucking sides while he was squatting.  This man barely can squat.  I mean, his squat form is dangerous for him, and he's got an incredibly strong back from all the pull-ups and shit like that.  But his fans, who are going to try to emulate this, I mean, and he even tells them to... It's fucking ridiculous.  This is why the fitness industry fails, people.  Because he's very popular and very stupid at the same time.  He really does not know what he's talking about.  And Chris, if you want to have a conversation about it, we abso-fucking-lutely can, by the way.  Because I know you're going to watch this because you get triggered like a motherfucker.  But he should not be giving this advice.  In this video, he's talking about adding bands to the lifts and shit like that.  Um, how about you learn to lift first, Chris?  How about you have your people learn to lift first?  Because you don't know what the fuck you're doing.  And if they copy your form on half this shit, they're going to get hurt anyway, let alone adding fucking bands to it.  I just, I find the whole video to be, it's like they're running out of ideas to make videos on.  So he's like, let's add bands to shit.  Like, it's obvious he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about with most of this shit.  For instance, he starts his entire workout with dumbbell curls. ",

And I find the best way to do this is to place a dumbbell right underneath you, tie the resistance band around it, and put it around your neck.  From this position, the resistance band should be giving you tension from the bottom straight down, forcing the muscles that are required to perform a pull-up to work twice as hard from the beginning all the way to the end.

It looks to be about a 70-pound dumbbell to me.  But he just doesn't seem to fucking understand this.  Chris, I've told you before, when you talk about weightlifting, with the cue cards that you read, you should have somebody that knows what the fuck they're talking about.  write those motherfuckers for you, because... Apparently, who you got doing it or yourself does not know what the fuck they're talking about.  Twice as hard.  There's no way to gear that.  Absolutely.  That involves the weight of the person that would be doing the pull-up that now has the elastic band around their neck with the vest on and connected to a dumbbell on the floor.  I mean, so if Harry weighs, it looks to be a 70-pound dumbbell.  and a 30 pound vest, that's 100 pounds.  So if he's pulling with more force than that, that dumbbell would still come off the ground, people.  It just would.  If it was twice as hard, if he weighs more than 100 pounds himself, because 100 plus 100 is 200, if he weighs more than 100 pounds himself, which he supposedly does, then the dumbbell would come off the ground.  It's just so fucking stupid. ",

But when you start to come back up, you're going to start to feel the increasing tension build back up, making it a lot more difficult to perform this move and making it harder to finish the rep.

            "text": "That gives me a migraine.  Holy fuck.  Just a few things for the official Thenx fans.  Um, because I don't want you to hurt yourselves.  I really, really don't.  First of all, put a fucking shirt on after you've done a couple exercises already and your back is going to be sweaty and shit and you're about to fucking put a load on top of your spine.  Put a fucking shirt on.  Um, if that load slips and you can't hold it up, you're going to tear your shoulders up at the fucking best just to be fucking real.  That's fucking stupid shit.  It really is.  That's fucking stupid shit.  I mean, I understand that Heria is literally a fucking nobody besides a kid that can do pull-ups without having his shirt off.  I fucking get that, Chris.  But don't fucking hurt people.  You're running the fucking risk of hurting people.  The bounce at the fucking bottom like that, like actually fucking showing your fans to bounce like that at the fucking bottom is fucking asinine.  Seriously, somewhere V-Stretch is going like, God damn, motherfucker, that's horrible.  I mean, how you doing, Vince?  How the fuck you been?  But I don't fucking understand why this boy thinks he knows what the fuck he's talking about.  I don't.  I don't get it.  This is dangerous shit.  It really, really is.  The fucked up thing is millions of people could watch that fucking video and be like, yeah, I need to try that shit.  That's fucked up.  We should hold ourselves more accountable as fitness people.  This is why people get turned off to fitness.  It really is.  Stupid shit like that.  Stupid shit where they see somebody that they think is really, really popular and knows what the fuck they're doing who has no fucking idea what they're fucking doing at all.  Give them instruction on something.  They go try it because they want to look just like that person.  And then they fuck themselves up and then they don't go back to fitness.  That's the fucking problem.  The problem with the fitness industry is that we are causing people to be unhealthy.  We're not helping people.  And I say we because unfortunately I'm fucking grouped in with you dumbass bitches.  That is fucking ridiculous.  It really, really is.  I don't understand why he wouldn't have somebody else in his videos that knows what the fuck they're doing.  ThenX should hire a fucking weightlifter.  Hire a fucking weightlifter.  They got a bunch of... Oh, this is on the Harriet channel.  That's right.  Fuck.  Well, Chris is too much of a fucking egomaniac to let anybody else fucking have the spotlight from what I hear.  A few other people have said stuff and made videos.  But anyway, I don't fucking get why he thinks he knows what the fuck he's talking about.  He talks about building muscle all the time.  He looks the fucking exact same he has, and he's a young guy for a long fucking time right now.  I'm happy he's shredded, and if that's the look you want, that's great.  That is way more a matter of your nutrition than it is of anything else.  Just fucking be real.  But let's be fucking real.  We need to have a better responsibility about not showing people dangerous, stupid shit.  This is dangerous, stupid shit from a kid that just doesn't seem to fucking learn his lesson no matter fucking what.  So, Chris, just my two cents on the matter.  Stay in your motherfucking lane and keep hanging from the fucking bar and shut your fucking hole when it comes to other shit.  And that's just my two cents on the matter.  My name is Alan Roberts.  Hit me up on Instagram at alanroberts.  Hit me up on Twitter.  I'm also on Facebook at Everyday Fitness.  And I'm on the Internet at everydayfitness.net.  God damn. ",
