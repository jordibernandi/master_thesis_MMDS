            "text": "all wrap it up.  so Jussie Smollett I'll tell you why he did it.  he really thought he was gonna get the support.  like Tupac he would be this beloved figure which is why he called himself the gay Tupac.  after reading off cue cards about the alleged event that didn't happen.  well the way he said it happened you know this marker country.  boo crap.  The man thought after this, his music career was gonna really take off.  Because see, his music ain't no little regular old music.  His music is political music.  Mm-hmm.  And if you look at his video, now I feel bad for you.  if you do, this stuff is trash.  Listen to the songs, trash.  But if you look at them, you'll see a video where there's an actual noose in the video.  This is before he made this claim of having the rope around his neck and leaving it on for 40 minutes.  This is before all that.  So there's already that bullcrap, that little story that he's painting for you.  And in that same song, he's talking about, oh, and they want to build a wall.  Sing it all ugly.  But see, he understands that.  That, hey, all you got to do is say you don't support Trump and then you're going to get all the support from across the board.  The media is going to support you.  And understand when I say the media is going to support you.  That's not to say, oh, Donald Trump must be against the system because the media coming after him.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  That's not how it works these days, Joker.  You see, he plays a role pretending to be anti-establishment right now, but Joker is still a puppet.  He's still got somebody's hand in his butt, just like Obama had.  So we had somebody had their hand in Obama's butt, the people who actually run things, and they switched it over to Trump, and they just put it right under there.  It's sick.  Nasty.  That's why I look at him so funny, but y'all, you don't see it.  So yeah, so he's not really anti-establishment, but they have to keep that going to get the people that are following him to think, oh yeah, we have to really fight.  We have to champion for him.  And then anytime Trump says something, then they're just going to support it anyways.  That's just for them.  Now, back to what Jussie is doing.  So Jussie is doing the Maxine Waters approach, where all you do is say, oh yeah, I don't like Trump, don't like Trump.  Y'all don't notice that?  Oh, I don't like Maga Hat.  No, I don't like Maga Hat.  And that's not even how she sound, but it sounds stupid, though.  I don't like Maga Hats.  Therefore, somehow Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez must be saying something that makes sense, which, you know, that don't make no sense.  So, yeah, that trick, Joker thought he was going to be on fire after this.  But then he just didn't think it through.  Joker, the man was talking about they had bleach in a hot sauce bottle.  What, Joker?  And then you got these people out here.  Wait a minute, what's wrong with y'all?  Still standing with Jesse.  Joker's talking about, you know, I'm gonna wait till Jesse says something about it.  Joker, we've heard from Jesse already.  Jesse is the same lion, Joker.  who held on to the Subway sandwich while he was getting beat down by two guys.  And then they poured bleach on him with a freaking hot sauce bottle.  And they, what the heck they do?  Shake the hot sauce bottle on top of the man?  Because look, the hot sauce don't come out so easy in that bottle.  So it's come out a little drip by drip.  I mean, that's so stupid.  And they recognize him off Empire.  Maga people.  Dumb.  Why would you listen to him?  What else is he going to say to you?  Is he going to start making sense?  No, he ain't.  So yeah, that's what he wanted.  That Joker thought he was going to be some heroic figure.  He know how easy it is for the media to just take somebody, prop them up just like they did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the same way they do Nancy Pelosi.  But it didn't work because his plan was too stupid.  Red, silver, J. All I gotta say. ",
