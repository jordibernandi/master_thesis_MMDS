            "text": "There's a video that came out of a father and mother very upset with Norton elementary school in Snellville, Georgia.  Now this father's upset because this is not the first time that they have lost their five year old child.  And I want you to hear the father and his anger with the whole situation.  But then we're going to talk about what happened afterwards because that's a little bit more upsetting than actually what you're hearing in the video.  No, no, no.  Can I explain to you, sir?  Can I just talk to you, explain to you?  What we do is, they have a big screen in their room, and when that bus comes up, we have adults all through the hallway here.  So, if y'all got adults all through the hallway, how did that happen for the third time?  Okay.  Not the first.  The first time, I was calm.  I was understanding, because I understood it could happen the second time.  I was mad, but I let it go.  The third time, my son called me from the bus, crying, screaming, talking about he don't know where his sister is.  I'm supposed to be at work, which is an hour away from where we live here in Snailville.  Now imagine if I went to work. ",
