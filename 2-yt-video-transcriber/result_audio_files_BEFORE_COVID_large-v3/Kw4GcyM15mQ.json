            "text": "So today's video is about someone that I truly, with every bit of my soul, never wanted to talk about again by the name of Onision, or as I call him, the pimple on the butt of YouTube.  He's basically the roach infestation that YouTube wants to do nothing about.  They won't even call on a exterminator for a quote.  You know what I mean?  They won't do anything about it.  And a lot of you guys, if you're new on this channel, which, hi if you're new, may not know about my history with this YouTuber.  I've debated this YouTuber over all of the allegations of predatory and inappropriate behavior with underage girls for which there's probably like hundreds of accusations at this point.  um it goes back years.  so just some of the predatory actions that come to mind in the past.  when it comes to greg if my memory is suiting me correctly which i know it is um greg was collecting pictures of underage girls in their underwear on his website.  in the past greg began dating his wife who is now i guess his husband because she transitioned.  He can't write this.  When his partner was underage and actually traveled across state lines to find states where it was legal to be intimate with them to avoid getting in trouble with the law.  I guess there are accusations of him putting girls in his basement against their will.  Like.  this is basically the R. Kelly of YouTube.  That's what you should be getting out of this.  But as of late, there's a lot of accusations and things going on with Onision that have made their way onto my timeline.  And a lot of you guys want me to talk about it and I'm totally down to talk about it.  So in this video, I'm going to go over the accusations of grooming of underage girls by Onision as well as interviewing a victim, an alleged victim.  And because I have received threats of legal action and cease and desist letters for every single video I've done in the past few months, no I'm not kidding and no I'm not exaggerating, I'm going to make a disclaimer that everything in this video is alleged.  all allegedly, and you are free to make up your own mind against all these public allegations.  From this girl named Sarah.  Sarah has recently blasted Onision and Onision's wife, who is now the husband, Kai, on Twitter and on social media saying that she was groomed by them from the age of 14 until she ultimately was in an intimate relationship with them four days after she turned 18.  Sarah was a fan and began tweeting Onision and his wife Lainey, who now goes by the name Kai, when she was only 13.  Eventually Onision and then Laineybot took notice of this and became friends with Sarah when she was only 14 years old and began texting inappropriate things, had a very inappropriate friendship.  These are both adults, keep in mind, becoming friends online and over text with this young girl.  Sarah alleges that when she was underage, she exchanged inappropriate graphic self images with Kai.  Sarah alleges that Kai described Onision's private parts to her at the age of 14.  And here's where things get even more messed up.  At the age of 16, after having an inappropriate, friendly relationship over text with Kai and Greg, Sarah actually moved in with them.  Sarah was going through personal family issues that led her to confide in Kai and Greg.  And shortly after, Kai and Greg decided that they would let Sarah move in at 16.  Sarah then of course lived with them, began appearing in YouTube videos with them, and speculation arose as to what exactly was going on with this underage girl living with this adult couple.  Sarah now says that this was a predatory relationship in which she was groomed to eventually become intimate with them once she turned 18.  So is it illegal?  Technically, no.  Is it creepy, manipulative, disturbing, and predatory to take a girl who is 15, 16 years old, going through family troubles, move them in, and then groom them from that age until 18, and then be intimate with them four days after she turns 18?  Yes, absolutely.  Now let's take a look at the interview I did with Sarah just this morning.  How old were you when you first started tweeting Onision and Onision's, at the time, wife, Lainey? ",
