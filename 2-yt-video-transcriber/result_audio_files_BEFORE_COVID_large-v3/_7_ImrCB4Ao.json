Every single bird is bipedal when walking on the ground.  In fact, the fastest extant biped is the ostrich, clocking in at 70 kilometers an hour.

And even if you were right, I fail to see how being bipedal is somehow evidence for a creator or evidence against evolution.  In fact, I would say that our transition to bipedalism left behind so many problems that it is actually great evidence for evolution.  There are a lot of band-aid solutions piled on top of each other to aid in survivability, but a redesign from scratch would have been a much better move.  Just look at our feet.  26 distinct individual bones.  This is a relic from our tree-dwelling ancestors who would have used their feet to grasp and climb.  This myriad of separate moving parts leads us to problems like collapsed arches, shin splints, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and more.  Our backs developed an S-shape to help us balance our heads, which results in chronic back pain, vertebrae fractures, herniated discs, and more.  Bipedalism is, quite literally, a pain. ",

Sure, sometimes you get the hands up looking up thing during worship services, but even then there's a tendency to throw your hands up and look down.  So we can look up and down.  But there are other animals that are better at looking up than us.  I mean, just look at rays.  They literally cannot look down.  They can only look up because of where their eyes are.  So does their upward facing countenance show that they were central to the mind of the creator?  They look up more than we do.  And birds, you know those other bipeds?  They can also look up.  So we've got bipedal with the ability to look up as evidence that we were central in God's mind so far.  Both apply perfectly to birds as well, though.

That number doesn't need to be that fine-tuned in order to sustain life itself.  It only needs to be fine-tuned to sustain stars that will be able to create carbon and spread that carbon out when they go supernova.  So if you want to have a universe that is only 6,000 years old, the gravitational constant doesn't matter that much.  Second, Robin Collins is a philosopher, yes, and he does have a scientific undergrad degree, but he never actually put that degree to use, focusing instead on philosophy, so to introduce him as a physicist-philosopher is rather disingenuous.  And thirdly, the gravitational constant has been observed to fluctuate by as much as three parts in ten trillion, so it doesn't seem that it's quite as fine-tuned as you were making it out to be.  Though admittedly, I did arrive at that number by looking at the chart of the gravitational constant's fluctuations and counting zeros, and I am notoriously bad at counting zeros, so I could have used the wrong label there, but I'm pretty sure you have to go quite a few more zeros down before you get to that one part in a hundred million billion billion billion billion billion.  And if I recall correctly, that number actually comes from Stephen Hawking's book, A Brief History of Time, and it was about the value of the gravitational constant one second after the Big Bang.  being that specific to the result in the universe that we see.  The fundamental constants were different during the time surrounding the Big Bang, so that wouldn't necessarily have been the number that we ended up with.  And if I counted my zeros properly, it fluctuates outside that specificity quite regularly.  So again, you're using an argument that assumes the universe is billions of years old, and that the Big Bang is a fact, in order to support your idea that the universe was created 6,000 years ago. ",

Today's comment of the day comes to us from Jim Yost, who says, When Solomon was a young man, the Lord told him he was giving him an anointing to be the wisest man who ever lived for all time.  1 Kings 3.12, King James Version.  Many years later, when Solomon was an old man, he made the statement that a fool's voice is known by a multitude of words.  Ecclesiastes 5.3. then about three thousand years later another wise man made this statement to the intelligent man or woman the world is infinitely interesting and mysterious but the stupid have an answer for every question.  edward abbey.  yep that sounds an awful lot like creationism to me.  i'm comfortable with saying i don't know.  when it comes to things like what came before the big bang how did the fundamental constants end up with the values that they have?  What are the specifics of abiogenesis?  And stuff like that.  But it tends to be the creationists who insist that they have an answer to these questions, despite their answer being completely untestable.  So there you have it.  The Bible says to stop being a creationist.  It makes you look foolish.  Links to social media and ways to support the channel are in the description, as well as my PO Box address.
