            "text": "But now when Malcolm was turned around by the teaching of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, he was an articulate spokesperson for Elijah Muhammad's ideas which he gained from Master Farad Muhammad and which he also was nurtured by the groundwork laid by Marcus Garvey and Noble Drew Ali.  Now black people in America had a voice, a powerful voice to articulate our hurt, our pain, our suffering, to use the words of Brother True Mathematics, our infuriation, our anger.  Malcolm spoke to that anger.  And for the first time, you saw white folks cringing.  What is this X that you're wearing?  Why X?  I mean, it's so strange.  Why true mathematics?  Why?  What is that?  I mean, you so used to Harry Jones.  Larry Witherspoon, Lucinda Zonka.  Somebody come up with Mr.  X, that blows your mind.  Black folk listening, I wonder how you gonna answer that?  Malcolm explained that X in mathematics stands for the unknown.  He said, my last name is unknown.  to me because when you took our fathers from Africa you stripped us of our names and the name that you gave us does not belong to us as a people.  those are your people's names.  so I'm not your slave.  now I'm free.  so I should give up your slave name and then qualify myself to wear one of the righteous names of God and I was intelligent.  This ex is not so dumb after all.  Then Malcolm started saying that the white man was the devil.  Now wait a minute.  Now this really shook up white folks and black folks too.  Black folk used to get under the bed with their radios.  After they had locked all the doors, pulled down the shade, turned off all the lights, got a flashlight, got under the bed, then pulled a heavy blanket over their heads and said, Why did we act like that?  We would petrify the white folks.  How could that nigga talk like that?  Still be living, love.  Somebody gonna kill him, but I sure like what he's saying.  You come out the next day acting as though you didn't hear anything.  Get on the job and ease into the latrine and say, did you hear that Malcolm Z?  I didn't want to say nothing, but I heard that nigga too.  He's crazy.  Now all of a sudden a black man talking like that, then other black people say, hey, he's living.  He's getting away with it.  Then now a lion is in you that have found a door.  Now the door busts open and another lion jump out.  Start roaring.  And white folks say, good God from Zion, the niggas is going to get up.  Now whether you know it or not, The word of Elijah Muhammad in the mouth of Malcolm X affected a general awakening of the masses of our people.  Everybody didn't love what Malcolm was saying, but everybody was affected by what he was saying.  To heck with what you love.  What is the effect?  And the effect was white folk began to shake in the 60s.  They began to look at their cooks.  at their maids, at their butlers.  And if the food tasted just a little funny, they would run and put their finger down their throat.  I know them niggas is poisoning us.  They began to understand that something was happening in America and that black people would never, never be the same again.  And they feared this movement.  And right here on Howard's campus in the early 60s, Malcolm went to Harvard University, Yale University, but he had his eye on Howard all the time.  Naturally, this being a government sponsored and run institution.  And even the strongest of the professors have to be cool.  Even if they like what you're saying, they pat their toes.  Because they don't want white folks to hear that they like what you're saying.  But if Harvard could accept him, and Yale could accept him, and Radcliffe could accept him, then he could be accepted at Howard.  And when it came to Howard, there in the audience was young Stokely Carmichael.  And Howard became the mecca of a new revolutionary spirit!  All of a sudden now, the campus of Howard was alive!  The men who were Alphas, the men who were Kappas, the men who were Omegas, the men who were Sigmas, the women who were Deltas and AKAs, all of a sudden the Greek letter people looked up from their parties.  And they said something is happening and they joined a movement.  And Howard began to affect the thinking of black, the thinking of black campuses all over America.  Because whether you know it or not, Howard, Howard is to the colleges of black America like Harlem is to black people.  Whatever trend you set, that's what is set in all colleges throughout America.  You want to party?  You want to boogie?  You want to get high?  You want to lay down?  You want to pop pills?  Then pretty soon all black America think that that's the end thing to do because they take their lead from you.  All right.  I'm almost finished.  Bear with me.  Now, beloved, the movement started in the 60s, a powerful movement.  It hit the churches with Martin Luther King, with H. Rapp Brown, Stokely Carmichael, James Farmer, James Foreman.  It hit the literary field.  It struck our artists.  And Eartha Kitt began to speak boldly.  Our artists began to challenge white folks, even in the White House.  All of a sudden, a movement had caught on.  And everybody that was a Negro just a few years ago began to talk about black and blackness.  A movement, a genuine movement, had begun.  But notice, Martin Luther King was on one side preaching integration.  Malcolm and the honorable Elijah Muhammad were on the other side preaching separation.  The church joined the integration movement, but the integration movement was spawned by white folk.  They recognized that you were on the rise and they did not want you to gravitate toward any separatist movement.  So the bourgeois intellectual element, like a true slave, always wants to be included in the master's domain.  They never want to go out and go for themselves, even though it may bring a future for their people.  They decided, we're going to get into the mainstream of white American life.  Dear Brother Martin Luther King, Many of you who watch them on television saw him marching.  You saw him close down that bus company in Montgomery.  You saw him march from Selma.  You saw white folks put fire hose on him, sick dogs on him, cattle prod him, put the women in jail, rape them, beat them.  Is that right?  And many of us were children, or you were children, I'm just including myself with you.  We're sitting back looking at TV.  You saw him being hit with fire hoses, and little baby said, never mind.  You're saying, fight, man.  Why don't you fight?  This is what you're saying behind the TV.  You go out on the corner with your reefer hanging out your mouth.  I say, man, them niggas is crazy.  Nigga hit me on my cheek, Jim.  I'm gonna take his whole head.  Now look, brother, this is spawning now another kind of thought.  Here's integration on one side, separation on another, and coming up in between is revolution.  Just look at it, brother.  You can't say, I don't like Malcolm, I like Elijah.  Or I don't like Dr.  King, I like Malcolm.  You got to look at the whole thing.  And the whole thing says every one of them made a contribution to where we stand right now.  There are finer details that we can get into at another time.  To deal with who did what, when, and why.  Because history affords us the golden opportunity to look back on men's lives and see mistakes while men who live their lives cannot see from your vantage point.  And that's why the legacy of greatness is always left to history to give you and not for you to give yourself.  Hold on.  Everybody with me.  Let's move this to its conclusion.  Now Martin Luther King, he said he would wear down white folk with love.  He was going to overpower their hate with his love.  These are his words.  He didn't want to be the brother-in-law of white folks, meaning he didn't want the law to make us brothers.  He wanted us and white folk to truly be brothers.  And I'm sure that's the sentiment of a lot of you.  But the question is... Can you do it?  We're going to deal with that.  We've got to deal with it.  Because we don't want to waste time searching for things that don't exist.  All right, let's move on.  Let's move on.  Now here's Dr.  King over here.  Malcolm over here.  Elijah Muhammad.  Now Malcolm breaks from Elijah Muhammad.  And he moves away from Elijah Muhammad into what is called Orthodox Islam.  And then Malcolm spawns a revolutionary movement.  Now you've got the separatists, the integrationists, and the revolutionists.  Then you have the Panther Party coming up.  All right.  That's a marvelous movement of young black brothers and sisters.  You may not have soldiered with the Panthers, but recognize what they meant to us.  Young black men standing there with rifles.  And they look mean, brother.  They didn't look like they ever smiled.  Fred Hampton, Mark Clark, just look at the cream of young black revolutionary crop.  The Soledad brothers.  This is the finest young black men that we produced.  They didn't die in vain, beloved.  They died that they could leave to us the legacy of their struggle, that we may study their struggle and extract from it the principles that we're going to use in the 80s.  Because the 80s promise great things for those who are wise.  But it promises death for those who are foolish.  So who helped?  Even wise men die, but they don't die the death of a fool.  A fool is dead before he dies.  So he dies twice.  I'll explain that at a later time.  Let's move on.  Now look, beloved, white folks sitting here watching this thing.  Martin Luther King now sees that he was a Negro leader.  Martin Luther King looks over at Vietnam, he says, uh-oh.  He says, the same people that are oppressing my people here are oppressing the Vietnamese there.  Martin Luther King steps out of a safe Negro position into a sure enough Dangerous position.  even like Peter getting out of the boat trying to walk on the water brother Martin Luther King stepped out and condemned America's policy in Vietnam.  now look brother and sister you may not appreciate what Martin Luther King did but But the man made a step that said, our struggle is not national.  Our struggle is international.  And our struggle is not just tied to us, but it's tied into every oppressed people on the earth.  So he was helping to broaden our vision.  Broaden our horizon.  Not that Marcus Garvey didn't say this 30 years earlier.  Not that Elijah Muhammad didn't say it.  But for Martin Luther King to say it.  From the position that he had once took.  This was indeed revolutionary.  And the government said something has to happen to this man.  The government said... And I repeat, the government said it.  And the government of America has been the number one destroyer of every meaningful black man and woman who would lead us to freedom, justice, and equality. ",
