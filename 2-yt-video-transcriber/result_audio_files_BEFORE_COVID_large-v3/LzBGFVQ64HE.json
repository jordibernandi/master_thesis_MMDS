And he's talking about a woman named Linda Fairstein, a longtime New York City prosecutor.  She was a sex crimes prosecutor.  She didn't exactly prosecute their case officially, but she oversaw the interrogation.  And if you saw When They See Us, or if you saw the PBS documentary on the Central Park Five, you know a lot about her and know that she played a huge part.  in putting these five at the time little boys behind bars.  And now the series on Netflix, Ava DuVernay's docu-series, it's not really a docu-series, just a drama series about the Central Park Five.  There's new backlash, renewed backlash against Fairstein and she has been dropping out of board.  She's been sitting on these boards for years and now she's resigning.  There are reports that she's being pushed from these boards.  But we do know.  on Tuesday, the president of Vassar College actually posted a letter on its website saying Fairstein had resigned as a Board of Trustees member, saying this.  I am told that Ms.  Fairstein felt that given the recent widespread debate over her role in the Central Park case, She believed that her continuing as a board member would be harmful to Vassar.  And the victim services agency, Safe Horizon, also confirmed Fairstein's resignation on Tuesday, thanking her for decades of pioneering work on behalf of victims of sexual assault.  An abuse, Fairstein said she was forced to act due to what she's calling mob mentality reaction to the Netflix series.  Which led to hashtag cancel Linda Fairstein, a movement on social media that included pledges to withhold donations to Safe Horizon.  And she says each of these organizations does great work.  She said it's so foolish of bullies to punish the charity.  She also called it totally pigheaded and stupid.  Here's the other side of this, because a former Safe Horizon employee said Fairstein's involvement had long been a contentious issue among staffers, but that repeated complaints to the agency's leadership were ignored.  And there's a little bit more to this, but I wanna get your thoughts. ",

Where one of them will do something that's obviously unethical, immoral, damaging to a certain group of people or a specific person.  And then once they face the consequences, the rightful consequences for those actions, they'll go ahead and brush aside the critics as, they're part of a mob mentality.  Here's the thing.  All things dark come to light.  That is one of my favorite quotes.  I don't know who originally said it, but it's true.  What happened to those young men was absolutely disgusting.  It destroyed their lives, period.  It destroyed their lives.  And more importantly, okay, when you look at our entire justice system, What happened to those young men is not uncommon.  It's not an isolated incident.  And there is a systemic issue that needs to be dealt with and it needs to be dealt with immediately.  There is a two tier justice system.  We do have a problem with targeting innocent people of color and putting them behind bars when they have not committed a crime.  And what that does is not only ruin their lives, but it also allows the real culprit to go out there and commit more crimes, more rape, more murder.  And that is certainly what happened in this case.

She doesn't want to take any type of accountability or responsibility for what she did.

And she wanted everyone involved, she wanted to hear, she wanted to be able to talk to everyone involved.  I think most of this was built upon the actual facts and then firsthand accounts of the experiences of these men who were children at the time.  Ava actually said, she reached out to Linda Fairstein, and Linda Fairstein tried to negotiate.  She said, I don't know if I've told anyone this, but she tried to negotiate conditions for her to speak with me, including approvals over the script and some other things.  So you know what my answer was to that, we didn't talk.  So she had an opportunity to somewhat play a part in this and to be honest and to be sorry, and she didn't.  And Raymond Santana, you saw him earlier in this segment, but we're gonna go back to him.  He's talking about a little bit about how she has not apologized.  She has continuously repeated the same narrative.  There has been no correction on her behalf whatsoever.  She has actually changed her story, I think, at one point to saying, okay, yes, DNA proves Mateus Reyes was at the scene and committed the rape, but I think those other boys were involved.  What?  It's ridiculous, but take a look at what else he has to say. ",
