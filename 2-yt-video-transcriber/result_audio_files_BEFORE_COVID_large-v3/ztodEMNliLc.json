            "text": "Guys, welcome back to another episode of Atlas Survival Shelters.  I hope you all had a beautiful Christmas and a happy New Year.  Now, just a few days ago, I put out a video called, This $150,000 Bomb Shelter is Nice Inside Atlas 10x33 Culvert with Generator Pod.  And ironically, in the video, it says something about the vouchers expiring on January 1st.  So I'm going to answer some questions real quick.  People say, why did you put out a video on January 3rd where you talk about a voucher expiring on January 1st?  Just a reminder to you guys, those of you who got that $10,000 voucher when I hit the 100,000 subscribers here on YouTube, you've got until January 1st to use that.  So I'm just reminding you guys, don't forget, don't waste that voucher.  And the simple answer is that that video was made and edited in early December.  And it was getting ready to be released, and my YouTube editor that's been making all my videos was in my office, walked out of here, and somebody put a gun to his head and killed him, murdered him, dead on the spot.  So, this is why I haven't been bringing you guys any videos the last few weeks.  We're a little messed up around here right now.  We're running a little scared.  We do not know who killed Joe.  We do not know why somebody killed Joe.  We don't know if it was related to this channel.  But I'm going to tell you what I do know.  But I have been asked by the L.A.  PD the detectives that are investigating this whole thing to not say too much because they know I have a YouTube channel and they ask me please don't give too much away because when we catch the murder there might be some things we just don't want them to know.  but I will tell you this much and I will tell you more as more videos come out and as I told things that I can basically make public.  But me and Joe were sitting in the office, and we were making and editing the video called This $150,000 Bomb Shelter is Nice Inside.  And about 5.15, It was starting to get dark outside.  So I was like, hey, you know what?  I got some dinner plans tonight, Joe.  I'm going to leave.  He goes, well, this video's not uploading.  It was slow.  My Wi-Fi was slow that night.  So he said, can you leave me a key and I'll lock up.  And I said, sure, I'll leave you a key and I'll just see you tomorrow morning because we're going to come back in and do some more editing on Sunday morning.  So I leave and we have security cameras in the office and my neighbor has security cameras next door.  So I leave around 5.15 because that's what the cameras told us.  And about 7.30, well let me back up.  So when I left here, We are right here on this road where there's a lot of people walking on the sidewalk, and when my door is left open, we often worry about somebody just walking in this office and robbing us, okay?  It's been a fear for a long time.  So when I left, it was right before dark.  The headlights were on the cars, the door was left open like you see right here.  I got in my car and I left.  Well, I guess about two hours later, walked out of here, and that's where the story kind of ends as far as what we know.  All we know is he was driven about five miles away from here, or he drove about five miles away from here, and somebody just shot him point blank in the head.  Didn't rob him, didn't steal his car, didn't really do anything.  It's a murder him.  So a lot was going through my mind.  At first, it's like, well, what happened here?  I mean, I don't understand this.  So immediately, I called my secretary when the detectives called me because I didn't know this for two days.  So I showed up the next morning at like 9.30 to meet Joe here, and he wasn't here.  And I'm like, God dang it, he went out and got drunk and he's hungover, okay?  So I was texting him, texting him, texting him, calling him, he's not answering.  I called my secretary, said, email Joe, it's like, is he hungover sleeping at his friend's house or something like that?  I don't know because he's done it before.  And I had a flight that afternoon and I was like, you know what?  I waited outside here for two and a half hours.  He didn't show up.  So I just went ahead and changed my flight, took an early flight to Dallas.  So that evening I was texting him and calling him.  He's not answering his phone.  And then I started worrying.  These thoughts go through your mind.  Okay, this is not like Joe now.  I left the door open.  That kind of bugged me.  I hope he got up and closed the door.  What if somebody walked in off the street?  and held him up and made him drive him five miles down the road, okay?  Well, we have security, but the door was locked.  So, we're thinking, okay, Joe wouldn't have locked the door if he's being held up.  So, what if he walked outside, went to his car, and somebody caught him because it's dark out here.  I mean, and we're in Montebello.  This is like East LA, guys.  And at night, you just don't want to be caught here.  So, what if somebody caught him in his car, drove him five miles, and then just shot him?  Well, that makes no sense.  Okay?  And it makes no sense where he was found dead.  He was found dead five minutes from here in East L.A.  And he lives in Palmdale, which is like an hour away down the I-5.  So, we're trying to figure this out.  And then, we're trying to... Then I'm starting... Then things are really getting to me.  It's like, well, what if... What if somebody was trying to get me?  What if somebody was... wanting to kill me and it was dark and they walked outside?  and so I'm starting to think, who wants me dead?  And why would they want me dead?  Well, if you watch my channel, you know that I do some controversial videos and I pretty much go after anybody.  that's bad or bad to the people in the prepper industry.  If you're a food company and you do a bad job, I will blast you.  If you do anything bad, if you make a bad bunker or if you do something bad, if you do anything bad to my people, which is the prepper industry, I'm going to blast you.  Because this channel, which started off just to save my business because I had a competitor that was doing everything to block me from getting business.  In the self-defense of my business, I created a YouTube channel.  And thank God I did because it saved my business.  But in the making of my videos, people started seeing my videos and they started calling me and saying, hey, I got a shelter from this company or I did business with this company and the owner was a snitch and he ratted me out and I went to prison and all this stuff.  So now I'm sitting there thinking, Do you think that guy, because I have had people call me from his area saying, you better watch out.  This is a bad guy.  I can't say exactly what they said, but he's a bad guy and he will do bad things to you.  So I'm starting to worry that the same thing you guys, my fans or the people following my channel were, what if that guy is trying to have you killed?  I'm like, man, that's just so far out there.  I just, I don't know he would do that.  But then Lo and behold, a woman calls me after the murder, before anybody even knows about it, and says, listen, I know this guy.  He's bad news.  You're right about the things that you said.  You better watch out.  And I said, well, ma'am, And ironically enough, my YouTube editor was just murdered.  And we don't know what it was.  We don't know if somebody had him killed, if it was a fluke robbery, if he walked out this door and somebody abducted him.  Or if he went and got lost in East LA and somebody just says, hey, why are you in my neighborhood?  And just walks up and shoots him in the head while he's sitting in his car.  So all kinds of things are going through my head.  So I don't really... No yet.  And the detectives won't tell me a lot.  Okay?  But as I get things, I'll let you know.  So that's why I wanted to explain to you guys why I haven't put out any videos lately.  Because my YouTube editor was killed.  But I have a temporary guy in here.  As you can see right here, this guy's in here helping me edit some YouTube videos.  So guys... When you have a small YouTube channel like mine, and I'm paying people to edit, I don't make any money doing these videos.  If anything, it costs me a lot of time and money, but I do it to bring you entertainment.  I try to highlight my product, and I try to show you a difference between right or wrong.  But I'm trying to survive here.  Sometimes, even last week, I had a guy who wanted to buy a bomb shelter from me, and he goes, well, I only have this much money.  Well, how many is in your family?  It's like... He's like, there's five.  I'm like, well, that bunker won't do it.  I'm like, well, I'll tell you what.  I'll sell you the bigger bunker for the smaller bunker price.  I won't make you probably a penny on the job, but you know what?  It's about doing the right thing.  That's what this channel's been about.  It's been about bringing you guys the truth.  so you would know the truth and make the right decisions.  I'm going to open a Patreon account.  I'm going to put a link right below this video.  If you want me to continue to bring videos or if you could help me, pledge a dollar a month or two dollars a month or five dollars, ten, whatever you can help.  But the money that you pledge is going to be used in the defense because some of the people are making the videos about the bad videos and the bad bunkers, they're suing me.  They don't want me to bring you the truth.  So they're suing me and these attorneys are expensive and unfortunately, For me, I don't have an attorney in the family, but they do.  So they have a family member that protects them on everything.  They could do anything and she's going to protect them, whether it's right or wrong.  She's an attorney and she protects her clients and her family.  So it's not costing them hardly anything.  And of course, a lot of people are suing that bad company for what they've done.  And I just wish the federal authorities would do their job and investigate people who take large amounts of cash for underground bomb shelters and are doing things.  I mean, I just don't know where the IRS and the federal authorities are at.  I wish they would just do their job, you know.  I mean, if I could have one thing.  But guys, pray for Joe.  Pray for Atlas Survival Shelters.  Pray for my safety because, you know, I wear my video, I mean, I wear my mega hat, and I'm always joking like this.  We made it to Los Angeles without anybody killing us.  So, my friend over here.  Hi, guys.  Let's make the Americans great again.  Luckily, there ain't nobody behind me to kill me today.  All right, guys.  Well, we made it back to the USA from Canada without anybody killing me with my mega hat on.  Now, we just got to get to the airport and home, and we're good.  Yeah.  I joke about nobody's killed me yet.  Well... Man, I hope the country hasn't gone to a point where we're just assassinating people and we're killing people because they don't like us.  And keep in mind, guys, we're a sharply divided nation.  I am a true conservative gun-owning Christian, and I will die that way.  But there are people that hate me for being a Christian gun-owner conservative, okay, and for wearing a MAGA hat, okay?  I wear a MAGA hat through the airport all the time.  I get more thumbs up.  And the myth that minorities hate Trump has been busted.  I get more minorities.  tell me, I like your hat.  I don't know where the fake news comes off on saying that they have all the minority vote.  They have a lot of it, but let me tell you what.  If you are smart, you're going to vote for the right, no matter if you hate or like Donald Trump, okay?  If you're uneducated, I guess you're going to vote for the left.  But guys, please, on the left, have an open mind.  Look at unemployment.  Look at lower taxes.  Look at less regulation.  Look at just the better country we can have, okay?  Four more years and Donald Trump ain't going to kill you, okay?  But I'll tell you what can kill you.  Four years of somebody like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, that would be disastrous for this country.  We would turn into a socialist country.  So pray for America, too.  But we will not stop doing what we are doing on this channel, which is bringing you the truth, bringing you products, doing reviews.  But so what I'm going to do?  because California is just a messed up place.  I'm going to take all this gear and everything that you're seeing in here and I'm going to take it to Texas very soon.  And I'm going to start doing my reviews and I'm going to start doing my introductions from within a bunker in Texas.  So instead of being an office, I'm going to be within a bunker.  But what I'm going to do for you people on those vouchers, because that video was made as a reminder, I'm going to extend the voucher, the $10,000 voucher that I gave to 100 people when I hit the 100,000 subscribers, until January 31st of this year, okay?  And it's also for $5,000 off a safe seller.  So you can either go with the small shelter and get $5,000 off, or $10,000 off with the big giant culvert shelters.  But guys... um i appreciate you subscribing to my channel.  um if you're not a subscriber my channel and for some reason this video went viral subscribe to my channel.  i'm a good person and we do good things.  i'm going to bring you a lot of great videos on how deep you can dig a bunker about tunnels and all kinds of cool things.  i'm do some videos about dumps or your deep underground military bases.  So make sure you stay tuned to my channel because I got some great videos that I'm editing with these temporary editors.  I actually have two of them here right now.  I have a guy, Brian, and of course this other guy.  So we're going to try to get you some content out and try to release it like two times a week like we were doing when Joe was here.  But guys, I'm very sorry that this happened to my friend Joe.  We worked together for 15 months.  He released the... the video on September 14th called Atlas 10x30 Safe Seller.  He did most of my original content.  He was an incredible editor.  I'm not supposed to say his age, but he was actually from China.  His English was very good.  He was an incredible guy.  Everyone loved him.  I will sorely miss him.  How do you feel about this job?  It sucks.  Do you like editing?  Love it.  You love it?  No.  Love you.  You're a fag.  You know, now you're an editor.  What did you do?  Oh, it's auto-saving.  Okay, doesn't matter.  Ron is editing his own video.  No, I'm not.  It's just very surreal.  So, guys, if you're not a subscriber to my channel, make sure you like and subscribe.  Share this video.  Hit that little bell.  Let's see when more of these videos come in and the updates about my friend Joe and his murder.  And, guys, as always, I love you.  I'll see you on the next video. ",
