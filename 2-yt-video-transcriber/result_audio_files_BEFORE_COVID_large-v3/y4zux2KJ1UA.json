But not only AOC, also Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.  And before I get into it, before I give you my two cents, before I tell you what's really going on here, let's look at some video.  First, you're going to see AOC in front of the National Action Network, which is Al Sharpton's little situation.  Then you're going to see Hillary Clinton speaking in front of some people.  And then you're going to see Joe Biden speaking in front of some people.  After we get done with all three of those clips, I'll come back, give you my two cents, and wrap it on up with a nice bone on top.  So without further ado. ",
