Share my videos, subscribe to my second channel, Alan Roberts and My Opinion Course.  Click the button below at the end.  Thank you very much.  I talk a lot about weight loss on this channel because basically obesity is kind of a pandemic.  It's an unsustainable thing for our species.  that's happening around the world where it's going to be.  the majority of people are overweight or obese.  We cannot sustain this.  It is very unhealthy for people and I talk a lot about it because the majority of people are.  However, I believe in being just healthy.  Healthy means being at a healthy weight, doing the best you can.  Being underweight or too low a body fat percentage, also extremely unhealthy.  And that's one of the things I want to talk about in this video.  I've been asked dozens and dozens and dozens of times to make a video about Stephanie Buttermore, who is a figure competitor.  She has a PhD, I believe, in pathology.  So she's a very intelligent woman, very, very educated.  and uh she has a large youtube following and does a you know does a lot of videos based off of her experiences.  what she's doing.  um she eats huge cheat meals um which like 9 000 10 000 calorie cheat meals.  i don't watch those things because i am not a fan of the whole.  let me eat nine ten thousand calories.  i even did a video before like how ten thousand calorie challenge is kind of Because that's kind of like Thanksgiving at my parents' place.  You know, you wake up, pancakes, bacon, sausage, when I used to eat meat.  Pancakes, bacon, sausage, coffee, latte, you know, with cream and sugar and everything like that.  You know, you're 2,000 calories, 3,000 calories in before you get up from, you know, the breakfast table.  A basin full of peanut M&Ms, a big, big, big lunch.  You know, you're at 5,000, 6,000 calories right there.  Dinner is turkey stuffy gravy, cranberry sauce, all the good fixings, and then a little later you have some pecan pie with some homemade whipped cream, a few beers, and an after drink coffee with Irish whiskey and cream.  10,000 calories plus, easy.  It's just a holiday to me.  I don't think it's something that should be... popularized.  I don't watch those things.  But they get a lot of views, and I understand why some people do it, especially when you watch a 110-pound woman pack away 90, or excuse me, 9,000 calories.  It gets views, right?  I have not wanted to make a video about it because why give attention to that type of certain thing?  However, somebody told me to go check out her last couple videos.  Her video about a month ago talks about her going all in.  It's a concept where she is trying to fix her self-admitted ravenous hunger via not putting a cap on herself, like eating complete satiation.  She does talk about how in her life she has always stopped herself.  you know, eating from, you know, eating to more than 50 to 60% fullness, that is like living under such a serious restriction.  I can imagine that being mentally daunting, just to be honest.  That's tough.  And that can happen through genetics.  There can be all sorts of reasons for it.  So if that's happened to her entire life, and then she gets into figure competiting where she has to seriously restrict herself, and she has gotten extremely lean, as you can see.  Like, extremely, extremely lean.  That's not healthy just about for anybody, but yet alone for women.  It can really mess up a woman's hormones.  And she talks about that, how she needs to get her female hormones back.  I do find these videos very... brave because she is talking about how she has already gained 10 pounds in a week.  She ate 5,000 calories a day for the entire week and gained 10 pounds.  I do believe a lot of that was because she was underweight.  Because as you can see here, she still looks pretty lean for a female. ",

She talks about how she doesn't know how much more weight she's going to gain.  She feels that she's going to cap out at some point in time and her weight will stable out.  And hopefully that means she won't feel the need to eat 4,000 or 5,000 calories.  Hopefully it'll be lower because she'll feel satiated and her body will be closer to its set point. ",

Inspiring that she is going to put herself out there because in the fitness industry for a woman to openly say she is not going to have a six-pack Somehow that's crazy.  in reality Most women the way their their physiological physiology is made if they have an actual six-pack they are underweight and that's not a healthy place to be.

That's what's wrong with the fitness industry.  The fitness industry is not about fitness.  Being at an ultra low body fat percentage for a woman is not fit.  Having incredibly, incredibly overdeveloped glutes and thighs while having still slim shoulders, focusing the majority of your workouts on your ass and not building the rest of your body in conjunction is not fitness.  That is not what actual fitness is.  The fitness industry has the examples for what women should be and should focus on completely asked backwards.  Women should train very similar to men.  They should train the basic lifts.  They should train in just nearly every way how a man would train.  Because the basic lifts actually simulate acts of daily living.  The squat actually simulates sitting down and getting back up.  The deadlift simulates picking shit up off the ground.  And you push the lift step over your head and pull yourself up.  It is very, very, very ridiculous that for some reason the fitness industry focuses all on under butts and making sure you have a big ass and a small waist.  That's ridiculous.  That's not fitness.  And my hat... if I was wearing one, would go off to Miss Buttermore for actually being brave enough to put herself out there to, one, say she actually has some issues that she is working through, two, to put it on fucking camera.  A woman gaining weight on camera when they were a fitness competitor, a figure competitor, is brave as hell, motherfuckers.  That is brave.  My hat is off to her because in reality, more women need to do shit like this.  I understand that people are used to hearing me say, you should lose weight.  It's never because of how the person looks.  It's never, ever because of how the person looks.  Yes, you can look at somebody and say, you're unhealthy, but that is not healthy.  Problem the aesthetic is not the problem.  the fact that you are not physically healthy is the issue.  and being underweight to the point where it messes up your female hormones is unhealthy.  that it should not be seen as a positive thing, and yet that is what you see every time you open Instagram, and it makes it worse because they put the filter on and they draw the abs in and all that stupid shit.  I will be following every single video that she does of this series.  I am very, very, very happy.  I went and checked it out.  I'm happy I waited because the 9,000-calorie thing, but I'm happy I checked it out, and I can say anything to anybody.  We need to unhook aesthetics from health.  The concept that they're interrelated is not true.  Just because somebody is huge, does not mean they're not a great person, does not mean somebody won't find them attractive.  Just because they weigh three, four, five hundred pounds, they can still be attractive, they can still be pretty.  Just like somebody that's underweight, if they're 60, 70, 80 pounds because of some sort of illness they have, or they're fighting off cancer, or they have an eating disorder of some kind, they can still be seen as beautiful by somebody.  That does not mean it's healthy.  We should strive to make sure everybody is healthy and worry about the aesthetics afterwards.  That is the entire issue that I keep facing on both ends of this spectrum.  And for some reason, people, the majority of fitness people out there, still want to talk about how to get shredded in six weeks.  So to all you motherfuckers that talk about that shit, actually realize that that shit could be leading to many more problems down the road for all sorts of people, anywhere from hurting their hormonal system to making them have an issue with food.  That is not what fitness professionals actually are supposed to do.  You're supposed to get people fit.  That's your fucking job.  It's in your title.  So everybody should go and support Stephanie Buttermore in her endeavor to find her healthy point, her health.  And she plans on making sure she watches over her health.  She's not going to gain too much weight, but everybody should support her, and that's who you should follow.  If you are looking for an example of what fitness for a female is, that is actually fitness.  Taking care of your long-term health, looking out for yourself so that you don't mess yourself up just to look a certain way.  That's just my two cents a minute.  My name is Alan Roberts.
