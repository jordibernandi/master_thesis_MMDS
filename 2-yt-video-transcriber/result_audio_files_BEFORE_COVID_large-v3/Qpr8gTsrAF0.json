Now they're all been grey.  The Greeks.  The Lebanese.  The Italians.  The old is being replaced by the new.  Displaced.  Their grandchildren can't afford to live here anymore.  Houses are bought up by developers and demolished.  They replaced them with identical multi-dwelling buildings, each individually going for as much as the original.  This new apartment building towers over everything within miles.  At the pre-sale, 350,000 got your one bedroom with a view of the train tracks.  Our community is sold to them as a core part of the product.  Life in the heart.  They don't realise they're displacing it.  Places that were once indispensable social institutions are being swept away, replaced with spots more palatable to our new neighbours.  Even our local MP moved here from elsewhere.  It's hard to be forced out of the community you grew up in.  Hard to watch it disappear.  In the shadow of the new apartment building, lies the old Greek social club.  Its mostly retired attendees spend much of their time there.  In perhaps 10 or 20 years, its membership will have dwindled.  Those who remain will walk home for the last time.  A trendy bar will take their place.  you. ",
