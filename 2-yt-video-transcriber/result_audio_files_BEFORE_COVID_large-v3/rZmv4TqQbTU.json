            "text": "Just when you think there can't be any more shady news about Hillary Clinton's emails, there is.  This news implicates not only Hillary Clinton and her team, but the FBI, too.  Here's what we learned.  The watchdog group Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request for internal FBI emails related to the Anthony Weiner laptop.  Anthony Weiner, as you remember, was the former congressman who was at the time married to Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman, Huba Abedin.  Weiner resigned from Congress after he was exposed, pun intended, posing as a pervert named Carlos Danger online and sexting underage girls, sending inappropriate sexual pictures of himself on Twitter to these girls.  So if we rewind to October of 2016, right before the 2016 presidential election in November, Former FBI Director James Comey announced he was reopening the Hillary Clinton investigation in light of Anthony Weiner's laptop, which contained emails between Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin.  This is important for two reasons.  Number one, Peter Strzok, the number two counterintelligence agent at the FBI, the one who interviewed Hillary during the email investigation, same man who was a top dog in the Trump-Russia FBI investigation, same man who interviewed General Michael Flynn, the same man who was caught in an illicit love affair with FBI attorney Lisa Page and whose text messages with Page indicated According to the DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, a willingness to use his official position and power at the FBI to materially damage the electoral chances of candidate Trump.  Strzok knew about the Wiener laptop.  He knew there were more Hillary Clinton emails on there.  Nevertheless, he stymied the FBI investigation into the laptop, ostensibly to help Hillary.  Until, that is, James Comey was forced to bring it to light.  That's reason number one.  Reason number two that the Wiener laptop is so important, Hillary Clinton sent and received classified information on unsecured email servers.  She obviously violated the law by doing this because you'd have to live under a rock not to realize it's against the law to handle classified information on a non-classified email server.  Why Hillary has never been prosecuted for this is beyond me.  So that's a background on the Wiener laptop.  But thanks to Judicial Watch and the new internal FBI emails that were just made public, it's even worse than everything we just laid out.  Lisa Page, Peter Strzok's FBI lover, according to these FBI emails, was emailing about a quid pro quo between the FBI and the State Department, in which the FBI would downgrade the classification rating on the Hillary Clinton emails on that laptop so that Hillary's lie about never sending or receiving classified emails would be true since it was a lie when Hillary said it in exchange for funding for more FBI personnel abroad.  In other words, while there's no evidence that this quid pro quo ever happened, the FBI was willing to entertain an idea, a bargain, in which they would help a presidential candidate they liked to lie in order to boost her chance of winning the election if they were paid off with more personnel funding.  Kind of takes your breath away, doesn't it?  And it should take our trust away in the upper echelons of the FBI, who use their position of power to help political candidates they like and hurt political candidates they don't like.  And yet, none of these people at the top levels of the FBI have been held accountable for their corrupt, dishonest, immoral, and probably illegal behavior.  Ask your elected representative why.  And that's my final points. ",
