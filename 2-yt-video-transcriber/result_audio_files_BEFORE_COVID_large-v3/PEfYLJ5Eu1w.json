            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back.  It's Neon.  We're going to talk about Star Wars Galaxy's Edge and some rumors concerning the fallout from the apparent lack of success of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge.  Now, you're seeing these pictures all over the internet.  The Galaxy's Edge is not nearly as crowded as Disney expected it to be.  In fact, we actually have videos from friends of ours who have checked it out in California, and they're like, yeah, this is totally legit.  The crowds are just not there.  But now there's a new rumor that Disney is actually going to cut back on the hours of cast members because they hired these folks to run this runaway success, this massive success that was going to be Galaxy's Edge, and the people just aren't turning up.  They don't need all the manpower.  So this was actually put out there today by DataRacer117.  They went ahead and reposted a woman's comments about her son working at Disneyland.  So this woman, KSLone4, is talking about how, yeah, the crowds are light.  I've seen these pictures all over.  Again, we've got friends that send us videos from Galaxy's Edge.  This is pretty accurate.  Pretty accurate.  So she says that her son works for Disneyland.  The attendance is so low.  Haha, see what I did there?  The attendance is so low that the company is asking cast members to help cut back on hours.  Cast member blockout dates have all been lifted.  Did you see Disneyland's social media page today?  The resort is begging for people to return.  Yeah, Disneyland's really been pulling out all the stops.  If you've been out to the official Disney Parks blog lately, there's a lot of talk.  about going to Disneyland.  They're pulling out the Main Street Electrical Parade, a fan favorite, right?  They're using Pete's Dragon to drag people to a brand new Star Wars expansion in the theme parks.  I mean, I love the Main Street Electrical Parade.  It's one of my favorite Disney things ever.  But the fact that they have to bust out a 40-plus-year-old parade using Pete's Dragon, Pete's Dragon, to get people... to go to a Star Wars themed area of Disneyland is pretty sad.  And it's taking a toll on the rest of the park.  The rest of the park is pretty empty too.  We've talked about it before, like it's 20 minutes to ride Pirates of the Caribbean in the middle of summer.  It's crazy.  We were out in Disneyland last summer at this time and we waited over an hour on average for the e-tickets.  So here she continues.  Heads up, Disneyland management has just had a meeting.  Sales are insanely low throughout the entire park and hotels.  Seasonal cast members may have to be let go.  Seasonal cast members may have to be let go.  Ouch.  Universal reporting record-breaking numbers this 4th of July season.  It looks like Disney's price increase is to blame.  I completely agree that the price definitely, definitely has had something to do with it.  That's across the board.  I mean, Disney keeps inching up its prices on both coasts.  They just dropped a massive 25% increase on annual passes in Florida.  Eventually, people are going to get to a point where it's not worth it anymore.  It's not worth it.  It's definitely not worth it.  So we got to pay over $100 to go into the park, to go into Galaxy's Edge, which is not based on the original trilogy.  It's basically a sequel trilogy themed shopping village with one ride that people were completely confused by.  I mean, it's not really knocking it out of the park.  I mean, to be honest, Disney at this point, if they could charge people just to go to their restaurants and hotels and stores to spend more money and do away with the rides completely, I swear to God, I think they would do it.  I think they would do it.  That's what they want.  They just want to increase revenue.  So this is really interesting, and I do believe this.  I know that Disney, especially going into the end of August, Because we're talking their fiscal year wraps up the end of September going into August.  If things are still bad, look for some major freak out fire sales.  And I've heard that that could be on the horizon with Disney World because apparently Disney World's bookings are very, very soft despite the fact that they are going to be bringing Galaxy's Edge to Disney World in August.  So, I mean, this is a bad look for Disney.  You go out to Google News and you Google Galaxy's Edge And it's full of fail.  The news is full of fail.  Look what comes up.  There are a couple things talking about how they're selling out lightsabers.  Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry, get to Galaxy's Edge, buy your lightsabers.  But look, Disneyland becomes a ghost town.  We got this covered.  Galaxy's Edge proving to not be as popular as Disney expected.  Okay.  You know, EpicStream, there might have been a lot of hype over Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, but it looks like the crowds are getting smaller at Disneyland's new Star Wars park.  Crowds at Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, smaller than expected.  Galaxy's Edge crowds are lighter than expected.  And of course, dork side of the force.  No, Galaxy's Edge isn't failing.  Galaxy's Edge isn't failing at all.  But for the most part, front page news for Galaxy's Edge is negative.  It's negative.  It's talking about how it's a failure.  Let's go out to fanside.  Let's go see Dorkside of the Force and see what they have to say.  Because you know they're going to totally be like, oh, no, this is a positive, guys.  This is a positive.  You know that you can get onto the Falcon ride with only a 30 to 60 minute wait.  How is that a bad thing?  With word spreading that Disneyland isn't as busy... As some expect in the middle of summer, some factions of the internet have suggested Galaxy's Edge is failing.  Is there any truth to this suggestion?  Okay, before we get into this, and people keep asking me, like, what is it to you?  Geeky and I ran a very popular Disney... and theme park blog for about three years.  We've been to many Disney media events.  We cover openings.  And I've never seen crowds as light as they are at Galaxy's Edge at opening.  Even last year, comparing it to Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World, the first couple months, and even now, it's crazy busy.  And that's still not what Disney wants.  They want more people.  They actually consider Toy Story Land to be kind of soft right now, even though you will wait over an hour to ride the Slinky Dog coaster.  So for Galaxy's Edge, which was infinitely more expensive than Toy Story Land, it's a failure.  I'm sorry, it's a failure.  Thomas Willoughby, it is a failure.  This past weekend, I made the mistake of looking at the videos YouTube's algorithms decided I would like.  Being a Star Wars fan, this often leads to Galaxy's Edge vlogs or videos from the always excellent Star Wars Explained.  On this occasion, I was flooded with Star Wars backlash, Galaxy's Edge a flop.  question mark explanation.  question mark i think that was actually a title of one of ours might have been ours.  uh style videos.  hyperbole such as this isn't new in the world of youtube.  naturally views lead to revenue and headlines such as these are almost required to pull in the viewer.  while i often avoid such videos and the channels behind them i made an allowance.  My usual decision to avoid said channels was vindicated as I was met with a 20-minute rant about Disney's handling of the series.  While the content of these videos is less than savory, they do bring to light the current headlines surrounding Galaxy's Edge and Disneyland as a whole.  Certain publications, for example, reported that Disneyland is a ghost town.  and that wait times for Smuggler's Run aren't anywhere close to a Cars ride, the Cars ride that opened in 2012.  With it being at the height of summer and one of the most popular holiday destinations on the planet, are the YouTubers of today right in saying a backlash to Disney's take on Star Wars is leading to their new billion dollar park?  Galaxy's Edge is not failing, all caps.  No, it's just bold.  Okay, it's not as simple as just no.  There are a multitude of factors that need to be accounted for when discussing why Disneyland might feel empty.  I want to preface this by saying I'm not a huge theme park guy.  I've never been to Disneyland or Disney World.  We go all the time.  Dude, I'm not, I just, I'm pretty much done there.  I've never been, we go all the time.  Anybody who watches Clownfish TV knows that sometimes we actually stream from the parks.  We're there all the time.  This is most certainly unusual.  especially in June and July, Disneyland is usually packed.  We were there last week of June last year.  It was packed.  It went every summer.  As a kid, we usually went the week of the 4th of July.  It's packed.  This is very, very weird.  It's very, very weird.  And I don't think it's Star Wars keeping people away, but I sure as hell don't think Star Wars is the draw they expected it to be.  So they're talking about people waiting it out because they're afraid that it's going to be too crowded.  They're talking about being too expensive.  I do think that actually the money, I think the money is definitely playing.  Yeah, look at this picture.  Oh yeah, Star Wars is a huge hit.  Look at all these people.  Look at all these people.  No, I think that's a big problem.  Disney's prices are too high.  And they keep saying that they're doing it because they're trying to weed people out.  And I'm like, well, it looks like you've been pretty damn successful, Disney.  You have to weed out your own employees because there aren't enough people coming to Disneyland to justify paying them.  So that's kind of crap.  The park isn't finished.  That is somewhat valid, too.  It only opened with one ride.  It's basically a glorified gift shop at this point with the Falcon ride.  So, you know, they're talking about, of course, it's going to get better.  Things are going to get better.  It's far too easy to look at a few tweets about open spaces and decide that's proof that the fans are fighting back.  My advice would be to wait for actual attendance figures to be released before deciding the park is failing.  Though I suppose it's too much to ask for this fan base to not be hyper reactionary.  Dude.  We followed theme parks.  We followed theme parks.  I was in Disney World's Galaxy's Edge as it was under construction as part of a media event.  This is what we do.  This is freaking weird.  It's freaking weird.  Again, I'm not saying that Star Wars is chasing people away, but it sure as hell is not bringing the crowds to Disneyland like they expected.  And I think they made all these... they basically counted their chickens before they were hatched.  They thought that they were going to have these massive crowds, so they did the blackout dates, they jacked the prices, and it had an adverse effect on Disneyland, and now they've got to lay people off.  Now they've got to fire people, because there aren't enough guests to warrant all the people that they hired, thinking this was going to be a slam dunk.  It's not a slam dunk.  Meanwhile, she is completely... Correct.  She's completely correct.  Universal in Orlando opened that Harry Potter coaster, the Hagrid's magical creature motor bike adventure thing.  And it has a 10 hour wait.  OK, for one roller coaster based on Harry Potter, which isn't as big as it used to be.  So, but again, Universal is cheaper.  You know, it's cheaper.  And there are a lot of other factors there too.  But Disney is just, yeah, I think they're pricing out average people.  They're pricing out the normies, the normal families.  So Universal, I objectively think Universal is doing much better than Disney right now at bringing people in.  And the word on the street is they're bringing Nintendo to Universal as well, which I think would be a Star Wars killer, absolutely.  So believe what you want, but I'm sorry.  There's a lot of headlines, a lot of tweets, a lot of people saying it's bad.  It's just not... It's just not good.  It's not good.  And sorry, you know, Disney, you just you screwed this one up.  And Star Wars, the Star Wars brand does not have as much power as it did even 10 years ago.  So there it is.  Hopefully nobody's going to lose their jobs over this.  But I think I think it's very, very likely.  I think it's very likely.  So we will talk to you later.  Please subscribe for more pop culture news, views and rants here on Clownfish TV.
