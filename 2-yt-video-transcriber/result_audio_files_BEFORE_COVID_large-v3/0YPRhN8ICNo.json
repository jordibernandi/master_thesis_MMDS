            "text": "Hey everyone, my name is Riley, and today we're gonna be talking about the Green New Deal, which I still struggle to say quickly.  Green New Deal.  Green New Deal.  Green New Deal.  Green and new just morph into one word.  I'm just gonna call it the GND.  So, the GND is a resolution stating goals for Congress to achieve by 2030, mainly to do with the environment, but also other issues.  It's massively progressive, and it's something that we all need to get behind if we want to fight climate change.  And we should want to fight climate change, because it will literally make this planet uninhabitable for us.  So today, I want to talk specifically about what the GND is trying to do, because it's important that we're educated about what we're advocating for.  Legislation that tackles climate change is important, but we have to know how it is doing that.  So first things first, this is not a bill.  This isn't a piece of legislation.  It's not doing anything on its own.  It's a resolution, which is just a statement saying, we plan to achieve these things through future legislation.  So if all goes according to plan, a lot of smaller pieces of legislation would be proposed that tackle different problems, and they would fall under the umbrella of being a part of the GND.  So don't expect the GND to get super specific.  That's what the future bills would be for.  Right now, the GND is intentionally vague.  It's basically a mission statement saying, here is what we want to do, and then we hash out the how to do it and the specifics of each individual bill.  Realistically, those bills aren't going to get anywhere for the next two years, because even if they pass the House, the Republican-controlled Senate is likely to vote them down.  And even if by some miracle it did get through the Senate, Trump would have to sign it.  So depending on what happens in 2020, we could start seeing GND legislation being put into place then, with the goal being to accomplish a lot of major points by 2030.  And given how climate change is increasingly exacerbating natural disasters and causing the sea level to rise, we can't afford to wait any longer than that.  So a major part of the GND happening in 2020 is electing Democrats to Congress and the presidency.  Without that, the people who believe in this plan won't have the power to do anything about it.  Between now and 2020, hopefully we'll see a bunch of different GND bills and have a chance to analyze and debate them before there's a real chance to enact them when the next Congress comes in.  So, with all of that said, let's talk about what this resolution says.  In the beginning, it basically makes a justification for why it exists, by listing a bunch of the ways that climate change is hurting the US.  And citing a 2018 report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it says that to prevent climate change from becoming even more destructive, we need to reach net-zero carbon emissions from human sources by 2050.  It goes on to list other ways that climate change is damaging the world, including its effects disproportionately harming marginalized communities, like communities of color, indigenous communities, and poor communities.  It even says that climate change is a threat to national security, as natural disasters worsen around the world and destabilize other countries.  Then it goes on to list several other crises that the US is having right now, including stagnating hourly wages, massive income inequality, and a racial wealth divide.  Then it basically says that the federal government has the chance to do something on a New Deal-sized scale that could both address climate change and many of the other issues plaguing the country.  That's when it lists its five main goals.  which I'll summarize in plain English, but you're welcome to go read the resolution for yourself.  I'll link it in the description below.  So those five goals are basically 1.  Get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in a fair way.  2.  Create millions of good, well-paying, secure jobs.  3.  Invest in modern infrastructure.  4.  Ensure that everyone has access to clean air, water, and other necessities.  And 5.  Promote justice for and repair the historic oppression of marginalized communities.  Those are the five big main goals of the GND.  It's essentially, stop climate change and do it in a way that benefits the people.  It goes on to say that these goals can be achieved through a 10-year national mobilization, and it gets a little bit more specific about how those goals should be achieved.  It emphasizes that funding and investment should go towards community-led projects.  because local communities know the best way to protect themselves against climate change.  It says the federal government needs to invest heavily in renewable energy sources and the infrastructure to deploy those renewable sources.  And it needs to make sure those sources are affordable for everyone.  It says we need to upgrade all the existing buildings in the country to maximize their energy efficiency and energy sources.  It says we need to support family farms and invest in sustainable farming practices to reduce or eliminate the pollution coming from the agricultural sector.  It says we need to overhaul our public transportation system to make it zero-emission and affordable.  And it specifically says that we need to invest in high-speed rail.  Which, oh my god, we really do.  Quick note before I cover the rest of this resolution, if you're American and you've never left the country, I think it would blow your mind how much better public transportation works in, like, every other place except the US.  Like, most of the US has really been designed with cars in mind, and it's life-changing to go to a city where there's a solid public transportation system, and you realize that there's a better way to do things.  Imagine the US having a high-speed rail system to go from LA to SF in a couple hours, or even to go cross-country.  It could happen, and it would fundamentally change the way we travel, especially by cutting down on flights that use a lot of fossil fuels.  Okay, sorry, back to the resolution, I just really love public transportation.  So the GND also says that we need to restore natural ecosystems that have been destroyed, and work to protect those that are endangered or fragile.  It says we need to clean up hazardous waste sites, and we need to promote the international exchange of technology and expertise when it comes to climate change, because we're all in this together.  And it says that the US should become a leader in this area so that other countries can follow its lead.  It emphasizes, again, that marginalized communities need to be consulted at every step of the way.  And it says that we need to ensure that the people benefit from the economic boom that will come from so much investment, not corporations.  Then it says we need to provide higher education to everyone, with an emphasis on people from marginalized communities so that they can be equal participants in the GND.  It emphasizes the importance of hiring local workers who are part of a union.  And it says that we need to guarantee good jobs with a right to unionize.  It says we need to improve workplace safety and anti-discrimination laws, stop the transfer of jobs overseas, and not allow companies to monopolize entire sectors.  It says that the US government needs to obtain consent from indigenous people for any decisions that affect them, they need to honor all treaties with them, and they need to protect the sovereignty of indigenous lands.  And lastly, it says that all people of the United States should be provided with high-quality healthcare, affordable housing, economic security, and access to clean air and water.  That's a lot of stuff for what many see as just a thing about climate change.  It's actually about way more than climate change.  It's about repairing this country in a bunch of different ways, and a big part of that is climate change, because it's already wreaking havoc on the globe and on the US specifically.  But the way that it chooses to address climate change, by ensuring that marginalized communities are consulted, by creating good jobs, by making sure everyone has healthcare and clean water, All of that stuff doesn't necessarily have to be a part of a climate change resolution.  But it is here, and I think that's a big deal.  The GND is very progressive, and it's actually gaining support among Democrats thanks to the hard work put in by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and so many other progressives who continue to push the Democrats to the left.  There's still a ways to go, for sure, but it's already got 60 House cosponsors and 9 Senate cosponsors.  And if we make it a key issue for 2020, it's going to push Democrats left, and it's going to ensure that we end up with a presidential candidate who's ready to take big steps towards fighting climate change.  So don't think of the GND solely as a climate change resolution.  Think of it as a massive community project to improve life for everyone.  At the end of it, we could have pollution-free air, high-quality public transportation, safe and well-paying jobs, a right to higher education, a right to quality healthcare, and so much more.  This could change so much, but only if we get behind the GND.  So when you're voting in local elections , make sure you're voting for candidates who support the GND.  If your representative or senator hasn't voiced their support for it yet, call their office and tell them you want them to support it.  We've got two years to build support for the GND, and we cannot wait any longer than that to act on climate change.  Anyway, that's all I had for you today.
