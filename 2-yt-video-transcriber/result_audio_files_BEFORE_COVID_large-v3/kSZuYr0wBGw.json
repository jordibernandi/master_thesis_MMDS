            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to the show.  Today we're going to be talking about the absolute state of universities yet again, because if you watch this show, you'll know that far left identitarians have taken over academia.  This is an issue we've talked about many, many times.  There are so many examples out there of professors trying to indoctrinate, not educate, indoctrinate their students with far left talking points.  And I know that whenever I talk about how unbelievably left-leaning academia is, there's at least one person who says something along the lines of, well, if all the most educated, learned people out there are all left-wing, shouldn't that tell you something about what the correct opinion is?  Huh?  Well, first off, not only is the far-left identitarian takeover of universities somewhat recent, it wasn't always a given that every person at a university would literally be a communist and black nationalist.  But also... Personally, I don't know how you guys feel about it, but a ton of gender studies, sociology, and art history professors all agreeing that capitalism and white cis males are the problem... That just... that just doesn't really mean a lot to me.  I'm not really looking for any type of advice or policy recommendations from those people.  In any case, though, the reason why I bring up the far left in academia is that we have been presented with yet another example of shocking, staggering bias, incompetence, and flat-out bigotry from a college professor.  Before we get into that, though, I do need a quick minute of your time to tell you about our awesome sponsors, Quip.  So what actually makes a good toothbrush?  Unicorn horn?

So Michael Moreno is a student at WSU who recently released audio recordings of his debate professor, a Mr.  Ryan Walsh, going on an anti-white tirade in which he asserts that space, as well as science and technology in general really, are white social constructs.

            "text": "Social justice advocates always say that black people cannot be racist toward white people because they lack systemic power, but really, when you think about it and what this example goes to show is that's not the real reason.  If even in a hypothetical scenario where black people have taken it upon themselves to round up all the white people on the planet and shoot them off into space forever, you still don't accept that black people have the power to be racist against white people?  You will never accept that black people can be racist against white people.  In these people's minds, when white people mistreat black people, that's racism.  But when black people mistreat white people, that's just retribution.  That's just justice.  It's a crazy world we're living in, folks, and you know what?  I feel like a lot of us see so many of these stories of crazy unhinged professors that we can kind of become desensitized to it.  But let's not forget who the real victims are, and that's students like Michael who are forced to listen to this crap day after day and heck, even repeat it themselves if they want to get their degrees.  I'm all for academic freedom, of course, but this type of behavior in a classroom setting is just unacceptable.  How can you have a debate class where you can't even push back on the idea that your race is inherently bad?  Michael has his own video, which I strongly recommend you guys check out, by the way, where he goes point by point through every single university policy that this Professor Wash is in violation of.  With evidence, by the way.  Academic freedom does not mean that you get to assert your own opinions are facts and shut down students when they try to push back on that, and it certainly doesn't mean that you get to disrespect students based on their race.  Since these clips started being shared around, WSU has released a statement saying they're looking into things, but I, at least, am not holding my breath that anything productive is going to come of that.  And what's especially frustrating is that just for sharing these clips and exposing the racism of his professor and classmates, which, by the way, I consider a public service, Michael has himself been slandered by WSU students as being an alleged white supremacist.  A Twitter account called Never Neutral Union claims to be, quote, a student-led organization made in response to the videos produced by Michael Moreno.  We will not be neutral in the wake of white supremacy.  They've tweeted that, quote, we demand that Michael Moreno be expelled from Weber State for breaking student code of conduct and propagating white supremacy.  Regarding the assertions of privacy violations, none of Michael's classmates are either named or shown on video.  Plus, Utah is a state that does not require someone's permission before being recorded, so... No luck there.  Also, if your definition of white supremacy includes saying, please don't banish me and my family to outer space forever just because of our skin color, You're insane, okay?  You are a crazy person.  There is no reasoning with you.  And that's why I wanted to talk about this story, not only to raise awareness about it and try to get support for Michael and hopefully condemnation for this professor, but also to say unequivocally that yes, all of this racial, identitarian, anti-white rhetoric is definitely contributing to the rise of white nationalism among Generation Z. You cannot have black people, Hispanic people, and Asian people all saying, my people, my race, my land, and then be surprised when white people say it too.  I've been saying it for literally years that these far left types with their racial grievances and boo white people attitudes, they've been making race relations worse.  Guess what?  We have proof of that now.  One study looked at five components of white victim ideology, specifically that, quote, whites face racial discrimination, whites' rights, particularly to their own culture, are being denied, whites are stigmatized for expressing racial pride, discrimination, loss of rights, and stigmatization lead to a loss of self-esteem and other psychological distress, and that these attacks are a threat to the existence of the white race.  The study found that, quote, results suggest all five elements of white victim ideology are positively associated with affiliation with the alt-right, with perceived reverse discrimination, i.e.  just flat-out discrimination, being the most influential factor.  I do not say this lightly, but racists like Ryan Wash are a stain on our society.  They threaten the cohesion of our social fabric and the unity of our nations.  The fact that he is actually in a position to influence the thoughts and opinions of young people is a sure sign of the degradation of our institutions.  And as always, I would love to know what you guys think.  What do you think the university should do to Ryan Wash?  And what do you think is going to happen to Michael for exposing his professor?  Plus, is there any way at this point to save academia or is it just a lost cause?  Let me know, but that's it for now.  Thank you guys so much for tuning in and I'll see you next time. ",
