            "text": "Armed citizens are stopping criminals every day.  Studies consistently show that Americans use their firearms in defense of themselves or others between 500,000 and 2 million times a year.  Yet very few receive national publicity.  if they receive publicity at all and these are average everyday americans they didn't go looking for evil but when evil found them they were prepared to deal with it here just a handful of the many times during the month of february in twenty nineteen that law-abiding americans demonstrated the importance of the second amendment.  on february second a restaurant owner in akron ohio scared off a masked man who attempted to rob him with a knife.  The man fled, and police believe he successfully robbed a different restaurant just hours later.  On February 9th, when three armed men attempted to rob a Little Caesars Pizza in North Fort Myers, Florida, a patron inside pulled his own firearm to defend other customers.  One suspect was shot, and the other two fled.  On February 12th, a homeowner in Jackson County, Georgia, heard someone trying to break into her house through a window.  She found a man standing outside and warned him, don't come into the house.  Nevertheless, the man broke the glass window, so the armed homeowner shot him.  On February 17th, an armed Good Samaritan in Daytona Beach, Florida, fired a shot to stop a knife-wielding man who had already stabbed someone from stabbing other people outside a convenience store.  On February 20th, a 79-year-old Commerce, Georgia homeowner called 911 to report a burglary in progress after she heard someone breaking into her house.  The burglar ignored her threats and came in through an upstairs window before police could arrive.  The homeowner shot at the burglar, who was so scared that he hid in a closet until the police arrived.  Without a robustly protected right to keep and bear arms, the people in these cases would have been left to the mercy of criminals who don't really care for the rights of others.  Despite this reality, gun control advocates and lawmakers are spending their time pushing legislation that would severely hamper the ability of law-abiding Americans to defend themselves and others.  We don't make law-abiding citizens safer by disarming them or making them less capable of fighting back against criminals.  We only make them easier targets. ",
