            "text": "Early on, the Chinese decided\u2014the end of the last century, the beginning of this one\u2014to hitch their economic wagon to the world market, to become the producer of goods and services for sale around the world.  And in order to do that, they had to build industries that produced what the rest of the world did, either at a higher quality or at a lower price, or both.  And basically they've done that, which is why Chinese automobiles, Chinese appliances, Chinese clothing, Chinese you fill in the blank, is everywhere.  Most of what you will see in an average Walmart is made in China.  And there's a reason why Walmart stocks up on Chinese good.  And they're not the only company, of course.  So they hitch their wagon to the world market, and they've done very, very well because of it.  The Russians couldn't do that, and the Chinese could.  And they did.  Here's another thing.  Private capitalists didn't go into Russia hardly at all, but they have been rushing, stumbling all over themselves to get into China.  And the Chinese understand that, and they offered Western capitalist enterprises the following deal.  We need your technology, the Chinese said.  We need your money, your capital, to be invested.  So here's the deal we offer you.  We will provide you with well-disciplined, efficient, hard-working workers at a very low wage, the one that we have here in our poor country.  And we will build the roads and provide the supports for you to be able to make a lot of money producing here in China more cheaply you could ever produce in America, or Western Europe, or Japan, etc.  All we ask in exchange is that you share your advanced technology because that's why we're doing this with you.  You will have access to our workers and you will have access to our customers to sell your product.  But we want your technology and your capital.  Nobody put a gun to any capitalist enterprise's head.  They made the decision to accept the offer of the Chinese because it was profitable for them to do so.  If it meant that they laid off workers in their home countries, these capitalist enterprises, they could care less.  They did that.  They abandoned whole industries.  They abandoned whole communities.  That's how capitalism has always worked.  Only this time, this destruction of working people in the West was a boon to the workers of China, which is why I gave you the numbers about the average real wage.  So the Chinese used world market, the deal they struck with private capitalists, and the lessons they learned from the Soviet Union to organize what they call a special Chinese kind of socialism that allows for private enterprise a considerable amount, allows for market dealings a considerable amount, but controls from the top through the state-owned enterprises the leading or dominant sectors of the Chinese economy.
