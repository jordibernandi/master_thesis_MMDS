            "text": "Shalom.  This week we are reading the Torah portion of Shemini, the third Torah portion in the book of Vayikra, Leviticus.  This Shabbat also features two extra levels of meaning as well.  It is also the Sabbath of the blessing of the new moon.  This coming new month will be the Rosh Chodesh of the month of Nisan, which will occur next Shabbat.  We always offer a special prayer, a blessing for the coming month on the Sabbath immediately preceding it.  And this Shabbat is also known as parashat Parah, the third of the four special Sabbaths that precede Passover, accompanied by special additional Torah readings.  As we have learned, the concept of these four special pre-Passover Sabbaths is ancient, and is mentioned in the Mishnah, the Tractate Megillah.  This special Sabbath of the portion of Parah, the additional Torah reading, a maftir, would be from the book of Numbers, chapter 19 verses 1-22.  This Torah reading deals with the Divine ordinance of purification from the impurity of death, through the ashes of the red heifer, the Parah Adumah.  This process of purification is a necessary requirement for the multitudes of Israel that would soon be preparing to make the festive pilgrimage to the Holy Temple to bring the Passover offering, hence the significance of this reading just before the arrival of the month of Nisan.  But since timing is everything, perhaps there is also a deep connection between the Red Heifer and our Torah portion of Shemini.  This week's Torah portion of parashat Shemini, meaning literally the eighth, begins on the eighth day, at the conclusion of the week-long inauguration ceremony of the tabernacle, at the very climax of the joy.  The parasha really only deals mainly with two subjects, the events of the eighth day, and laws of kashrut, of what may and may not be eaten from among the living things, according to G-d's will.  This 8th day described in our parasha is itself none other than Rosh Chodesh Nisan, the new moon of Nisan, the first day of the first month as it is described in Exodus 12.  In many ways, everything that we have been learning, every nuance of every weekly Torah portion, the entire Torah, all of creation has been leading up to this moment.  Because this is the day that G-d Himself has been waiting for, the day that the nation of Israel, representing mankind, welcomed His presence into the world.  This day is described in our holy tradition as such a great day, the day in which G-d's goal for creation, namely that He should have an abode in this world, this goal began to be fulfilled, when the tabernacle became a reality.  The power of this moment, as our parasha opens, the intensity of this scene, is beyond words.  But if mere words really fail to describe the feelings, the experience of the nation, that day that the shechina, the Divine Presence, took up residence among the children of Israel, If words can't express, can't describe that kind of transcending joy, song can.  Thus here is one of the most amazing verses in all of Torah, chapter 9 and verse 24.  A fire went forth before Hashem and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fats.  The people saw and sang glad song and fell upon their faces.  This is an amazing and singular expression in Hebrew, Vayaronu vayeplu elpnehem, they sang glad song and fell upon their faces, the people, the entire nation, inspired by the reality of the living presence of G-d among them, in total humility, nullifying their egos completely to G-d, they fell on their faces and sang glad song, they heard the music of the universe and they allowed themselves to become a part of it.  So this was the first day of the priestly service and the priestly blessing, the day upon which the Divine Fire descended from heaven upon the altar.  This uplifting, transcendent, sublime experience is the background to the tragic and untimely death of Nadav and Avihu, who were seemingly transfigured by the sheer ecstasy of the indwelling of G-d's presence, and they wanted to add their own contribution of love to the manifestation of G-d's love.  but apparently they err it in their understanding of how to live with that presence and incorporate it into everyday reality.  Much has been written about the background and intention of these righteous men, and their motivation.  It's difficult to talk about the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, it's hard to avoid generalizations and pat answers and judgment calls about these men.  It's all too easy to fall into that trap, to pontificate, to draw conclusions and determine how much better we know and how much better we would have done, as if we actually know better.  Nadav and Avihu thought that they had to do something special, something extraordinary, to keep this feeling of closeness to G-d going, to keep it constant for them.  But what really is the definition of living a life of holiness?  They brought an offering which was not commanded.  But isn't the spiritual level of one who is not commanded even greater than one who is commanded?  That's maybe what most would think.  But in reality, it's hard enough to do what you're told.  And that's what G-d is really asking of us.  It's much more difficult to follow instructions.  That requires more humility, yet more confidence and sense of purpose.  There are huge life lessons here for us that G-d intended for us to learn from this episode.  We try to understand how it happened that at this greatest moment, at the apex of this joyous festive occasion, the resting of the shechina in the tabernacle, how there occurred the most devastating failure.  While Moshe and Aaron and the entire nation stand by, Aaron's holy sons draw near with an offering that they weren't commanded in, and fire comes down from heaven and strikes them, consumes them.  What a shock.  What a disappointment.  It's like from the highest moment to plummet down to the depths of despair.  What could Aaron have thought?  What could his wife, the boy's mother, the righteous Elisheva, what could she have thought?  And what could they possibly say?  How did this impact their relationship with Hashem?  The great tragedy that befell Aaron on the day of the dedication of the tabernacle, and how Torah records his reaction, teaches us a great deal about what it means to cope with this, the most difficult challenge that any human being faces, death.  Aaron's response is silence.  Moshe said to Aaron, of this did Hashem speak, saying, I will be sanctified through those who are nearest me, thus I will be honored before the entire people.  And Aaron was silent.  There are different types of silence and different reasons for manifesting silence in the face of such a tragedy.  For example, there is the silence of shock.  A person can't process what's happened and refuses to believe.  But Aaron's silence has a different implication.  He was silent from his mourning, as one of the commentators of the Rashban explains, meaning he didn't express mourning, he didn't cry, this was a silence of acceptance and submission to the Divine will, a silence of coming to terms.  While generally the halacha, Torah law, requires us to mourn over the death of a close relative, Aaron's job restriction was not that of an ordinary person, and he was expected to continue with the Divine service despite his heavy loss.  Aaron summoned Mishael and El-Safan to carry the bodies of their brethren out in order to allow the service to continue.  Eleazar and Itamar were commanded to continue the service and refrain from such mourning practices as allowing the hair to grow long and rending their garments.  The assignment of mourning was given over to the nation of Israel and removed from the family.  Only the eating from the sin offering was kept from the sons of Aaron on account of their mourning.  Aaron's response to the death of his sons gives us great insight.  To the mourner, it seems like his whole world, his whole connection to reality, has been destroyed.  The vacuum created by his loss fills his entire world, until it feels to him like there is nothing else in the world but this void.  With the passing of his loved one, it's like the whole world is dead, and life has lost its meaning.  But this is the illusion of death, and Aaron saw through it.  And this is an aspect of the beautiful and unique connection between our parasha of Shemini and this Shabbat being the special Sabbath of the reading of the ordinance of the Red Heifer.  The Torah's exclusive antidote to the impurity of death is the sprinkling of the ashes of the Red Heifer, one of the commandments in the category of chok, meaning mitzvot, whose reasoning is beyond the realm of human understanding.  What causes the impurity of death?  What is it?  What does it represent?  The great illustrious Rav Kook writes that the impurity of death is its very falsehood, the fact that it is a lie.  It casts a debilitating illusion over our eyes and makes us think that this is the end, when in reality it is a graduation, a new stage of existence for the eternal soul, outside the physical confines of the body.  When slapped with a confrontation with death, Even those of great faith can have a momentary weakness, for it takes a powerful connection to Hashem, whose shechina in the Holy Temple is the secret of eternal life.  It takes a powerful connection to remember that death is not the end.  Torah teaches us that while the deceased has departed this life, life does not stop.  The life of the soul is neither interrupted nor suspended, but continues its existence on a whole new level.  and the world continues to exist, and the responsibility for its continued existence and rectification remains on the shoulders of the living.  The mourning process is very important, and the circle with the departed must be closed properly.  But those who remain continue to look towards the living and not to the dead, to the future and not to the past.  The mourning process has to give us the strength to draw renewed energies to accomplish in this life, and it bequeaths to us the sense of responsibility to continue the life's work of the deceased.  The second subject in our parasha deals with what is permissible to eat from among the living things.  And juxtaposed as it is with the death of Aaron's sons, perhaps it could seem trivial.  What does Hashem care?  what we eat and what we don't?  Swap up your hearts in deepest way, because just as we learned regarding the korbanot offerings, These laws are for us, and they affect us, not G-d.  This is our need, not Hashem's need.  Eating kosher is about the subjugation of the body to the soul, it's about rising above physicality and the body, it's about putting our own desires aside and allowing us to be guided by Hashem, and is one of the things that differentiate between Israel and the nations.  Nothing is haphazard about the Torah, and there is a deep connection between the two major themes of the parasha, the death of Nadav and Avihu, and kashrut.  Perhaps one level of meaning is the idea that everything we do requires great intention, kavanah.  This Hebrew word conveying the idea of intention, kavanah, is related to the word for direction, as well as the word to aim.  We are taught that we need to have proper kavanah when we pray, we need to literally aim our prayers in the right direction.  And the same is true for everything we do in this life, for every moment of our lives.  Living requires kavanah.  Everything we do, even the simplest act of going through the motions in our daily lives, should bring us closer to G-d.  And the same deep, as pure and perfect as possible, even flawless intention that we are striving for, that one must summon forth, is required to bring an offering before G-d, as Nadav and Avihu sought to do.  That's the same level of intention we must have to do to something as simple and thoughtless as eating.  Even when doing something as seemingly basic or trivial and mindless as eating, we are not eating for ourselves.  We are eating as guardians of the G-dly soul.  To eat is the same thing as to bring an offering in the Holy Temple.  Some people are always mindless, never really thoughtful, consciously in the moment.  People can eat without thinking as they do everything without thinking.  But the laws of kashrut represent a different world view than most people are used to.  It's the difference between seeing everything as being all about me, what's in it for?  It's all about me, it's my pleasure, I'm in the center, which also implies the minimization of everything else but me and my self-centered non-responsibility for both myself and the world around me.  As opposed to this, the laws of kashrut are on the wavelength of, what if everything, every thought, word and deed has significance?  What if it all means something, not only something but so much, what if everything goes somewhere and is registered with accountability and makes the mark forever, both on the individual and on the cosmos.  Indeed, everything has meaning.  Eating is a very spiritual, very powerful undertaking, with great potential for both holiness and, on the flip side, for total undoing, for a total breakdown of one's humanity.  It could be ultimate subservience of spiritual over physical, or ultimate self-gratification, selfishness and exploitation.  We are taught that every level of creation contains a divine spark that is hidden, the spiritual essence, a level of the soul of creation.  This includes everything we eat.  Torah teaches us that eating can be a powerful spiritual conduit, a potential revelation of holiness, if we elevate the divine sparks within existence within the food we eat, by eating with humility, with thankfulness, with recognition of G-d as the provider of our needs.  This is eating with proper kavanah, intention.  When we eat in this manner, we peel away the layers of concealment that cover over the holy essence, and just as the physical aspect of the food nourishes our bodies, spiritual aspect nourishes our souls, and we in turn can elevate, can literally redeem, the hidden aspect of holiness within the seemingly dormant level of the inanimate food that we eat, and thus strengthen the unity of all things in godliness.  But some foods have negative spiritual energy, and not only Can the essence of these foods not be elevated?  But they are so dense that they cause one who eats them to lose ground spiritually.  They bring a person down.  They literally cloud the mind and dull the senses, erecting a barrier between our souls and G-d.  That's what the rules of kashrut are really all about.  Everything that we do and don't do, God is telling us, is an aspect of our responsibility to Him, first and foremost an aspect of our responsibility to ourselves, to keep ourselves in a fit condition for the mission with which we've been entrusted.  In chapter 11 and verse 44 and 45 we read, For I am Hashem your G-d, you are to sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy.  For I am holy, and you shall not contaminate yourselves through any teeming thing that creeps on the earth.  For I am Hashem, who elevates you from the land of Egypt, to be a G-d to you.  You shall be holy, for I am holy.  This verse employs the word v'hit kadash tem, which we've translated here as you are to sanctify yourselves, but which really means Work at making yourselves holy.  Put all your energy into that task, and fight against anything that stands in your way.  V'hit kadash tem, make yourselves holy, and thus, he promises, you will become holy.  The opposition within you will diminish more and more, the internal struggle against your base animal drive will become less and less, so that ultimately you will reach the state when all that which is impure, that which would pull you down and away from G-d, it will have lost its attraction to you.  I am holy, G-d states, and you are to strive to reach an ideal state of freedom from the forces that bind you.  That's the reason I took you out of Egypt in the first place, for you to work at becoming holy.  And if you work at becoming holy, you shall be holy.  That's why you should work, because I am holy, and if you want to draw near me, G-d says, you have to be in harmony with me, because I am holy, you can become holy.  The life within us is the breath of life, breathed into our nostrils by G-d.  With that breath, these laws of kashrut raise Israel above physical compulsion, protecting our sensuousness from unrestrained animal passion.  G-d herein bequeaths to Israel the power of self-determination, the ability to become master over the pettiness of our own material nature.  Thus these laws beckon to us.  Thus says G-d, as I reign over the world, you can reign over yourselves.  You shall be holy, for I am holy. ",
