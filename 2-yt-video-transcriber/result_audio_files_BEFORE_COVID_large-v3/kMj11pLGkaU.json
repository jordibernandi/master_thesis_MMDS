            "text": "Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well.  Today's video is going to focus on a question that I've personally been considering a lot lately, which is what makes a great woman or even just a good woman?  And by extension, how is female greatness currently assessed in our society?  And is this assessment correct?  Firstly, it is worth noting that words like good and great aren't too commonly used nowadays.  Words such as empowered, powerful, and influential are used much more often.  But I personally think that these words have little to do with greatness.  For example, every great woman is naturally influential, at least in some small way, but not every influential woman, no matter how influential she might be, can be worthy of being considered great because influence can also be used in a negative manner.  Some of the most highly regarded qualities or quote-unquote virtues that a woman nowadays can possess seems to be having a high-powered career, especially if that career puts one in a leadership position, being financially successful, having a high social status such as a lot of followers on social media for example, fighting for the modern conception of social justice, being sexually free and liberated, being ambitious, aggressive, and unapologetic when it comes to getting what one wants, being physically strong, and lastly being independent from men.  I'm sure there are a few qualities that I've missed, so if you can think of any others, please feel free to list them in the comments.  While some of you watching this video might disagree, as I do, that these are the qualities specifically that make a woman great, it can't be denied, at the very least, that these are the qualities that our society places the most praise and focus on.  These women are great because they have political power, we say.  This woman is great because she's independent and doesn't need a man.  These women are great because they're famous.  And these women are great because they're well-educated and have high-powered careers.  While women with these attributes and accomplishments can of course also be great, greatness really doesn't have anything to do with power or success and it really doesn't have anything to do with popularity or beauty either.  It really is much more than these things and it's comprised of very different qualities many of which I'll be the very first to admit that I personally lack.  I'm not in any way trying to make this video claiming, oh yes, I have all the qualities listed.  I'm simply making it to shine a light on them because I think they're incredibly under-discussed nowadays.  Also, just as a little disclaimer, while all of these qualities are ones that, if possessed by a man, will also make him great, because they're fairly foundational and thus it's difficult to isolate them from any person who is great.  For the purposes of this video, I'm going to be exploring them from a female angle.  In no particular order, the first great quality is loyalty.  Not just towards others, but towards one's principles.  And... I mean, you would think that this would be a fairly straightforward and universally acclaimed quality, but actually, believe it or not, infidelity in regards to relationships is actually promoted nowadays, with some even being proud of their infidelity.  It's a common misconception that men, no matter their age, cheat far more often than women, but actually, the Institute for Family Studies report found that 11% of women aged 18 to 29 said they were guilty of infidelity, compared to 10% of their male counterparts.  That said, age 18 to 29 is the only age cohort in which women are more likely to say that they've cheated than men, and the gender gap quickly reverses and widens in older age groups.  Obviously, without loyalty, our relationships have little to no chance of of long-term survival, whether that relationship be romantic, professional, familial, or a friendship.  Not to mention it will make it nearly impossible for anybody to trust us or respect us.  The second aspect of being loyal is having loyalty towards ourselves, namely to our principles.  I saw a very interesting tweet on Twitter the other day that read, I was chatting with my friend's daughter who is taking a gender studies course.  She said many classmates disagree but don't speak up because they're scared they'll be accused of supporting the patriarchy.  Feminists have a black belt in shutting down others' opinions.  While I do agree that feminists have a black belt in shutting down other people's opinions, I don't necessarily think it's due to the merit of their arguments, but rather that they hold such a dominant position in our culture.  And as a result, even though many women and girls do disagree with the feminist positions, many refrain from challenging them publicly because to do so is the equivalent of ostracizing oneself.  And the unfortunate truth is that many girls would prefer to fit in with the current fashions and trends.  The last thing that we want to do is be ruffling feathers.  I mean, some of us, but the majority not.  We would mostly prefer to maintain the group harmony.  On average, men and women have different levels of self concern and other concern.  Men are, on average, more concerned about appearing to have high status and may be able to demonstrate this status by acting independently from the opinion of others.  On the other hand, and again although there are substantial individual differences among them, women are, on average, more concerned with connecting to others and maintaining group harmony.  Taken together, this means that at least when they're being observed by others, men are more likely to hold their ground, act independently, and refuse to conform, whereas women are more likely to conform to the opinions of others in order to prevent social disagreement.  These differences are less apparent when the conformity occurs in private.  Conforming to the opinions of others or even choosing to remain silent on the subject of our principles in order to prevent social disagreement.  It might save us a few instances of strife, sure.  It might spare us a few occasions of discomfort and anxiety, but it's also a betrayal of self.  And after we've stepped over this line one time, it becomes much easier to continue doing so until at some point we risk completely losing ourselves and becoming a malleable product of whatever ideology happens to be in fashion at the current time.  As Joan of Arc once wisely said, one life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it.  But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying.  The second great quality is humility.  And I think This is a quality of particular importance due to the fact that our society routinely encourages the opposite.  The mentality is that if you've got it, you should flaunt it.  Whether you're beautiful, have a fit body, are sexually successful, make a lot of money, have a lot of material goods, houses, cars, designer clothes, and so on, there is often a reward to showing these things off.  It gets you attention, praise, and perhaps thousands or even millions of social media followers.  But if you don't happen to be beautiful or physically fit or have a lot of material goods, A similar type of attention can be achieved through moral policing and virtue signaling, which, at least on the internet, seems to have devolved into a competition of sorts, a kind of battle about who can be the most woke.  This, unsurprisingly, makes the principles of those involved come off as artificial, as a strategy of pandering, with the goal being to get attention and praise from observers.  And I think this is perhaps why many of the people who routinely engage in virtue signaling, such as journalists and activists, at least in my own experience, they are some of the most slanderous and unfriendly people you will ever meet.  I recently came across a quote by Saint Augustine, which I think sums up this sort of mentality extremely well.  Humility is the foundation of all the other virtues.  Hence, in the soul in which this virtue does not exist, there cannot be any other virtue except in mere appearance.  If you're lucky enough to know a truly humble person, there's absolutely no denying what a Breath of fresh air they are, especially if these people are ones that have many talents and accomplishments of their own which would make perfect sense for them to be proud of and be bragging about all day long.  Fascinatingly enough, and also it'll probably come as a shock to no one, but studies have also shown that humble people are a lot more attractive than those who are not.  A series of experiments published by the Journal of Positive Psychology revealed that people found potential partners with higher humility more attractive than those with low humility scores.  One study showed a small sample of respondents' dating profiles.  with varying levels of humility based on a computer assessment.  Participants were more likely to share their profiles and phone numbers with the highly humble potential partner than the less humble dating partner.  The third great quality is charity, which if one is charitable, I think they're also very likely to be nurturing and compassionate.  Admittedly though, this quality is a bit tricky nowadays given that it's become so politicized.  Many people, not just women, but many people in general have become very selective with their kindness, choosing to spend it only on those who they agree with politically, religiously, and so on.  And everybody else, everybody who they disagree with, they might as well be dirt on the sidewalk.  I personally find it very ironic how feminists go on all day long about what a big problem misogyny is.  Because in my entire life, I have never been treated worse than I have by women, most of which are feminists, who disagree with my views.  While it's perfectly fine to detest another person's views, to find them immoral, repugnant, and worthy of criticism, I don't think that disagreement should in any way affect how you treat another person as a human being.  The fourth and final great quality, the ability to be self-sacrificing, is I think perhaps one of the most important qualities, yet at the same time one of the most difficult qualities to master, At least it is for me.  No matter what we choose to dedicate ourselves to in life, whether it be marriage and motherhood or a career, it will inevitably require a lot of sacrifice.  On the one hand, it's in our nature to want to be happy, to stay when things are good and to leave as soon as they get too hard.  We're constantly chasing happiness in people, material things, personal goals, and so on.  But at the end of the day, happiness is temporary.  And without the willingness to sacrifice, None of our goals will come to fruition and none of our relationships will last.  Perhaps one of the reasons why it's so difficult to be self-sacrificing nowadays, particularly when it comes to other people, is because our society leaves little room for it.  For example, sacrificing for somebody puts you beneath them in a way, in a serving position.  And this completely goes against the narrative of being strong and powerful.  Even though, if we're being honest, it takes much more strength to be self-sacrificing than it does to be selfish.  Once again though, I don't think that greatness can ultimately or even accurately be defined by the size of one's fan base, bank account, their appearance, career level, or professional credentials, although these qualities certainly aren't disqualifiers.  As I said previously, successful, famous, and attractive women can absolutely be great.  This video is in no way meant to be harsh towards a particular type of woman.  It's as much directed towards me as it is towards any of them.  And on that note, I've actually met a ton of wonderful women, particularly over the past few years, who I greatly admire and respect.  in politics, at church, in my general social circle, and they've helped me in ways that I can't even begin to list.  I've also been blessed enough to have an incredible mother and four incredible sisters who embody many of the great qualities that I mentioned in this video.  Lucky for me, though, they're not the sort of people who just tell you how to be good.  They show you.  And these, I think, are truly the greatest type of women.  Not the preachers, or worse, the women who preach but secretly do the opposite, but the women who lead others to do good by setting an example.  Of course this doesn't mean there's no room for error, that you're not allowed to slip up from time to time.  Failing to live up to your beliefs doesn't make you a hypocrite so long as you get back up and try again.  I realize that there are many other great qualities that I could have mentioned in this video such as honesty, forgiveness, gratefulness, but I think the ones that I did mention build a really strong foundation upon which many of these other virtues will naturally follow.  I would add though that of course all of these good qualities are far easier talked about than actually possessed.  It's certainly never easy to be good, particularly due to the fact that our culture encourages serving oneself over others, and also because we, for the most part, lost our sense of community, which can do a great deal to teach, help, and encourage one another.  What tends to help me personally is to find a role model that's far better than me, which, if we're being honest here, it's not that hard to do.  Whether it's somebody that I know like a family member, friend, or mentor, or perhaps even somebody that's long been dead, and working to incorporate the virtues that they have.  Because in doing this, even if we'll never be great ourselves, we're at least working in that direction rather than remaining stagnant or regressing.  And with that said, I will end this video with a super short clip from the wonderful Fulton Sheen.  It's a clip about women, and even if you don't agree with the clip, which, you know, it's perfectly fine, it at least offers some very interesting food for thought. ",

That is why we have to explain things to children by bringing it down to the level of their minds.  But when we love something, we always have to go out to meet it.  For example, if we love music, we have to meet the demands of music.  We study a foreign language, we have to follow its laws.  Even if we study ping-pong, we have to meet its requirements, too.  Now, inasmuch as woman is loved, it follows that the nobler a woman is, the nobler man will have to be.  to be deserving of that love.  That is why the level of any civilization is always the level of its womanhood. ",
