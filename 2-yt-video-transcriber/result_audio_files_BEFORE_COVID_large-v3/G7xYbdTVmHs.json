            "text": "well it's late at night.  i'm feeling kind of sleepy.  life's been rough in the real world for gundam but no one cares about that.  they demand their content.  i read the emails.  where is the content gundam?  where is he?  where is he?  talk to me pal where who's the guy with the?  Anyway, all jokes aside, I was going to do a video, I guess I'll save it for later, came out months ago, where female-to-male transsexuals learn there's no such thing as male privilege.  I read some of it and laughed my balls off, because I knew this chick I dated, who was talking about going trans, and I told her, like, listen, you'd be a fucking fool to do it.  You'd be a fucking fool.  You're gonna open a door you can't turn back on.  Once you go in, there's no going back.  But anyway, I'll save that for later.  Because if I talk about it now, that's what I'll be talking about.  Since people love me watching Twitch and hating my life so much, here I am again.  Apparently, people sent me this a couple times.  It's this female Twitch streamer, right?  I can't even remember her name.  Oh, sorry, this site was playing like a little clip of Richard Lewis talking to some Twitch guy who was sitting there going, there's no special treatment for female streamers.  It's just angry guys making it up.  Sure.  Sure it is.  Because I like making up stories like this.  If I was going to make up a fucking story, I'd tell people, I can turn into a falcon and will.  And then chicks would go, oh my God, he's like David Bowie.  As I do my Bowie dance, looking like a gay chicken, but somehow it worked for women.  Anyway, this girl called Ivory Love, I probably said that wrong, was banned on Twitch for using a phone as a sex toy.  That's right, children.  The same thing you'd see on Shatterbait.  You know, when those chicks had that little pink thingy that has the wire that sticks out.  Gundam, you know a lot about this because I watch the videos, obviously, and I whack my beef.  I beat my dick like it broke into my house.  What are you doing here?  Anyway, so much like those chatterbait girls, she did something similar with her phone and just lets it play.  Fuck you.  Fuck this site.  I'm so sick of this shit.  These motherfuckers.  So anyway, this chick starts fighting with her phone, wiggling around, yelling at it.  the same way I yell at my phone.  What is it with all these gamer girls and Zelda?  What the fuck is that?  Have you ever noticed all these gamer girls on Twitch all like Zelda?  It's like the go-to, for God's sakes.  It's kind of like when you go to the average person and go, what's your favorite baseball team?  And they're all like, the New York Yankees.  So let's watch the clip together, children.  No!  Stop it!  Okay, I'm not even gonna play the music because I know I'll get copyright claimed for this piece of shit rap song.  Alright, she's stuffing it in her pantalones.  I've been using the Rosetta Stone for Spanish.  Look at that.  She's arched it right there.  That's full contact.  She's got a fupa.  She's totally got a fupa.  She's playing that shit up.  It's totally vibrating.  My neck, suck it off my back.  And come, nigga, make sure I keep busting.  Busting, my nigga.  I got nothing for that.  She gets on camera.  She should have said it with an M. You can get away with that.  You can say my nippers.  She could have got away with that.  She went the full fucking tilt right there.  And the funny thing is, she's not worried about her cell phone directly on her cooch vibrating.  And she gyrates around to my neck, my back, lick my pussy and my crack.  She wasn't worried about that.  But when she dropped the N-bomb, she's like, don't ban me, Twitch.  She knew where the real trouble was.  Oh, my God.  Fucking.  She does look like a mess, though.  Like her hair is a mess.  She's kind of.  She's not the best of shape.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not trying to be an asshole, but that was a full fupa.  Just hanging over those underpants.  Shamelessly wiggling.  She was feeling herself.  She was feeling her oats.  She was like, yeah, I'm funny.  I'm cute and funny.  It's me.  It's a little Riri.  Guess how long she's banned for?  Oh, by the way, this was on Easter Sunday.  So is that like happy birthday, Jesus?  Or is that the return of Christ?  The sequel.  If you guess she was only banned for one day, you'd be correct.  That's all.  One day.  That is it's.  it's fucking funny.  I got nothing for it.  You know how Twitch rolls.  You already know how Twitch rolls.  This is like what we live with.  This is the world we're in.  As a bonus clip, my new favorite Twitch streamer, Sweet Salty Peach.  You know what the hell that name's a euthymism for.  Peach, you get it?  Sweet and salty peach.  Get it?  Oral sex for a woman if you don't know.  Oh my.  What is it?  Her and ST Peach, two chicks using a name that you know what it really means.  It's been banned before.  Unfortunately, I could not find this clip, dude.  It was a cooking stream, right?  She was wearing see-through short shorts.  She got a great ass.  You got the full fucking Mountie if you catch my drift.  Unfortunately, even screen caps of it have been censored.  You fucking asshole.  I was searching for this fucking clip of her bare ass.  You would have thought I was looking for the cure for cancer.  I need help.  Anyway, she's in trouble again because she's wearing super short shorts.  It's real quick.  Let's pause this still.  Let me slow motion rewind.  Oh, yeah, that she's wearing a total thong.  Those are some very sexy panties.  You're doing a fucking up.  I'm sorry.  I quit doing drugs.  I'm clean.  I gotta get my kick somewhere, baby.  It's been too long.  my sweet monkey, how was your trip?  Mmm, you're looking scrumptious.  Oh No, don't wear shorts, baby.  Don't hide your goods.  Oh I'm happy to see you, baby.  Oh, this is the greatest stream ever.  Feels good to be back, right, guys?  It's good to see you, sweetie.  Please don't get banned again, guys.  I cannot get banned again because then I'll just never be on Twitch forever.  No!  I will make sure you never get banned, baby.  Aw, thank you so much, 16theBall.  Mark's here, Gameboy's here.  I'd love to put lotion all over your buttocks.  I'd eat your ass for muscular dystrophy.  She is cute, though.  That's a fucking shame.  You know she's only on this site because it's easy money.  She knows it.  You look at this girl's Instagram, and it's the typical Instagram of a wannabe model chick.  Beautiful photos, landscapes, half naked all the time.  Everything involves being in a bikini of some sorts.  Oh, there goes a full naked shot, obviously.  Ass photos, as you should.  Oh, more nudity.  Fantastic.  This is high art.  It really is.  Jesus Christ.  You know what?  She's doing this for money.  Before you know it, she's going to be in Saudi Arabia.  She'll be in fucking Dubai.  And you know why.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, Google it.  Instagram models in Dubai.  You will be shocked.  I need to put it into this.  While searching for sweet and sour peaches see-through underpants, I then came up across a girl named May.  Legendary May or something like that.  Anyway, she's on... Holy shit.  Dude, that's full-on... Yeah, that's full-on puss, dude.  That is... That's full nudity right there.  How does she miss that?  How does she miss... Why is she wearing shorts?  this ripped up and then goes off-camera... How do you expect that to hide anything?  Jesus Christ.  Let me have a shot of whiskey.  I'm the passenger.  That's full on.  That's a full slip right there, bro.  Oh my God.  I wonder how long she been.  This chick still has a Twitch account.  She still has a Twitch.  Good God.  It's full pussy exposure.  God damn.  I bet you if like my nuts slipped out in a stream, I would have been banned for life.  I'd have been banned.  Jeff Bezos lawyers would have handed me a cease and desist.  They would have been like, since your nuts were exposed, don't even use Amazon Prime, you son of a bitch.  Soda Poppin?  Soda Poppin gave this chick $920?  Fuckin' A, dude.  She wouldn't get shit from me.  Only way a chick's getting money out of me is if she tricks me into a relationship.  And later somehow tricks me into marriage.  That's the only way a woman's getting my money.  And even then, I'm gonna fight it tooth and nail.  Alright, to end this, I'm going to go off on my favorite streamer because someone sent me a clip of this.  It's AmiWami.  Telling you freaks that her father said he has seven guns.  for Easter.  And my dad was like, so how's the streaming life treating you?  And I was like, I mean, it's okay.  Just some weirdos in my DMs being like, tell them your dad has seven guns ready to go.  And I was like, whoa!  Why do you have so many guns?  And he was like, your grandfather died and I got all the guns.  And I was like, ah!  Now, the funny thing that Amaranth forgets to tell her father about the freaks that DM her is the fact that her Twitter, honest to God, is like softcore porn.  How the fuck do you not expect to get weird DMs if you're doing shit like this all the time?  Oh, come to my Patreon.  Look at my titties.  Oh, my God.  I'm a bad little rabbit.  Oh, what do you expect?  It's like fucking leaving garbage in your backyard or food and then getting mad at the raccoons for coming.  You are feeding the thirst.  She knows there are dudes that are so fucking thirsty for her that they don't even live in a realm of reality.  I have been exposed to some of them.  I watched one dude watch her stream while wearing a horse head and wiggling and gyrating around.  And I left him alone because he looked like he had a mental disability.  It's how kind Gundam is.  Even though it would have been perfect to point out she was willing to manipulate a dude who's mentally disabled for money.  But whatever, you know, I'm the dirtbag here.  Isn't that right, YouTube?  Let's demonetize me.  Let's put me on the blacklist.  Just exposing women doing bad things.  I have half a mind to claim that I'm gay and trans just so I can get away with saying the truth.  They'd just be like, oh, look, he's spilling the tea.  He's spilling the tea.  You know, people would defend me if I was gay.  But since I'm straight, and I'm telling it like it is, Jesus, holy shit.  Nice manipulation there.  Cutting off the picture right below, just right above the nips.  Good lord, was she gonna sit on this cake?  Is that, really?  Really?  That's total fetish, dude.  That's total fetish.  This is fetish stuff right here.  I can't believe this shit.  I cannot believe it.  Dad, freakish guys send me DMs.  Tell them that your father has seven guns.  Dad, I forgot to tell you that I like to rub my ass over a fucking cake and it makes dudes horny and crazy.  No wonder they're sending you dirty DMs.  Get me out of here.  I had enough.  Just ten minutes of this shit and I'm already ready to call it quits.  I'm ready to tap out.  Where's Thanos?  Give me the Infinity Gauntlet.  I'll snap the finger twice.  End it all.  Sorry, Fluffy.  Sorry.  Forgot I had the dog respond to snaps.  That was stupid.  False alarm, Fluffy.  We're not getting rid of half of humanity.  You know what?  Rate, comment, and subscribe this hateful piece of shit.  Because I need it.  You're the only thing keeping YouTube from burying me.  What?  Hopefully that's good news.  I hope that's the mostly on paper, boy. ",
