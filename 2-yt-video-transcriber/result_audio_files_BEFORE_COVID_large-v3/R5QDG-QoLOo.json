And there's been a lot of pundits in the mainstream media who really aren't too excited about Bernie Sanders.  But with that being said, My favorite bad take from the media, of course, came from Fox News, which is just a bad take machine.  And they covered Bernie Sanders in the way that we'd expect them to cover Bernie Sanders by fearmongering about socialism. ",

Socialism is great at promising something, but has no idea how to fulfill the promise, which is why it always ends up in coercion, misery, and ultimately death.  You can look at Venezuela, Cuba, Cambodia, East Germany, Ethiopia, Romania, Poland, USSR.  The only sad thing is all of socialism is ugly and disgusting, but Bernie is likable.

            "text": "So, there were so many gems in that really quick segment, and by gems, I mean mind-numbingly stupid statements by Greg Gutfeld.  And, you know, we're not just gonna dwell on the stupidity here because this is all what we'd expect from Fox News because the response from another panelist is what I really want to focus on, but let's just take a moment to go over what Greg Gutfeld says here.  Quote, his platform only ends in misery.  He also says socialism ends up in coercion, misery, and ultimately death.  I mean, if you're going to do propaganda, you maybe don't want to be that hyperbolic, so it's actually believable, but nonetheless, you know, suit yourself.  His evidence here for that, by the way, is Venezuela, Cuba, Cambodia, and other countries who all tried socialism and have failed.  But in actuality, Bernie Sanders isn't trying to replicate those models of socialism.  He's a very moderate social democrat who's modeling his policies after the likes of Scandinavian countries, where social democracy is incredibly successful.  Denmark.  Norway, Sweden, those countries.  And furthermore, if you're going to fearmonger about someone like Bernie Sanders, then you also have to explain how there's basically a social democratic party in every single European country.  And that's because social democracy is something that isn't even controversial.  It's only controversial in the United States.  where we have a right-wing Overton window.  But nonetheless, I mean, Greg Gutfeld, he's now going to try to explain this from a position of someone who wants to educate his audience because he is a bad faith actor.  And then he says, even though socialism is bad, Bernie is likable.  And the implication is that because Bernie is likable, and since we're so enamored with Bernie Sanders, we can't see the danger that he actually poses in actuality.  But no that's not it.  it's not that we're enamored with bernie sanders because of his likability.  we're enamored with the policies he's talking about because when bernie sanders says hey our neighbors north of the border have medicare for all so why can't we have it?  that makes sense.  when he says maybe it's the case that you know four-year colleges are now equal to what high school diplomas were a couple of decades ago, and maybe we should make college free, that makes sense.  So it's the policies that we're enamored with, not his likability and charisma, because Bernie Sanders, as Kyle Kalinske puts it, he has anti-charisma.  You see him for what it is.  He's just an old man who wants to give us healthcare and education, and that's it.  But I want to get to the real point in why I'm even talking about this, because, you know, if you're on Fox News, the goal ultimately is to do propaganda at the behest of the Republican Party.  But Juan Williams comes in and he completely drops a bomb on this segment and it goes off the rails for all the right reasons because he actually comes to Bernie Sanders' defense and basically tells you all the things that I just told you about.

First of all, Juan, you're wrong.  whoa whoa whoa juan juan juan.  let's let's just stop.  okay be quiet.  let katie talk because you're making too much sense and if you'll recall this is fox news and we're doing an anti bernie propaganda segment.  so katie please explain why juan is wrong here.  I mean, the minute he really starts hammering them, he gets cut off.  And this is what you'd expect from Fox News.  It's not the first time that it happened because the host there was supposed to reign him in and she was doing just that.  And what's interesting is.  He actually set off this entire discussion by using a particular trigger word, the far right, because he brought up Bernie Sanders and talked about how Bernie Sanders never feeds into the far right narrative about socialism.  And that was a trigger to Greg Gutfeld, who said, well, look, it's not the far right who are against socialism, it's just people who are normal, which is when Juan Williams proceeded to dismantle Greg Gutfeld's bullshit argument, saying, I don't think you want to say that there are no normal people in Denmark, Norway, England, Germany, France, and I don't think you want to say there's no normal people in the United States who back Social Security, Medicare, the VA.  And that right there is exactly how you want to respond to when somebody starts being disingenuous and alarmist and starts fear-mongering about socialism.  Ask them if they like the socialist social security that is keeping their grandmother from sliding into homelessness and poverty.  Ask them if they like the socialist paved roads that they drive on.  Ask them if they like the socialist fire department.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  And Greg Gutfeld tried to give himself cover by saying, no, I support a safety net, but I just don't support Bernie Sanders' brand of socialism.  What is his brand of socialism?  Social democracy.  basically saying we look out for the people.  And we have a more mixed economy where we remove the profit incentive from industries that actually can harm us, like healthcare.  Like, there shouldn't be a profit motive in healthcare.  The goal should just be the delivery of healthcare.  And if you disagree with that, then you're the radical, Greg.  Because 70% of the American people now, including 52% of the base of the party that you do propaganda for, agrees with us, not you.  Now, what's interesting is that Katie went on to correct the record in this next clip here after she stopped Juan Williams, and since Juan Williams did so much damage to the argument that Greg Gutfeld was pushing, she had to really basically undo the damage, so she ramped up the fear-mongering.  And she said just the most ridiculous things I've seen with regard to this talk of socialism.  Because it's no longer just that Bernie Sanders wants to, you know, inadvertently turn us into Venezuela.  No, he likes Venezuela.  That's actually what she said.  Take a look. ",
