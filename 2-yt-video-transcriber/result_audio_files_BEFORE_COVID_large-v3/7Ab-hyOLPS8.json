Of the declared candidates, Harris consistently polled in second place behind Senator Bernie Sanders and ahead of Beto O'Rourke, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Cory Booker, and Senator Amy Klobuchar.  April, however, was a different story as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vice President Joe Biden entered the race.  Immediately, Biden and Mayor Pete rose above Harris in the polls, and eventually she was even passed by Senator Warren.  While Harris' polling average didn't rise, it didn't fall either.  In other words, Harris needed a boost, and the first Democratic presidential debate was her ticket out of the doldrums.  Watch how she deftly used this totally unscripted and off-the-cuff one-liner.

Then in late October, it was reported that Harris's campaign closed three out of four offices in New Hampshire and laid off more than a dozen field organizers.  Then there were these three articles about the campaign that talked about dysfunction, a lack of direction, and a power struggle between campaign manager Juan Rodriguez and campaign chair Maya Harris, Kamala's sister.  The New York Times also reported that extensive polling led her to believe that there was great value in the word truth.  So she titled her 2018 memoir, The Truths We Hold, and made a similar phrase the centerpiece of her early stump speech.  And that phrase was, let's speak truth.  Boy, did she use it. ",
