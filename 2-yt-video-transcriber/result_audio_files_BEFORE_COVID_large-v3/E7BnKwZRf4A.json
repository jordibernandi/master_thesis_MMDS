            "text": "All right.  Nasty Nathaniel out here in the city of Los Angeles.  And right now I'm going to be conducting a First Amendment audit of Paramount Studios.  We're going to make sure that our friends at Paramount respect and honor the rights of a free citizen to record in public.  So yeah, here it is, Paramount.  Got a security booth over there.  I was across the street earlier, now I'm on the studio side.  But I'm on a public sidewalk, I'm not on their property.  There's the guard there, checking people in.  Not quite sure if he's noticed me yet.  Got some cars coming out.  This is a look inside.  Sign right there, lets me know exactly where I am.  Another look at the guard booth there.  Now, so far, no contact.  I've only been here a few minutes.  The audit's still young.  The guard again.  Got a Buick and a Honda.  Maybe I should go out at a car lot, keep mentioning all the cars.  He doesn't look happy.  Maybe he got denied the part that he auditioned for in the new Tom Cruise movie or something.  Some people waiting to go inside there.  And there is the famous Paramount Water Tower with the Paramount logo painted on the side of it.  A little history behind that logo.  Co-founder William Wadsworth Hotskin chose the mountain because he said it reminded him of his youth spent in Utah.  And the stars, which were representations of the original actors and actresses that were put under contract at Paramount in 1916 by co-founder Adolph Zukoff.  Hopefully I'm not butchering his name, but yeah.  There's a little history lesson for y'all.  So some famous movies have been filmed at the Paramount lot.  They got this green here.  that's surrounding the property.  But anyways, movies like Sunset Boulevard, The Godfather, Airplane and Chinatown with Jack Nicholson.  Those are some of the famous movies that were shot here.  And interesting enough, if you've ever seen Coming to America with Eddie Murphy, in the beginning when they show the Paramount Mountain, there's a shot that actually goes over the mountain and then the opening credits begin.  That was something that was kind of different.  And something that I learned about Paramount is that they actually give tours here.  You can actually come and take a tour of the studio lot.  See, I wasn't lying.  They do actually give tours here at Paramount.  Unlike at CBS, where I guess they're not as open to the public as they are here at Paramount.  Nice little look into the studio.  We got somebody over there, maybe a sound guy.  Maybe this van's going to come out.  I moved over to another gate.  Maybe we'll see some action.  Maybe we'll see some movie stars.  Maybe Tom Cruise will come strolling out.  Tell me I'm not allowed to take his picture without his permission?  We got this entrance here.  Saw some people coming out and they left the door open.  See any security guard, anybody here?  Says it's the... Gower entrance.  That looks like there's a maybe a guard in that window right there.  Stand over here don't want to block the egress.  Oh, yeah, have a good day.  Somebody else coming out here?  Maybe she's telling on you.  Hi!  Uh oh, she's gone.  Oh no, I think I scared her off.  Another gate here.  Oh, this is kind of cool.  Oh, yeah, this would be a cool shot right here.  Oh, wow.  Nice look into the lot there.  The sound stages are.  Got a guy on a bike.  Howdy.  Somebody getting off work?  Howdy.  There's another bike guy.  All right.  There we go.  Stopping at security.  All right, there we go.  Boom.  Here, let me hand that to you.  There you go, sir.  Have a good one.  Leonard Nimoy Way.  I don't need to tell you who Leonard Nimoy is or was.  So I'm over here at the Lemon Grove Gate.  This is on the corner of Lemon Grove and Van Ness Avenue.  This lot is huge.  It covers quite a bit of area.  Ah, it looks like a manual door.  Huh, that's interesting.  I would think Paramount would have a bit more fancier technology, but I guess not.  But yeah, that's kind of interesting.  People are like manually opening the door themselves.  That's different.  Not something you see every day, but you know, you learn something new every time you do one of these things.  It's like a common sight that you see at these film studios, these like golf cart looking type things.  I guess it's because the lots are so big, they use these to maneuver around to get from one side of the property to the other.  That and bicycles.  Got a security guard in there.  He's hard at work.  Checking people in.  Can I help you?  No, I'm fine.  Thank you.  Can I have your ID?  No.  Then get lost.  No, I don't have to.  I'm on public property.  This is a public sidewalk.  You cannot take pictures of the lot.  Yes, I can.  I can take anything I see from a public vantage point.  Learn the law.  Now he's closing the gate.  Oh yeah, tough guy.  Oh, Mr.  Tough Guy over there is calling somebody.  Wonder who he's calling.  Maybe he's gonna bring some Scientology goons over here to deal with me.  Oh, look at that.  Wow, what a crybaby.  Now, people can't get in because... Or I guess they can.  Security over there, and then... Looks like an LAPD motor unit, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Probably working some overtime.  It's probably like a overtime assignment.  Then we got these big production trucks.  You see them when they go out to do shoots.  They're gonna shoot a film or something like that.  Kind of neat.  It really shows you like what goes into the making of a motion picture.  Yeah, talking about millions of dollars.  How you doing?  Good, thank you.  So yeah, there it is.  What I find kind of interesting is that the security guard over there at the Lemon Grove gate was trying to say that I wasn't allowed to take pictures of the studio and he was going to call somebody and I just walked past an LAPD motor unit who Didn't try to stop me.  Pointed my camera right at him.  Now don't you think if what I was doing was illegal?  Don't you think that officer would have said, excuse me sir, stop right there.  Another example of a security guard doesn't know the law.  Truck going in there.  Alright, now I'm over here at the Van Ness Gate.  And... Let's see, let's see what they do over here.  I think it might just be that one guy who's.  maybe he's having a bad day.  Maybe somebody spiked his coffee or whatnot, but there's security right there.  And gates opening up there.  Letting the big truck inside, letting everybody inside that's trying to go in.  Hi.  How's it going?  Good.  How's it going?  You're going.  Huh?  Where are you going?  Filming Paramount.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  Is this like a special assignment for?  Yeah.  I hear a lot of, what do you call it?  I've talked to some LAPD officers.  They say that these kind of like when you do security at the film, when they're doing like a film or something, that this is like an overtime assignment.  It is.  Oh, okay.  So you're probably working on your day off then.  I've got a lot of days off right now.  But anyway, yeah, we come out here when they're out and about, make sure they don't get in trouble.  People are buying by the traffic laws and all that.  Traffic, you know.  All right, well, cool.  All right, well, have a good day.  Where are you from?  Huh?  Where are you from?  I'm from around here.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Yeah, I just wanted to... It's Paramount.  I wanted to check it out.  Oh, Paramount.  Been here since 1910 or something?  Yeah, there's a lot.  I've been to a lot of the famous studios.  I was at CBS the other day, Studio Center, and then at Warner Brothers, and they were really nice at Warner Brothers.  They weren't so friendly at Disneyland.  Not Disneyland, but no.  Disney Studios over in Burbank.  I know.  Yeah, they didn't like it too much, but all right.  Well, have a good day.  You too.  Appreciate it.  See you.  More of these golf carts, things.  People who are, I guess, make sure nobody brings in anything they're not supposed to.  such as some Scud missile launchers.  Hi, how are you doing?  Good, how are you?  Good.  Is this the Paramount?  Is this the VIP lot?  Uh, no.  Oh, okay.  You got some nice tats.  Thanks.  Ah, cool.  I just, I like arts.  Oh, okay.  Sorry about that.  I didn't mean that.  No, I just wanted to check out the studio.  Thanks for being professional.  The guard at the Lemon Grove gate was kind of giving me a hard time.  Oh, was he?  But yeah, everybody else was fine with it, you know.  As long as you don't come on, I don't care.  Yeah, cool.  No, no, you know.  All right, well, have a good day.  Take care.  I'm over here at the Bronson gate.  looks like i've hit just about every gate here and they oh yeah they definitely got something going on there got the camera crane.  god can you imagine what that?  what that kind of stuff costs the money that goes into something like this.  but yeah Well, they're leaving me alone over here.  I think maybe somebody got the call by now.  Maybe Mr.  Lemongrove, tough guy.  Maybe somebody said something to him.  Well, I'm going to go ahead and wrap this audit up.  Everyone here was pretty cool, except for that one security guard.  It's funny how one person can ruin an audit with their behavior.  but hey um i'm not really sure what to call this.  uh you know i'm gonna let you guys decide.  is it a pass?  is it a fail?  you decide so please.  uh let me know how you think paramount pictures did nasty nathaniel saying thank you for watching.  please uh don't forget to like subscribe comment all that groovy stuff.
