            "text": "Canada has an identity crisis.  Okay, let's be a little bit more clear.  White, anglophone Canadians have an identity crisis.  And this isn't just me saying that, there's quite a bit of scholarship on this.  The reason is, Canada doesn't really have a national concept.  As a country, it's actually several nations built upon the genocide of several more.  White, anglophone Canadians trace their roots back to refugees from the American Revolution.  Often what passes for identity is how not American we can be, while acting almost exactly like them.  So, if your origin story is from a culture which you then through historical circumstance actively reject, you're left\u2026 hollow.  But hey, did you know that doesn't stop Canadian nationalism from being a thing?  And not just people in reflective vests who say that we don't hate Muslims, oppress indigenous people, or destroy the fundamental life support systems of the planet fast enough.  But if you have a hollow identity, how do you create nationalism?  Well, that part's easy.  We just make a really big deal out of an insignificant war.  we won.  Okay, kind of won.  All right, it was a draw.  But that would be transparent and dumb, wouldn't it?  Fire!  Learn more about the War of 1812.  Visit 1812.gc.ca.  Welcome to Step Back, where we use the past to understand today.  I'm Tristan Johnson, and let's talk about the War of 1812.  Who's ready to talk about a war that was extremely insignificant, but for some reason make a really big deal out of it?  Honestly, the reasons for the war were numerous.  Neither the Americans or British played nice with each other after the American Revolution.  Most of the debate about whose fault it is for starting the conflict comes down to which factors you think are more important.  The British had been trying to stick it to the Americans since the Revolution.  Britain had acted in ways which Americans saw as violations of their brand new sovereignty.  One example was the British impressed American sailors.  This doesn't mean they wowed them with the quality of their hardtack and salted pork.  Impressment is a recruitment technique.  And by recruitment technique, I mean kidnapping sailors to serve in the Navy.  Britain expanded its fleet in the war against Napoleon and turned to press gangs to man those ships.  But this is just one of many nasty spats on the high seas.  The American trade fleet increasing made the British nervous about competition.  Worse, the Americans declared themselves neutral in the war with Napoleon.  So yeah, British and American ships were clashing with each other all across the Atlantic.  The British also made efforts to limit American expansion.  One of many reasons why the American Revolution happened in the first place was anger over Britain restricting their ability to go into indigenous territory and steal their land.  After the war, the British continued to arm their native allies in places like Ohio to curb American expansion.  The British plan was to make an indigenous state in the area, but let's be honest, they were ready to abandon them pretty soon in the peace deal of the war anyway.  This was the last chance for the indigenous people of the region to have hope of their own homeland, and yep.  All gone.  Most of the time, Canadians will ignore all of these and focus on manifest destiny.  There were a few vocal American politicians who advocated the British territory, which would become Canada, should belong to America.  They framed it as a second American revolution.  They'd be welcomed as liberators and push the British off the continent, blissfully ignorant that most of the English people living in Canada were loyalist refugees from the first revolution.  Not to mention, many Americans were grumpy about the idea of absorbing a bunch of French-speaking Catholics.  Because the British were so occupied with Napoleon, the Americans saw this moment as an opportunity to put them on the back foot before they could rally people over the Atlantic for a sideshow.  Because yeah, the British were a massive empire.  They could crush the Americans, and they would, with only a small fraction of their forces.  So the British and the Americans had themselves a little war.  It was super cool with like cannons and muskets and stuff.  There was a Laura Secord, who I think smuggled chocolate into Quebec, and a war hero named Tecumseh, who led a scrappy army of indigenous soldiers against the Americans who tragically died in battle.  You guys know the deal at this point, but if you're new to Step Back, you'll know that I'm not really a arrows and maps type of historian.  You can go and watch Kings and Generals or something else for that.  The end of the war was a draw.  No territory changed hands.  But the Americans did get a promise that we would no longer harass them.  The British razed Washington,  D.C.,  including, yes... burning down the White House, and torching part of Congress.  Canadians love to rub this one in American's faces, I say as a Canadian.  We tend to ignore.  we also burned tons of Thomas Jefferson's personal book collection, which was a massive loss for historians.  Also, some people think it could have been worse, but And I can't believe this is a thing, a tornado hit DC and wrecked a bunch of the city, forcing the British to leave.  Now, what Americans remember of this war is a major British defeat called the Battle of New Orleans.  Which, by the way, was not that important of a battle in the scope of the war.  It occurred after a truce was already signed, but the British fleet didn't get the orders since they were at sea.  What it did do is make a war hero out of Andrew Jackson.  He'd leveraged this to become president, and more or less found the Democratic Party.  So... There's that. ",

            "text": "Okay, in the United States, there's usually not a lot of emphasis in most curriculums about the War of 1812.  I mean, it does depend on which state you live in.  I live in Kansas and so we don't focus much on it.  Usually when we do focus on it, it's the Battle of New Orleans because, of course, You know, Andrew Jackson and the ragtag bunch that is all heroic as huge underdogs against the big bad British.  But yeah, so it's not really given much attention down here in the United States.  And as a matter of fact, most Americans probably don't don't know anything about the War of 1812 other than perhaps the year it started.  And what's crazy is that the Star-Spangled Banner, which of course every patriotic American knows all the words to, a lot of Americans don't realize that the words for that song came from Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812.  So yeah, if you want to learn more about American history and I guess less about the War of 1812, check out my channel. ",

            "text": "Honestly, the war isn't that big of a deal in the grand scope of things.  Americans barely teach it, and the British treat it like it's a small sideshow of the Napoleonic War.  But not Canada.  We stood side by side.  and won the fight for Canada.  Canada makes a huge deal about this two-year war.  We have reenactments, tourist attractions, and names on high schools.  The absurdity hit fever pitch when the bicentennial went down back in 2012.  It went down with maybe Canada's most right-wing prime minister, Stephen Harper.  So this tiny war in which no territory changed hands and neither belligerent really teaches turned into this.  200 years ago, The United States invaded our territory.  But we defended our land.  Oh yes, the Harper government tried to reinterpret Canadian identity behind 19th century nostalgia, British loyalism, and of course, no small part, military jingoism.  Which makes perfect sense in a country that is well known for its peacekeeping efforts, and in which more than one in five of its citizens are foreign born.  Way to go, champ.  Also, it was an attempt to build a universal identity around a country where every province hates every other province.  A unified nationalism around a war which occurred primarily in Ontario and Quebec, two provinces the other eight are huge fans of.  And don't worry, even Ontario and Quebec enjoy hating each other.  Heck, I even pitched to Mr.  B. You can watch it on his channel right now.  Go and... Just take in the blood feud going on in the comments.  I warned you, Mr.  Beat.  I warned you.  But you see, building a nationalism around something so silly shows just how ridiculous but also dangerous it is.  It attempts to construct a narrative, but that narrative is only in place so that a very privileged group can create an exclusionary militarist identity and then also push a very right-wing agenda.  Today, it's imbibing that excellent flavor of white nationalism all the kids in America are talking about.  And with, as of this recording, three new far-right provincial governments and a really, really dumb election this fall, things are looking grim.  Nationalism is a consuming ideology which uses oppression and even genocide to make an exclusionary identity.  that leaves a lot of people out.  It suppresses individuality.  Canada often sold itself on its multiculturalism and it seems people are ditching that.  Nationalism is festering in Canada and around the world and it has already led to some pretty scary stuff.  It was during evening prayers on Sunday that witnesses say gunmen opened fire on 40 worshippers inside.  The past weekend I went to Carrefour Laval and a woman working there refused to serve me.  She said I'm not going to serve you if you are a veal.  According to Statistics Canada, hate crimes nearly doubled in the last few months.  Canada's strength, when it lives up to its own ideals, is that this is a country where you're able to be free to express yourself and be yourself no matter what it is.  It could be whether you have a different religion, a different ethnicity, a different culture, or you love somebody different, or you come from a different perspective.  You're welcome here. ",
