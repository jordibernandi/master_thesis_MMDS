            "text": "Let's take the problematic word objective out of that for a minute and repeat.  Without a reference point, this astronaut in space can't tell what's up or down.  Presumably, the astronaut in this scene will choose the Earth as his reference point, and presumably choose to think of North as up and South as down.  Once he has chosen, he can use this reference point to objectively identify other objects as up or down in relation to the reference point.  In relation to a north-oriented Earth, the circular object in this scene is objectively up.  But, note that the reference point itself was chosen entirely subjectively.  The astronaut could have chosen the south pole to be up, or chose the wheel thing for his point of reference, or the moon, or the sun, or anything really.  The point is that Craig is mistaken.  It is not the reference point that is objective, but rather the relationship between the object and the reference point that is objective.  The wheel thing is objectively up when compared to the earth reference that was chosen entirely subjectively.  Make sense?  When we say an object is up, we are always actually meaning in reference to my perspective that object is up.  but that level of specificity would be very cumbersome in casual conversation.  And in day-to-day life, we have so few conversations where we don't have a common perspective on what is up, that we simply drop the, in reference to my perspective part, for convenience.  Indeed, the concept of shared perspective is so intuitive to us that most people never really stop to think about it.  Because everyone we meet has chosen to agree that the ground is down, it seems to us that the ground is objectively down in all circumstances.  But it should be clear by now that there is no such thing as absolute down, no version of down.  that is down for all perspectives.  A common reference point must be first arbitrarily agreed upon to even begin to talk about upper down.  It is in trying to pretend objective morals and absolute morals are the same thing that Craig manages to deliberately confuse the whole issue. ",

If I want to hear a YouTube video, it is better to set my volume above zero.  However, if I don't want to hear the video, setting the volume to zero is the better action.

In the spectrum of possible actions or decisions, good would describe the range of those that might best accomplish the goal.  and bad the spectrum of those that would least accomplish the goal.  Take a game of chess, for example.  The rules of the game are ultimately subjective.  There's no intrinsic reason.  the bishop moves diagonally instead of the rook.  It could have been reversed, but in order to play the game, both players agree to the same subjective rules.  Once that is done, objective statements can be made.  If you want to win the game, you objectively ought to protect your king from being taken.  If you want to win the game, you ought to take the other player's king.  However, if your goal isn't to win the game, but instead to sow chaos among your friends, you ought to flip the board up in the air, sending the pieces flying.  You can't specify right and wrong without first specifying the goal.  It's interesting that the example used as a character falling down, when we've already discussed that objective downness exists only in relation to a subjectively chosen reference point.  The feeling of absolute downness he instinctively experiences in this moment doesn't change the nature of the subjectively selected reference point it is actually based upon. ",

While it may well be that this thief feels remorse and that he is in the wrong to take the phone, there are also thieves who completely disagree that they've done anything wrong.  This alone should be enough to shatter the notion that there's some absolute standard for right and wrong.  No, instead what you're affirming when you cry injustice is that you have a desired set of outcomes and that some action went against your desired outcome.  Just as such a... high percentage of humans have agreed that the ground is down and the sky is up, that we start to think our perspective on down is correct in an absolute sense.  In practice, so many humans share the same fundamental moral goals that we are similarly fooled into thinking that those goals are therefore objective without spending any time thinking about them.  Among those who do think about such things, it has been observed that all decision-making motivations can be expressed in terms of reducing pain or increasing pleasure.  There is some debate about whether it's one or the other, or both in combination, or if pain and pleasure are merely the opposite ends of the same spectrum.  That's not important for our current discussion.  For example, in the afternoon, one might decide to allow for some short-term pain in going to the gym to pursue the long-term pleasure of being healthy.  That same individual on the same day might later choose the short-term pleasure of a slice of cake, even though it contributes to long-term pain.  But both decisions were motivated by the desire of pleasure, avoidance of pain.  If you think about it, you'll likely agree that all practical decision criteria can break down to a desire to increase pleasure or decrease pain.  If you can come up with one that doesn't, please leave it in the comments.  The reason actual decisions vary from person to person or moment to moment stems not from the criteria but rather the time scale considered and the scope of whose pain and pleasure are being considered.  Those who consider reducing suffering over the longest time frame and over the largest group of people or creatures would be those classically considered most virtuous. ",

Just like bats, lions, wolves, ants, and many others, humans gained evolutionary survival advantage by working cooperatively.  Within a social species, where cooperation is key to survival, empathy and altruism are valuable traits to bring to the tribe.  At its base, empathy is basically recognition of how you would like to be treated if you were in someone else's position.  A monkey who doesn't want to be shoved off a tree will recognize that other monkeys likely don't want to be shoved off either.  Altruism is an extension of empathy, when an individual makes choices to benefit others at a personal detriment.  everyone in the hyena pack gets a share of the kill not just those who made this final kill again.  at its base this behaviour is strategic selfishness a literal you scratch my back i'll scratch yours scenario.  in a social species individuals who exhibit empathy and altruism are more included and welcome in the group thereby increasing their likelihood of securing a mate thus passing along the traits of empathy and altruism more often to future generations.  In fact, brain scan studies show that private acts of charity and acts to boost one's own social standing both trigger the pleasure center and reward circuit of the brain.  We have evolved such that being a positively impact member of our tribe is a direct literal biochemical increase of our own pleasure.  Even our most altruistic acts have a selfish element.  We feel good.  So, because we are a social species, when we make decisions or take actions based on reducing pain or increasing pleasure, we necessarily consider the pain and pleasure of others as well.  The weight that we give to the pain or pleasure of others versus our own pain or pleasure in any given decision is also a spectrum.  Some decisions end up being more selfish than others, but the impact to others is generally at least a consideration. ",
