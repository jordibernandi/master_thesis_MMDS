And one thing about gay people, myself included, there's a quality that a lot of gay people talk about, which is, especially when they're in the closet, that there's this need to kind of be perfect, to be the teacher's pet, to get the accolades, to get all the credit, as if there's some ledger being kept.  Was there a part of you that ever thought Yeah, I'm gay, but I got to make sure I, you know, talk about my Christian faith.  And yeah, I'm gay, but I'm going to join the military.  so that, yeah, I may be gay, but I'm a gay fucking troop.  So that ever?  was that ever in your thinking that that because you were ambitious, because you wanted to do big things, because you thought you were this incredibly talented person, which you are that, you know what?  I got to make sure that I'm putting these pieces together now.  so that even though I'm gay, whether I'm fully conscious of it or not, that I can have all these other accolades to kind of get me to where I want to go.

I think it is true that you feel a different level of pressure to be the most, the best, the strongest, especially if there's something gnawing at you that makes you think that there's something about you that's wrong or off, right?  And a part of it was different, which is more practical, which is just the simple fact that I had a little more maybe bandwidth because dating wasn't available for me for as long as I wasn't willing to be out.  So in hindsight, it's nuts that I was mayor and I was a reservist.  I deployed to Afghanistan in the middle of being mayor.  If I had any kind of personal life, I think none of that would be on the table.  Um, and, and yet you just, you find places for your energy, right?  You can even argue, find places for your love to go if, if it's not going into a relationship.  And, uh, who knows all the different ways that, that, that kind of finds its way out.  I'm conscious now of like literally being on the couch here and don't know that I'm that good at like plunging into my own kind of motivations or backstory that way.  But there's no question that so many gay people feel that pressure.  And it, I think, propels us in different ways. ",

You weren't comparing the experience.  You weren't saying that being gay was like being black or that the problems facing gay people or anything like the problems facing black black people historically in the present.  what have you?  but?  that you had some access to what it's like to feel marginalized.  and in the moment I watched that and I thought I'll be honest, I thought, oh, I'm not sure this is gonna play.  And the reason I didn't think it was gonna play is because there's this sense that, despite having said so, that you're not an outsider, that you don't have this experience of being an outsider, and that even in that moment when you talked about it, you talked about it in terms of laws, that you saw people debating your rights as a human being.  Do you feel as though you have been an outsider? ",

            "text": "I mean, part of what I was trying to get across, and I have no idea whether it played well, but it wasn't just the experience of exclusion, but also the experience of having my rights expanded by coalitions of people who included people like me and people not like me.  And understanding how that kind of feeds back to an obligation I must have to make myself useful to others who, even if they're in the lead fighting for their own rights, need people not like them at their side cheering them on or fighting with them.  No, I mean, the point is I think we all need to reach into whatever we do know of feeling like you don't fit.  And a lot of times it's the things that make you fit in one context that wind up amounting to your style when you walk out to a different place, if that makes sense.  So I think growing up in my community, I felt both of it and not of it in a lot of ways, which is one of the reasons I left.  That and the fact that the message that everybody got growing up in my part of Indiana was that success meant getting out.  And then no sooner did I get out and find myself at a place like Harvard where all of the things that made me weird back home, like being kind of intellectual and liberal, were accepted or even celebrated.  And then you also realize that you're from somewhere.  I never felt more Indiana than when I got to Harvard.  Just like I never felt more American than when I got to Oxford.  So the very same environment that you're at odds with when you're in it, you begin to own it when you step out of it for a second.  And I think we all have that relationship with our communities, with our country, often with our families.  And I think there's a particular flavor of it for queer people because of all the different ways that that fact puts you at odds with your community, sometimes your family and your country. ",

And one thing you said early in the campaign was we shouldn't give in to Republican arguments.  We should decide what we think is best and do what we think is best because they're going to call us socialists.  They're going to tar us no matter what.  And, you know, I think you've gotten some unfair criticism on your higher ed proposal because it is incredibly ambitious.  It would be more progressive than anything proposed in any previous campaign.  And yet, you know, you face criticism because it isn't universal.  Right.  It is means tested.  And even though you would cover what, 80 percent of students, there are still people that wouldn't be helped.  But you said we shouldn't be paying for college for the children of millionaires.  Do you believe that it's politically, is it simply politically untenable to have a universal public college program?  Or do you actually believe it is worse policy to have a system that, say, taxes billionaires and billionaires a little bit more, but is available to everybody? ",

            "text": "No, I think, I believe what I do, not just politically, philosophically.  I just think that this is an example of a benefit that we should target where it's going to make the biggest difference.  Sure, yeah, a lot of our programs are universal programs.  There's a very simple and very big difference between K-12 education and university education.  And the simple difference is that we expect everybody to get through 12th grade.  At least we hope everybody and want everybody to get through 12th grade.  It's not the same with university education.  And look, there are some things that we means test and some things that we don't.  I don't think anybody believes that the earned income tax credit shouldn't be means tested, right?  I think that there's a limit.  on where we should be paying for.  all the way down to the last penny of somebody, especially if by definition we're talking about those in the higher income brackets, but also by virtue of the fact that they do have a college degree will go on to be in a higher income bracket than those who didn't.  So it's just a progressive, by my lights, it's a progressive idea that we should target those dollars.  because the reality is No matter where you're raising the tax money from, and I get the idea of how we pay for this on my competitor's plan, or on my plan for that matter, is largely taxes raised from rich people, right?  But whether to spend them on rich people is a policy decision we make on every single policy that we initiate.  And I believe that things like national defense or interstate highways should be equally available to everybody.  But something like university, I think it's fine if you're in that top 10%.  I wish you well.  I still wish you well.  I just think you ought to pay your own tuition. ",

And so at the end of the day, I think we share the goals, right?  We share the goal of universal health care.  We share the desire to make sure college cost is never a barrier for somebody who wants to go to college.  I mean, broadly, we're aligned as a party, actually, despite all the narratives.  We're largely aligned on where we think things ought to go.  And the really good news is it's not just internal alignment among Democrats.
