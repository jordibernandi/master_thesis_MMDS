            "text": "Look, there's the Black Holocaust.  I knew it was prophecy.  A thousand times worse than the Jewish atrocities.  Uneven playing field, there'll never be a fair score.  Cause in 1619, that's when they declared war.  We the 12 tribes, the ones that the promise reaches.  Cause you got somebody by the name of Gabul of Tunisia, right?  When Egypt and Syria, he was president of Egypt and Syria.  And he made a declarative statement right here.  Right, and he read it.  I'm going to read you the statement in the Time magazine.  It says, the Europeans claiming to be Jews are nothing but Hebrew-speaking Gentiles.  The late president of Egypt, Gabul Abdu'l-Nasir, stated on television, you, meaning the Jews, will never be able to live here in peace because you left here black but came back white.  We cannot accept you.  That's how the Arab feel.  That's how the Muslim feel about the white Jew.  He said, wait a minute.  Who in the hell are you?  We know what the Jew looks like.  You ain't him.  Go to hell back where you came from.  He said, you can never live in peace.  So why is all that hell going on over there in Israel right now?  Because the real Jew is not in Israel.  God said when his true people come back, it's going to be peace.  They haven't had a moment's peace yet since 1948, right?  So they can't be the real Jew.  You got a question?  I'm just here to listen.  You're just here to listen?  What's your nationality?  Huh?  What's your nationality?  Mexican.  Mexican?  Your father's Mexican?  It is in Mexico.  Yeah.  You make sure you got some white in you, huh?  A little bit of white in you.  Why does it matter?  I'm just asking, man.  I'm just asking.  Why does it matter?  I'm just making it clear.  Don't get offensive.  I'm just asking a question.  If somebody asks me, I'm Haitian, right?  If somebody says, you got some white in you, my mother is.  Yeah, there ain't no big deal.  You know, but in effect, it just affects your appearance.  It's not a big deal.  I'm just asking you.  If it just affects your appearance, then why does it matter?  I'm just asking.  If it just affects your appearance, then why does it matter?  Why are you so offensive?  Why are you so offensive?  I'm rude.  Are you a brother or you're not a brother?  I'm a brother, man.  Emphatically.  Are you?  I am.  Alright.  Your Uber is here.  I wouldn't want you to miss Uber.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  We can continue.  We can continue.  What does Muhammad believe for you?  I don't know nothing about Muhammad.  What about Muhammad?  Why don't you believe in Muhammad?  Because I believe in the Bible.  I don't believe in Quran.  No, no, no, no.  What does Quran mean?  Huh?  What does Quran mean?  No.  Is that true?  You a Muslim?  No.  You speak Arabic?  Huh?  No, I'm not a Muslim.  What are you?  I'm a Hebrew Israelite.  I'm a tribe believer.  I've been listening.  You speak Arabic.  Wait, you're a Hebrew Israelite?  Yes, certainly.  Okay.  So Quran goes back to the Syria.  Of course, I certainly... You are a sinner of the 12 tribes.  Without a doubt.  I'm of the 13th.  What's the 13th tribe?  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.  I got to hear this.  What's the 13th tribe?  I mean, you just, I never heard of it.  You told me you were from it.  So I need to know.  I don't know about the 13th tribe.  I know about Arthur Coulson's book that talks about the 13th tribe.  So what's the 13th tribe?  You said you're from it, man.  No, I'm not Jewish.  I'm not Jewish.  I am from the tribes.  The tribes are not Jewish.  The tribes are Jews.  Judah, Benjamin, Levi are Jews.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not imitating you.  I'm the real Jew.  so who's the 13th tribe?  can you tell me?  can you tell me?  no you i don't know about it.  so i'm asking you can you educate me?  can you educate me?  no listen i can't educate you on the 13th tribe.  you have the microphone.  i can't educate you on the 13th child with the president.  he don't know.  he don't know who the 13th tribe is.  he has no clue.  he's the one that told me he invented it right now.  so i'm asking him to tell me about it because i'm totally ignorant.  I'm totally ignorant to a 13 child.  You're ignorant?  Yes, yes.  Go ahead.  What's the problem?  Don't miss your Uber.  Don't miss your Uber.  Don't miss your Uber.  Don't miss your Ignance.  Why are you so feminine, man?  You're so feminine.  That's right.  You're feminine.  You're feminine.  You a bitch?  You tell me about God.  You're real defensive.  You're real defensive.  You're real defensive.  You're real defensive.  You're real defensive.  You tell me about God.  Back up, bro.  You tell me about God.  Tell me about God.  Tell me about God.  Hold on.  Tell me I got any problem.  I don't forgot anything.  I'm going to do it too.  Are you guys doing this thing?  Have you read the Bible?  No, no.  Have you read the Bible?  I have.  I have.  I have.  Hey, I read the Bible.  I've read the Bible.  Have you read the Bible?  He's a loser.  I don't give a fuck about murder and shit, bro.  I don't give a fuck about murder and shit.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  We'll lose you.  We'll lose you.  I just want to know.  You know, you could have had a white grandma.  I'm just asking you.  I just need to know.  That's all.  Reasonable question.  You can ask me the same question.  I'll tell you.  What's your question, man?  What's your question?  We're talking about the truth of the Bible.  That's what you're talking about.  The truth of the Bible, sir.  Yes, sir.  Emphatic.  Emphatic.  Huh?  What scripture?  What scripture, sister?  Okay, you're an Israelite sister, you better remember that.  Alright, you need to repent.  Okay, she knows what's up.  All praise to the Most High in the Triple D. Okay.  Alright.  What's going on?  What you need?  I see you listening.  You got no question?  All right.  We got a pre-session.  You got a question, man?  You got a question?  What are you doing?  You got a question?  What's up?  You guys, like, I don't know.  I'm just getting along, you know what I'm saying?  Getting along?  Where are you from?  Where do your people come from?  My people?  I don't know.  My family is from Pennsylvania.  You're from Pennsylvania?  What's your last name?  Warhol.  so what warholic polish polish?  okay okay all right.  well how'd the poles get along with the nazi?  no you know what i'm saying.  that's what.  that's what i'm saying.  i can't get along with the nazi right but who the nazi to me is all of y'all.  you see what i'm saying.  I'm a stereotype.  I'm gonna generalize.  Alright.  Perfect.  Go ahead.  This is, uh... That's wrong, man.  That's wrong.  I'm gonna say it was wrong.  Let me tell you some more.  I see some wrong.  There's some wrong right here, man.  That's right.  No, that is wrong.  That is wrong.  What did she do?  I need to know what she did.  What did she do?  That is wrong.  She was minding her damn business.  That's wrong.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  At the end of the day, that's still going on right now.  Right this second.  Read that.  Section 13.  Separate thyself from thy enemy.  From whom?  From thine enemy.  Separate thyself from thine enemy.  We gotta separate ourselves from y'all.  That's all I'm talking about.  And it's a problem.  You know why they feel like that?  Because the right race is a leech.  They're leeches.  Right?  They're leeches.  So what happens?  A leech is going to hold on to you and suck on you.  You see what I'm saying?  As soon as you feel like you're taking the leech off, he can't suck no more blood, then what's going to happen to the leech?  Now I've got to hold on.  I need to live.  I can't live without a host.  So us separating from them is literally a leech being left from its host.  A leech can't lose its host.  Why do you think they've done what they've done and try to give you the illusion that you live in a post-racial society?  Why have they done it?  Because they want to make sure they have a host to continually suck the blood from.  Like I was just going over with that couple.  Even though I say blacks and Latinos are going to be the main population in this country, in 30 years, we're going to have even less money.  What does that mean?  They're going to just keep sucking.  Yeah, you keep making them, they're going to keep going to work for nothing, and we're going to keep sucking all your resources.  Right?  Read on.  2 Corinthians 6 and 17.  Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye separate.  That's what time it is for us Negroes and Latinos, to be separate.  Or else we wouldn't be out here getting beat in the street like the one they got the other day.  That's right.  And where was anybody to help save that sister?  Where was the PD at?  Where the police was at?  I don't know.  They're here now.  Where were they at when she was getting sucked in the face?  That's what I want to know.  Where were they at when that 4-5 came out?  Boom.  Why'd they put a 45 out on a woman?  Where did they do that at?  How do you feel about that?  Everything's fucked up.  What are you doing out here tonight?  I'm trying to enjoy my night.  Where are your friends at?  And give a look at their faces, too.  Go ahead, man.  A lot of losers out here tonight.  Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye separate.  We gotta come out from among you.  I mean, look at the way he's sitting there with his hands in his pockets.  I can't even get around a nigga like that.  This nigga pulling Dexter as well, man.  Go ahead.  Say it to the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing.  Gotta get away from the unclean.  Oh, wait.  Get away from that right, man.  Get away from it.  Stop loving this woman.  because it was in the middle of the month you know what the massive part is what it's um hispanic for me.  i'm not even white.  where are you from.  i'm not even white.  are there white hispanics?  yeah so you mean you say i need to qualify you indigenous.  you know what.  i hate you.  why do you keep on every time they run from that?  i'm no mexican man I'm Azteca, nigga.  Fuck the white man, nigga.  They do that way in a minute.  Way in a minute, Spaniard.  Don't lie to me.  Right?  You indigenous?  What country your people come from?  What country your father come from?  doesn't matter.  you know what matters.  you know what matters is how you treat people alright.  you know what matters is how you treat people alright.  you know what matters is how you treat people alright.  you know what matters.  That's what's happening, man.  Treat people how you want to be treated.  I agree.  If you lead somebody into captivity, you've got to go.  It's that simple.  You've got to go.  What that mean?  First of all, don't step on my... Don't step on my... Yes, yes, yes, you are.  You are stepping on my belongings.  Don't step on... Don't step on our belongings.  You stepped on my stuff.  You stepped on my stuff.  You stepped on my stuff.  I agree with everything you're saying.  I'm glad.  He that killed with the sword must be killed with the sword.  Go ahead, go ahead.  I love everybody.  You know what I hate the most?  What?  Fucking white people.  Well, that's sensible.  Yeah.  So now you're gonna start listening?  I'm not asking you to.  I'm not asking you to.  You know what the most fucked up reason is?  Fucking white people.  They are fucking privileged.  They think everything should be to them.  And they're like, oh, look, we ain't got nothing.  Don't feel like this.  But they're like, everything's all the same.  And they fucking want to confuse all of us.  They're like, hey, How do I know?  What I'm saying is it feels like when you're when you're at work and the white man is at his desk and he gets stuck, he goes, hey, can you help me?  Can you help me reboot my computer?  You know, your father's Mexican?  Yeah, you come from Mexico?  I know.  I was born here.  No, you're a pop star.  I'm talking about dad.  No, he wasn't.  He was born here.  Who born here, but he's Mexican?  What about grandpa?  Grandma was born here.  Grandma.  Grandma?  Okay, there we go.  Go ahead.  Oh, my God.  Go ahead.  Numbers 1538.  Speaking to the children of Israel.  I'm not on here.  What you want?  What you want?  Go ahead.  Because he said he was Mexican, right?  Sorry.  2026.  The disposition of a liar is dishonorable.  Listen, man, I'm just out here preaching the Bible, man.  That's all.  Man, I ain't fucking preaching shit.  I'm just telling you like it is what it is.  And I agree with you.  And I'm on your fucking side.  If you can sit here and make fun, then I hope you feel great about that.  I laughed at something that he read.  I didn't laugh at you.  You gotta be so sensitive.  He read something that was funny to me.  You're acting like it.  Go ahead.  What you got?  Hold it.  Hold it.  I need another drink.  Hold it.  Hey, hey.  Enjoy your night.  Enjoy your evening.  Have a good evening.  Have a good evening.  I have no hard feelings or nothing.  Y'all have a great night.  The juice is on the loose.  The juice is on the loose.  You want me to read it?  You want me to read it?  Read it and break it down?  Yeah.  This is Syrac, 20 and 26.  The disposition of a liar is dishonorable.  And that's what that man was.  He's dishonorable.  And his show was counted.  It's like the other one.  Wait a minute.  Who's next?  Finally came out.  See, that's why they're hiding it.  He already knew.  He was caught.  Grandma.  Grandma?  Oh.  As I suspected.  As I suspected.  It turned your red a little brown, and that was about it.  That's all it held for you, Gene Poole.  All right?  And it's not rocket science just to figure out why people are the most evil people in the world.  That's easy.  White people get that, right?  So I'm not going to give you no cool points for recognizing the obvious, right?  So read.  It says the disposition of a liar is dishonorable.  What?  It's dishonorable.  Right, so it's dishonorable.  So we dishonored him.  That's why he felt like that.  He knew he was being dishonored, right?  And his shame is ever with him.  His shame is what?  Ever with him.  Don't look shameful.  You see him waving at him.  Get your pedophile jeans on, man.  Come on, man.  You're dishonorable.  You know what I'm saying?  There ain't no other way around it.  Period.  Where we at?  Precept?  It's getting hot out here, man.  Precept?  People are born at 12, but the word of God is quick and powerful and stronger than any two-edged sword.  That's why they're getting mad out here, because we're bringing the Bible out. ",
