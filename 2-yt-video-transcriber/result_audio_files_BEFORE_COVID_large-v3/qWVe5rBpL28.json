            "text": "In our independent economy, how do you know you're being paid to serve?  We destroy the structures that just pay less than half a dollar for all the work that all women in the Asian agricultural economies do for a day.  So, I call upon all of you to not build large-scale political education for the women of the Third World, whether they are educated or whether they are politically.  Unless we do that, we will not be able to come out of our shadows.  Thank you.  should consider the problems of women as the problems of just one woman or the problems of minimum women in a locality.  All these should be considered as problems in their totality.  I just want to repeat that our enemies of women's oppression, neocolonialism and imperialism, all the forces that operate in this world, After all, the labor of women by exploiting the labor of women in various ways.  Don't wait for the men of the third world to educate the women of the third world.  We have to take the political education of our women into our own hands.  Thank you.  I came very far.  I came from Puerto Rico and I want to emphasize in one problem of the woman of the third world.  It is colonialism.  Puerto Rico has been colonized for almost 500 years.  We are half of the population of the world that still lives under colonialism.  Beware of colonialism.  We want to emphasize in another problem.  because of colonialism.  One of them is the economic crisis, the external debt and unemployment.  We Puerto Rican women are suffering about unemployment.  We have in Puerto Rico almost one million women unemployed.  Also, another problem of colonialism is militarization.  We Puerto Rican women are facing the problem of militarization.  All our sons are taken to the army, forced.  Also, our country is a big base of the United States.  We have another problem because of colonialism.  It is sterilization of the women of Puerto Rico.  More than a third of our population, of our women, is sterilized by the Control of Population program, improved since 1950.  Right now we have 35 women sterilized in our country.  Also, we have another big problem of colonialism.  It is the cultural assimilation.  We have been forced to forget our culture, to forget our tradition, and almost our language.  We are speaking Spanish country.  Also, we have been forced to emigrate.  Two million of our five million people of Puerto Rico have been forced to emigrate to the United States because we don't have any economic alternative life.  Also, in the United States, we have all the discrimination against women, against men.  We face also the racism in the United States, the colonialism as one of the main problems of the women of the third world.  Thank you very much.  I'm Marjorie Mbelidi from Tanzania, and I would like to speak about the increasing financial conquest of Africa, which has taken place since independence in the early 60s.  and what could be called a financial bondage which is led by the World Bank and the IMF.  Whatever limited independence African states want is increasingly being lost.  Their efforts to industrialize is under attack.  Their efforts to develop a self-reliant economy is under attack.  The economies are increasingly dependent upon the export of crops, primarily to Western Europe and North America.  The major producers of those crops are women.  However, they are unable to earn enough from farm production and are forced to become beer brewers, prostitutes, or otherwise provide for their families.  Related to the growth of financial institutional power led by World Bank and IMF is what could be called a new kind of colonization, led by a new kind of state, an international global state, which has many parts.  It includes the World Bank and IMF.  It includes United Nations.  It includes so-called bilateral states and some of the big NGOs.  We see in Africa the declining power of independent nation states and the growing power of this international global state.  It means an international colonizing.  The old colonizing powers were one state like Germany or England or France.  Today we see an international colonizing force in Africa.  And this obviously requires in Africa and in Latin America and in Asia, the development of a third world movement to fight the new forms of colonization.  My name is Ana.  I'm from Brazil.  A military dictatorial regime.  Although we have defeated them and we have now a constitutional government, we have quite a lot in Latin America that has the highest external damage.  that all the money, all the work of the Brazilian people is to pay that debt.  We have to pay 10 million dollars just for the service of that debt.  So, that money that should be used for social and measures just has to go to.  So we have, although we are a very big country and a very rich country, we have all the characteristics that everyone has known here.  We have 10% of the abortions.  made in all over the world, they are strong Brazilian women.  We have 50 million children that are careless and abandoned.  So I think that Latin America and Brazil, because it's the biggest country, has to do with force and to play, not to pay that debt, the only way that women, Brazilian and Latin American, who have no more discrimination and to have equality and peace.  I would like to report how, very few days ago, in our waters of the Caribbean Sea, 28 Dominican women died suffocated in a trailer because they were being contrabanded.  Dominican women are being exported to other ports, both from the Caribbean and Europe.  And 28 Dominican women, suffocated because they were piled up in trailers in a port of an island in the Caribbean Sea, died suffocated.  This is hidden.  This is not what is advertised on our islands.  Folklore is advertised.  The beauty of our women.  But those women are being exported.  And they have higher prices than our sugar.  And they have higher prices than our coffee or our tobacco.  That is one of the great problems that we, women of the Third World, face and we have to fight against them.  Here we have been asked how we can define the chains that enslave us.  But we have to define those chains from the political, economic and social regimes that govern us, or rather, that depose us.  Because we have colonialism, we have neocolonialism, we have dictatorial regimes, we have... apparent democracies, apparent only because they are in political terms towards the outside world, but they are regimes that can only be maintained on the basis of force, of economic force.  That is the war we are living, the war of hunger towards our peoples.  And we, as women, live, suffer that war of hunger.  Black women, Latino women, Native American and Asian American women live within our own type of third world.  We are called minorities and suffer the highest levels of poverty, illiteracy and cultural domination.  Racism is one of our most important issues.  Living in a white racist society, we suffer from racial discrimination and violence.  We women of color from America have come to Nairobi to join you in the struggles of all third world countries.  What would you like to see for the women of your country in the future?  I'd like to see every household, every woman, every household should have water and women should be educated.  We are the backbone, we are the people who work in agriculture sector and Kenya depend on agriculture.  So I'd like to see all women being educated to at least from two or all level, 12 years.  At least every woman, every other people who work to produce the wealth of this country, we should get a share of the labor of our hearts, the sweat of our fists.  All women should be educated.  No woman should be married before she has reached, you know, 40.  And also, something should be done about firewood energy.  Every home should have water and energy because that is woman's job to look for water and to look for fire, for energy.  And because we are the ones who work, we should also be the policy, you know, the policy makers of the world, the product of our labor.  By the year 2000, we should have everybody educated from lake to the sea, from north to the... What has been the most exciting part of this conference for you?  You came to this conference for many reasons.  What will you take away?  What will you remember?  What I'll remember is I'll never forget the different types of women.  I'll never forget that I shook hands with a Palestinian.  I've been thinking that Palestinians are just killers, Israeli.  I'll never forget the sights, the beautiful sights of women, the beautiful, peaceful conference we have because up to now there hasn't been anything, you know, bad.  I shall never forget that women should really rule the world because they are very, very peaceful. ",
