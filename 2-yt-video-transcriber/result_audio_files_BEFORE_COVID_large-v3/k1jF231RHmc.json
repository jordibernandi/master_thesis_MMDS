Listen, we don't have time to talk to you right now, peasant man.  We're going to the muzzleloader party.  If you make me late to this thing, I am going to lose it on you.  You don't have time for me?  I swear to God, I'm the city inspector.  There's my car.  It's out of operation.  It's a gorgeous piece of garbage.  We're level sevens.  We go wherever we want.  Now, what you can do for us is open your door.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah?  And you look just like a dumpster monster.  Kind of like a shruggy little kid.  My father would squish you into little pancakes and eat you alive.  Now, open the gate immediately, you beggar!  Oh, this is great!  Listen, we don't care about this level.  one city, you boring little bitch.  Look, this is the never again, guys.  Okay, you made it here.  You know, it kind of sucks, but you got to care about it.  This is worse than the time that David forgot the lube powder, and we were stuck at the top of that skyscraper for three hours.  Don't even bring that up.  That was such a boy.  That was the worst time ever.  You don't know Atari.  The guy must have downloaded ahead of my worth that shit on his phone.  But the guy's got a cannon on his camera.  I can feel like a peanut or something, or maybe a little piece of urine to leave.  I don't know.  It's angry because she's got it all set.  Woo!  Yay! ",

Perhaps the time hackers had overstepped by declaring war on such a powerful dynasty.  But it was too late.  The Murder Charles had detonated the short-range neutron bomb, and the Bush-Clinton progeny were skeletons now.  No longer bisexual, just ash.  Scrap metal was up to $5 per car.

This thing does everything you want.  I got my hero over here, Janet Reno, responsible for, I don't know, 1,300 men, women, and children deaths.  Fire them up.  Probably more.  Mostly children.  I always test guns out.  Take that one, sir.  You don't need that.  You guys are going to love this.  This right here, Nick, actually, the guy's a genius.  He built CBS, Pleasure Android, Pleasure Model.  Quite defective, though.  We turned the logic circuits on once she became homicidal.  We had to turn those off permanently.  Charles, what were you telling me about the new cop killer bullets?  The new cop killer bullets are totally resistant to any sort of cop armor, and they kill usually police chiefs and their families, including the whole genie group.  That's a new kind of bullet that's coming out.  I got it.  Come on, you little chumps.  You wanna fuck with me?  You wanna roll the dice?  Give me what you got!  This right here, this is my pride and joy.  Made this out of toy train parts, action figures.  It's called the Dream Machine, JSI-19 to be specific.  What this mask does... What this mask does is it interprets pineal gland, DMT, Joe Rogan, spirit energy, and it's going to cohabitate .  And so what happens is it goes down these pipes here and into one of these things.  I forgot what these are called.  This actually runs on lightning.  Essentially, all I have to do is I just come down in my little position here.  And I think whatever I want to think, and the dream machine projects my dreams onto the screen right over there.  So I'm gonna dream something right now.  I'm gonna dream something good.  Sam!  Sam!
