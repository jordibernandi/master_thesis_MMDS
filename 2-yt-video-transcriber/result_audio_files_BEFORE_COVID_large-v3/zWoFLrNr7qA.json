So when you had these rallies in gold and silver over the last couple of months, I hear they do get some form of margin call.  Obviously there's an open loss.  And I wonder from this banker mentality, are they just arrogant enough that, hey, no matter what happens, we'll slam more and we'll win?  Or are these guys getting worried where if you're short an asset that its fair value is significantly higher, you know, your only incentive to continue shorting is if you can drive it down.  And I wonder, are these guys getting a little nervous yet? ",

            "text": "They're getting very worried, Chris.  Here's kind of how I think about it.  I think in practical terms, if a big bank is way short, they need a patch job.  And now you enter into a domain of risk.  Will they properly and accurately estimate what they need or will they run out of their credit line?  Third point, is there any personal family fortune at risk?  So it's misjudging, running out of credit line or risking your family fortune where, you know, our family had $84 billion, but if this thing goes bad, we're going to have five.  And that's when they pull a plug.  I think we're going to have some other types of problems that some analysts talk about, I think about a lot.  Is it possible that JP Morgan, which is running the derivative machinery, is it possible that some of their disaster scenarios and simulations weren't really well done?  Take a look at some of the stress tests.  Now, I realize that they are intentionally falsified to enable passage.  We've had like 15 or 20 companies fail and go bankrupt after passing stress tests.  It's becoming a bit of a joke.  But when it comes to disaster scenarios and simulations, I come from a computer science background.  I don't have a mathematics college degree.  I had a math minor, math and stats.  But my degree was in computer science programming and, you know, data structures.  And it was fun.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  I didn't have... This is going to sound a little strange.  I didn't have the mental maturity until I turned 20.  And I graduated from college a year young, a year early, 21.  So... When I got to master's level, that's when I started taking some more math courses and I backed out of a graduate program, Ivy League statistics doctoral program and went to Carnegie Mellon and spent two years bridging a gap.  But I learned a lot about simulation and we have a saying in simulation.  The quality of the simulation results are as high as the quality of your input feeder system.  of your platforms, your rules basis, your conjured threats, your reactive modality.  Let me keep it much simpler.  If you do a simulation where you got garbage in, you're going to get garbage out.  You do a simulation that's kind of Mickey Mouse and not sophisticated and really didn't do your homework and really didn't set all the parameters really well and didn't have the limits.  you're going to get a simulation that's not going to really help you in a crisis.  And that's what I think is a big risk for the computer machinery that's often called the derivative shop.  And JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are involved running that.  The Department of Treasury is in charge of that.  And I think they're going to get overwhelmed.  That's what I think.  And I think the evidence is going to be a shooting up of this gold and silver prices.  And I'm hearing a lot from smart people who I respect that the shooting up in price, the big breakout is going to happen with gold and silver later.  And I'm thinking, well, maybe.  What's your basis of that?  Well, gold is going to be the monetary metal and silver is going to be the technology metal.  And I say, where's the industrial shortage?  It's with silver.  Where's the industrial supply lacking?  Like in Mexico, Peru, and Chile.  Even Russia.  It's silver.  Okay, so I think we're going to see price movements in gold and silver.  Thank you. ",
