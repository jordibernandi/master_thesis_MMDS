So whether we like it or not, whether we think it is good that people like Meghan McCain have... The voice that carries farther than news people.  This is the universe that we live in, so we have to deal with it.  But they were talking about Julian Assange, and I just could not help myself but make this video.  And I gotta say... It's mixed in a good, bad way rather than just a terrible way.  So let's check this out together.  First, I want to point out the most excited husband, father, I'm not sure who, ever.

Neither of those scenarios by either side have anything to do with WikiLeaks actually doing any of the hacking.  That's so absurd.  It's so absurd.  What...

As many issues as I have, and you can see I have issues with this.  actually one of the better segments on tv that's that's where the bar is.  it's just like you know in the center of the earth is so low.  so we have the two nepotism people who are uh against this.  i gotta give it to sonny.  That was principled.  It was accurate.  It was a constitutional argument.  It's what I would hope to expect from a prosecutor.  Meghan McCain, I think everyone knows this is exactly what we would expect.  Spoiled rich kid.  Grown up.  Never really understood what a tough thing is in her life.  Carried through everything.  Now sitting here with the stolen valor that she took from her father's grave and she continues to hold and parade around her with this sense of authority that she has... never earned and never will.  and then uh uh miss huntsman i actually don't remember her first name already.  uh who's there for basically the same reasons as megan.  i guess they needed someone else to balance out megan.  i'm kind of brain dead on this one guys so i guess i'll leave it at that.  oh let's do.  let's do some sort of poll.  um You know what?  No poll.  I changed my mind.  I retract the poll.  You get claps.  You get anti-claps.  You may get cups back.  You still had anti-claps.  No poll for this.  Guys, I'll see you on Saturday.  Did you like that video?  Are you not subscribed?  Okay, you are now?  Fantastic. ",
