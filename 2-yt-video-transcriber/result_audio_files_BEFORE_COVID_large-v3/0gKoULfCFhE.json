            "text": "Many of you might remember the white woman that was in ShopRite using all kinds of racial slurs and spitting at two Black customers.  Well, karma finally came to visit her.  I would like to thank Dark Mother for leading me to this story that came out in the Daily Mail March 27, 2019.  White woman's home is robbed just weeks after she was forced to quit her school district job after she was caught on camera shouting the N-word at two black shoppers at a grocery store.  And remember, that was ShopRite.  All right.  A white woman who was forced to quit her school district job after she was filmed using racial slurs and spitting at two black people at a grocery store had her home burglarized Monday.  Robbers strip Corrine McGovern's Connecticut home and garage of its copper piping, damaging her ceiling and a wall.  New Haven police confirmed yesterday.  McGovernie Tyrone made headlines two weeks ago after she was film calling black customers the N-word multiple times.  And remember, she had her two kids with her as she shopped with her two young children.  This woman, I know y'all remember.  All right.  This is her home.  McGovernie Tyrone worked as a clerk in the district central office according to the New Haven Register.  The resignation was officially announced a day after a video of the incident went viral on Facebook.  The video had been shared more than 8,300 times and commented on more than 2,500 times.  it has generated over a thousand reactions.  The footage was first posted to Facebook by a user with the profile name Tatiana Nguyen.  In the video, McGovernie Tyrone is heard shouting the N-word three times.  She then spits at a black man and woman twice.  And you know what?  And when she called 9-1-1, she said they spit at her.  And you don't see that anywhere on the video.  All you do is see her doing all the spitting.  It is unclear if anything precipitated the outburst.  After McGovernie Tyrone first utters the racial slur, the man looks as if he steps towards her, prompting her to respond.  Put your hands on me.  Come on.  She then pulls out her phone and starts recording.  The man then slaps the phone out of her hands.  He then turns and walk away from McGovernie Tyrone, who goes after him.  The black woman then steps in between the two.  The video was filmed at a ShopRite location in East Haven, according to the Facebook post.  McGovern, Tyrone, next door neighbor, a black man, told the New Haven Register that he was surprised to see her in the video.  All right, I'm just going to go down a little.  The police were seen at McGovney Terone's home on Saturday, but there was nobody inside.  Authority said no criminal complaint has been filed.  Wow.  I mean, people robbed your house and took out the piping and you did not report that?  Interesting, isn't it?  We are in touch with ShopRite and are looking to get a better understanding of what took place.  Friday night, East Haven police said in a statement.  Well, I wonder if she's even there, that she left town because of everything that has happened.  You never know.  You know, it just seems strange that something like that would happen to her house and she didn't file a police report.  But she filed a police report on people in ShopRite.  She called 911 over that, but she did not call 911 over her house.  So I don't know.  I mean, she could have gotten up and just got out of there, you know, because of everything that has happened.  You know, these people, when they do something and it makes a video viral on social media, they tend to go into hiding.  It sounds like that's what's happening in this case too.  Okay, authorities could conceivably charge McGovernie Tyrone with assault since spitting is considered a form of assault.  At minimum, she could face a charge of breaching the peace.  And my question goes back to Shoprite.  After she did that in Shoprite, did they still serve her?  They should have asked her to leave.  And I don't think they did.  I think they let her shop.  That's why we don't ever see that in the story.  Hamden School District released a statement saying we have become aware of the video footage that appears to show an employee in our district engaging in abhorrent conduct.  Specifically, the video appears to show the employee repeatedly calling an African-American man the N-word in a supermarket in East Haven.  The video also appeared to show the Hamden employee spitting at aforementioned African-American male as he was walking away from the employee.  It also appears that the employee's children witnessed her conduct.  Because her children were present, school administrators filed a DCF report.  So they went to the Department of Children and Family on her.  A DCF report is filed whenever there is a reason to suspect child abuse.  So there you go, y'all.  Boy, that karma sure didn't take long.  But it didn't talk about her whereabouts.  You know, if they're going to arrest her, especially for the spitting, it doesn't say that.  So it leads me to believe that she left town.  But please tell me what you think, ladies and gentlemen.  Please leave your comment and subscribe.  Don't forget to hit on the notification bell.  And I'll see you on the next video.  Peace, family. ",
