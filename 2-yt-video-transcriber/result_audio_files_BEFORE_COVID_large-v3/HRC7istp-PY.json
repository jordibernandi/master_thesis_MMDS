Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, of course, went through and saw that they were only occasionally being given these little things of shampoo, not even enough to wash their whole bodies.  We can afford soap.  They're saying they're spending over $700 per detainee.  Where's the money going?  I think the money is going to keeping them detained rather than allowing them to go with their family who lives in the States.  Right, and that's the thing.  A lot of these detainees have family in the United States who would happily take them and take care of them.  Is there enough attention on this issue, especially among Trump supporters?  Are they paying attention?  I think they're being fed a diet of conservative media and they aren't getting the information.  I also think we don't have enough video of what's actually going on.  There's very few people who have been allowed in.  The people who have been allowed in haven't been able to really share with audio and video what's going on. ",
