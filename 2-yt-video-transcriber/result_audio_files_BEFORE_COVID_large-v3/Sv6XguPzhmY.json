You probably rolled your eyes.  And I couldn't let this one go because I'll just say this.  I don't love it.  You know what I'm talking about when we put this clip in.  But here's the clip and then I'll break it down a little bit.  Alright, so, what do we see here?  We see, besides it being unrealistic that you bought two new cars at the exact same time, I don't know what they did with the other cars, sold them, you know, turned them in, whatever, it doesn't matter.  The idea here is that man buys woman a new car.  They both get a new car.  And actually, I believe one of them is a truck and one of them is like, you know, a midsize SUV or whatever.  Either way, he gets her a gift and he walks out.  And he says, one for you.  And he points at the SUV or whatever.  One for me.  He gets the black truck. ",

But what a bad message it sends to our young men out there.  So here we are supposed to believe.  Actually, here's also a bad message.  It sends to women who are going to expect this type of treatment.  I know many women like this that are in relationships or whatever, and this is a move they would pull, okay?  You could have one woman who, you know, her husband buys her a new car and she's ecstatic and so thankful and grateful.  Oh, that's so nice of you, all that.  Or you could have the modern feminist woman, the modern empowered woman, where... She gets what she wants.  You could also have the modern marriage mindset, which is happy wife, happy life.  Just let her run the show.  What she wants is what she gets.  Anything for her.  It's better than arguing with her or having to put up with her being angry at me.  That crap mindset.  So men out there, especially young men, Do not ever put up with this, ever. ",

            "text": "I like that.  So how many of you guys saw this ad?  What did it make you think of when you first saw this ad?  Because to me, what it made me think of was, There's no way I would ever let that happen.  There is no way.  If I want that big black truck there, that's mine.  That's mine.  She gets the other one.  I don't care if she's upset about not getting the color she wants or she wanted the truck and I want the SUV.  No, no, no, no.  That's mine.  Appreciate your gift.  Don't sit here and try to take my gift and use it as your own.  So I really wanted... I saw this and I was just like, okay... It's fun to point this stuff out so that we see why, again, young men get shaped to believe to just appease their wife or appease their girlfriend or appease women.  And young women get it in their mind that they can basically demand whatever they want.  I know that she didn't do it in a demanding way necessarily, but what does this do?  It sets up our society to... be shaped in such a way that never go car shopping without your woman.  You better make sure that she approves it first and you better get her whatever she wants, even if it's something that you wanted to.  No, no, no.  Forget yourself.  It's all for her.  That crap mindset.  So what do you guys think about this?  What was your first reaction when you saw this ad?  Because I think this came out a couple years ago.  And I remember seeing it multiple times.  And I just couldn't let it go this time when I saw it.  So yeah, let me know what you guys think.  Give some wise words to any young men that might be watching this as well.  But yeah, GMC, come on, man.  Don't forget, subscribe, like, comment, share the video, but definitely subscribe.  Thank you. ",
