It's not all cam-am and high glitz and glamour.  And you're looking at one of the hardest working ranches on the planet right there.  Never seen anyone with a work ethic like that.  We're putting up some economical solution to, and also painting the arse solution to putting a second course of fence up here.  These rolls of fence can weigh upwards of 300 pounds.  And when you start putting them above four feet, it gets difficult.  They also cost hundreds of dollars a roll.  This typical horse fence is $100 for 100 feet or so.  So we're getting up higher and higher by putting in single lines.  Now these are ceramic rollers for where the angle changes.  And the rest of the assembly is just galvanized fence staples.  That's all it is.  You get the thick ones, the good ones.  and you leave them loose.  And now, Top Knot's going to show how to put on, what is it? ",

Is that about right?  Yep.  And so we have a run here of 200 feet.  This is a 200 foot wire, which is a short wire.  Really easy to tighten.  Couple clicks and you're playing guitar.  That's the E string.  And this is so, due to seasonal shifts, we can tighten up these upper wires.  Maybe a deer tries to jump in.  Who knows? ",

So he's not going to cut himself this time again.  I got this side.  Take your time.  Use the linesman.  You just like to rush it.  Get her done!  So right now he's what down there that top knot's doing.  He's wrapping that son of a bitch in there.  And there he goes, hand tight.  Then he goes in with the cool proprietary for the final tippy touch.  And now we could be playing this like a harpsichord, ladies and gentlemen.  Amazing work.  Coming from Goebbels, Michigan.  One of the top ranchers.  Record time.  How do you feel after that performance?  Like I just stepped in the hole.  Oh my God.  Proper prior planting prevents poor performance when the grass is high and there are holes in the ground. ",
