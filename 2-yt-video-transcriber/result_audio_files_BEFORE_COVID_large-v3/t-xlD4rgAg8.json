            "text": "Hey y'all, just wanted to wish a quick happy birthday to my beloved America, who this July 4th will turn 243 years old.  But if you ask me, she still looks just like she did when she was however old she was before segregation ended.  Now Donald Trump's done plenty to set us back and make us look bad in his time in office, but not to worry, he's got a plan to make us look good this holiday by doing what he does best, using a shitload of other people's money on a tacky, wholly unnecessary display of superficial success.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, Trump's got this big birthday bash plan called Salute to America.  Costing millions of taxpayer dollars, it's gonna include tanks and jets and helicopters and the biggest fireworks display to hit DC since the truth made an incoming Supreme Court Justice weep with rage.  It's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine.  It's all very over the top and ridiculous, but it's not at all surprising though.  I mean, this is how Trump works.  He kind of just screams his narrative at this country, and an alarming percentage of us just lap it up.  Because sure, while a lot of Trump's base is still out of work and in debt and can't afford health care, well, come Thursday, when they see that blue angel go screaming over the nation's capital and they pop a big old star-spangled boner, well, by God, America's going to start feeling pretty great again.  Fucking kill me.  And then there's the fact that a lot of money for this has been siphoned from the National Park Service.  Imagine being in the National Park Service and thinking you finally have some money you can put towards some much-needed TLC for one of the last remaining unblemished symbols of genuine American splendor.  And then the Trump administration comes in like a bully at lunchtime, just like, Yeah, sorry, we need to use all this for a bitchin' tank party.  I'm sure the trees will get over it.  It sucks, man.  But what also sucks is I know I'm playing right into their hands by bitching about it.  See, they know that liberals are going to complain about this shit on account of our brains working, and then they can just dive in on talking about how we all hate America.  That's how it works for them.  You're either a cartoon Toby Keith on Veterans Day level patriot, or you hate this country.  But that's bullshit, man.  See, America's like Game of Thrones.  And they've been running the show for the past couple seasons.  And they act like if we're critical of the way they've went about it, well, that means we were never fans to begin with.  But fuck that.  We love this show just as much as they do.  We're just disappointed and upset because we remember how much potential this show had just a few short years ago.  how awesome everything was set up to be.  And we just can't believe just how badly they have fucked it all up.  But that don't mean that we hate the show.  I mean, goddamn, this show's got the world's best storylines and heroes and entertainment and titties.  I mean, how could you not love the show?  We still love the show.  We just hate what they've done to it.  It ain't the same.  Analogies aside, seriously, liberals, this Independence Day, when you're enjoying your vegan hot dog and you're watching Trump's little chest-thumping, dick-waving charade parade go on, just remember, that calling the out-of-touch assholes in charge out on their bullshit is just about the most American thing you can do.  So, love y'all, fuck them, God bless America. ",
