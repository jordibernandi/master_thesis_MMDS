            "text": "Here's your apologetics tip of the day.  Focus on the gospel, not on apologetic arguments.  Sometimes we're so eager to try out our arguments that we initiate discussions about some apologetic subject as if that's the most important thing to discuss.  It's not.  If you have the opportunity to bring up the gospel, that matters more than any other subject.  Now, if they reject the gospel for some reason, then you can use your apologetics to address their concern.  Remember, apologetics is not an end in itself.  The end is the gospel, and apologetics is simply a means to that end.  And it can help you remove obstacles that people might have that keep them from accepting Christ.  So, if you're in a conversation and you can lead that discussion in any direction, lead them to understand what Christ has done for them.  That's your apologetics tip of the day. ",
