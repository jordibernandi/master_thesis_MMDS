So after inheriting this short position, JP started accumulating all this silver.  In fact, now, as we know, JP Morgan has the most significant physical silver position of all time.  So what gives?  What does JP know that we don't? ",

But getting back to all this market manipulation, this does not vindicate all of the conspiracy theories that have been around for years and years, that there's been a concerted effort on the part of big banks like J.P.  Morgan to artificially suppress the price of gold, that the reason the price of gold is not much higher is because of this conspiracy to keep the price of gold down to kind of keep the fiat monetary system going.  And that's not what these indictments show.  These are simple market manipulations in both directions.  WHERE THE GOAL IS?  SIMPLY TO MAKE MONEY.  I MEAN, THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.  THEY'RE TRYING TO RIG THE MARKETS TO MAKE A PROFIT.  THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO STOP THE PRICE OF GOLD FROM GOING UP.  SOMETIMES THEY'RE ACTUALLY BUYING GOLD.  THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE MONEY BY HAVING AN UNFAIR EDGE.  AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE, YOU KNOW, AND A LOT OF THIS STUFF NOW, IF YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE SPOOFING THE PRECIOUS METALS MARKETS, That's nothing compared to what's probably going on in the cryptocurrency markets.  That's where you probably see even more widespread spoofing and other types of manipulation going on. ",

I understand you're of the position that people just don't understand gold and silver.  They don't understand how the Fed works.  And that's why these prices are going down.  Is that correct? ",

            "text": "Yeah.  And first of all, you know, the price of gold went from under $300 an ounce in 2001 to almost 2000 an ounce in 2011.  So if people were trying to suppress the price of gold, they were doing a pretty bad job because the price went way up.  Now, we did have a correction.  We went down to almost 1,000, but now we've gone up about 50% since then.  But yeah, I think the price should be a lot higher, but it's not where it is because of manipulation.  It's a lack of understanding on the part of investors around the world of the real situation that's going on economically.  It's too much trust in central banks and fiat money.  But when that trust ultimately gives way, and it will, you're going to see a rush to buy precious metals.  It's already happening now.  The central banks are buying gold.  It's not going to be long before the investor class follows their lead. ",

Most people are in denial, but those who aren't are preparing.  And even if you prepare too early, that's fine because it's much better than preparing too late, which means you're not prepared at all. ",
