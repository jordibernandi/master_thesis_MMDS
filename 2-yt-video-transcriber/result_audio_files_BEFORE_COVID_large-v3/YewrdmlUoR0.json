            "text": "This is Jonathan Cahn, the author of The Paradigm, the ancient blueprint that holds the mystery of our times.  And we've been just touching on some of the things in the book.  I can only just touch on to give you a taste of it.  But the amazing things that come out of this ancient blueprint, it's over two and a half thousand years old, and yet it's revealing everything of our times, the people, the places, the events, the times when the things have to happen before they happen.  And I will just, well, I will say this before I tell you what this is.  Because what I'm going to tell you right now was not in the first edition of the book, because this only came afterwards.  I didn't know it when I wrote the paradigm.  But then I saw it, then I got it into the next editions.  But we've seen this paradigm where you, where we left off with a showdown between Jehu.  And the other thing is that, that the, the leaders of our time, the paradigm reveals they're all following these ancient prototype leaders without realizing it.  The timing, the personalities, the events, the dates.  So we have a time, in the paradigm you have Jehu, a warrior, wild guy, comes on the scene like, like out of the blue.  And head to head with the former first lady.  That's Jezebel.  Former first lady.  So you got the warrior and the former first lady head to head.  And We saw that when they, that was, we saw in America, same thing.  We saw the antitype of Jehu, Donald Trump, wild warrior, out of the blue.  And we had the antitype of the ancient queen, which is Hillary Clinton, former first lady.  And they come head to head.  And America sees it.  I mean, it's before everybody, head to head.  And while all the polls were saying that the Democrats were going to, it was going to be a wipeout, trounce Donald Trump, the paradigm said, Jehu will emerge victorious, or Donald Trump will emerge victorious over Hillary Clinton.  But now I want to share something I didn't realize.  At the Democratic convention that nominated Hillary Clinton, on the actual, as far as I know, the actual day when she is to be, she's to receive the nomination, the crowning day, a man makes a speech at the convention hailing Hillary Clinton.  I mean, it's lifting her up.  Now, here's a warning to those who might be tempted to spend the next four years trying to knock Hillary Clinton down.  You better get ready for a woman who won't stay through.  They threw her down as the First Lady, but she didn't stay through.  They threw her down as a U.S.  Senator, but she wouldn't stay through.  They threw her down as a Secretary of State, but she wouldn't stay through.  They threw her down in this very campaign, this campaign, but she won't stay through.  No, she ain't going to stay through.  She won't stay through.  She won't stay through.  They threw her down when she was the first lady, but she wouldn't stay thrown.  They threw her down when she was a senator, but she wouldn't stay thrown.  They threw her down when she was secretary.  She wouldn't stay.  They threw her down in this campaign.  They threw her down, but she wouldn't stay thrown.  Now, it's kind of strange to talk like that.  You can say they attacked her or they put her down, but they, he says they threw her down, but she wouldn't stay thrown.  Over and over and over again.  It's the threw her down speech.  They threw her down.  They threw her down.  That's the theme of the speech given on the day in the convention that brought Hillary Clinton to the nomination.  And what was she being ordained for?  To stand against Donald Trump.  It's like lifting up the former queen to stand against Jehu.  As in the Bible.  Jezebel and Jehu.  She's being anointed for that fight.  But it had been prophetic.  Well, not that the guy knows what he's doing.  Not that anybody knows what they're doing.  But when you take the key central statement of that speech, the mantra that goes over and over again, the theme of the speech, the through or down speech, take those words, through or down, type it into the internet.  Out of all the words in the world, it will take you to the Bible.  The words of the speech linked to Hillary Clinton will take you to the Bible.  And of all the places in the Bible, it will take you to Kings.  Second Kings, the chapter, the book concerning the paradigm.  It will take you to the paradigm.  And not just the paradigm, it takes you to a particular chapter and a particular verse.  What is the verse?  The verse it takes, of all the words in the world, it will take you to the verse.  And here she's being anointed to stand against Jehu.  of what happens when Jezebel, the former first lady, stands at the showdown against Jehu, the warrior, or Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.  And it's prophesying.  they threw her down.  It will be her downfall.  She will not be victorious over Donald Trump, Jehu.  She will have a downfall.  It's all there.  And this was proclaimed on the very day of her coronation to fight, stand against Donald Trump.  It's beyond, beyond, who can put this together?  Prophetic, though, and beyond.  Now, I can only touch on these things, just give you a little taste of a taste of a taste of some things in the book, but it's all there in the book.  You want to get that, that's, you full revelation.  Paradigm is everywhere.  Online you can get it, and everywhere.  But the next one we're going to is a totally different revelation, a different kind of man, and this may involve many of you.  You may actually be in the paradigm.  And so next time, we're going to open that up.  It's going to be clip 16, The Holy Man of the Paradigm.  Thank you. ",
