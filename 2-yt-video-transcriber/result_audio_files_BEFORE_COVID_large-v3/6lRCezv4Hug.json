I figured I would travel the world, take beautiful pictures, do extraordinary things, make all my wildest dreams come true, and help inspire the world to do the very same thing.  When I started that journey, I had absolutely no idea what that entailed.  I've dedicated the last five years working on that dream.  Sleepless nights, every second. ",
