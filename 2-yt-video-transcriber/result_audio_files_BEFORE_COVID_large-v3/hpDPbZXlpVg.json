I'm out here today with San Joaquin Valley Transparency and Nate Skates 182, and we are on our way to a post office audit.  But before we go there, I thought I'd show you a little bit of the sights and sounds here of Venice, California.  Yeah.  This is the corner Tony Vera hangs out at when he wants some coffee.  Please go to Tony Vera's channel.  Give him a like, share, and subscribe.  This is my new van.  I just bought to travel up and down the coast of California.  I did this stenciling myself.  Well, all these women are quite attractive, except none of them have heads, which is really a good thing because you can talk to them and they won't talk to you back.  I don't know what's going on.  Everybody clap.  Now one more time.  Oh, my God.  Up next, Nick Skache.  He's from the Philippines.  Lady, he's single.  And he wants a green card.  A new one!  Hey guys, News Now California out in the city of Venice.  I'm at the United States Post Office.  I'm out here today with San Joaquin Valley Transparency and Nate Skates 182.  This facility here is not open to the public.  It's a major distribution area.  Here we go. ",
