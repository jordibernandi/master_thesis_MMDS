            "text": "Family, the B-1 brigade goes on the march tonight.  A false flag campaign has been used against Jason Black's YouTube channel for the sake of trying to silence him.  It's the same garbage that they tried against me a few months back.  And I am calling upon you to give the same vigorous response that you gave back in August when they tried this against me.  I want you to go to Team YouTube's so-called help channel, which is in the description.  And just like you did for me, be sure to light it up.  Post the messages.  Let them know that Jason Black, the Black Authority's YouTube channel, must be reinstated immediately.  And then do the same thing on Twitter.  We shake these trees hard enough as we did a few months ago, as you did for me, and they will back down.  But this is an example of the white supremacists being terrified.  They're seeing what's happening.  Now that the numbers are getting to a place now where one video essay gets posted and you've got 40,000 people who see it in less than 24 hours, the white supremacists are feeling the pain.  They're feeling the fear.  And we are not going to allow them The white supremacists to gain any ground.  False flag campaigns are going to bring them nothing.  But it depends on you.  The B-1 brigade has a go on the march and put their shoulders to the wheel.  Don't just post once or twice.  You let them know that this is an issue that's not going away because they're always allowing the white supremacists to run roughshod over people who have done absolutely nothing wrong.  YouTube happens to be a white supremacist haven.  We know that and we're not going to let it be a safe space for white supremacists.  We're not going to allow that.  That's part of what it means when you're instituting a system of justice.  The bad guys are trying to figure out, can we have a little spot where that's going to be a bastion of injustice?  No, not even here.  Not even.  So again, take a look.  at the comment section also take a look at the description on this video so you can see the link to go to youtube's team youtube help channel here on youtube and also to their twitter channel to their twitter feed and make sure that you post repeatedly share this video.  let them know that we see what they've done what they're allowing and we will not allow it to stand.  The reason this is going on, the reason it's happening now is the white supremacists are really feeling the heat.  As I posted earlier today on Twitter, the hottest fire makes for the strongest steel.  The white supremacists have realized that we're able to have an impact.  We're dealing and rooting out their agents and their would-be spies among us.  We're making an environment where the white supremacists are simply having a harder time operating and they're looking and going, man, if it's this hard now, It's going to be impossible in a few years.  And they're right.  We're going to make it impossible.  And we're not going to allow them to slow that process down.  No, the old days of false flag campaigns.  We're putting that behind us.  We're making it clear that we're going to show our strength.  We're making it clear we're going to exercise power over all of these racist white supremacists who are trying to figure out what desperate maneuver that they can pull next.  No, they're not going to be silencing the truth.  They're not going to be throwing roadblocks in the way of the voice of justice.  For too long, they've been getting away with this mess, and now we're bringing it to an end.  But family, you got to get on this.  Spread the word.  Because what they're doing is they're testing us.  They're trying to figure out if we attack one of the thought leaders of black empowerment, what's the response going to be from those Negroes?  Are we going to be hit up by the hundreds and thousands?  Or is there going to be a tepid response?  This is a test.  They're trying to figure out just how much hot water they're really in.  Well, let's show them that this ain't hot water.  It's lava here.  Let's show them that they're not going to be getting away with the old tricks.  They're not going to be doing this mess because we won't allow them to.  This is the kind of resolve that we have to show, the kind of resolve we have not shown in so long.  And if we are weak at moments like this, if we are not unified at moments like this, if we do not bring the heat at moments like this, it will only serve to embolden the white supremacists.  It will only serve to let them know that, oh, okay, those Negroes, they were just blowing off some steam.  No, a few months ago, the white supremacists attacked this very YouTube channel, and you guys, the B-1 Brigade, you rallied, you brought the heat, you brought the hammer down, and you made them back off.  Well, now we gotta do it again.  And we have to do it again and again and again and every time.  Anytime we are met with white supremacist aggression, we are going to fight our way back and we are going to make them back down and put them on the run.  The white supremacists are not going to be winning the day.  The white supremacists are not going to be gaining any ground.  We fought too hard for it and we're not giving them anything.  Not one inch, not one centimeter, not one step back.  You share this on social media.  You spread the word.  Go to YouTube's so-called help channel and then go to Twitter and hit them up on their so-called creator feed and let them know that we're calling them out because of the fact that they have attacked Jason Black's YouTube channel.  They're attacking the Black Authority.  This is an attack on all of us.  This is an attempt to silence us because what happened is we've shown what we can do.  They're figuring that if they do it now with everybody's attention on that nonsense nothing burger in Washington, they figure they can get away with it.  Everybody's looking the other way, so they think they can get away with this.  Let's show them that they have gotten away with absolutely nothing.  Because earlier on Twitter, I had a few of the trolls who came to my Twitter channel telling me that, ha ha, we were the ones behind it.  So you understand, this is a concerted effort going on, same way it always has.  But what's new, what must be new, is our vigorous response to this.  The white supremacists who happen to run YouTube, they are very bold until they get called out, until they are challenged, because they know that they're doing it wrong.  But what they also know is that they haven't really been substantively challenged.  They haven't had us speaking in one unified voice saying, no more, not ever again.  They haven't had that happen.  This is exactly what the white supremacists always do.  Whenever the YouTube channel starts getting too many people, and Jason was over 80,000 people, when it starts getting numbers like that, the white supremacists are like, this is a game changer.  This is going to sink us.  We got to stop this now.  I have no illusions that many of the people who have attacked Jason's channel do in fact work for YouTube.  We are not at all naive about that.  We are not in denial about that.  We see things clearly.  And now we're going to open their eyes, whether they like it or not.  So again, family, I want you to look at this channel's description so you can see the links.  Then go to YouTube's so-called help channel and then go hit them up on Twitter as well.  Make the kind of noise that you made on my behalf a few months ago.  This is the time for us to show our strength.  This is the time for us to show our resolve.  You've always wanted to know what the world can you do for black empowerment.  What you can do is what the baby boomers failed to do.  And that is to stick up for the thought leaders who are speaking for you and who are promoting your agenda.  This is something that black people have always been lax on.  You were there for me and now we gotta be there for our brother in arms, Jason Black.  We are not allowing the white supremacists to get away with the old tricks.  We're not allowing them to be able to get away with this nonsense.  Forget it.  The days of them having it all their own way are over.  They are over because you and I are bringing an end to it.  The white supremacists Thinking that they're going to be the ones calling the shots.  Forget about it.  Now black empowerment's taking control.  YouTube decided to play along with this false flag campaign.  And what they think is they're getting away with something.  And you're going to have to call them out on it and let them know.  we see what it is that you've done.  No rules were violated.  We're not going to allow you to do the old.  we're white and we say so.  You're wrong.  And we say so. ",
