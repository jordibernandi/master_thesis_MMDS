We will become and stay totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.  Anybody hostile to our interests, believe me, we don't deal with them, we'll handle them just fine.  Just fine.  And by the way, there are plenty of them out there that are hostile to our interests.  At the same time, we'll work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.  We'll work with them because we have to knock out terrorism.  Thank you. ",
