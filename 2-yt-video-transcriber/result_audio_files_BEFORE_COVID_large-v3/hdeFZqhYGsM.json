            "text": "The Scripps.  National Spelling Bee is back once again.  Hundreds have reached the final rounds, but only one can win.  To help the remaining contestants and you at home, we look through 21 years of spelling bee mistakes to figure out some of the most common pitfalls.  Here are five tips that can help someone go far in the spelling bee.  Tip number one, don't be intimidated by word length.  Here, you give it a try.  Your word is triskaidekaphobia.  The correct spelling is T-R-I-S-K-A-I-D-E-K-A-P-H-O-B-I-A.  Did you get it right?  You'd expect a word like this to be challenging.  There are more letters and more opportunities for error.  But in reality, most super long words aren't harder to spell than shorter ones.  You can see in this chart that shorter words and longer words are misspelled more or less equally.  It's likely because longer words are technical or scientific in nature and often follow rules that are familiar to good spellers.  So if you want to spell a long word, try breaking it down into shorter words first.  Tip number two, a little Talmud study couldn't hurt.  Here are the five toughest languages of origin at this spelling bee from 1996 to 2014.  You've got a little Russian, some Sanskrit, American Spanish, Persian, and then the most difficult language, Hebrew.  There weren't many Hebrew words at the B during that time, but just 45% of the 20 words were spelled correctly.  Tip number three, beware the deadly schwa.  The most common vowel sound in English is called the schwa.  It's the uh sound in the word pizza.  The thing that makes the schwa difficult to spell is that all English vowels can make its particular sound.  For example, A makes it in pizza, like we said.  E can make it in a word like elephant.  I in pencil, O in oven, U in a word like supper.  Even a Y can make the schwa sound.  Think of syringe.  Sometimes multiple vowels combine to make one schwa.  Take the word patriless, which has two schwas spelled two different ways.  The schwa is the speller's natural enemy.  Tip number four.  Double letters can mean trouble.  pavilion, tinnitus, philippic.  Double letters are easy to overlook.  Of the double letter combos, double L has been the most vicious culprit, appearing in 83 of the roughly 1400 late round knockout words.  Double R is also dangerous.  The word parterre knocked out Julie Palmer in 2001 and Catherine Cross in 2004.  Asking for a word's definition and knowing where it derived from can help.  For example, a parterre is an ornamental garden, and it comes from French.  You might recognize that terre is French for earth, and that could unlock parterre for you.  Tip number five, embrace the ch-ch-ch-changes.  There are two ways can trip spellers up.  First, the sound, like in checkers or chess, can be made by letters other than .  The word has been posed three times at the from 1996 to 2016, but not a single speller has gotten it right.  Second, the combination doesn't always sound like .  Think Christmas or cholera.  Other times, even when a word sounds like it might have a hard , it doesn't.  Sean Conley made the mistake on a word he was posed in 1999, offering the spelling C-H-O-R-E-O-P-S-I-S.  But there's no H there.  Choreopsis is a genus of herb and comes from chorus, meaning bedbug.  So there you have it, our five tips to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee.  1.  Longer words aren't necessarily harder.  Two, maybe brush up on that Hebrew.  Three, be careful of that uh sound.  Four, pay attention to those tricky double letters.  And five, watch out for that ch.  Now when you're watching the competition, you can keep an eye out and see if any of this year's spellers make any of these common mistakes. ",
