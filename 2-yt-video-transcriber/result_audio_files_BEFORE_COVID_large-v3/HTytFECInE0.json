            "text": "Good evening, everyone.  Welcome back to your Friday evening episode of Blue Ridge Silverhound.  And today we have a doozy for you.  This one is going to be entertaining.  Don't go anywhere.  This one will blow the lid right off your head.  I'm serious.  This video right here has a lot of pretty insane, hard to digest type of coins that sold for huge amounts of money.  So today we're gonna talk about 10, get it, 10 Lincoln cents.  All common date, all extremely high mintage, relatively common coins that for each single one of these coins pretty much sold for over $10,000.  There is even some that sold for two and three times that amount.  The number 10 coin, however, I'm going to use as my honorable mention piece to this whole list.  And it's this crazy 1975 Lincoln cent.  I did a video on this coin a while back when it sold.  And I got to say, this thing should be impossible for the amount of money it sold for.  This one sold way back in April 27th of last year, 2018 through heritage auctions.  And this one right here, folks sold for $9,000.  All right.  So we're going to use this coin as a model for the rest of the coins on the list.  Okay.  You're going to see a few old ones.  You're going to see a lot of new ones.  I, you will be in complete shock utter awe and disbelief by the absolute insane value figures that these coins have sold for.  the important thing is we're also going to look at and kind of review you know based off of when these coins have sold.  have they lost value or have they gained value since that time?  so it'll be kind of like a little a two-part kind of uh thing that we're doing here other than just announcing how much he sold for back you know 10 years ago.  so this one right here of course like every other coin on the list it's all grade driven all right.  that's the key as to why these coins sold for a lot of money.  Your typical 1975 Lincoln Cent does not sell for $9,000, let alone $5,000 or $1,000.  Okay, there's a specific reason why.  And with this one, it is a Top Pop graded PCGS Mint State 68, full red.  It was also graded in a Secure Plus holder.  Okay, so with all those different factors coming into the equation, You know, and this was probably only one of two that existed at this grade level the same time last year.  And that's why it sold for the amount of money it did.  $9,000.  That's the only lowest coin under $10,000 on the list.  The other ones will just blow your mind like in a huge way.  So I'm going to go about the list in no specific order.  You know, I'm going to kind of bounce around, just kind of shock and awe you a little bit.  But this next coin right here is gonna be a 1937D Lincoln Memorial cent.  Oh, and by the way, before we go too much further, I wanted to let you know that in 1975, the US Mint produced 5.4 billion.  these coins and then there was one that sold for nine thousand dollars.  let that kind of register in your mind.  i i mean again it's not supposed to happen based off of the ratio of the amount of coins produced compared to this one single solitary coin that sold for this kind of money.  uh it seems very backwards you know in terms of the market of these coins.  So this 193070, okay, this is a really nice coin.  It's, I think, I believe the only 1930s coin on the list.  So that tells you a lot.  You know, these coins are not the greatest of shape.  A lot of the dates have low mintages compared to some of the other ones that I'm gonna talk about.  But this one graded out PCGS Mint State 68 Red.  All right, this one sold on Heritage Auctions.  December 4th of 2008.  So it's been a while.  It's been a little while, a hot minute since this one sold.  This one sold for $11,500.  That's a lot of coin right there.  Of course that was over 10 years ago.  The mintage on this, okay, it's up there.  The mint made 50,430,000 pieces of the 1937D.  Okay, it is relatively common in all grades.  if you were to buy them raw.  They're virtually everywhere in wheat scent bags, and sometimes you find them in change.  When you go to coin shops or coin shows, you know, raw, brilliant, uncirculated mint state caliber examples that are not graded.  You can buy them traditionally between $3 and $5.  Again, not a rare coin by any means.  But this one here in the 68 grade is extremely high.  It's one of the highest around for this coin.  Compared to 10 years ago, I'm pretty sure this coin has gone down in value and I'm pretty sure there's been a few more examples.  of a mint state 68 red that have come into the marketplace since 2008.  So I would say to assume that this coin is somewhere south of $10,000 with the extra supply out in the market.  Now this next coin right here is a huge example as to the changing of the market.  What we have here is a 1954 Lincoln Wheat Scent.  This one graded out PCGS Mint State 67 Red.  Holy smokes, tough grade for the state.  The state has been plagued with a myriad of various problems from carbon spots, planchet flaws, you know, right out of the mint.  And these coins were handled rough, right, in the canvas bag from Fed Reserve to bank and to the customer.  So there's very few examples in 67.  However, this example right here sold just a couple months ago, January 10th of 2019 through Heritage Auctions to the tune of $31,200.  Someone really wanted their 1954 Lincoln wheat scent.  bad enough.  Here's the thing about this coin, okay?  One sold on eBay a few days ago for guess what?  How much?  $7,500.  So there's been more of these that have come out into the marketplace within the last few months.  As you can see, it decimated the actual value of all the coins in 67.  The one coin that was sold for $31,200 back in January, you know, it's now effectively worth under $10,000, you know, which... If you're not in the registry game, Lincoln cents, okay, to a certain point, not exactly the greatest investment, especially when you're looking at strictly top population coins, because eventually more will enter the marketplace.  More people will find them, they'll grade them, they'll come out at 68 or 67, and it'll just kill the market.  So kind of a little cautionary tale for you folks out there that want to dip your toe into this kind of part of numismatics.  it's it's a tough one it's a bloodbath sometimes.  so the next coin coming up here okay is uh it's it's a good one.  this is a good looking coin right here.  it's a 1921 lincoln wheat scent.  uh philadelphia.  of course i forgot to tell you the mintage of the 54 but it was 71 million 640 000 pieces.  the 1921. um you know even though it's a philadelphia mint okay they did produce 39 million 157 000 of this particular date.  okay so it's not huge.  but at the same time it's not a key date.  it's not a low mintage.  it's kind of like mid-pack when it comes to those earlier dated Lincoln Wheat Scents.  This one graded PCGS Mint State 68 in full red.  You can't get any more loftier than that.  This one sold on Heritage Auctions January 10, 2019.  I think it was concurrent with the sale of that 54 for $36,000.  Talk about a tough date to find in anything higher than 66.  As a matter of fact, any coin from the 20s, really tough.  These things were abused, circulated.  And we're talking about a time pre-stock market crash of 1929 when the world was truly depressed.  And people were spending this kind of money.  And they were getting beat up, that's for sure.  The coins, that is.  So this is a tremendous coin, and to see a surviving example is a rarity, all right, nonetheless.  So this next coin I did a video on a little while ago, and some of you probably remember this, but it's the 1963D Lincoln wheat cent.  For the longest time, this has been my chase coin.  I've personally gone through easily about $200 face in BU rolls of 63Ds to try and locate A pristine example like this one, which by the way, it's a PCGS graded Mid-State 67 full red.  This one sold September 30th, 2018 last year.  Great Collections was the hosting auction service and this one sold for $14,625.  It's the very first mint state 67 coin to exist in the market.  Again, not rare as far as a date goes.  There were quite a few of these produced.  As a matter of fact, nearly 1.8 billion pieces were produced in 63 of the Denver minted variant of this coin.  However, to find one that is fully struck with full luster, extremely difficult.  and it's not for the faint of heart you could really easily lose your shorts if you're not careful again you know submitting these coins through those grading services.  So the next coin, you know, we're going to tone it down just a hair, but not by much, is a 1949 Lincoln wheat scent.  This one right here is another phenomenal looking example that graded really high.  This one was a PCGS Mint State 67 Plus full red.  Okay, so it's one of your better dates.  out there, especially with the plus designation.  It really gives it a nice kick in the pants for the value.  This one sold on Great Collections October 7th, 2018.  So it was a short while ago.  This one, I'm happy to say, sold for $10,968.75.  Another truly phenomenal looking coin.  It's certainly out of this world for sure.  So it definitely belongs amongst the stars as far as a really high-grade gem in the 1940s.  Uh, so, you know, we have a few more coins here and they're all, they're all tough because there's some of the earlier dated ones and some that are just really tough to find in general in high grades.  This one right here is a 1929 S Lincoln cent, uh, wheatback variety.  This one graded PCGS mid state 66 plus full red CAC certified.  I'm telling you, 1920s, ever so tough in the marketplace.  But to see one that graded 66+, it's not even a 67, and still sell for $11,822.62 is truly remarkable.  the mintage on this one again it's mid-pack.  you're looking at about 50 million 148 000 pieces but the survivability rate of some of those gem bu full red examples is few and far between.  this one however that sold through great collections on february 10th of this year 2019 is a sweet looking coin.  all right this one is absolutely phenomenal.  So this next one may kind of shock and surprise you a little bit, but this one's a 1946 Lincoln wheat scent.  This one graded out PCGS mid-state 67 full red.  And this one sold on Stax Bowers.  They're the other hosting auction service that's highlighted on this video.  By the way, all of the photos are provided by Heritage, Great Collections, and Stax.  for all three of these, for all the review coins on this video.  This 1946, extremely tough grade when it did sell nine years ago.  PCGS 67, of course not a low grade by any standards.  This one sold for $10,062.50.  All right, so just north of the five-figure mark.  Truly beautiful example, if I say so myself.  And then coming in, we're almost done here, and we have a 1919.  This is probably one of my favorites on the list.  This one, get this, folks, graded PCGS Mint State 68 Red.  Whoo!  a coin that is uh officially 100 years old as of this year.  pretty crazy now.  this was part of the medio da costa gomez collection.  okay um the collection is a bunch of high grade.  uh astronomically ridiculous.  um lincoln cents full red like 67 68s.  This one sold also on Stacks Bowers, June 28th of 2004 for the princely sum of $12,650.  Truly magnificent coin.  You can actually see just the pure, just the overall texture of the surfaces of this coin.  Their originality is just second to none.  And finally, we can also lump this coin in.  to the originality aspect of the 1919 that we just saw.  And let's go ahead and talk about the 1913 Lincoln Wheat scent that also sold on Stax Bowers.  uh yeah this one's crazy pcgs mid-state 67 plus full red.  this one is in a retro original green holder coin so it might even be a little bit undergraded.  uh because those older green holders were from the late 80s.  so the word around the street is you know they were a little bit more stricter with the grading guidelines so this one might actually have a little bit more room to go up half a point.  maybe it could be a 68 someday who knows.  So again, this is another Stax Bowers coin.  This one sold April 4th of 2017.  This one is a little bit more recent, but check this out.  This coin was nice enough and hot enough in the market during that time that it sold for a tremendous $35,250.  Yeah, I'm officially throwing the clipboard in the air and all the papers flying around because this list was absolutely nuts.  I forgot to tell you though, The 1919 had a mintage of 392 million pieces.  That seems like a lot for its time, but it's well within line because it is a Philadelphia minted coin and that's where a lot of the production came from.  The 1913 also had a pretty decent vintage figure of 76.5 million pieces produced.  So to find examples in 67 plus and 68, again, it's tough as nails.  It's like hen's teeth.  But I hope you guys enjoyed this absolutely ridiculous list of just 10 random pieces high vintage coins absolutely common in the marketplace.  that's sold for uh you know money that would best be reserved for the prince of persia.  it's that insane crazy.  so i want to thank everyone for joining in on this one.  as always come check me out on facebook instagram and twitter.  the best way that you can support my channel bar none is.  go ahead and hit that like button if you like today's content.  i would love to hear what you have to say about some of these.
