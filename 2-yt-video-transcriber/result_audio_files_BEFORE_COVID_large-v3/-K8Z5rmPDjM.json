            "text": "October the 1st, 2019.  Guys, last night, a lot of folks asked me to do another Bible study, and this has been on my mind quite a bit lately.  Let me say this, we're looking at Matthew 24, King James Version, and this is the eSword software that I linked last night.  It's completely free.  It'll let you search out any word in the Bible.  You can... use the greek and hebrew translations.  that's in the strong's concordance that will come in on this.  it's all just a click on the tools guys and it's a whole new wealth of information and the search alone for any word or phrase in the bible is tremendous.  it's a tremendous tool And in the Bible, a lot of things are repeated a lot, many times, three times for emphasis.  And you're looking at Matthew 24, 1, King James.  And this message was repeated three times for you guys taking notes.  It's in Matthew 24, it's in Luke 21, and it's in Mark 13.  The same story, three times for emphasis.  Now, I'm going to use Matthew in this particular message, if you want to put it like that.  But guys, what's happening is, you know, you are just like I am.  One of the main questions that we have, if you think about it, is what are the signs of the end times?  I mean, are we looking at a catastrophic asteroid impact?  Are we looking at war?  Solar flares, knocking out the power, whatever.  What are the signs?  And Christ very simply answered that question here.  Now, if you dig a little bit deeper, some of these answers that he gives to these disciples that are asking about the end times may surprise you.  Maybe it won't.  Let me go through this.  And Jesus had come out of the temple, says Jesus went out, departed from the temple, and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple.  They said, Lord, look at this magnificent temple.  And Jesus said, and notice that this particular chapter has a lot of words in red.  Jesus said unto them, see ye not all these things?  Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.  We know that the temple area will be trodden.  It's been torn down many times, but in the end times, you've got this three and a half year period.  But guys, here's what, when we get deep into this, And he said upon the Mount of Olives, which is guys at that time, you know, you had two mountains when the temple was on.  You go down the little creek and go up on the hill on the other side and on the Mount of Olives.  And that's where they were at.  And he's as he said upon this Mount of Olives that the disciples came into him privately saying when a big group wasn't a large crowd.  tell us and he's telling all of us now when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world?  now guys don't stop listening to this video now because i know this sounds familiar.  you've heard it all before right?  just keep listening.  and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you.  we talked about that in the video last night for many.  many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many because people are looking for a man to save them.  and we were told was it in the book of timothy There is no man can intercede.  You don't need that.  You don't need it, regardless of what preachers tell you or what major churches around the planet tell you. ",

What was the first thing?  bread?  bread.  think about it famines.  and when we talk about the other world views and the chaos that can be involved with that famines would do it.  that would start a very big problem because it would start a food war across the planet.  pestilence and earthquakes in many places.

No.  Not really concerned about the person that passed.  I've seen it in my life.  And the love of many shall wax cold because of that sin, that greed.  But this is not the best part. ",

            "text": "guys this is getting to a major point.  listen to me don't read over this lightly.  We've got the gospel going to be preached in all the world for witness into all nations and then show the income fast.  It's going to be coming very quickly at that point.  But we're already going to see the wars and rumors of wars and pestilence and famines.  These are the tribulations of man, not the wrath of God.  So what happens after Matthew 24, 14 in the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come.  Just like the trumpets, trumpets of battle, trumpets in revelation.  When it starts, it's going to come very quickly.  It says, when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place.  who so reason?  let him understand.  then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains.  now we're getting to the meat of this video.  let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of the house.  neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.  guys never forget matthew 24 19 that i just read you.  why would it be?  woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.  we're going to get to that but pray you that your flight not be in the winter neither on the sabbath day.  two keys to this day sabbath and a winter day.  but listen for then shall be great tribulation such as was not seen since the beginning of the world to this time nor shall ever be why?  instantly god has had enough jesus christ is coming And as soon as that abomination of desolation stands up, all hell is going to break loose.  Again, just stay with me here, guys.  Except those days should be shortened.  There should be no flesh be saved.  But for the elect's sake, those days should be shortened.  The election, guys, the chosen ones, the ones that stood and fought.  Did they also fight?  when satan gathered a third of the angels and went against god what did the other two-thirds do?  are they in the election?  think about it says then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there.  believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders.  How is that going to happen?  Who is going to be these false prophets?  Who is going to be the locust army?  In so much that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  Guys, it is not possible.  And if it were, it's what it says, but it is not.  The election know what's coming.  And it's their job to let everyone else know it.  behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth.  behold he is in the secret chambers believe it or not.  why?  because he is coming in the sky with a cloud of witnesses after his sign is shown and the nations tremble.  For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.  For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together, the vultures.  Because when this happens, and that great earthquake happens, there's going to be a great change in the twinkling of an eye.  when this election is gathered from the four corners of the planet.  But it gets better.  Immediately after the tribulation of those days, guys, so this is the tribulation of man.  We haven't seen Christ yet.  Listen, he says, the sun shall be darkened.  This is getting to the meat of the message.  And the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken.  What are they talking about?  Let me show you something.  Many people say this is an asteroid shower, comets hitting the planet.  No, it's much deeper than that.  And it's got to do with those that give suck in the end times.  Or with child.  These stars are not asteroids.  I don't care what anybody tells you.  They're not falling stars.  They're not a meteor shower.  Three times in Job 38, Revelation 9, Revelation 120.  These stars are angels, messengers.  When the morning stars in Job 38 sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy.  Remember, Revelation 9, 1.  This is very important.  The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth.  Not an asteroid.  And to him, him, was given the key to the bottomless pit.  This is Apollyon.  It is a... an angel that has fallen and in revelation one twenty the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks.  the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches.  the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.  all three of these relate to messengers some good some bad.  now back to matthew for a moment.  immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.  guys this is it.  pay attention what has just fallen from heaven And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  And he shall send his angels with the great sound of the trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other.  This is the gathering together.  It is after the tribulation.  But again, guys, you know that message.  The message I'm talking about is who is falling from heaven.  Why should you not be giving suck?  Why should you not be with child?  Let's continue.  I'm going to skip down to 2436 for time, guys.  It's just a couple of verses there.  But of that day and hour north, no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my father only.  But as in the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of son of man be.  What is he talking about?  For as in those days there were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark.  Who was?  fallen angels guys and that's where the Giants came from and the other tribes that were there was always a battle.  that is why when God saw this this pollution of his seed the floods came.  why is Christ bringing that up again with these these falling stars drinking and marrying and giving in marriage?  Why were they doing it then?  Why would they be doing it this time?  OK, look at the real scenario here, guys.  We've got all the wars and rumors of war starting to coming famine.  False prophets, the locust army.  And what happens during that time?  The fallen angels return.  They deceive mankind.  They deceive the women into marrying and giving in marriage.  Why does he say don't be impregnated at that time?  Don't be giving suck.  Don't be with child.  Why?  What happened then?  The giants were born.  And it has a spiritual meaning also.  Are you in bed with the lies of Satan?  Are you impregnated in that false spiritual doctrine?  But it also is physical.  So we're going to see a reintroduction of the fallen angels, and people may want to call them ETs, whatever they want, saviors, false messiahs, whatever.  This is what Christ is talking about.  Woe unto those that give suck in those days.  And knew not until the flood came and took them all away, so shall also be the coming of the Son of Man be.  These angels will be here.  There will be another influx.  what we what a lot of people want to know is how will that appear?  and you people talk about the great alien messiah the deception coming.  will that be part of the plan?  but who knows for sure?  but you better understand what christ was saying.  there's another influx of the fallen angels and they're going to be drinking and eating and marrying and giving in marriage and woe to those that are with child and giving suck in those days.  Then shall two be in the field, and one shall be taken, and the other left.  Two women shall be grinding at the mill, and one shall be taken, and the other left.  Watch therefore, for you know not what hour your Lord doth come.  don't know the hour and time but we know the signs of the end times.  and guys if you don't think they're talking about fallen angels or possibly um what will be called extraterrestrial life false messiah the great savior coming.  christ said it many shall come in my name before me.  who are these?  many who are the great and renowned men?  They're coming back.  It's a heads up, guys.  Don't let some preacher steer you away from the truth of these letters in red.  He's telling us what's happening.  And many people have talked about this for a long time.  But here it is.  And guys, this is just a drop in the bucket.  Read this.  Study it.  Let me just end with the last couple of verses.  It says, Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an hour as you think not, the Son of Man cometh that day.  Who then is faithful and wise?  Or who is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  Meat is food, guys.  If you look at the Hebrew word, it's not flesh.  And when King David sat down to meet, do you know that that word in Hebrew was raisin bread?  It's the ruler of his household that has prepared not only physically to feed his family in this new season, he has studied the word of the Lord to give them the spiritual meat also.  Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.  Think about it.  Verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.  But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming.  Guys, when we just read, we don't know when he's coming.  And shall begin to smite his fellow servants to eat and drink with the drunken.  The Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him.  and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Guys, that could be just a heart attack.  When you're partying, eating, drinking, whatever, not looking, take you down before you have time to redeem yourself.  Think about what I'm telling you.  You think the Bible doesn't talk about these fallen angels and what's coming upon this planet?  You're wrong.  You can argue with these words in red all you want to, guys.  But for those that have eyes to see and ears to hear, I hope this is a message.  It's a heads up, guys.  Be safe. ",
