No.  So we're all struggling with sin.  That's why we need a savior.  Because everyone, you and me and everyone in this room, needs the sacrifice that Christ provided, regardless of what our feelings are, regardless of which way we're directed, based on nature or nurture.

Actually, though, if you look at what Jesus said, when you look at Matthew chapter five, Jesus actually ratchets up the standard.  He says, if you're just angry with your brother, you're guilty.  Well, thanks, Jesus.  I don't have a prayer of living up to that, and I don't.  He says, be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.  I can't do that.  You can't do that.  Nobody in this room can do that.  Who can do it?  Only he can.  That's why we need him.  So we all have these struggles, Sammy.  I have struggles.  You have struggles.

In fact, there were things I wish were different, but I'm not the general manager of the universe.  I'm not God.  So... I guess back to your question, you'd have to define exactly what you mean by love.  What does love mean?  Can you care for somebody of the same sex?  Of course you can.  I do.  The question is, should you go further than that into some sort of romantic relationship?  That's the question. ",
