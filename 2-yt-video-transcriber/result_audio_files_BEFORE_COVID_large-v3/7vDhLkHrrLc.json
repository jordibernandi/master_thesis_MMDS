            "text": "Welcome to 100 Clues.  The Philippines is the ancient land of gold known as Ophir in the Bible and history.  No, it's no fable.  And this has already been proven in full in the God Cultures Solomon's Gold Series in such a definitive way that no historian, scholar, theologian has been able to disprove their findings in over two years.  The few that have tried to debate have failed.  We have pulled out 100 clues from this research in which we will highlight briefs of the most compelling points.  And yes, there are over 100.  These videos are for those who have not had the time to watch Solomon's Gold series, and a five minute or so video cannot replace that entire 50 video in-depth series, nor prove the way that it does.  But this will still be very effective nonetheless.  So go there for full evidence.  But now our series, 100 Clues the Philippines is O' Fear, one clue at a time.  The Philippines is one of the most overlooked places on Earth as it leads the world in many things, especially some mentioned by the Bible even.  Some of the largest deposits of mineral resources on Earth have been discovered in the Philippines in recent years.  But let's start with the one that defines, oh fear, the land of gold.  Yes, gold itself.  This will surprise many.  Even Wikipedia records the Philippines as mining gold since 1000 BC.  For those who wish to challenge Wikipedia, be sure to watch the next videos, because you have no challenge, as history agrees with this.  But we'll get there.  For now, one clue at a time.  Solomon's gold series proves this much further.  But if the Philippines was mining gold in 1000 BC in a gold rush status, which it would have to, that means it has been in that trade for over 3,000 years.  Again, find another.  Because any land claiming to be Ophir would have to produce this as fact.  And they cannot.  Only the Philippines can.  Not only has the Philippines been mining since 1000 BC, but still, today, it remains the number two country on Earth in untapped gold deposits in the ground.  Let's go to the source of this report.  Can we say this with confidence?  Not just confidence, but we will now establish this as fact.  why?  this first source is, drum roll, none other than Forbes Magazine, and confirmed by many others.  Basically, just the foremost economic publication, or at least among them, on Earth.  Yeah, that one.  In 2015, Forbes cites a study released by NASA and the mining companies in which the Philippines is identified as the world's second largest gold reserves in the ground, untapped, on the planet today.  What?  Have you heard that before?  Well, if you have watched Solomon's Gold Stories, you have.  But this is a rare category that, oops, Ethiopia, Yemen, and even India do not fit in and have never made this list, nor will they.  Yet, they claim to be Ophir based on nothing.  When the Philippines fits as an exact science, we will show you, overwhelmingly and indisputably, over these 100 clues.  It's laughable.  This is even debated, even on this one single point.  But by the end of this series, you will be so overwhelmed with evidence, there will be no denying it.  nor debating it, which is pretty much the response we get to our Solomon's Gold series.  Perhaps a point here or there, a side note.  someone wishes to pick apart, but the conclusion is sound and extremely strong.  And every scholar, pastor, and every person on earth, especially those in the Philippines, should test this out, research it for yourself, and actually really prove it.  And hey, try to prove it wrong.  Many have.  No one has proven these conclusions wrong in over two years.  While the New York Times confirms Forbes that the Philippines is the world's second largest in gold deposits in the ground untapped, it also ranks the Philippines in the top five countries worldwide for overall mineral deposits, generally.  Again, since 1000 BC, many of those resources have been mined in the Philippines.  Thus, no, it's not number five.  Even in those categories, when one looks at all of history, before some of these other nations were mining anything, but no matter, We'll get there too.  So if the Philippines is number two in gold today and really number one in gold in history prior to a point we'll cover, is there anyone else in the running as the ancient land of gold?  The only one would be South Africa, as it is listed as number one in gold deposits today, indisputably, but again, oops, that's just today, and for the last hundred or so years only.  They did not even discover gold according to their own universities until 1100 AD.  Now, that's over 2,000 years too late when the Philippines had already been mining gold in a consistent, abundant gold rush.  Don't worry, we'll prove that further.  And South Africa's gold rush did not even begin until 1884, a little over 100 years ago.  So yes, South Africa leads today with the Philippines still coming in at number two, but... In the 3,000 years of history of Ophir, the Philippines is by far the number one source of gold on the planet in all of history.  There is no one else which compares.  So just what does this clue tell us?  Ladies and gentlemen, the Philippines is the ancient land of gold, oh fear, as it is the number one land of gold in all of history.  Thus, the land of gold, and no one else qualifies.  Really, all claims already dispelled.  Don't worry, we'll deal with them head on, one clue at a time.  Wait till you review all 100 clues as this short video is not the case.  It's one clue.  And you too will find this very difficult to dispute.  When you get to probably even number 20, whether alone, 100 yes, we will be releasing 100 compelling reasons.  Any scholar or even pastor not taking this seriously has done little to no research on the topic.  So their opinions based on no actual research of their own is really impertinent.  Anyone beginning with the falsened paradigm of demanding archaeology of architecture or golden temples is making up their own story, as they will never find one historical narrative that says Ophir built such, but that it had an abundance of resources, especially gold, in fact, beyond any other land.  which fits the Philippines.  That land is found, and it is known as the Philippines today.  It is time this knowledge be restored.  For those about to comment in ignorance, yep, we always get them.  We dare you to watch Solomon's Gold series, By the God Culture, the original channel to prove the Philippines is in fact Ophir.  Even here, we are breaking these into sound bites and clear points as requested.  But watch how all 100 clues tie together in history, the Bible, science, archaeology, geography, language, etc.  And this series will blow you away.  Thank you for watching 100 Clues.
