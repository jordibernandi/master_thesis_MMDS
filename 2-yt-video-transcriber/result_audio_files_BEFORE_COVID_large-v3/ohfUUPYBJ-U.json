Do Border Patrol agents or ICE agents ever go on any other networks to tell the story of what's happening at the border?

She said, if you're mad that I think people should know when Dems vote to expand ICE powers, then be mad.  She writes, ICE is a dangerous agency with zero accountability, widespread reporting of rape, abuse of power, and children dying in DHS custody.  Having a D next to your name doesn't make that right.  And you say... ",

            "text": "Okay, let's talk about it.  I was supposed to be on an airplane this morning going to Dallas to do an event with Sheriff Bill Weyburn, Sheriff in Tarrant County, and I canceled my flight to respond to this.  So I'm sorry I couldn't make the event for Sheriff Weyburn, but I had to be here.  Look... She said we're dangerous.  What's dangerous?  You have a congresswoman that doesn't know fact and fiction.  You have a congresswoman that doesn't know how to tell the truth.  I forgot more about this subject than she'll ever know in her two whole months of being a congresswoman.  She said three things.  She said that ICE was holding children down and injecting them with antipsychotic drugs.  Are you kidding me?  That allegation was made against HHS, a different agency in a different department, and she failed to mention those allegations where I'm substantiated.  That was not ICE.  As far as raping women and sexually abusing women, ICE rescued 310 women from traffickers last year.  We found them.  We saved them.  We save women.  We don't rape them.  In the NGOs, the main investigation, our facility, they huddle massive sexual abuse.  FBI went in there, did a full investigation, found nothing.  I'm sick and tired of ICE agent officers who are being accused of this stuff.  She said children died in ICE custody.  A child has never died in ICE custody, ever.  Give me one name of a child that died in ICE custody.  Two children died in custody of the Border Patrol, and it wasn't their fault.  They did everything they could to save these women.  So this lady, this congressman, needs to get her facts straight.  What infuriates me, if I bury too many border patrol agents and ICE agents to have her spit on their grave or her spreading these rumors about ICE, if she wants to place blame on the 30% women being raped by these criminal organizations and children dying crossing borders, she needs to look in the mirror because she supports... sanctuary cities, abolishing ICE, open borders, which entices more people to come to this country.  I'm upset.  I've never been this upset in my career.  How dare she?  Where's the ethics investigations in Ocasio-Cortez and saying what she says? ",

We lost so many of them that they leave the safety and security at home every day to defend this nation.  And she dishonors them with these total lies.  Let me mention one more thing.  She says too many people died in ICE custody.  Last year, nine adults died in ICE custody.  We dealt with 350,000 people from third world countries who never seen a doctor.  I'm surprised only nine died.  But look at New York City.  From 2001 to 2009, 246 people died in custody.  New York City officials, that's 27 years, three times more than ICE ever thought of having.  We have the lowest mortality rate of any system.  So she ought to need to look in her own backyard in New York before she denigrates the men and women of ICE. ",
