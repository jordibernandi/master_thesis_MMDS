There's a warrant on the plate.  If you ever buy a used car, maybe even you loaned your car to somebody and they got arrested in it, it can be as simple as a DUI.  Maybe their DUI arrest goes to warrant.  It'll stay on your license plate and on your vehicle, and you'll get pulled over for that felony warrant.  Anytime we get a used car from a private party, you know, that's already got the plate on there, it's probably not easy to check what's on that plate.  You might just go ahead and get a new one.  But I have experienced that before.  There was a DUI warrant on a license plate for a 1980 Cadillac I had years ago.  I had to replace the license plate.

Yeah, no, I saw him recording everything.  It was just extreme with my children, and I didn't know what was up.  They started treating me like all crazy.  And I'm like, yo, bro, like, this hurts.  Like, chill out.  But I just cooperated with him because I knew I was clean.  I mean, whatever happened, it would get, you know, sorted out.  But the guy's car.  I'm borrowing it from a friend.  All is well, though. ",

            "text": "You're welcome.  I would say it's pretty important and amazing to note that the tow truck was already here as well.  All these police vehicles, all this happened automatically just because the license plate reader at an intersection picked up this license plate.  So, you know no person put any thought into it.  Automatically upon this license plate driving by There's 20 guns pointed at the heads of children a tow truck ready to take the vehicle Regardless of whether or not the police murder you or they don't.  and if you notice that even if the police may have seemed apologetic Typically they do those FI cards with the handcuffs on too tight the entire time and they did still do an FI card.  so Although this guy was wrongly targeted for an automatic response, the manual response that police put thought into was, all right, well, we're going to do a FI card on you.  We're going to take some information that we have no right to in addition to the information that we already took that we had no right to in the first place.  So that's just something to think about.  The only reason they didn't take the car is because they couldn't take the car.  The guy didn't do anything wrong.  But they still overstepped their authority even after.  That's my two cents.  You ought to know that you could be treated and killed as a felon just for borrowing a car that someone else happened to own or someone else happened to use.  So things are not looking good for our future here in Southern California.  And I'm talking immediately.  Something that I think is critical for you to know and understand and remember is is at this point I'm still able to access the police radio so I can use their communications to prove to you when there's a difficult truth that the police are going to deny.  But any day now, I won't be able to use the police communications to prove they're lying, and that means people will have to take my word for it.  Independence Day stands for the police having independence of any oversight.  That's the future of law enforcement. ",
