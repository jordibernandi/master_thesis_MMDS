I also pray for the man that hurt you.  Well, the mass was obviously over after that, but parishioners continued it back up Sunday and said they had about double the people attending, including Bishop Cruz, who, with some stitches on his face, assured parishioners that he was doing okay and that this was an isolated incident.

Shout out to my Facebook friends who tagged me in this video of this Catholic bishop in a church in Newark, New Jersey, who got knocked the flip out because apparently, allegedly, he did not pay someone that, in clean words, that he solicited sexual favors from.  her pimp, or it could be a him, but the pimp, pimp named Slickback, rolled up in the church door mass and knocked the F out of him because he did not pay the money for his sexual flavors, for his sexual favors.  They said the pimp pulled up in a pink Cadillac, like This was not a pimp.  You know, he was a Mary Kay consultant and he showed off his pink Cadillac.  You know, we don't know that this individual, this young man was a pimp.  He was legit doing Mary Kay.  But the way he just showed up, it just knocked up.  Out of him.  I told y'all, I told y'all the church would tell you to believe that God is your protector.  No weapon formed against thee shall prosper.  But in the church, they got off duty police officers in there protecting their ass.  I told y'all, check that out in the video when I said that the church ain't shit.  I told y'all, they tell you pray for peace, but they peace be still, okay?  They ain't taking no chances.  They know that they preaching some fuckery to y'all that, oh, no weapon formed against me shall prosper.  That's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  Did you see how quick all them cops rolled up?  Them cops are already in there.  They were there for off-duty, and they paid those officers.  Those officers wasn't there for free, and they wasn't praying either.  They was there off-duty employment.  The other part that had me cracking up was while they was interviewing the one guy, did y'all see that big ass rat run across the back?  Oh, that church is trash.  That big ass rat run across.  They're like, oh, this little girl, she was baptized by this bishop and she wrote him a letter.  Now, motherfucker, this bishop out here paying for prostitutes and paying for sex and got a pimp rolling up in your fucking church and you're going to tell your child, oh, he's still so good.  Write him a letter and I'm going to pray for the man that hurt you.  I told y'all that Christianity, church, is the most dangerous place for children.  When are y'all going to realize that?  I put that up there in... um, um, I'm tired of this church, that video.  And then the other video that I put up, how Christianity makes children of the corn.  So you already know that these are some sexual deviants in the church.  You let them touch your children, baptize your children, getting a big ass bathtub with your children and call it baptism.  That's just the most stupidest shit I've ever heard of in my life.  And that just gets me pissed the fuck off.  And when you see this guy up front, you know, I've got, I yelled at him.  I said, stop.  I said, stop.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  That's just my thing.  Today is Sunday.  I call it Sunday gun day, Sunday fun day.  I believe that you should be anywhere else but church.  And if you still, it's 2019.  All these videos I made, all these other videos on YouTube, all this knowledge we got out here, and y'all still carry your asses to these churches on Sundays?  Y'all still gonna sit your asses in mass and shit like that?  For real?  For real.  I mean, I don't get it.  Make it make sense.  Yes.  Make sure you subscribe to my channel.  Check out this playlist.  The Ex-Christian Chronicles.  That's my story from leaving Christianity up until I got here.  I'm going to add this video to that playlist.  Y'all make sure to check that out.  And really, think about why you're doing this.  Why are you going to these churches?  You might as well go hang out at the city jail.  Because it appears that all the rest of the criminals end up in church.  They wind up there anyway.  Just go hang out at the fucking jail and... you know get it over with.  you know like subscribe and share and hit me up.  connect with me on my other social media platforms and i will see y'all on the next video Me?
