I would now like to read a portion of the July 25th phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky.  Trump says, We would like you to do us a favor, though.  There's lots of talk about Joe Biden's son.  Also, we have reason to believe there was meddling in the 2016 election by some terrible people, very bad people, a woman named Chrissy Teigen and a very hairy man, Alex Baldwin.  Terribly, terribly hairy.  Whatever you can do.  Hang on, I have to make another call real quick.  Yes, give me a 10-piece tenders with extra biscuits and two large sides.  Well, then he just orders chicken.  Did you find this call unusual?  Yes.  And is it true, Ambassador Taylor, that you were conflicted about the role of the president's personal lawyer? ",
