            "text": "No, I think they're just going to blame the same people.  they always blame because we're all in our own little bubbles.  Should they feel disenfranchised?  100%.  Because in a society that treats sex as transactional, in a society that basically reduces sex to just a physical transaction that is based solely on consent.  It makes it very difficult to explain why it is that the casting couch in Hollywood is bad, per se.  Feminist theory says that it's bad because of power imbalances.  But the sort of libertarian culture of the left suggests that power imbalance doesn't have anything to do with it.  If I feel like trading my body for a part in a movie, well, that's my business.  And if you say differently, then you're slut shaming me.  Right?  Well, you can't really have it both ways.  Either it's bad or it's not bad.  And if we are going to fight sexual harassment and sexual assault, it seems to me that we have to do a couple of things.  One, we have to reinvest sex with value beyond just a physical transaction.  It's not just two people who are getting each other's rocks.  It actually means something beyond that.  There's a relationship that's attached to it.  And beyond that, I think that we need to re-inculcate in men themselves, not just the teach men not to rape routine.  One of the things that's happened is that traditional masculinity, the idea that it is a man's job to protect women.  This is one of our jobs as human beings, as men, to protect women.  The feminist movement doesn't like that.  Well, then you can't blame us for not protecting women if you don't want us to protect women.  Like, I want to protect women.  I think men should protect women.  I think one of the reasons God put man on earth is to protect women.  Okay, well, then it is incumbent on me to protect women, but if you're telling me that I can't even open a door for a woman because this is somehow an offense to her honor, and that if I say that it's man's job to protect women, that this is somehow reinforcing gender stereotypes, then don't come whining to me when bad stuff happens.  First thing that I hate today is this insane piece by some crazy person named Jodi Allard.  She's apparently a feminist blogger.  First of all, all feminist bloggers are, I don't mean to generalize, but they're all crazy.  So she actually has a piece today called, the title of it is, I'm Done Pretending Men Are Safe, Even My Sons.  Really.  And the entire thing is about how her sons are potential rapists.  She says, I have two sons.  They're strong and compassionate.  The kind of boys other parents are glad to meet when their daughters bring them home for dinner.  They're good boys in the ways good boys are, but they are not safe boys.  I'm starting to believe there's no such thing.  She is talking about her own children being potential rapists because of rape culture.  I have a general recommendation.  If you believe that all men or all women are crazy, that everybody's terrible, maybe it's just you.  Maybe it's just you.  If every relationship you've ever had has gone bad, maybe it's not because all the people you know are terrible.  Maybe you suck as a human.  And I'm going to go with that on this one.  She says, my sons won't rape unconscious women behind a dumpster, and neither will most of the progressive men I know.  But what all of these men share in common, even my sons, is a relentless questioning and disbelief of the female experience.  I didn't realize the common female experience was to be raped while unconscious behind a dumpster.  I know a few females, and I don't know any of them who have been raped while unconscious behind a dumpster, at least none who have told me about it.  And if they did tell me about that, I would say, can we find the person and hunt them down?  Like, that would be my first reaction.  Can we tell the police?  And if not, is there a way that we can kill this person and get away with it?  Like, that seems like the best possible, like, is that not feminist enough?  Do I have to do more than that?  I do not want to prove my pain or provide enough evidence to convince anyone that my trauma is merited.  If you accuse someone of rape, you might have to provide evidence of actual rape.  You shouldn't just be able to accuse anyone of any crime.  Totally insane.  Totally insane.  Child Protective Services needs to show up, like, right now at this lady's door.  Thank God, it sounds like her sons are getting old enough that they get to leave home.  Leave now.  Leave now, okay?  I will try to find a way to put you up in your own apartment.  Seriously.  So what you actually wrote is you wrote that Gorsuch... Like Antonin Scalia is a proponent of originalism, which means he believes a judge should attempt to interpret the words of the Constitution as they were understood at the time they were written.  When the Constitution was written, women couldn't own property.  In 1787, women didn't have the right to vote.  It would be 133 years before women won that fight, a fight they fought for 72 years.  Considering women had no right to when the Constitution was written and there was no mention of women in the Constitution, originalism is sexist.  So let me ask you first to expand on that.  Is it the Constitution that's sexist or originalism that's sexist or both? ",

            "text": "Because they're trying to, because if you're looking, if I wrote a piece of legislation 10 years ago and I said to you, okay, you and I write a piece of legislation today, And we use the language of today.  We mean something by that language.  In this conversation, somebody will read this 100 years from now, and we will have meant what we're saying to each other.  We understand what we're saying.  If somebody wants to read what we're talking about today, and then it turns out that all the words that we're using now mean the reverse because things have changed, did our conversation mean the reverse of what it meant, or does it mean what we're talking about right now?  Words have meaning at the time they are said.  And to try and read new meanings into old words just because, quote unquote, times have changed, you can end up with some really bizarre results.  And the problem here is that you may not like what Neil Gorsuch is trying to do, but at least it's a rule of interpretation.  In the constitutional structure, what we've had is the Supreme Court very often reversing itself on the exact same language by using the sort of rules that you want.  So, for example, in Plessy v. Ferguson, you had the Supreme Court say that the 14th Amendment did not apply to black people insofar as segregation was okay.  And then 50 years after that, they say, no, it turns out the 14th Amendment actually meant that segregation is not okay anymore.  That's silly.  I mean, it either meant one or it meant the other.  It didn't mean two different things at the same time.  One of those decisions is wrong and one of those decisions is right.  That's true for every judicial decision.  The idea that we can just look to our hearts to determine what a text meant 200 years ago is silly when we can find out what they meant 200 years ago by reading what they're talking about now.  How about the idea that if you're a woman, that you're at some sort of inherent disadvantage here in the United States?  No, you're not.  You're living in the freest, best place on Earth in history for women at any time.  How about the wage gap, this idea that women are somehow victims in the United States of this horrible discrimination, this glass ceiling that hovers over them at all times, that only Hillary Clinton's face can break, right?  The fact is that in 147 out of 150 of the biggest cities in the United States, women make 8% more than men if they are single and unmarried and have the same degrees.  They earn more than men.  Last question about your Planned Parenthood thing.  So why do you think it's not about conflating women's bodies and just about the separate life?  Like, after the baby is born, How come when people don't care about them, they don't care where to end up in foster care, they don't care about the mother being poor?  Okay, I do care about the mother being poor.  I do care about foster care.  Okay, but why don't you advocate for that, though?  Because Planned Parenthood is supposed to prevent abortions.  Well, Planned Parenthood doesn't prevent abortions.  They perform hundreds of thousands of abortions a year.  They perform 300,000 abortions a year.  They're the leading abortion bill in the United States.  Where's your evidence for that, though?  That they perform 300,000 abortions a year?  From Planned Parenthood.  That's my evidence.  They don't dispute that.  No one disputes that.  I'm not anti-birth control.  Birth control is extraordinarily cheap.  Okay, they're not the only people in America who provide affordable birth control.  You can go get a pack of condoms down at the local CVS for $12.  Yes, and it's true that most forms of birth control are also extraordinarily cheap on an annualized basis.  Unless you have a severe problem, most birth control is very cheap and readily available.  And I'm not against people going and getting that from Planned Parenthood.  As you may have noticed, I'm mostly against abortion.  If you want to go to Planned Parenthood and get a contraceptive, go for it.  I don't care.  I do care when you start killing babies.  This is a problem for me.  Women really gave up on marriage a lot too soon.  Okay, marriage was the best thing ever for women.  It is an amazing, it's an amazing thing for men too because it civilizes them, it cultures them, it teaches them to be protectors of their family and to take care of people and to think beyond themselves and to think beyond their generation.  Women gave up in marriage a way to teach men to do those things.  And also, women gave up the idea that a commitment was going to come along with this intimacy.  And let's be real about this.  I mean, every scientific study ever done has shown that women actually do have better sex in the context of committed relationships.  All of the crap that you see in Cosmo magazine about sleeping with 100 guys and being sexually happy is just garbage.  It is just sheer, unadulterated garbage.  So, a long answer to a short question, but re-inculcation of traditional roles of male and female with the same feminist respect that we ought to have for women at all steps of the process is the answer.
