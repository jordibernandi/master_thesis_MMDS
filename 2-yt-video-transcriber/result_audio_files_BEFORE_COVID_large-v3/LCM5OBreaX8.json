            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with the weekly perspective for the week ending 12 July 2019.  Well, this is from Japan Today headline.  Global economy heading for trouble as manufacturing and construction shrink.  Global manufacturing and construction sectors have already entered a downturn.  The service sector is all that now stands between the economy and a full-blown recession.  Global manufacturers reported new export orders fell for the 10th month running in June, with the most widespread decline for six years, according to JPMorgan Global Purchasing Manager Survey.  So more of the same, I've been saying this almost every week.  If you search carefully, you can find this kind of basically mainstream news.  That is rather contradictory to what you hear on the mainstream financial press about greatest recovery, things are wonderful, and blah, blah, blah, blah.  The truth of the matter is that we are seeing the contraction and it will continue.  Next up is from CNBC, pretty mainstream.  India may need major rainfalls to reverse its economic slowdown.  India's agricultural sector accounts for around 14% of the country's $2.7 trillion economy and 42% of total employment.  With around 55% of India's arable land dependent on precipitation, the amount of rainfall during the current monsoon season could sway economic activity in the agriculture sector and industries linked to it.  The slow start to the monsoon harvest season has prompted the government to raise minimum support prices for all the current season's crops to help support farmers' incomes, according to their media.  I bring this up and I want to elaborate on this.  It's not just India.  It is, China is having problems with the army beetle.  They have got massive problems on their food supply and the Midwest with these floods that took place through the Missouri, Mississippi Valley, and some of the biggest corn growing belts in the US.  So yields are going to be significantly less this season than they have been many years in the past, which means food prices are going to go higher.  which means that even though fuel, energy, and food are not part of the official CPI, Consumer Price Index, the inflation number, for the US government, believe it or not, that's a fact, look it up, people can't help but notice.  They notice two things, basically.  They notice food prices and gasoline prices.  So as these food prices work their way through the system, you are going to see Perception of the general public that inflation is back.  And this will start a momentum into, I think, the precious metals.  People that have some money, which is like maybe half the population at best, will start moving back in the metals.  And you'll hear a lot about it probably in the local news or whatever, but it is coming to the fore.  It is going to take place.  It's something to prepare for.  It's something that you need to be aware of.  You're not going to hear a lot about it from the mainstream economists as far as I can tell.  But it is actually a very big thing.  The problem is it may not be a one-off.  In other words, it may not be just this season.  It could move into subsequent years.  And if that's the case, then you'll see further upward prices on foodstuffs.  This is from Mish Talk.  I thought it was interesting.  It's very quick to go into. ",

            "text": "Negative yield.  junk bonds take hold in Europe.  What Mish points out here is that there are 14 junk bonds in Europe.  They're junk bonds with a negative yield.  I don't read them all to you, but you can see them here in this list.  I'm just not sure Americans would know too many of these companies, but actually most of these are actually fairly significant companies.  And there you are, a negative yield, something that, you know, someone like me thought could never happen, and here they are.  So be ready.  Things are going to get more interesting, and I think rather rapidly, not necessarily next week.  But I think by the end of this year, there'll be a shift, as I've said in past updates.  where you'll see the precious metals finally starting to get attention and provide positive returns.  The underlying equity is doing even better than that, meaning the mining shares, the resource sector, and the stock market probably showing signs of a top.  One of the biggest news items this week had to do with this Facebook and this Libra situation where they're going to have their own currency and paid attention and watched a few videos, listened to, read a few things, but this is direct from CNBC.  and the tech industry is starting to doubt Facebook will be able to launch its Libra currency by 2020.  A month after Facebook laid out its plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra, some in the tech industry are starting to doubt it's launched by 2020 or ever.  Regulators in the US and around the world are taking a close look at it.  Meantime, Libra Trump exec David Marcus is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee next week and ask if, is asking regulators for feedback.  I won't read you any more.  This is going to be interesting.  A lot of these companies in the corporate sector are charming at the bit to become banks, basically.  And I'll be talking about this at this little gathering here in Spokane we're having tomorrow, Sunday.  In town with Bix Weir and company.  I digress.  I'll come back.  A lot of talk about this Iranian situation, the Straits of Hormuz, who's capturing whose ship, why, when, where, etc.  They're doing it.  No, I'm denying it.  And on and on it goes.  I think I'll leave that to the side this week and just go a little higher up and get a higher perspective.  This is from Defense One.  Pentagon looks at virtual reality to prepare troops for nuclear war.  It's not something I enjoy reading, believe me.  Uh, the defense threat reduction agency wants information about VR training systems that could simulate radiological threats.  The defense department is considering investing in virtual reality platforms to prepare troops that face nuclear threats.  The defense threat reduction agency on Tuesday began seeking information on virtual reality training systems that would allow troops to rehearse different scenarios involving radiological threats.  Again, uh, Just bring it to your attention.  Obviously, at the end of the age of empire, you're going to see more and more push toward wars.  And I won't say they're inevitable, but certainly when I read something like this, it does give me pause.  And so I will pass it along for you to contemplate.  All right, I move on to energy now, and then I'm going to finish off the gold market.  These are always lengthy but very worthwhile as far as I'm concerned.  You can probably read it in 10 minutes, not like a book.  But our finite world, why stimulus can't fix our energy problems.  There's no substitute for energy.  Supplemental energy leverages human energy.  And basically, my analysis indicates that workarounds in the aggregate don't keep energy prices high enough for energy producers.  Oil prices are at risk, but so are coal and natural gas prices.  We end up with a different energy problem than most have expected.  Energy prices remain too low for producers.  Such problems can have severe consequences.  Look at a few issues involved.  One, despite all the progress being made at reducing birth rates around the world, the world's population continues to grow year over year.  Two, this kind of world population leads to growing use of natural resources of every kind.  Remember one of my favorite sayings, if it can't be grown, it has to be mined.  We're having food problems imminent, meaning this year's harvest.  potentially after that as well.  And then, of course, nothing happens without energy.  So there are three reasons we might expect growing use of material resources, growing population, world economy needs to work around the problems of an increasing resource-constrained world, deeper wells and more distillation are required to handle water needs of a rising population, Energy products themselves are subject to limits.  The third point, the years which the quantities of material resources cease to grow correspond precisely to recessionary years.  Fourth, world energy consumption follows a very similar pattern to world resource extraction.  And you can see this, I've used this in fact in the energy stock profits letter that I write in addition to the Morgan Report.  Oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, and of course our wind and solar and all the other stuff is a very small portion of the overall energy production that's in our planet so far.  Note the flat periods, almost identical flat periods in extraction of material resources.  Fifth, the world economy seems to need an annual growth in world energy consumption of at least 2% per year to stay away from recessions.  And it gives you this graph, kind of point that out.  Sixth, in the years subsequent to 2011, growth in world energy consumption has fallen behind the 2% per year growth rate as required to avoid recessions.  So this recession thing is, I think it's basically started, others as well.  Officially it hasn't, and the official... The announcement that we're in a recession usually is about after six months of being in it.  But regardless, get ready.  Seventh point and final, the growth rates of oil, coal, and nuclear have all slowed to below 2% per year since 2011, while the consumption of natural gas, hydroelectric, and other renewables is growing faster than 2% per year.  Their surplus growth is less than the deficit of oil, coal, and nuclear.  So you can see this here.  This is one of the basis for the reasons I started the energy stock profits.  You can go to the coming energy boom.  It's coming energy boom and sign up for my free webinar.  I'll go into more detail about this and how you can profit from it.  That's a quick look at the landing page for the coming energy boom.  And I won't even read it to you, but without energy, nothing happens.  So we've been folks on, we've been writing this report now for about a half a year.  And we've had some pretty good success.  In fact, one of our speculations is up 28% already, which is kind of nice.  But it isn't for everybody.  But if you are in the metals, a question I get often is, well, in the metals, Precious metals, the resource sector, your guidelines in the Morgan Report.  Where else should I invest in the answers.  energy?  Defense is one as well.  I'm not partial to defense, but if you have a Lockheed Martin, own it and hold on to it.  Any defense stock, because we're at the end of the age of empire.  You're going to see war.  You're going to see necessities, especially the money problem come to the fore as things continue down this path that we're on.  All right, well, let's finish up with the gold market.  This is from my friend Marco Byrne over at GoldCore Daily Market Update.  This particular one is Poland's central bank increases gold reserves by over 125 tons.  Gold reserves at the National Bank of Poland have risen by 125.7 tons to 228.6 tons, the bank announced Friday.  And I won't read you the rest of the article.  I am going to read you something from, I think, one of the best technicians on the planet.  And that's John Murphy over at StockCharts.com.  Gold is the world's strongest currency.  Gold has hit a six-year high quoted in US dollars and is hitting multi-year highs when quoted in major foreign currencies as well.  Gold is doing better than the world's major currencies.  Gold is more than a commodity.  Gold is sometimes viewed as an alternative currency.  When global traders lose confidence in their currency, they turn to gold.  to preserve their wealth, and when the Fed starts to lower rates, it weakens currency.  Gold recently rose to a six-year high on falling U.S.  interest rates, which have weakened the dollar, so gold is rising in dollar terms.  The true hallmark of a bull market in gold, however, is its ability to rise relative to other major currency, and it is doing just that.  And he goes through a bunch of his other charts, which I'm not going to show you.  It's his work.  I'm a subscriber of his.  But chart one compares the performance of gold to the world's major currencies.  It's looking great.  And the other one's showing gold in the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, the U.S.  dollar, the Swiss franc, the Aussie dollar, the British pound, and the euro.  Guess what?  Gold looks great.  So we are in a situation that not that many are even believing that Even gold bugs are a little bit remiss to jump back in, but time is here, time is now.  I think we'll see 1450 gold as a minimum by the end of the year, more likely something like 1500.  Yes, silver's lagging.  I've done a lot of interviews in the public domain about that and why, and when.  I think silver will start to push forward and lower the gold-silver ratio.

And if you're so inclined and you're interested in getting the best leverage on a risk to reward basis, you could consider a subscription to the members only part of the Morgan Report, which is a monthly publication and videos where I go through timing updates on companies.  In fact, I just did one today earlier on The uranium sector getting plummeted today.  It's probably on a rumor that this 232 rule is not going to be enacted.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's fine.  You're probably not in this sector.  So leave it at that.  Remember, there is nothing more powerful than the truth.  Gold tells the truth about other currencies.  And the truth is, all fiat fails.  So, gold is on the march again.  Pay attention. ",
