            "text": "Bang!  Bolt Action News Group here, Wright's Crispy with News Now South Florida and Government Accountability.  How are you, brother?  What's going on?  Freedom is not free.  Freedom is not free.  What do you got going on here today?  We had two petitions.  One on increasing minimum wage to $10 an hour.  Okay.  And the other one to lower your light bill.  Right on.  So, what are you guys doing?  Bolt Action News Group.  We're Donzo.  journalists slash civil rights auditors.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Hold the government accountable.  Absolutely.  That's his name, Government Accountability.  Right on.  Right on.  I like that.  Say that again.  Right on.  Right on.  There we go.  That's my cash rate.  Right on.  Right on.  Exit only.  Lobby here.  This is Melvin Morgan.  Doesn't look like much of a weight.  \u00bfNos est\u00e1n atendiendo en espa\u00f1ol?  \u00a1Qu\u00e9 bueno!  Gracias.  You guys from TV?  Yes, sir.  Hi.  Hi.  Is there something I can help you guys with?  Be honest with your boss.  No, man, thanks.  Just let us record our video, that's all.  You know, you're on like five other cameras, though.  What's your name, though?  Shelly Walker.  Yes, sir.  And you're okay with filming.  I'm not telling you you can't film, but you can't film any of the customers without their consent.  That's not true, ma'am.  That's not true.  No, no.  We're in public.  No, this is a public building, and they have no expectation of privacy in public.  That's incorrect.  But we're learning for fun and for free today, right?  Let me spin it to you differently.  If that were true, how come you can film them without their consent?  Yeah.  You see where those cameras are?  I don't have an X. I didn't want to miss you.  Would you be able to help me?  No, no, I'm just simply offering a rebuttal to your point.  You said that we keep filming without consent, but you're doing it.  Would you give Noelle a call?  Oh, Noelle.  We're getting Noelle.  Is it the first Noelle?  That was funny.  This is nice.  Yeah, read and return, like a tiny library.  Hi.  Oh, are you talking to me?  Well, are you a college-educated individual?  I'm going to give you one guess what I'm doing.  Just one guess.  I am recording, and I do have permission.  Yes, sir.  The Founding Fathers.  It's the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  That's the highest you can go.  Thank you.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  What's your name, sir?  No, no.  Come on.  Let's make this hard.  What's your name?  What's your license?  No.  No.  I am not a public employee serving the public and asking somebody in the public what they're doing.  That's why I'm asking you.  Who are you asking me what I'm doing and giving me directives?  Please identify yourself.  Sir?  Are you not going to?  Could you get Tracy Pipkins, please?  Oh, Tracy and Noel.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Are you Noel?  You haven't identified yourself, so we don't know who.  you are telling us what to do.  Okay, silent treatment.  I've done that one before.  You know his name?  Okay, no problem.  We'll find out your name.  Why don't you want to identify yourself if you work for the public?  Do you have something to hide, sir?  What?  I'm really not trying to antagonize you, sir.  I'm trying to have a respectful dialogue.  Not monologue, dialogue.  I understand.  And you don't want to identify yourself.  I'll take that as a no.  I am.  Hello.  Hi.  Is this publicly accessible?  I'm sorry?  Is this publicly accessible?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hi.  Video camera?  Want to know if this is publicly accessible?  This year, the members of the public come here to do local business tax.  Okay.  So, yes.  I just answered my own question.  Okay.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  That's Robin.  Thank you, Robin.  Any sign of Noel or Tricia?  A Snapchat.  Yes, exactly.  That's what I was filming when he told me to stop recording.  We're good, right?  Right, and again... Right, this is the public area, and all their information is to be protected by you, not me.  And that's kind of the purpose of why I'm here, making sure that their information is being protected by you.  Yeah, by telling you not to... No, no, you have to have, like, screen protectors, you have to put up a blinder or a reflective mirror, but you can't just give me directives.  As a member of the public, it's the other way around.  Okay, thank you.  No, nobody's coming.  They just said we're okay.  With some incorrect stipulations as far as... Really?  They were cool with me.  No, Robin said it was okay.  Robin said it was okay, right?  Oh, I thought Robin said it was okay.  You're Robin.  Okay.  Oh, no.  They just checked with Trish and Noel.  We're good.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You can double check.  Triple check.  Right, right.  This is an audit.  Civil rights audit.  First Amendment of the Constitution protects our freedom of the press, making sure that the government is working.  how we pay it to work and do the right things.  Make sure you guys are doing an excellent job.  There's no wait out there.  You should see other places that we've gone to.  It's like the line is super long, and this looks like it's working efficiently.  Understandable apprehension to cameras, but the difference between this one and that one is that if somebody gets out of line, this one is not going to get lost or destroyed.  Okay.  Okay?  Thank you, Mr.  They good?  Yeah, they're good.  Did we ever find Noel?  No, but I did talk to him.  They were talking to Noel and Trish, and everything's okay.  That's good.  One there, one there, one there.  You get me from all three angles.  Well, we can't be over there.  You already sent them.  Mystery man.  Come on.  When nobody tells us their name, we come up with a nickname for them, and it's usually not kind.  That's okay.  Come on.  I can't think of anything unkind to say about you, though.  You seem like a nice guy.  Why don't you just tell me your name?  You don't even have to.  Just flip that little ID around.  Do you know if it's in your policy to identify?  Last chance.  You don't want to identify?  It's a policy, sir.  So take it as a no once again.  Yep.  Over here?  John.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  No, no, that's exactly why we have the objective documentation.  Hey, Deputy.  Anybody flipping out yet?  Good, good.  Thanks.  What's your name?  Deputy Winsolowitz.  Winsolowitz?  How'd I do?  Did I pronounce that correctly?  Winsolowitz, yeah.  Winsolowitz.  Got it.  And do you have an ID number?  05072.  Thank you for being professional.  Oh, last question.  How long have you been a deputy?  Two years.  How do you like it?  Good.  Are you drinking out of the water?  Hi.  Hello.  What kind of services do you provide here?  Tax services.  Tax?  Property taxes.  Okay, so you pay your taxes here?  Yep.  What are you guys doing?  We are recording our government officials in the course of their government duties on the government dime.  Okay, nice.  And what's your name?  Oli.  Oli.  Is that short for something?  Odalis.  Odalis.  I do not.  I do not.  No, I will bring one next time.  And the cards that we have are pretty much just have case law on them.  It's really to give to them, hey, you're on notice to not trample on my rice type of thing.  It's really not very much information.  We like to remain anonymous.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Wonderful.  So you're the attorney.  Okay.  Where did you go to school?  St.  Thomas.  Right on.  Excellent school.  I know.  I grew up in Miami.  I got a 178 on the LSAT.  I got accepted everywhere.  Why didn't you go?  I didn't want to consort with criminals for the rest of my life.  You don't have to consort with criminals.  No, I mean my colleagues, not my clients. ",
