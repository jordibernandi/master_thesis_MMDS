            "text": "Okay, to this, I don't really know exactly what to say, but let's think it through.  Okay, the claim that every single supposed miracle gets debunked eventually is being used as an argument to say, therefore, you shouldn't believe in God.  But let's think it through.  My first thought as I hear this argument is just... Like really?  This is not a statement of known fact.  This is a prediction based upon a prior belief.  What am I saying?  I'm saying this is circular reasoning.  The idea that every supposed miracle will eventually be debunked is a statement of faith, of belief, based upon assumptions.  It's, that's exactly what circular reasoning is.  You see, how can I assume every miracle is false?  Well, if I assume there is no God and no supernatural to cause the miracles, then I can assume they're false, so then I can assume that they'll be debunked eventually anyways.  This is just circular reasoning.  It's kind of strange because I know that in the production of this video, Hemant Mehta would have sat down and had a list of arguments and thought them through and tried to pick the best ones he had, 20 that he thought were of quality and of value.  I know if I'm presenting, you know, arguments for God's existence, I vet them.  I bring the best I've got and I certainly try to avoid things like circular reasoning.  It's one of the worst things you can do.  in an argument is actually have circular reasoning.  Let me analyze this further because maybe he just thinks this is common knowledge and maybe you do too.  Maybe you're watching this video and Mike, everyone knows miracles don't really happen.  Everybody knows this.  I would say that that's not common knowledge.  So let me give you some statistics that will help support what I'm saying here.  In 1992, there was a Gallup poll that found that 82% of people in the US believe in miracles today.  Only 6% of people at the time said that they held Hemant's position that categorically rejects that miracles can happen, right?  That miracles do happen today.  No adjustment to this data, no little margin of error is going to bring that 6% close to a majority or certainly a consensus.  This is definitely circular reasoning to say that everyone simply knows that miracles don't happen.  In fact, it's quite the opposite.  In a 2003 Newsweek poll, 72% of people in the U.S.  said that they believe that God may cure a mortally ill person for whom science has surrendered hope.  According to the landscape survey on pewforum.org performed in 2007, it says among those who rarely or never attend church, the majority believe that miracles probably do occur.  So these are not like these just church-going Christians.  We're talking about rarely or never go to church.  Even among that group, the majority think that miracles do occur.  34% of U.S.  residents claim to have witnessed or experienced divine healing.  34% saying that their eyewitnesses or personal experience says, I've experienced a miracle.  So you would have to just assume that they're all cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, that they're all just dummies, basically, in order to affirm what Hemant Mehta assumes in his circular argument against the existence of God here.  Every single supposed miracle gets debunked eventually.  Well, he's almost alone in that personal opinion right there.  For further research, I recommend you guys take a look at Craig Keener's two-volume series, Miracles.  This book series has lots of examples, as well as working through philosophical objections to miracles, that sort of thing.  And I think it's a really interesting book that I'm kind of working my way through at the moment myself.  But let me give you one example of a miracle which has not been debunked.  And it's kind of central to the Christian faith.  You see, it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Now, some skeptics are going to roll their eyes at me when I say this, but the thing is, the evidence is really good for the resurrection of Jesus.  There is a well-constructed argument from history that gives evidence for the resurrection of Christ that can't be explained away by any other theory in a rational way.  In fact, this is one of the strong pieces of apologetics that we bring to the table today.  I love the evidence for the resurrection.  I think it's powerful evidence for a miracle that has not been debunked.  So I would say that in this complaint, Hemet has made an assumption, done circular reasoning, he's ignored the evidence and I think he stumbled upon one of the best reasons to be a Christian and that is we have good evidence to say that Jesus did in fact rise from the dead.  It's compelling, it's impressive, it's thoughtful, and it's well researched, and it's scholarly, and I encourage you to check it out.  In fact, the only reason to not think that Jesus' resurrection is.  the best explanation of the evidence would be to assume that miracles don't happen.  But then again, we have that problem with that circular reasoning.  Unless you assume miracles don't happen, you should be affirming that Jesus rose.  Now, I've actually made this case and so have others in other videos.  I recommend you do some research on your own and seriously consider the evidence for the resurrection of Christ.  It's powerful.  My final observation here is that this argument against God's existence is a position driven by faith.  It's just faith in the idea that God doesn't exist or that God just will never do anything.  And that's why we're assuming that eventually we'll figure this out.  We'll prove this wrong.  It's like a naturalism of the gaps kind of argument.  It's not really an argument against God.  It's a result of not believing in God, thinking that that belief is a good reason for that belief, which is not a good way to come to a belief or affirm one.  The next video in this series is a challenge related to the Ten Commandments.  So please click the whole playlist.  All these videos are not on my channel.  I recommend you watch it on the playlist because Cam and John from two other Christian YouTubers are working with me to create this content and these responses.  I hope you like this series.
