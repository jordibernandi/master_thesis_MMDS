Right behind me is where Bernie Sanders, absolute socialist and commie, is going to be speaking very, very soon.  We are going to ask his supporters, who clearly want to have full communism in this country, where socialism has worked in America, or anywhere in the world.  Let's go find out. ",

FDR's presidency.  All right, here we go.  For what it's worth, FDR had to be term limited.  And we had to literally pass a constitutional amendment.  Hey, ma'am, where's socialism worked?  Uh, FDR.  FDR.  She says FDR, too.  Okay, fantastic.  All you millennials out there, you can thank the Social Security.  you'll never see on FDR.  What is y'all doing with my money?  Nowhere.  All right.  From the woke millennial.  Look at these kids.  Socialism has worked in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands, according to this gentleman right here.  We want America to be more like the Netherlands, more like these countries.  They have higher happiness in the US.  So higher happiness, socialism, higher happiness.  Yes? ",
