The believer does have it easier psychologically, in exactly the same way the anesthetized have it easier when they go under the knife and have surgery.  Just slip a little God into your IV and the brutal, painful reality of our world, that horrible, natural world God created just for us, will simply slip away under the powerful influence of imagined afterlives and a good God who... Well, he couldn't get things right here, but we'll surely have things figured out by the time you reach the afterparty.  Unless you, for some reason, geography, a skeptical mind, misguided indoctrination into the wrong religion,  etc.,  have chosen to believe in the wrong god, or no god at all.  In which case, that afterparty will be the worst hangover you've ever had.  I have a dear friend who has chosen not to come out to her family because they would be tortured for the rest of their natural lives by the thought of her being tortured forever in the next.  Are you feeling that psychological comfort of belief like I am?  It's tingly and it's very warm.  It's almost like a burning in my bosom.  Pete Kreef continues. ",

For Hitchin's sake, these are the guys believing this bullshit, and they can't even sell it with any confidence.  If you accept, it is possible.  Somehow.  And if my mother had wheels, she'd be a trolley car.  Is there a thinner reed to lean on than faith in some supposed God who possibly, somehow, sets things right?  And isn't the fact that God needs to set things right in some supposed future life the ultimate admission of God's incompetence and the believer's psychological desperation?  Personally, I prefer gods who get things right the first time.  But that's just me.  Let's focus on that somehow, though, for just a moment, because it really does reveal the psychological neediness of the believer.  The fact is, there are no actual details of how God sets things right. ",

Oh, there's also the fact that evil men who torture and murder innocent victims can be redeemed on their deathbeds with a simple profession of faith.

Sure, believers can fill in the blanks to their liking and wish it were so, But non-believers interested primarily in soothing themselves with wishful thinking can do the same.  It's as cheap a remedy as there is.  Pete's ifs and possibles and somehows are clear evidence of nothing but a belief in wish fulfillment.  The bad still win and the good still suffer.  Earthquakes and cancers kill believers, Pete.  Your insistence that there's more to the story is supported by nothing.  and I don't see believers thrilled at the funerals of their loved ones, so happy that Biff or Pop has passed on to the eternal bliss of rainbows, unicorns, and lollipops.  You may take comfort in your beliefs in the moment, my believing friends, but deep down you know there's nothing to them.  It's why you hate people like me who point it out.  It's the world's most delicate bridge made of sewing thread and cotton candy, and here I am jumping up and down on it.  Is that peace or comfort to you, Pete, living in fear of reality?  And are you really unaware that such a cognitive shutdown has other consequences, in some cases terrible consequences for the rest of us, indeed for the planet itself?  Isn't it time you wake up and smell the reality?  Oh, yeah, that's awful.  That's awful.  I understand, Pete.  If belief in God reduced suffering even slightly, I'd be all for it.  But we have the data.  The tribal war god of Abraham completely ruled the Western world for a thousand years, leading to untold ignorance, intolerance, regrets, and, yes, suffering on a massive scale.  that people unthinkingly take comfort in such beliefs cannot take priority over the benefits of facing reality head-on, confronting our existential angst, summoning our courage, and believing in what is empirically undeniable, our ability to reduce the suffering of sentient beings on a global scale, on our own, here and now, no next life required.  We don't even have to believe in that.  We have been witnessing it for the last 400 years.  But we didn't do it by wishing it so.  We did the grueling, labor-intensive, tenacious work needed to discover the actual causes of our suffering and then put our brains to work conquering those causes, natural causes, reality-based causes over which we can have some say.  It was never God punishing us or the torment of demons.  It was the natural world, which, if ignored or wished away, cannot be surmounted.  Closing your eyes will not keep the train from hitting you.  And the last thing we need in this world is people seeking their own comfort while others are suffering.  You can close your eyes tight and make all the wishes you want, or you can roll up your sleeves and start clearing the rubble.  But only one of those will do any good for anyone.  Thanks for watching.  Nothing's as important as enlightening, humorous content.  And with once-weekly Patreon-supported Wellbrightron XL, you'll get that and so much more.

This risk can increase if you've recently left your religion or consumed large amounts of marijuana.  Don't use if you've recently stopped thinking clearly or are offended by religious or political satire.  Be careful when mixing Wellbrightron with libertarianism, magical thinking.  or regular doses of PragerU, which can increase blood pressure, sometimes severely.  To reduce the risk of serious side effects, tell your cognitive advisor of any deficiencies in cognitive function or sense of humor.  If religious, contact a secular advisor if you begin to have thoughts of apostasy, dancing, or sexual liberation.  Don't stop taking Wilbrightrin abruptly, as that may lead to extreme mood swings and frequent urination. ",
