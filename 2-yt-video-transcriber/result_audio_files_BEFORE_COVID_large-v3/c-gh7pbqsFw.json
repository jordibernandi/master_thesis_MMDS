            "text": "American companies that make stuff have to compete with foreign companies that make the same stuff, such as sugar, cars, lumber, or steel.  Those foreign producers often have lower costs, and so in an effort to protect U.S.  producers, our government often institutes protectionist policies, such as quotas or tariffs.  But as always, when government picks winners, it also creates losers.  And plenty of those victims are right here in America.  The most obvious victim of protectionism is the U.S.  consumer who pays higher prices for the things she buys.  The federal sugar program, for instance, places quotas on how much sugar Americans can import without facing a high tariff.  The quota reduces the supply of sugar, thus increasing the price of sugar.  That's why sugar prices in the U.S.  are constantly higher than the prices in the rest of the world.  Sometimes they are two or three times the world price.  If Americans import too much sugar, our government slaps a tariff on the excess.  This cost largely gets passed on to the consumer.  Politicians will say that jobs in the sugar industry are worth you paying a bit more for a bag of sugar. ",

That makes it hard for Enstrom Candies to make a profit.  This is why, in 2003, our sugar quotas helped drive a Lifesavers plant out of Holland, Michigan into Canada, where sugar would be cheaper.  A candy maker can try to raise its prices, which would, in turn, affect American grocers, ice cream parlors, and their customers.  But because so many candy bars are made overseas, a price hike might not be possible.  It affects mom and pop companies like us that can't afford to go abroad to create the candy.  That's why, in order to stay in business, Lifesavers had to move to Canada, which wasn't good for the people of Holland, Michigan. ",

Paying more for her car, her sugar, her can of soup, she has less leftover for other expenses, which creates another hidden victim of protectionism.  The businesses where she can't spend money.  Finally, protectionism makes a victim of the whole U.S.  economy.  When quotas or tariffs make foreign goods unaffordable, Americans need to start producing those goods ourselves.  That takes up resources such as money, land, and labor that would be better allocated to other purposes.  In the case of sugar, protectionism turns swaths of the unique and irreplaceable Everglades into agricultural land, requiring massive fertilizer use and, in turn, causing damaging runoff.  So of course government can help some domestic producers through protectionism, but it hurts everyone else, including consumers, the producers who use those imports, unrelated businesses that suffer when consumers have less money, and the U.S.  economy as a whole.  Every time government picks a winner, it also creates losers.  These are the victims of cronyism. ",
