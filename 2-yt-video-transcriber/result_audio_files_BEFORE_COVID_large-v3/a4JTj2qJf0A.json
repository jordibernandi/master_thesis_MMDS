The reason why I asked you about scholarship, and I asked you this because I respect you, Andrew, and I'm sure that like me and Dan, you care about what's true.  And you're not going to want to waste your life on something if it's not true or if there's any kind of doubt about it.  Go on Wikipedia and Look up the title or the subject heading Dating the Bible.  And there's a table there, Table 1, Chronological Overview.  And it tells you the order in which scholars think the books of the Old Testament were written.  The oldest period in which the first books started to be written, according to Bible scholars who dedicate their careers to understanding this properly, is the monarchic period 745 BCE to 586 BCE.  So even more recent than I was suggesting off the top of my head earlier.  It turns out that when you actually study what the Old Testament says, it's clearly written in a far more recent period than it suggests.  Just one example, it describes Abraham riding around on camels at a period in history before, sorry, long before camels were domesticated.  But if the Bible was written in the first century, or sorry, in the first millennia BC, it would make far more sense for there to be characters riding around on camels.  Do you see what I'm saying?  So scholars are able to look at all of these different details and say, well, clearly, When we factor in all of these different things, clearly we can pinpoint a much later period for these books to have been written than the books themselves are suggesting.  And just because the book is saying something doesn't mean we should just accept it on face value.  Otherwise, we would all be Mormons and we would all believe what Joseph Smith was writing because why would he lie to us?  Yep. ",

You mentioned right at the outset that you've at least dabbled a little bit with Bart Ehrman by the sounds of things.  That's one scholar.  There are others.  And if you jump on Amazon and you look for a few different books, let me see, there's one book that I can recommend off my bookshelf.  This is a fantastic book that you might want to check out, The Bible Unearthed.  by Israel Finkelstein.  Israel Finkelstein is a leading archaeologist and he writes about the Bible lands and how how critics are able to reach conclusions about the Old Testament based on things that are described.  For example, the fact that if the Israelites had left Egypt to go and conquer the Promised Land, they would only have been conquering another part of Egypt because Palestine was part of Egypt in the time period that's described.  Things like that that you probably didn't know before.  you will learn by reading this and other books.  All I'm suggesting is learn more about what scholars have to say because they've dedicated their careers to understanding the Bible better.  They don't have a reason to lie to you.
