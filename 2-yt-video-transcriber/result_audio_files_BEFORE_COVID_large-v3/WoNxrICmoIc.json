Now, some people think that they're planning a crash and that they've had all this in their mind from the beginning.  And they always have options.  But I don't think they thought things would get out of control the way they have been because of the resistance of the populations to their attempts to increase their powers.  We've seen it with the Brexit vote, with the Trump election, with Italy, Hungary, Brazil, India.  Everywhere you look around the world, there's a resurgence of nationalism.  And so what do they do?  They've come together at the same time the G7 was going on, which was a complete catastrophe.  The only one who was standing on his own two feet at the G7 meeting was Trump.  But while this was going on, In Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the annual Kansas City Federal Reserve retreat, you had a strategy put forward for their new global empire.  In fact, the term they used was it's time for a regime change in international finance.  The head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who called for adopting what he called a synthetic hegemonic currency.  Just the language itself shows you how crazy it is. ",

They cut out the central banks, they cut out the banks, and they're ideally directly peer-to-peer between you and I. And so the challenge for payment systems is to move in that direction so we can instantaneously move money from my account to your account to the publican's account, the guy who runs the pub, directly.  And what we're doing at the Bank of England is we're reorganizing the core of the system in a way that allows uh... new payment providers to just plug in.  a lot of people don't really understand what a global reserve currency is or why it's important.  one aspect of it is that it makes sense to choose a standard currency for the settlement of international trade and the?  u s dollar has served in that role since the end of world war two.  But the arguably more important definition of the phrase reserve currency is that it's the currency in which central banks hold their foreign exchange reserves, is that the nation issuing the global reserve currency enjoys an immense artificial demand for its currency, because everyone else in the world needs both the reserve currency itself in order to settle international trade, and they also need sovereign bonds denominated in that currency to serve as central bank reserve assets.  Why are we having so many problems related to the U.S.  being strong but the rest of the world being weak?  And he says that's because so much of the world is priced in dollars.  So the theory of flexible exchange rates resolving these imbalances is not working.  way back in the 1950s economist robert triffin explained why global reserve currencies never last forever.  see the wikipedia entry for triffin dilemma if you want the gory details.  the gist of it is that the country issuing the reserve currency will have the opportunity to borrow and spend recklessly without suffering the immediate consequences that other non-reserve issuer nations would suffer if they tried to do the same thing.  What he might be getting at here is this idea that the US is affecting the world beyond the amount which the world should be affected.  And that's why, you know, Sarah, I know former traders in Russia that sit there and watch the US employment report for how Russian stocks are going to trade.  And the question I think Carney's asking is, is that right?  Or should there be a different weighting of the importance of the U.S.  economy on the rest of the world?  The process takes decades to play out, but eventually the reserve currency-issuing nation becomes so indebted that other countries no longer trust the creditworthiness of the reserve currency.  At that point, the rest of the world abandons the incumbent global reserve currency and chooses a new one.  And to be sure, pressure has been building in international circles to reduce dependency on the U.S.  dollar as the kingpin of the international monetary system.  That really set the tone for an acceleration of getting out from under the dominance of the US dollar and the Western financial system, such as SWIFT and what have you, and looking for alternative approaches.  And what we're seeing here is this acceleration.  We're seeing Russia, China, Iran, Turkey India, Pakistan, the BRICS countries of Brazil, China, Russia, and even South Africa beginning now to look more eastward in this pursuit. ",

I think, you know, from a U.S.  standpoint, the  U.S.,  I think, is trying to provide some more clarity, which I think is a very positive development, because at the end of the day, there's a significant risk there that we'll lose control we'll lose business overseas.  And what does that mean?  It means we lose innovation, we lose tax revenues, and we lose jobs.  And that's not a good outcome.  So there is a significant risk there if we don't get it right.  The way at Ripple we view cross-border payments as sort of the most practical use case for digital assets.  More recently, we've seen global consensus from countries across the world, including the UK, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, noting that XRP is not a security, but in fact a hybrid between a utility and settlement token.  And again, I just reiterate that we do not see crypto as replacing fiat.  We see opportunities for the two to coexist, and we see significant benefits from building network of networks. ",

When we think about this, and what I've said very publicly, is I think the long-term value of any digital asset is going to be derived from the utility it delivers.  And billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions.  So around payments, we think XRP is uniquely and extremely well positioned to solve that payments problem.  It's extremely fast at about three seconds per transaction, and it costs about a thousandth of a penny to actually enable that transaction.  We often make the point that, well, where Bitcoin is very profound in solving that store of value, an XRP transaction is about 1,000 times faster and it's about 1,000 times cheaper per transaction.  There tends to be one reserve currency and it tends to be a stable equilibrium for a period of time, but it's not infinite, right?  The pound, of course, was the reserve currency for many, many years, but now the dollar has been for some time.  So what do you consider risks to that changing at some point in the future?  It's a very long-run thing.  It's a fairly stable equilibrium.  You have to think what currency out there would compete with the dollar.  It's hard to see the dollar not being the reserve currency for quite some time. ",
