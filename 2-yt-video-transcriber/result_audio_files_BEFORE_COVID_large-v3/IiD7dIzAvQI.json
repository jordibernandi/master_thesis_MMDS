We'll often hear the argument that the heliocentric model perfectly predicts all the observations that we can make, especially when it comes to observing the Sun and the Moon.  However, this is a blatantly false statement.  Any model can be created from the predictive nature of sunrise and sunset or watching the moon go overhead and watching its phases throughout a month.

There are many models of the solar system and the Earth, both flat and spherical, and apparently we get together and just decide upon one at random with no supporting evidence over lunch.  You know, the Illuminati just makes these decisions for us and we're not to question it.  Well, nothing could really be further from the truth.  Models in science are developed from observation of nature.  We come up with a model that explains what we observe in nature and a model that allows us to predict future events in nature.  Now, a classic example is this right here.  These are the solar eclipses for the next 10 years.  Let's have a closer look.  Now, as we can see from this webpage, we can easily predict the exact track and time of every solar eclipse for the next 10 years.  We can reliably predict that on December 26, 2019, there is going to be a solar eclipse in the vicinity of Phuket, Thailand, where Nick lives.  He could easily go a little bit south and actually see this solar eclipse.  and it will appear at exactly the time that it is predicted to the minute.  Now it's true that orbital mechanics were worked out initially from observations based on the surface of the Earth.  It's an understanding of these orbital mechanics that allow us to make these predictions for solar eclipses to the level of precision that we do.  It's because we understand the movement of the Earth and the Moon in relationship to the Sun. ",

Using Kepler's laws of planetary motion, we can use that to calculate the distance to the moon.  We can also laser range find the moon from reflectors that were left there when we went there.

Now there are two things that I can tell you about reality and that is that no matter where you are on the Earth on the same day, the phase of the moon will be the same from any location on Earth.  Now, the other thing is, is that if you look at the moon from the northern hemisphere, say Russia, and compare it to the moon that you see at the same time down in Australia, the image will be flipped.  The moon will be upside down in one site compared to the other site.  Okay, so let's have a look at this illustration.  Right here is the sun.  And up here is the moon.  I think that we would all agree that the sunlight coming from down here, straight up, would cause this side of the moon facing the sun to be illuminated.  So, in Russia, right here, we would see a full moon.  However, what would we see over here in Australia?  We'd only see a half moon.  because the sun is down here and it's shining just on this half of the moon.  This is not what we see in reality. ",

Now we've also seen that there's a problem with the phase of the moon from different spots on the Earth on this model.  OK?  So now we're running into another major problem.  The moonrise and the position of the moon differs from day to day by about one hour.  However, if you look from new moon to new moon, it's every 27.3 days.  If you have two objects, the sun and the moon, going in a circle over the equator, as in this simplified model, why don't you try and figure out mathematically how you would have a one hour difference in the rise or the movement of the moon in the night sky from day to day, yet you have a 27.3 day difference in the phase of the moon.  would the sun have to be and how would the sun have to move in order to make that work?  and then once you figure that out figure out whether or not that corresponds to how the sun actually moves in the daytime sky.

I think that we've already shown that if the moon was lower than the sun, there would have to, by definition, be a solar eclipse somewhere on the Earth every day.  OK?  We don't see that.  We don't see partial solar eclipses, depending on the orientation of the sun and the moon.  Now going back to our original discussion on models, the problem with models is that they make predictions, such as this model predicts that there is no way to avoid having a solar eclipse, or at least a partial solar eclipse, every day if the moon is below the sun and this model is correct.  Therefore, the Moon must be higher than the Sun in order for this model to be correct.  You see, what you do is you come up with a model and try and make a prediction with it, and then compare that prediction to what you see in the real world.  So, for example, in the heliocentric model, which is our current understanding, we can very accurately predict when a solar eclipse will occur, such as that one coming to Southeast Asia on the 26th of December.  it will arrive within a minute of what we predict.  That's very strong evidence that our model is correct.  Can this model predict a solar eclipse to the minute in 90 days?  I'll let you decide that. ",

So we've got a couple of problems that we've identified already.  First of all, there's going to be different phases of the moon in different parts of the world.  Second, the Moon has to be further away from the Earth than the Sun is.  No evidence for either of these.  Third, and that's this illustration right here I just want to call your attention to.  Now, according to Paquette's model, the only time that we can have a new Moon, which is a non-visible Moon on Earth, is when the Moon and the Sun are right next to each other, basically overlapping, and the Sun is blocking the Moon from our view.  However, we see new moons at night when the Moon is supposedly on the other side of the Earth.  That just doesn't work.  Well, I think I've given Phuket enough of my time and your time as well.  So, this idea that the Sun and the Moon are local and revolve around the equator or somewhere thereabouts is about as absurd as the idea that the Earth is flat.  We've already demonstrated that it doesn't fit reality.  It doesn't fit the observations of the moon phases.  It doesn't fit how new moons occur.  It doesn't fit how solar and lunar eclipses occur.  Now, you start adding things like the transit of Venus and Mercury to that, and it just falls apart.  Now, this is why you can't just make up a theory or a model to fit your fantasy.  You have to actually make your model based on reality and observations of reality, and the model tries to explain what you see to the point that you can use that model to predict things that occur in the future, much as we predict solar and lunar eclipses years in advance.  So, until the Flat Earth starts thinking like science, they will never be science.  And with that, I'm going to go ahead and sign out.
