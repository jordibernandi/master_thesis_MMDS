Is there a reason you guys are following me?  Just walking around the station.  I guess the same reason.  you're videoing the police station.  Well, you're not videoing the police station.  I know.  I'm following you around the police station video.  What's your name?  My name's Austin Jackson.  Good to meet you.  Your name?  Sergeant Olivier.  Good to meet you.  What's your name?  Would you like to give me a tour of the interior of the station?  I can't do that.  I don't do that.  The PCR does that.  You can call that a make-up point.  Okay.  I'll see about doing that.  We introduced ourselves.  What's your name?  I really don't want to give that information.  Well, then we'll continue to follow you around the station.  It's kind of senseless.
