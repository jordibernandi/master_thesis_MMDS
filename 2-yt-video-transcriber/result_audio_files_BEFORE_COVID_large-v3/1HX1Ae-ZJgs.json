            "text": "The blind audition study is one of the most celebrated social science papers of all time.  It's famous for showing that when orchestras auditioned musicians blindly behind a screen, women's success rates soared.  But it turns out the study showed no such thing.  What's going on?  That's coming up next on The Factual Feminist.  During the 1970s and 80s, the nation's orchestras became more open and democratic, and to ensure impartiality, several introduced blind auditions.  Two economists, Claudia Golden of Harvard and Cecilia Rouse of Princeton, noticed that women's success rates increased along with the adoption of screens.  Was it a coincidence or the result of the screens?  That's the question they tried to answer in their 2000 paper, Orchestrating Impartiality, the impact of blind auditions on female musicians.  They collected four decades of audition records and rosters from eight major orchestras and crunched the numbers.  Now, their paper includes multiple warnings about small sample sizes and contradictory results, but few readers seem to have noticed.  What caught everyone's attention were some strong claims in the final paragraph.  We find the screen increases by 50% the probability that a woman will be advanced from certain preliminary rounds.  According to Google, the study has received 1,500 citations in academic articles and thousands of media mentions and showcased in so many diversity workshops that one recent attendee begged never to hear about it again.  Now, the study's appeal is clear.  Two prominent economists in a top journal wielding state-of-the-art econometrics captured and quantified gender bias.  And they also documented a solution.  Or so it seemed.  The research went uncriticized for nearly two decades.  That changed recently when a few scholars and data scientists went back and read the whole study.  They found a tangle of small, ambiguous, contradictory findings.  For example, the screen seemed to help women in preliminary audition rounds But in the semifinal rounds, they didn't.  And none of the findings were strong enough to draw broad conclusions one way or another.  And the authors say as much, albeit ambiguously, throughout the paper.  So where did Golden and Rouse get their totemic conclusion that blind auditions dramatically improve the success of women candidates?  Well, after warning that their findings were not statistically significant, they simply declared them to be economically significant.  But what does that mean in this context?  That doesn't mean anything at all, says Columbia University data scientist Andrew Gelman.  In a recent commentary on the study, he said that they are just fine words that really mean that our data is too noisy to form any strong conclusions.  Now, my guess is that the authors thought they detected something with real-world relevance somewhere in all that noise.  But that's a reason to call for more research, not to declare the transformative power of screens in women's quest for equality.  Still, some may think it seems obvious that the screens contributed to equal hiring, but it's not.  The screens may have been a reflection of changing attitudes, and it was those attitudes, not the screens, that helped women.  After all, women didn't need blind auditions to move ahead in law or business, medicine, or even in the Cleveland Orchestra, which had not resorted to blind auditions, according to the study.  Now Gelman and other critics, they don't deny the reality of gender bias, and they don't question the potential merits of blind auditions as a means of achieving impartiality.  But Golden and Rouse verified nothing about the special benefits for women.  And nor is anyone else.  The subsequent research on blind recruitment is just a morass of baseless claims or retracted statements, contradictory findings.  So how did such an equivocal study achieve iconic status?  Well, a lot of the credit goes to confused but influential fans, such as the writer Malcolm Gladwell, and the Harvard psychologist Mazarin Banaji, they saw the study as powerful, indisputable proof of the ubiquity of gender bias, as well as a way to counter it.  According to Gladwell, orchestras in the 1980s started putting up screens in audition rooms, and immediately, immediately, orchestras started hiring women left and right.  And here's Professor Banaji in a 2017 TEDx talk.  In the late 1970s, American orchestras were almost entirely all male.  Once the curtain dropped, the case study shows that the number of women who were selected doubled.  They went up 50%.  but it didn't show that.  Truth matters.  Overhyped claims create confusion and undermine public trust, and they don't solve problems.  Sex discrimination in the workplace is a serious matter, but improvements require solid data, replicable research, and careful evaluations of causation.  As the scholar Alice Draeger says, carpe datum, evidence is an ethical issue.
