Torquemada would make Stalin look like the pipsqueak ruler of a tiny banana republic.  If you want to compare body counts adjusted for access to more efficient means of destruction, we can.

This is what we'd see if there was no designer.  Or a really, really bad one.  Again, humans seek agency.  That the universe could function with complete indifference may be difficult to accept, but just because something seems designed doesn't mean that it was.  This guy talks about not discarding any possibilities a priori, then therefore, before we discard the possibility that something exists without deliberate design, it has to be shown that it couldn't.
