Society is constantly telling us to take off our clothes and show off our bodies, but every Christian girl knows that the word of God says that we need to dress modestly.  Now, I'm not saying that you have to wear a brown paper bag every single day in the name of modesty, but we definitely have to be conscious how we are dressing in order to help our brothers in Christ not stumble.  and so you know I've been doing this a few years now and I've learned a few tricks along my way.  so I want to share those tips and tricks with you my seven wardrobe hacks for dressing modestly.  so if you want to learn what those tricks are please keep watching and real quick if you are new to my channel welcome to my community.  you know I really try really hard to to listen to what my audience wants out of me.

And this beautiful necklace that I'm wearing right here was inspired by Psalm 91.  It is so beautiful, and it really reminds me that God's protection is always with me.  These also can be purchased at queenidentity.com.  okay let's get into today's video.  modesty.  hack number one is the undershirt.  man i love love the undershirt.  i wear them almost every single day because you know sometimes you go to a store and maybe you don't try on the clothes and then you realize when you get home that the shirt is see-through or maybe it's a really beautiful like work shirt but it's a little bit see-through and you know it's always not a good idea to show off your undergarments.  So it's always nice to have like undershirts that you could put and layer your clothes so that you're not exposing too much.  And I love these back here that I have right here.  I have them in almost every single color and they're very comfortable and I love these.  I love getting them in basic colors because they just go with everything.  And so I do, I love this glittery one too.  It's like a blush pink because this is a color that I wear very often.  I also have it in black, but it's actually dirty right now.  So that's why you don't see it over here in my collection.  But I love the thick strap because these, you know, they can easily hide more, especially your bra strap, which, you know nobody needs to see that they also keep you very warm in the winter or fall months when it gets.  really you know it's been really cold in california lately.  we have had a little bit of rain which i mean compared to other parts of the country it's not that cold.  but for us californians that are used to the summer weather um it's pretty cold.  so i love wearing undershirts for that reason too because they keep you warm and cozy and you can layer them with your dressy shirt for work whatnot and I just love them so much modesty.  hack number two is the kimono.  I love kimonos.  I love them so much because you know they really hide the back area very nicely so that you're not showing off too much especially if you're wearing like skinny jeans or something form-fitting.  you know you can wear a kimono over your outfit and instantly just hide the parts that need to be hid.  And you know, some of us need to be more conscious about it than others, because a lot of us ladies are blessed in the back area more than others.  So they really do hide your figure very well.  And as you can see, I love the lacy kind.  Like this is one of my favorites.  I wore it to an event.  Um, it was a woman's conference that we went to And it's just so beautiful.  I love the color too.  But as you can see, I'm a huge fan of lace.  I have this one in lace.  I've got white in lace and I just love them because they really do hide the back area very well.  And they still make you look really beautiful and sophisticated and chic.  You know, I've got this one in a tan color.  Again, the lacy material that I love so much.  And I also have them in like the satin.  I love the satin one.  It's so beautiful.  And it's an easy pop of color for any outfit.  Modesty hack number three is the high waist jean.  I am obsessed with high waisted jeans.  I love them so much.  I have them almost in every color.  These are some of my favorites right here.  I love like the beautiful button up that they go all the way up.  And they really just... hug your body so nicely, but they also are great because, you know, right now crop tops are very, very popular.  And so with the high-waisted jean, you can still wear the crop top and still be completely covered up because the crop top only goes so high.  And then the part, you know, your mid section is not showing because you're high-waisted jean is there.  So these are great.  I have them in this color.  I also have them in white.  I have them in black, you know, just all the colors that you could possibly need to make any look really great.  Modesty hack number four is the body suit.  Oh, how I love these.  These are another ones of my obsessions because I just love how they make your body look so seamless.  And I love the fact that they cover up the entire midsection.  and they instantly make you look chic because it's almost like you're tucking in a shirt without actually having to tuck it in.  I just picked up these two, not bad, Marshalls for $12.99.  This one was also, I think, $12.99.  Oh no, this one was on sale for $10, and I'm actually wearing one right now.  I don't know if you could see it, but I'm wearing a bodysuit under the skirt, and it's so beautiful because I just love how seamless it is.  It makes you instantly feel skinny.  And they're very versatile, you can wear them with pants, you can wear them with a skirt, you can wear them with jeans, really any type of bottom.  you could basically wear body suits with.  So it's really, beautiful, how they make you look.  And I just love that they cover up your midsection.  Modesty hack.  number five is the jean jacket.  I love jean jackets.  Oh my gosh.  I love them so much.  This one I actually got in Italy when my husband and I went and it literally instantly makes you feel edgy.  Like as soon as you put on a jean jacket, you instantly feel edgy, but I love Jean jacket, I mean, I love leather jackets because they go very well with like beautiful dresses and it instantly elevates your look from like plain dress to an edgy, beautiful, sophisticated look.  And the cool thing about leather jackets is that you can wear them when you're wearing like a spaghetti strap dress.  Like maybe you go to a wedding and it's cold outside, but you know, you kind of feel like there's not a lot of like sweaters that go with your outfit.  Well, a leather jacket is a great replacement for that.  and you still feel like you're dressed up, you know?  So this one is my current favorite.  I love this black leather jacket.  I wear it almost all the time when I'm wearing a leather jacket.  I also have this one in this camel color, which I love.  I have this white one that's kind of like a leather jacket, a little bit, but this one's a little bit more lacy, but I still love it because it has a zipper.  So I wear that one.  And yeah, I have this one that's a little dressier too.  It's got the leather in the front.  and it's got like this mesh material on the sides.  And so I just love leather jackets, period.  I'm actually trying to build my collection more, but for now, this one is definitely my favorite.  Modesty hack number six is the maxi dress.  Oh my gosh, do I love maxi dresses.  I love maxi dresses because they make me feel So beautiful.  Like I, I instantly feel beautiful when I put on a maxi dress and I'm super covered up too.  Like I love halter maxi dresses.  Like I have these two that are halter.  This one I wore to a wedding that I went to and I just love the high neckline because you know, you, it really covers up your cleavage very nicely there.  And this one I wore to Italy, and actually we went to Venice when I put this one on, and I felt so sophisticated when I was in Venice with this dress.  I felt very elegant is the right word.  And I wore it on the gondola ride.  I'll put you guys a picture right here so you guys can see how I looked.  But it's beautiful because it covers up very nicely.  And you know you want to feel like summery and beautiful in the summertime but you also want to feel like you are covered up.  So this one is great and I paired this one with my white leather jacket that you see back here.  And it looked really pretty on and it especially kept me warm.  it started getting a little colder.  so maxi dresses are really great and elegant and just so beautiful.  i love it.  and my final modesty hack for you today is the jean jacket.  i love jean jackets.  as you can see behind me i have a slight obsession with jean jackets.  i love them.  i just got this black one actually for our anniversary.  hubby bought it for me, but I love them because of the thick material.  They're very versatile and you can also wear them all year long.  It doesn't have to necessarily be in the winter.  You could wear them in the summertime.  You could wear them in the spring and they instantly make you feel covered up.  As soon as you put one on, you instantly feel covered up.  and they're great in the winter time as well because of the thick material of them.  They keep you warm.  Um, I especially love wearing them when I'm out and about, especially if I'm like near the ocean, because in the ocean, like it gets really cold, really fast.  So I love putting a G jacket on.  I love this white one.  That's a Michael Kors that I got a while ago.  And yes, I'm that dangerous woman that wears white all the time because I love white, but yeah, they're very versatile.  You can wear them with shorts.  You can wear them with skirts.  You Jean jackets are with a boho style dress or also with jeans.  You can never go wrong pairing them with a pair of jeans like the white ones that I have back here.  You know, you can wear white on white, like a monochromatic look, which I love.  So there, you know, you can style them very differently, but also still feel very chic and sexy and beautiful.  So there's ways, ladies, where we can dress modestly, but still look beautiful.
