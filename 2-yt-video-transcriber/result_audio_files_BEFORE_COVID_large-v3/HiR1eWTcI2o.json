            "text": "Shalom, shalom, it's El Dario for One Nation, One Power.  Coming back to you brothers and sisters one more time to bring forth some prophecies that's gonna take place on the earth so that you can get a better insight on what's coming on planet earth.  According to the Bible, not me.  Once again, get your pencil, get your paper.  Because you're going to have to write down some scriptures and some verses.  Because we're going to break down our Bible according to Isaiah chapter 28 verse 9 and 10.  Write that down.  We're going to break down our Bible according to Psalms 119, 104.  We're going to break down our Bible according to Psalms 119, 128.  And we're also going to break down our Bible according to 2 Nephi chapter 28 and verse 30.  It gives us a breakdown.  or how we should read and understand our Bible.  Are you guys with me?  So now, we need to go into our Bible, since we're living in the last days, since they're poisoning our water, since they're trying to vaccinate the children, since they're spraying from the air, let's go into our Bible today and see what this is all about.  What is this all about?  Why are you contaminating the food system?  Why are you vaccinating the population?  Why are you contaminating the food and fluoridating the water?  What is it all about?  Somebody is up to something that should be made known to the rest of the world because it has everything to do with the 12 tribes of the children of Israel.  So now let's go first to Isaiah chapter 61.  Isaiah chapter 61.  Isaiah chapter 61.  And we're looking at Bible prophecy.  Isaiah chapter 61.  And we want verse 9.  Isaiah 61 and 9.  We're going to go straight to the meat.  Isaiah 61, 9. and their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people.  All that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed, that they are the seed which the Most High has blessed.  This is Bible prophecy in Isaiah 61 and verse number nine.  that while we are living among the Gentiles, that the day is going to come when they are going to know who you are.  And that's happening right now.  Now we want to go to Micah, chapter 5.  Micah, chapter 5.  We're dealing with Bible prophecy.  Prophecies that have not happened yet.  Michael chapter 5.  At a later time, you can read Michael 5, 8, all the way down to verse 15.  But today, we're just going to read Michael 5 and 8.  We're going to go straight to the meat.  Michael 5 and 8.  And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles.  Where they at?  Among the Gentiles.  This is precepted perfectly with Isaiah 61 and 9.  Where we at?  Now, among the Gentiles.  Why does this make perfectly good sense?  Because when you read out of this thing, It tells the story of the Messiah putting his spirit upon the Gentiles to come over, and he gave them this land for their inheritance and took it from us.  Shipped us out of here, but a lot of us are still here.  So today, we are living among the Gentiles.  And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion, as a what?  As a lion, as a what?  As a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of the sheep.  Who?  If he go through, both tread it down and tear it in pieces, and none can deliver.  And none can deliver.  Did you hear that?  And none can deliver.  Now, the remnant of Jacob is the 12 tribes of the children of Israel.  In this particular prophecy, the Most High is letting me know and letting you know that these children of Israel are lions.  They are like lions.  But right now, they don't know that they're lions.  Only the tribe of Judah think and believe that it is the only lion among the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.  But I'm here today to let you know that all twelve tribes are lions.  Let's read verse 8 again.  And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion.  The remnant of Jacob is like a lion among the Gentiles.  Who?  Who?  Who, who, if he go through, both tread it down and tear it in pieces, and none can deliver.  Right here, the Most High is likening the last day remnant church of the Lamb of God unto lions.  Let's continue.  Let's go now to 1 Kings.  Chapter 10 and verse 20.  1 Kings 10 and 20.  1 Kings 10 and 20.  1 Kings.  1 Kings.  I'm in 2 Kings.  1 Kings chapter 10 and we want verse 20.  1 Kings 10 and 20.  Let's start at verse 16.  1 Kings 10 and 16.  And King Solomon made 200 targets of beaten gold.  600 shekels of gold went to one target.  and he made 300 shields of beaten gold.  three pounds of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon verse number 18. moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold verse 19.  The throne had six steps.  And the top of the throne was round behind.  And there were stays on either side on the place of the seat.  And two lions stood beside the stays.  Verse 20.  And twelve lions.  And what?  And twelve lions.  And what?  And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other up on the six steps.  There was not the like made in any kingdom.  King Solomon, my friend, understood that the 12 tribes of the children of Israel, the warriors, the Spartans among them, were like lions so that he made 12 lions going up to his throne.  Let's continue.  Go now to Isaiah chapter 5.  Isaiah chapter 5 and verse number 29.  Isaiah chapter 5 and verse number 29.  Their roaring shall be like a lion.  They shall roar like young lions.  Yea, they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver it.  And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea.  And if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.  The children of Israel in this day and in this time shall be made like unto male lions.  Let's continue.  Where do we want to go now?  1 Chronicles.  Is that where we want to go?  No, we want to go to Jeremiah 51 and 38.  Jeremiah 51 and 38.  Jeremiah.  51 and 38.  They won't teach you this in the Christian church.  Jeremiah 51 and 38.  They're thinking they're getting away from these prophecies.  These prophecies coming to get you.  Jeremiah 51 and 38.  Jeremiah 51 and 38.  They shall roar together like lions.  They shall yell as lions wail.  They, they, who is the they here?  The 12 tribes of the children of Israel shall roar together like lions.  Let's go now to 1 Chronicles chapter 12.  These prophecies are going to come and get you.  1 Chronicles 12.  1 Chronicles chapter 12.  1 Chronicles 12 and 8.  1 Chronicles 12 and 8.  And of the Gadites.  They have separated themselves unto David in the whole up to the wilderness.  Men of might.  Men of what?  Men of might.  Men of might.  And men of war.  Fit for the battle.  You hear that?  Fit for the battle.  Do you hear that?  Fit for the battle.  Oh, do you hear me talking?  That's why right now you got to make yourself fit for the battle.  Do you hear me talking out there?  How do you get fit today?  1 John 1, 7, 8, and 9.  You confess your sins.  You repent daily.  You get yourself fit for the coming battle.  That could handle shield and buckler.  Whose faces were like the faces of life.  And were as swift as the rose upon the mountains.  This my friend is your Spartans.  Let's continue.  Jeremiah 25.  Let's see if they are likened to the son of the most high God.  Jeremiah 25. and 30. jeremiah 25 and 30 did.  jeremiah 25 and 30. therefore prophesy thou against all these words against them all these words and say unto them the lord shall roar from on high And utter his voice from his holy habitation.  He shall mightily roar upon his habitation.  He shall give a shout as they that tread the greats against all the inhabitants of the earth.  Or what?  Against all the inhabitants of the earth.  No, he's going to lead some.  Against all, all, all, all the inhabitants of the earth.  And noise shall come even to the ends of the earth.  For the Lord hath the controversy with the nations.  Of course he has a controversy with the nations.  They're living in outright wickedness and abomination.  So he's supposed to have a controversy with you.  If he's teaching don't sin, don't live in sin, keeping the commandments, and you're doing the opposite.  Of course he's got a controversy with you, my friend.  He will plead with all flesh.  He will give them that are wicked to the sword, says the Lord.  Thus says the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coast of the earth, and the sling of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth Even until the other end of the earth.  They shall not be lamented.  Nobody going to be crying for them.  Neither gathered.  And nobody going to be gathering them up.  Nor buried.  They ain't going to be buried.  They shall be dung upon the ground.  Do you know what that means?  There shall be a foul stench upon the ground.  Do you know what that means?  There are going to be dead corpses from one end of the earth to the other.  My suggestion to you right now is to repent.  Confess the sins of your forefather and your sins so that you can be ready when he comes.  Because he ain't coming playing no game.  Go to Ezekiel chapter 9.  The people of the world are in a comatose state.  They're running around here praying with their eternal souls.  Thinking that the most hard God is on their side.  Who told you that he is on your side my friend?  Who told you that he is with you?  If you are not doing exactly what he said to do he's not on your side.  He is your enemy.  Ezekiel chapter 19 and verse number 6 Ezekiel 19 and 6.  And he went up and down among the lions.  He became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devoured men.  Oh, you better come on out of here.  And devoured men.  And devoured men.  And devoured men.  Let's continue.  Go now to the book of Nahal.  You want to go to the book of Nahal?  Go with me to the book of Nahal.  Chapter 2, and we want verse 11, Nahum 2.11.  Nahum 2.11, where is the dwelling of the lions and the feeding place of the young lions?  Where the lion, even the old lion, walketh.  And the lions wept, and none made them afraid.  Verse 12.  The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangle for his lionesses, and fill his holes with prey, and his dens with ravens.  This is a prophecy.  that these twelve tribes of Israel are like the lions.  And when the time comes, they're going to tear in pieces.  This is Bible prophecy.  Don't get upset with me because these men are going to only simply do what their Creator would have them to do.  They're going to follow in the likeness and the footsteps in the Son of the Most High God.  The Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world.  He's coming back, my friend.  Go to Zechariah 14 and 1.  Zechariah 14 and 1.  Zechariah 14 and 1.  Zechariah 14 and 1.  Behold, the day of the Lord cometh.  Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.  The day of the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.  Now at a later date in time, read all of Zechariah 14.  Because all of the wealth... All of the gold, all of the silver, all of the sheep, all of the camels, all of the acids, everything on planet Earth will go back.  unto the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.  I bring forth these simple prophecies that have yet to be fulfilled, that must be fulfilled before the second coming of the Son of God.  This is El Dario for One Nation, One Power, letting you know to prepare yourself to make yourself fit for the coming battle.  Shalom. ",
