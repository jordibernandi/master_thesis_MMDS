            "text": "Each one of us walk with pressures that we need to learn how to handle.  Do you agree?  According to the physics teachers, each of us carries 15 pounds of atmospheric pressure on every square inch of our body.  And if I asked you to hold 15 pounds for 15 minutes, you would feel it, wouldn't you?  And I'm sure as light as 15 pounds seem, just stand there holding for 15 minutes.  I guarantee you'd look at your watch several times and see, should I put this down?  Yet, you walk around every minute of every hour, you lay down, and you get up with that kind of pressure on your body.  But you don't feel it.  You don't feel it because that pressure is equalized by an inner force that pushes out equal to the force pushing in.  What do you do when you don't have an inner force sufficient to push out, to equalize the power of the force coming at you?  Or upon you, you cave in.  And each one of us at some juncture cave in.  Pressure gets too great.  I just can't handle it.  I just can't handle it.  Have you ever been like that?  And you know what?  When you get to the point where you say, I just can't handle it, you very rarely think of Allah.  You say, I'll go get a drink.  Oh, I'm a true Muslim.  I wouldn't do that.  I know a lot of so-called true Muslims who do things that say they disbelieve in God.  At that critical moment, we'll seek pleasure.  We won't seek the God.  We'll seek, yeah, strange sex.  We'll seek Drugs will seek relief in our friends and conversation, which never dispels the pressure because it's there.  It wakes you up in the night.  See?  Pressure.  Anytime you're living in a world where Allah says, surely the shock of the hour is a grievous thing.  and when you see it, the day you see it, every woman giving suck will give up or forget her suckling.  And there's no mother that will forget the baby on her breast except she's in extreme stress.  And the pregnant woman who is not come to term even will lay her burden down and a child will become gray headed.  That's some stress.  And each of us as Muslims trying to be right in a wrong world, trying to go against the grain of an unrighteous world for Allah's sake.  and our own sake, we find we are under an inordinate amount of stress.  How do we handle it?  How do you handle it?  What does Allah suggest to us to help us to handle the stress of trying to be right in a wrong world?  Allah says, seek refuge in him.  So the last chapter of the Quran says, Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim.  In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, I seek refuge in the Lord of men, the King of men, the God of men.  Stop right there.  Who are you going to?  Now some have called me a lord.  But this didn't say seek refuge in who you say is lord.  The definite article is used there.  I seek refuge in the lord of men.  And who is that?  Allah.  I seek refuge in the king of men.  Not Prince Charles or queen whoever or king whoever.  That's not the king of men.  The king of men, the sovereign over our lives is not the president.  Huh?  It is Allah.  So Allah is saying to you, seek refuge not in who you call Lord, in the Lord of men.  Not in who you want to bow to as a king, in the king of men and in the God of men.  Not a God, but the God of men.  Seek refuge from what?  From the evil whispering of the slinking devil.  who whispers into the hearts of men from among the jinn and the men.  Now, beloved, when you attempt to walk right in a world as wrong as this one, you're going to get not only loud shouts of disapproval, but you're going to get heavy whispers in the form of suggestions.  But the worst whispering is the whispering that comes up from inside your own mind, from among the jinn, from among the fiery nature of yourself.  When the nature is in heat, when the nature feels upset and angry, when the nature is feeling discomforted because no one seems to recognize who you think you are, and you're in a bad mood, the nature inside a suggestion, a whisper comes up.  And you better seek some refuge in Allah because in that mood, in that moment, You can do great damage.  I seek refuge in the Lord of men, the King of men, the God of men from the evil of the whisperings of the slinking devil who whispers into the hearts of men from among the jinn and the men. ",
