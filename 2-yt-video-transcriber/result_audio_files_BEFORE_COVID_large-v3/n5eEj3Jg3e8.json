            "text": "There's a combination of individual and structural factors, if I can put it like that.  So certainly I don't put the blame on individual journalists.  I don't particularly think that's helpful.  Maybe sometimes, but most of the time they're dealing with pretty difficult circumstances.  But you have to acknowledge the fact that journalists increasingly are not that representative of the wider society.  So we had recent research that showed there was a vast over-representation of journalists and editors who were educated at Oxbridge and went to private school, you know, massively over-represented journalists.  That actually is a real structural constraint on what they think is important.  We know about politics at such an explosive, volatile time in the world.  Politics is still seen as this thing that happens in one square mile around Parliament, maybe sometimes around the city when it broadens out to economics.  And that's it.  And I think that the understanding or the misunderstanding of what was going on that led up to Brexit, the inability to That's something that happened in the UK as well as with the election of Trump, an inability to really think of what is happening to the ordinary lives outside these bubbles.  That is difficult for journalists when those aren't their lives to do that.  So I'm going back to what Anna was saying, what the journalist Nick Davis coined journalism.  So the idea that you are constantly repurposing public relations journalism.  And you're also facing horrendous deadlines across different platforms at the same time as you have a wider media system that, frankly, is much more interested in reproducing established narratives and stories instead of challenging them.  All of that is quite an explosive mixture that just does not serve audiences well. ",

            "text": "What I would also say is that journalists aren't doing research in their own spare time, in their free time.  So I've seen a lot of journalists talk about the Westminster paedophile ring now being a nothing-to-see-here kind of thing because of what happened with Carl Beach.  None of them were there reporting on the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in March.  where there were about four senior police officers saying that they were told to keep quiet should they encounter anything to do with a VIP paedophile.  So this story just did not get out.  I'm aware of one journalist that was there every day.  He wasn't getting paid.  He's been publishing on Twitter.  But generally, there was very little presence at that independent inquiry to child sexual abuse in March from any of the mainstream media organisations.  And the testimonies on oath from these senior police officers talking about how if they saw a photograph of anyone of importance or a politician with a young boy, they were told to keep quiet.  So the journalists that I have challenged and said, well, you know, you've said that the Westminster paedophile ring, you know, basically implying that Leon Britton and everyone else is in the clear now, there's nothing to see here.  I said, well, have you looked at these testimonies from ICSA?  And they get angry.  This is a problem I do have with journalists.  When I present them with information, well, look, there is another story out there that you haven't been presented on your press release or from your editor where you look into it.  And on the whole, what I found is they get angry and they don't like being challenged and criticized, even though that's what they do every single day. ",
