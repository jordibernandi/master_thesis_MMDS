            "text": "What's going on, Americans?  Jericho Green here with you once again with my fresh new JG hat.  That's right, I had to update my own green gear.  So, if you haven't heard, apparently the happiest place on Earth is not the safest place on Earth.  I think it was this weekend or something.  These fucking jackasses are in Toontown inside of Disneyland and these jackasses get into a damn fight.  Who the fuck is fighting at Disneyland?  Well, if you're wondering, check out the video.  You'll see four of these ghetto ass animals Four adults, two men, two women, and one of them's pushing a stroller with two fucking kids in it.  Apparently, the conversation got heated, and the one in the white top, big Nell Carter-looking bitch, spits in this dude's face.  Now, this dude is probably 6'3\", 250 pounds.  This dude is huge.  So he starts throwing hands at this chick.  On her, at her, whatever.  He starts hitting her.  Now you would think a man of that size hitting your average woman, she'd be out.  She'd be done.  So he ends up swinging on three of the people he's with.  Again, like I said, you would think a man of this size, if he punches anybody in the face, they're going to sleep, especially a woman.  These women were much smaller than him.  So you would think he connects, lights out, everybody who gets hit, you get to park in the blue parking space in front of the store for the rest of your life, right?  Wrong.  This dude obviously has sugar in his tank because he is slapping and pulling hair.  Luckily for them.  Luckily he didn't know how to fight.  Luckily he didn't ball his hands up.  But this dude is basically a big ass sissy and he's slapping and pulling hair.  And then at one point in the video, one of the women, he was like walking and they were talking.  They were walking together.  All of a sudden, he just starts swinging on her ass, too, pulling hair, pulling them to the ground.  Now, Disney is getting some backlash because they took, what, there's a five-minute video.  These fools took three minutes to show up to the scene.  You didn't see any Disneyland security until three minutes in.  Now, on one hand, I can understand that.  You know, quick response.  This is Disneyland.  People are paying a lot of money just to get in there.  You haven't bought any food, no souvenirs, nothing.  Just a step in the gate, you paid a shitload of money, so I want good service.  Good, prompt, professional, polite service.  Three Ps.  Prompt, professional, and polite service.  But on the other hand, how busy is Disneyland security?  Now, I'm sure there's probably some behind-the-scenes episode somewhere on the fucking Discovery Channel where it's Disney security.  Yeah, I'm sure they do have things to do, but how often do they break up a damn fight in Toontown?  So people are standing around, you know, ushering their kids out of the way, horrified at what the fuck is going on inside of the happiest place on earth.  What the fuck is this shit?  Every adult involved in that should be caned.  Remember that kid in 94 who went to Singapore, decided to spray paint on some shit, and they caned his ass?  That's what they need to do to these fucking idiots.  It was so bad, we had to start fighting right then and there.  You couldn't say, you couldn't walk away and just leave?  We'll handle this later?  What the fuck?  You had to fight right there in Disneyland in front of all those families, in front of all those kids.  You piece of shit.  Not only that, hey, thanks a lot for perpetuating the stereotype, you fucking assholes.  Everybody in there who wasn't black was like, see, I told you, look at him.  uncivilized fucking animals.  You can't take them anywhere.  These niggas decided to fight inside of Disneyland.  And I'm not using that as a term of endearment.  I'm using that to describe these ghetto ass pieces of shit.  In my house growing up, my parents did not throw that word around lightly.  It was not part of our everyday lexicon.  If my parents said nigga, they were talking about some low down dirty ghetto piece of shit.  That's what that word means to me.  That's how that word was used when I was growing up in my house.  Like Chris Rock said, there's black people and there's niggas and niggas have got to go.  You ghetto ass motherfuckers.  Security should have shown up, batons in hand, and started beating their ass.  You guys want to fight?  We'll give you a fight.  You fucking ghetto trash.  Man, I'd be mad as shit if I'm in that park with my kids, my family, and these fucking dummies start fighting.  They should be banned for life.  And arrested all of them.  I hope they were arrested, you fucking idiots.  You ghetto.  Oh, man.  I saw that shit.  I saw the.  So I come across my news feed.  And it was a still shot.  And you just see that big ass sissy open hand slapping a woman.  I was like, oh, no, no.  Say it isn't so.  man I don't know what the fuck do you say.  is it a stereotype.  at this point I'm starting to think that regular decent black folks whom I happen to know a lot of I'm starting to think we are the true minority.  are there fewer of us in these ghetto pieces of shit?  you fucking section 8 motherfuckers man God.  Not every racial group.  You got your ghetto trash.  You got the ones you see and you're like, oh, fuck, please don't look at me.  We all have those.  But it seems to me the ones that look like me always seem to pop up on the Internet with some ghetto shit is happening.  I've said this before, I'll say it again.  Like my dad used to tell me, son, they may be your color, but they ain't your kind.  This is the textbook definition.  Fucking assholes.  Bring caning to America.  Here are your first four candidates.  Now let me hop in this damn rat race.  It's my Monday.  But that's alright.  I got my new Fresh Prince sweatshirt.  I'm ready.  My new green gear.  I'm ready.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please subscribe.  Hit that notification bell.
