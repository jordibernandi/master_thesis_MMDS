            "text": "Good afternoon, brethren.  This is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, we will all praise this to the Most High, Yehawah.  I also want to give acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  I also want to acknowledge Yehawah Shai.  I pray that the Most High blesses this lesson today and gives more knowledge and understanding to the events of the past, the events that are currently happening today, and the events to soon come upon the earth.  Wanted to come today with a quick lesson, talking about how a lot of the Gentile nations are seeing the changes that are coming on the earth, and they're trying to wrap their minds around it, and trying to explain things while they're leaving out the Most High.  I've been watching them quite a few videos and, you know, as they start to see these changes happening, they always want to act like men are making these things occur.  One thing I wanted to talk about was like a weather modification.  Because of all the storms and the intensity of them coming across the nation and across the world, that a lot of people don't want to believe that the Most High is doing this.  And I can see why, because in the churches, they teach you about Cesare Borgia, white Jesus, loves everyone, wants everybody to come to repentance, doesn't want to avenge anyone, doesn't want to bring judgment to anyone.  He's very soft and loving.  So when you start to see this destruction coming on the earth, it's very difficult for them to grasp or get to wrap their heads around it.  when you've hidden who the real children of the Most High are.  And then it's hard for them to believe that, you know, he's going to, these are the real people.  These people of color that we've been keeping at the bottom the entire time, they don't let their minds, they don't wrap their minds around that whole concept because it's probably too grievous to think about.  So I've been hearing quite a few things about, you know, with the rains and the flooding, it's a weather modification.  And the elites have control of these HAARP systems and they can do this and they can do that.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm sure they probably have some weapons or some machines that they can, you know, manipulate certain things in the weather and things like that.  Yeah, I'm sure they probably have some.  But ultimately... the Most High, is in charge.  You know, just like in the time of Egypt, when Moses came, and he performed his first miracle in front of the Pharaoh, and he turned his staff into a snake, and the priests and the sorcerers of the Egyptians were able to do the same.  So, yes, the other nations, because many of them, or all of them, are all pretty much ran, by the adversary and they have demons that perform miracles on a much smaller scale for them in order to keep people in the dark.  so yes they have some power and they probably have some information where they can manipulate weather to a certain extent to keep people blind.  but we all must remember that the most high is the one who's doing this.  he is the one that is in charge.  you know So, but that's the thing with the other nations.  We were given to the other nations.  They did not take us down.  But see, since they don't acknowledge the Most High, they wrap it in their minds that they took over power because of their great military prowess.  Not the fact that the Most High had blessed them.  That's the thing that they don't admit, that the Most High blessed them and gave us over to them.  They want, they are very prideful and want to let, they want to believe that they took us down.  So when you start getting into, you know, looking now that the fact that the Most High is changing things and starting to bring torments and destruction upon them, they don't want to believe that that's the Most High.  They want to believe that they're in control of their own demise at this point.  You know, I said, it's the Most High who's doing all this.  just like we were delivered into your hands for us, you know, breaking the law, you're going to have to serve punishment.  And the most high is going to bring the pain.  You don't get to control your own punishment.  You don't say that the elites are trying to destroy the world.  They control everything.  Why would they want to destroy it?  You know, and that's what he's, the most high is taking his power away.  You know, he is the one that is in control of the heavens.  And there's a great story that was actually in the Bible.  And I wanted to read a little bit of it.  Talking about Elijah, when he was going against the 450 priests of Baal.  And that's what this picture is actually from, from that story, from the Bible.  You know, and they believe that they could manipulate, you know, the heavens and and have, you know, a fire come down from the heavens, and, you know, ignite the bull on their altar.  And the Most High showed them who's in control in this story, just like today.  Okay?  So let me get that real quick.  We're going to 1 Kings, chapter 18, verse 22.  Then said Elijah unto the people, I Even I only remain a prophet of the Lord, but Baal's prophets are 450 men.  Let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under.  And I will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under.  And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord.  And the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.  And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.  And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first, for ye are many.  And call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.  And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us.  But there was no voice, nor any that answered.  And they leaped upon the altar which was made.  And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god.  Either he is talking or he is pursuing.  or he is in a journey or peradventure, he sleepeth and must be awaked.  And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them.  And it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me.  And all the people came near unto him.  And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.  And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.  And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Most High.  And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.  And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.  And he said, Do it the second time.  And they did it the second time.  And he said, do it the third time.  And they did it the third time.  And the water ran around about the altar.  And he filled the trench also with water.  And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah, the prophet, came near and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art the most high in Israel and that I am thy servant.  and that I have done all these things at thy word.  Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou hast turned their heart back again.  Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench.  And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and they said, the Lord, he is the God, the Lord, he is the God.  And Elijah said unto them, take the prophets of all, let not one of them escape.  And they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slew them there.  So just nothing is new.  Everything repeats itself over and over and over again.  It's like Groundhog Day.  So when you get a good chance of understanding what's happened in the past, we can understand what's going to happen here in the present and what's coming on the earth again in the future.  These other nations think that they're going to rely on their priests and pastors, and if they are the ones who are going to lead them, you know, into the spirit world, into the heavens, that they're the ones with the keys to heaven.  I've been studying quite a few of my new books that I've purchased, and I'm going to be coming out with more videos on that.  And it's amazing because once you start to see the things that these people did in the name of their God, how anyone could believe that these people could lead you to heaven is beyond rational.  You'd have to be crazy to believe in these priests and pastors with a thing that they condoned in the past.  I mean, I've already talked about it in some of the other videos, but some of the new stuff that's going to be coming out real soon, you're going to see even more heinous and horrible things that they condoned in the name of their power.  And now that they're seeing that their chokehold on the world is being taken off, They're trying to justify or, you know, everything with, yeah, well, we're in, we're controlling everything.  We're manipulating, you know, these are all.  people are manipulating everything and we're in control.  They want to make sure that everyone believes that they're in control all the way till the end when they never had control in the first place.  You know, so just like in the past, When the 10 plagues were going on in Egypt, I'm sure many of the people were trying to find scientific reasons as to why these 10 plagues were happening.  I've seen articles, I was actually looking at articles today that tried to explain all of the 10 plagues with a scientific reasoning that it wasn't God, but it was just natural occurrences.  And now you're seeing the same thing play out here in this society.  It's not the Most High that's bringing these hurricanes and these storms and this flooding.  It's men that are doing it themselves.  So just like in this story where men think that they are in control, the only one that's in control is the Most High.  And I just feel like it's really hard for... the vast majority of this population to believe that the most high would bring judgment on the world because of what's been done to his children.  It's much easier, I guess, for them to believe that there's a men that are at the top, the top one or 2% who control the whole world would just destroy their own creation for no reason.  I think the latter is more.  easy to believe that the most high is in charge and he's bringing in judgment because of what's been done to his people.  But this really plays into, if you look at the way the most high works, this thinking about them and being in control of everything plays into the most high, the way the most high works things, how he reveals himself.  At first, people try to blow off what they're seeing.  People try to make rational decisions scientific judgments as to what's going on around them.  And that just opens it up for the Most High to go all in on his plagues.  He's like, oh, okay, you don't want to believe that this is me?  All right, well, I'm going to make sure I do some crazy stuff that you will know for sure that it's not just some random occurrence.  You'll know that it's the power or the God of the Israelites that's doing this to you.  And I wanted to read a couple of excerpts here from The book of Jasher, when the Most High just kind of opened up the plagues on the people and let them know for sure, hey, this isn't an accident.  This isn't just a freak of nature.  This is the Most High who's bringing the judgment.  So in the book of Jasher, let me get this real quick.  It's in chapter 80.  So when the plagues are going on, we're going to read verses 1 through 8.  At the end of two years, the Lord again sent Moses to Pharaoh to bring forth the children of Israel and to send them out of the land of Egypt.  So the Most High, you know, gave them their time.  I'm sure they were trying to just, you know, play everything off.  All right, we got everything under control.  And here's what the Most High did.  And Moses went and came to the house of Pharaoh.  And he spoke to him the words of the Lord.  And he had sent him, but Pharaoh would not hearken to the voice of the Lord.  And God roused his might in Egypt upon Pharaoh and his subjects.  And God smote Pharaoh and his people with very great and sore plagues.  And the Lord sent by the hand of Aaron and turned all the waters of Egypt into blood with all their streams and rivers.  Now we usually hear that from the Bible, but then in the book of Joshua goes even a little bit more.  It goes, and when the Egyptian came to drink, and draw water he looked into his pitcher and behold all the water was turned into blood.  and when he came to drink from his cup the water in the cup became blood.  and when a woman kneaded her dough and cooked her victuals the uh their appearance was turned to that of blood.  Okay, and then check out the part with the frogs here.  And the Lord sent again and caused all the waters to bring forth frogs, and all the frogs came into the houses of the Egyptians.  So I've heard that part trying to be explained scientifically, but this is some of the stuff that was left out that you don't have scientific explanations for.  Verse 7.  And when the Egyptians drank, their bellies were filled with frogs.  And they dance in their bellies as they dance when in the river.  And all their drinking water and cooking water turn to frogs.  Also, when they lay in their beds, their perspiration bred frogs.  Okay.  So the multi, when he's unleashing judgment, it's going to be on a scale that is going to be undeniable.  Okay.  So people can play off the warnings if they want to.  But if people are starting to see the warnings and the Most High is talking to you and telling you to repent and come back to him, I would suggest that's something that you might want to do.  Men are not controlling this judgment.  Esau and the other nations don't get to choose their punishment like they do now.  The Most High is going to be the judge, okay?  and the executioner of the judgment.  All praises to the most high, Yahawa.  Again, acknowledge to the earthly mother, who was wisdom, who was the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledge to Yahawashi.  Shalom. ",
