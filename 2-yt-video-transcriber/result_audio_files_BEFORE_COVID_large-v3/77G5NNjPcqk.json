            "text": "Today David Lammy received a racist note which specifically name checks Anne Whittacombe, with whom Lammy has been feeding recently.  And Lammy promptly took to Twitter.  So let's have a closer look at this note.  We can see that this note paper has been folded exactly once and so must have come, one would think, in quite an unusual shaped envelope from the normal rectangular envelope.  But that's by the by.  One notable feature of this handwriting is the slanting cross to this T here.  I think you'd agree that this T is unusual.  You'll see that it is not consistent across the whole note but comes only at the start of words.  Now, I'm quite a cynical type and when I see a letter that plays in perfectly to the narrative and worldview of a certain politician, including name-checking their enemies with whom they are feuding at the moment, I get a little suspicious.  Some of you will recall that this is not the first time David Lammy has received such a note.  Last May, he received... another racist note.  let's take a look at this one.  oh this is interesting isn't it?  note once again this distinctive T. in fact as my buddy living the dream has done on Twitter you can pull out all sorts of letters and need no training in handwriting analysis at all to tell that this is exactly the same hand including reference to a banana although interestingly they switch from dear dave to dear wog in the newest effort.  now this all seems rather strange but can be easily hand-waved as the writings of a deranged and obnoxious member of the public.  no one could possibly suspect that lammy himself would write these notes Or could they?  Another buddy of mine and a fellow YouTuber, Discordia, has managed to find this shot of David Lammy writing on a whiteboard in 2005 with Janet Street Porter.  Let's take a closer look.  Now that T looks interesting, doesn't it?  I've pulled out the first T in in each of the two letters.  First, there's this one, and here's the second, and here's Lammy's on the whiteboard.  And here they all are in a row.  You will note the same diagonal slope.  Now it would be nice to find a bigger sample and look what I found.  Now unfortunately Lamy was not writing in all caps on this occasion but we do have a W and we do have a D so let's go closer.  Because there's a bit of a perspective issue on the angle that the photo was taken let's straighten it up a bit.  I've picked out the W as follows.  Here is the W from the note and here is the W from the original note and if we put them all together you can see how the first U in the W is narrower than the second.  The W on the whiteboard is leaning right and the other two are leaning left but this could be because the perspective is still a little bit off or just because as I know from teaching writing on a whiteboard is a little bit different from writing on paper.  But I would say and I think you'd agree that all three of these look like they're from the same hand.  Let's look at the D. Now one mitigating factor here is that on the whiteboard Lamy was signing his name.  So this D is likely from his signature and if he's anything like me you don't quite do your signature in the same way that you write normally.  However, if you look closer, there is... So let's look at all three of these Ds here.  You'll notice that the bottom lip of all of them overshoot.  He's clearly drawn the line of the D first, and then the curve, and in every single case, the bottom lip overshoots.  over hits.  So I would say that this is a distinctive feature of this person's handwriting.  So let's go over the evidence.  Lammy, a politician who makes his name talking about racism, just so happens to receive a racist note which mentions Ann Widdegum by name and this note just so happens to be written by someone with identical handwriting as the person who wrote to him back in May 2018.  And this person also happens to have a capital T that looks a lot like David Lammy's own capital T with the distinctive diagonal cross, a very similar W with a narrow first U and a very similar D where the bottom lip overhangs, so to speak.  Well, anyway, I'll leave you make your own mind up, dear viewer.  But something smells very fishy to me.  Now get out. ",
