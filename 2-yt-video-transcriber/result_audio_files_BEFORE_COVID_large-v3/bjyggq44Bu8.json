            "text": "All right, thank you.  Good up, y'all.  There's a call about this lady flipping out, yelling, and throwing trash cans.  Looks like the cop is pulling up right now.  We've got security guards pointing her out to the cops.  We've got a security guard over here following her.  They just said no crime, so we'll see if they actually stop her.  Oh, shit.  Now she's throwing rocks in the street.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to get you in the car.  No, I'm not going to do it.  Stop laughing at her behind her back.  I don't know if they just requested Kurt.  I give a hell of a million fuckers.  Talk about fanlessness.  10 minutes.  10 minutes.  10 minutes.  I don't have patience.  No way I don't have patience.  You know I don't have patience.  You know I don't have patience.  You know I don't have patience.  You know I don't have patience.  You know I don't have patience.  Just whoever she threw a trash can at doesn't want to press charges.  Cops said they're going to evaluate her for a 5150.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  I need you guys.  No!  No!  No!  Please don't!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Jack!  Jack!  Jack!  This is exactly what she needs, huh?  Jack!  Jack!  Jack!  So she's not under arrest.  She needs to go to the hospital.  Stop it!  Hey.  They're requesting a body wrap.  Why are they just letting her fucking do it?  She allegedly threw a trash can at somebody and was throwing rocks into the street.  They said there was no crime.  They said the person who had the trash can thrown at them didn't want to press charges.  Said she's not under arrest, but she needs to go to the hospital.  So they cuffed her, now she's banging her head on the car, and they're requesting a body wrap.  And hurt still hasn't showed up.  Just because she's screaming don't mean she's on drugs, man.  People go through mental crisis all the time.  Stop assuming.  That's as bad as this cop laughing at her behind her back.  You don't know what she's going through right now.  Don't!  don't you stop fucking smiling and prevent her from banging her head against the fucking car man?  show some respect.  she's going through hell obviously and you're just making it worse.  that's officer kenny.  He's talking shit about his own officer's response.  He just asked where the rap was.  He said the station's right across the street.  I could have walked there and got it and came back.  There you go.  Damn, he fucking rolled up.  Now the sadomasochism begins.  City wants a spit sock, too.  City wants a spit sock.  Oh, my God!  Get down!  Get down!  Get down!  I am done now, bro.  Hey, lay down, bro.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit.  Sit.  Roll over.  I need power.  Roll over.  I need power.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  It'll stop her from banging her head.  It'll also stop her from breathing.  Nothing.  Cops escalating shit for no reason.  Hey, my God!  I'm evil!  I'm evil!  It's my fucking death!  It's my fucking death!  It's my fucking death!  They need to strap her to a gurney and take her to the hospital rather than make it worse by putting this shit on her.  She wasn't acting out until they told her they were going to take her in and cuffed her.  I'm going to get her!  I'm going to get her!  Get out of my house!  Get out of my house!  Get out of my house!  Come on, man, get your hands off of him.  I ain't got a job to do!  No!  I ain't got a job!  Suck your mouth out of me!  I ain't got a job!  No, no, no.  No, no, no!  Nope, no EMT and no psychiatric emergency response team.  Just a bunch of sadomasochists in their fetish vids.  Yeah!  I've got some stuff that I've got done!  I've got some stuff that I've got done!  I've got some stuff that I've got done!  Show some respect man.  You don't need to be laughing at her behind her back, dude.  How professional is that?  You too, man.  What if that was your mother?  What if that was your sister or your daughter?  ... ... Thank you. ",
