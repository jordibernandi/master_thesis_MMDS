            "text": "Forgive me, brothers.  It has been over a week since I have last ranted.  So.  Let's get into this.  Normally, I don't mention other people in a rant or a video.  And I have been trying to stay away from the, what I call the purple pill brigade that is going in on other dudes or warring with other dudes over the favor of women.  So instead of getting triggered by it or listening to it and getting triggered by it, I just don't listen to it anymore.  Every now and then you peek your head in, listen to something.  If it's not to feel like it, you pull your head out and close the door.  That's what I do best for my sanity.  But a sub of mine sent me a link to a Mixler.  So if you know who's on Mixler, I don't have to tell you who it is.  And the particular show was about Passport Brothers divesting from black women in the United States.  Okay.  So when I caught it, it was towards the end of the, I guess, the stream.  And the brothers were going back and forth and puffing their chest and beating their chest about who can do what and going to war with brothers, which is what this is not supposed to be.  Who's best at doing whatever, right?  This is not supposed to be a competition.  It's supposed to be a discussion turned into a competition.  And this thing about 50-50 versus 100% versus whatever, which on its surface, I don't have a problem with whatever mix of whatever it is that you have to do to fund or facilitate your relationship.  or your lifestyle whatever the way it is that you want to do whatever it is that you do.  okay i have no problem with it.  and brothers we're talking about if you you know you want to facilitate a lifestyle you want to facilitate certain behavior that you have to pay 100 of her bills okay I pay for that.  If you're facilitating compliance for that female to get her to act in a certain way, and that is the cost of the price that you have to pay to get her to act in a certain way or behave in a certain way that is conducive to your mission or your purpose or whatever it is, the agenda that you have for her, for her, your relationship.  I have no issue with it.  I really don't.  I have an issue with it.  But what I do have an issue with is when dudes say that if you don't pay 100% of her bills or a bigger mix of her bills, she's not going to respect you.  That's the issue that I have with this.  And that's the issue that I have with the 50-50 or the 100% or whatever it is.  I don't have an issue with you buying her compliance because if it's necessary for your agenda that she comply with your wishes to get to wherever you want to get to, whether it's business, whether it's raising a family, whether it's sex on a regular basis or whatever kind of sex you want on a regular basis, if she's going to comply, if you give her a certain amount of things, that's okay.  I understand that.  I am black pill, you know, probably black pill, probably either borderline black pill or black pill.  I don't know which one it is.  I agree with you paying or funding or doing what you need to do to facilitate whatever agenda that it is that you have.  It's called a tactic.  It's called a process that's logical.  That's the way the world works.  It happens all the time.  That's called power.  Three forms of power.  Force, money, persuasion.  Put it on the street.  Put it in a red pill form.  Physicality or protection.  Resources or game.  Persuasion is your game.  You should be fluent with all three, as Ron says.  Should be fluent with all three.  Ron would say it.  Kevin would say it.  Warren B would say it.  You should have all three.  Perfect game is having all three.  If you have perfect game, then you will get her respect.  She will give you her respect.  People have to give you respect.  OK, if you're buying her respect, she's not giving it to you.  You're getting her compliance.  You're getting her cooperation just like an employee.  If you have to buy her respect, there's no difference than you going out and buying a whore.  There's no difference than you going out and tricking.  acculturated prostitution, as Warren B, who was my favorite pimp, would tell you.  If she's not going to break herself, you do not have her respect.  You don't have her love.  You have her compliance.  Even the red pill gurus would tell you that respects come from you being a man and you holding yourself as a man and you comporting yourself as what men do.  That's called respect.  That's how come a street dude with no money can get her respect because you have mastered gains.  There's three levels of power.  Three types of power.  Let's put it that way.  Three types of power.  Force, physicality, wealth, which is resources to whatever your ability of your class can attain.  And persuasion, which is game.  Need all three.  Holding frame or demonstrating frame is just simply game.  It's persuasion.  Persuading her psychologically or unconsciously to give you respect, see you in a certain light, see you in a certain way.  Kevin does the same thing.  Kevin does this a different way.  Kevin demonstrates you the conscious stuff, which is the suits, which is the shoes, which is the sense and all that kind of stuff.  Kevin doesn't tell you the underlying unconscious stuff that goes on in the background.  That's what image is about.  97% of image is unconscious.  But Kevin's a master.  He doesn't tell you that because you wouldn't understand in the first place.  Maybe one day me and Kevin will get together and we'll talk about the unconscious part of image.  why things work the way they work.  Good salesmen know about image and the unconscious part of selling people certain things.  That's a horse for a different day.  You cannot buy her respect.  You can buy her compliance.  You can buy her cooperation.  You can't buy her respect.  That's why a rich wife will cheat with the pool boy and hold her husband in underlying contempt.  because you cannot buy her respect and you hear the little giggles behind your back when they get with their girls.  you got your chest puffed out because you paying 100 of her bills and and you the man in your eyes and you know that's.  hey as they say boo dude if that's you go do you.  if that's what makes you feel that you're the man and that's your idea of being respected then do you.  Whatever you believe and it gets you up the next morning and makes you feel happy and gets you through your day or your life, hey, do you.  But buy and respect that you should get from her before you spend $1.  You should have mutual respect from her before you spend $1.  If you don't have it, you shouldn't even spend $1 on that woman.  There should be a mutual respect.  If it's a relationship, you should have respect for that woman before she even takes her clothes off.  There's a lot of guys... really want to be wanted for them.  what you leave with your money you're going to want me because i'm going to be more dependable.  a more dependable utility for you than the next dude and the guy slinging dick.  you're just a utility too.  don't get it twisted.  don't get it twisted.  if you sling if you're slinging penis You're a utility too.  Just like your side chick is a utility to you.  She's there for a purpose just like you are.  Don't get it twisted.  She don't love you no more than she loved the dude that's slinging her money.  That's why Rahm talks about being the complete dude.  Being the complete man.  Holding your frame as a man.  Being interested in your own right.  All my life, ever since I have been, hell, 10 years old, and I came up as a poor kid, I got respect from girls and women just because of me.  And if they didn't respect me because of me, they didn't get dollar one.  I didn't go out of my way to prove to them that I need to be respected.  Because at the end of the day, if I didn't get respect from them, it's not because of the money that I spent or that I'm facilitating their lifestyle.  It's because of me.  I needed to be improved.  And the same thing, when I got in my 20s and lifted weights and I had the 21 inch arms and I had the little 28 inch waist and I had the 44, 46 inch chest, they wanted me for my body.  They didn't respect me because they didn't know me to respect me.  They respect the person.  Once they got to know you, they respect the person.  When you get respect, they respect the person.  whether you have money or not.  And I've had women that have made more money than me.  That's something C Boogie said.  You being a man, and you holding your frame as a man, gets you respect of the women that were willing to respect you.  If they don't, man, bounce them.  It has nothing to do with money.  So I'm getting tired of that.  100% versus 50% versus 0% or whatever it is.  I'm so sick of hearing it.  And I'm so sick of guys in the brotherhood, or the manosphere as we call it, that's supposed to be supporting brothers, beating other brothers over the head, trying to prove that you're better than the next dude.  There's a lot of reasons.  people have more money than the next person.  Lots of reasons.  It has nothing to do with you being a damn man.  Wealth is a matter of more luck than it is anything else.  You got to be in the right place at the right time, talk to the right person, learn the right thing, have the right parents, get into the right situation.  There's some dudes that were born on the right spot, the right place, and make a hell of a lot of money, but they're no more a man than the dude that on the corner pushing bottle caps.  Sometimes I have more respect for the dude on the corner collecting cans, trying to make his way for the next day to eat and hold his freaking head up in defiance of the world even when he ain't got no money.  Because he's going to get spit on every day.  And he got to hold his frame.  Like there's brothers out there enjoying a beer, man.  And he got two nickels to rub together.  And he got two nickels.  Does that mean he's not a man?  No.  Is he down on his luck?  Yes.  And I have no clue what he had to go through to get to where he is.  Could he have just given up?  Possibly.  Could he have gotten destroyed by the system?  Possibly.  Could he have made a mistake and gone to prison and they dumped him out in this society, in this freaking society?  Possibly.  I don't know.  When do we as black people have the luxury of looking down on anybody?  That's what I don't get.  I understand that we have to push people up.  That we have to hold people to a certain standard.  so that our group of men can actually rise.  Holding people to a standard does not mean looking down on them or reaching out your hand to help their brother up.  Elevating yourself as a man does not mean you step on the next one.  If you got to step on the next man to get where you get, then you probably don't deserve the spot because the journey is internal, not external.  The journey to manhood is not how much pussy that you can acquire or money that you can acquire.  A billion dollars doesn't make you a better man.  Now, being a better man, can they get you a billion dollars?  Possibly, if you're lucky enough.  Two kind of billionaires.  And I'll give you an example.  Bill Gates was born into a wealthy family that had a hell of a lot of influence.  And I'm not saying that Bill Gates didn't earn everything he got.  He did.  But he was born in a wealthy family that could give him access to certain things.  Now, he was clever enough and lucky enough to maneuver his way to get to the point where he's a billionaire.  I ain't got no problem with him.  The other kind of billionaire is Elon Musk.  Elon Musk is born in a foreign country, happens to be a brilliant dude.  couldn't get anywhere where he was at.  so he got on.  he got on a freaking plane flew to the united states slept on couches and by grit and determination and brilliance he got to be a billionaire to where he is.  those are two different kinds of people.  in my mind elon musk is the better man.  is he richer?  no bill gates is richer.  money does not equal manhood.  i have never heard elon musk step on.  anybody was beneath them.  now if you're competing in an avenue if you're competing man to man and you want to get the best of the next dude to an equal competitor fine i. i get that we're trying to step on dudes because they have a chick that you don't have instead of trying to figure out what what is the quality that they had to get them that woman in the first place?  No, I get that black women, especially black women, have issues.  I get that.  Now, if you want to take black women to task for their behavior, I'd be the last person to even go.  get at you about holding black women to task or to account for their behavior, especially with the rhetoric that they give black men.  We're using female rhetoric to beat up on your brothers?  Come on.  I can't rock with that.  I can't ride with that.  You should be with me because that nigga's a buster.  That's dirty macking.  That's dirty macking all day long.  But Eddie Murphy or Jay-Z walks into a club, they want to be around Jay-Z because that's Jay-Z.  He ain't got to spend a dollar.  Eddie Murphy ain't got to spend a dollar.  Denzel ain't got to spend a dollar.  Magic Johnson doesn't have to spend a dollar.  Most dudes that spend money like that, that's because that's their reputation.  It has nothing to do with the woman.  It has to do with his reputation and how he's seen by the public.  He wants to be seen a certain way by his peers, by the public, by the people that are around him.  Money facilitates that.  Being generous facilitates that because he wants to be known as a generous person.  He works out, learns how to fight because he wants to be known as a person that you don't want to mess with.  He learns the subtle art of persuasion because he wants to be known as a well-rounded guy, a guy that can actually use his words, that's intelligent, that can use his intellect, that he's charismatic.  Charisma is persuasion, which is the bottom line.  Persuasion is where the respect comes from.  But that goes into being a man, to be a particular entity that we call a man, a black man, a white man, whatever it is.  That's called holding frame as a man, holding frame as a society, holding frame as a people, holding frame as a nation.  What do you think those aircraft carriers are for?  And the banks and the technology.  That's the United States holding frame on a global scale.  And the money facilitates that.  Money is a facilitator.  You can't buy people's respect.  You don't earn people's respect by buying their respect.  You have to do other things other than just spending money, other than paying 100% of bills.  Anybody can do that.  Pick a chick that's poor.  You pay 100% of her bills.  She's going to get compliance because she needs to survive.  And she'll put her head down and shut up because she needs to survive.  That's not going to get you respect.  Being dependable gets you respect.  Being there for her gets you respect.  Being loving gets you respect.  Being able to get her an orgasm is part of getting her respect.  All that stuff is inclusive.  You can give her an orgasm where she's shaking on the bed, turn around, treat her like shit.  You're not going to get her respect.  You get her addicted, she can call you an asshole and not like you.  But when she gets horny, she's going to call you because that's what she needs, like a drug dealer.  Nobody respects a drug dealer.  Being a whole person gets you respect.  Not beating up on the next dude, puffing your chest out, saying that you're better than this dude because you make more money.  Now, I've seen very wealthy women that didn't like that.  I've seen very wealthy guys that are humble.  And I'm talking about dudes that have hundreds of millions of dollars that are humble.  Robert Smith does not leave that.  he's a billionaire, okay?  He doesn't use his billions to earn his respect.  His deeds and who he is as a man is why he's respected.  Not because he paid off the debts for a bunch of school kids.  That's part of it.  But who he is as a man and what he does as a man is why he's respected amongst his peers who are also billionaires, amongst his people.  And we have guys that some dudes only make six figures.  Beating their chest, said I'm better than the next dude.  Come on, man.  Come on, man.  Knock that shit off.  Anyway, that's all the rant I have for today.  There's other stuff to do, and I'm just ticked.  I'm not pissed.  Just irked.  Not irritated.  So with that, I'm going to jump off here.  This is GGS out, and I will see you guys on the next one.  Peace. ",
