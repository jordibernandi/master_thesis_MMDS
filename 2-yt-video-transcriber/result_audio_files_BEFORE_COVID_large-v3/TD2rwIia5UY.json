So one of the questions to Bill Pristip, the top FBI official, about their investigation, because as I said earlier, the court wants to know, are there other emails out there that can be searched?  And one way they figured it out is to say, well, ask the FBI where exactly did they look in their effort to reconstruct the emails that she deleted or tried to hide.  And so we asked them, where did you look?  And I'm kind of paraphrasing.  The interrogatories are very legalistic or full of legalese.  But I've fairly characterized them.
