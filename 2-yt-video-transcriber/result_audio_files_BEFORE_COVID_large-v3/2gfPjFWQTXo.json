            "text": "We'll talk about the death of Jeffrey Epstein.  I think it's one of these scandals that highlights the concerns Americans have about the rule of law here in the United States, about the Justice Department, about equal treatment under the law, about the idea of a two-tier justice system, and whether or not the government can be trusted to investigate itself.  Now, Jeffrey Epstein, several years ago, was convicted in, I think, state court in Florida of sex crimes.  As part of that plea deal he agreed to, Florida, at least the U.S.  attorney in Florida, Mr.  Acosta, who used to be Labor Secretary under President Trump, agreed he wouldn't be subject to any federal crimes stemming from those crimes.  So basically everything was supposed to be clear.  Now, a lot of people have looked at that plea deal and thought it was too light and that it was a slap on the wrist.  And I'm not in a position to argue that.  But it was a plea deal.  And he spent time in jail under very lax conditions.  But he was convicted.  He had an agreement.  The feds blessed it.  And then More information about his victims has come out because they've gotten older and braver because they are older and have discussed the allegations in more detail.  The Justice Department's been embarrassed by the way it handled it.  And now Jeffrey Epstein, of course, has been tied to a whole host of political figures tangentially to President Trump, really nothing there.  But more closely to Bill Clinton, he is a funder and founder, according to Epstein's own people, of the Clinton Global Initiative, which is the Clinton Foundation.  Clinton's been on his planes two dozen times. ",
