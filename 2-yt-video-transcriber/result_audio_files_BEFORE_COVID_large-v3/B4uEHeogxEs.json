Right now, let's focus on the opening line of Genesis, Genesis 1-1.  It is far more profound and meaningful than most modern readers realize.  It says in Genesis 1-1, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.  and this is a profound claim.  You see it doesn't say universe but that's because in the Hebrew there's no word for universe there.  What they do is they use the phrase heavens and earth to talk about the universe.  So the subject is the whole of a whole of creation all of the universe and it says something about it.  two things right that it had a beginning point that the universe had a beginning point and that God is the one that brought it into existence at that beginning point.  So let's not miss the profound implications of Genesis 1-1.  The universe, according. ",
