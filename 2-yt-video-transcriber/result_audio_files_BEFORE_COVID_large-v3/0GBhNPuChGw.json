            "text": "Fellow service members, veterans, know that your selflessness, your dedication, and your commitment will never be forgotten.  Hillary Clinton called Tulsi Gabbard, quote, the favorite of the Russians.  She's the favorite of the Russians.  She's also a Russian asset.  Our troops and veterans' willingness to sacrifice everything cannot be taken lightly.  It must be honored.  She's the favorite of the Russians.  She uses this language that feels straight out of kind of the Kremlin.  Our government should be of the people, by the people, and for the people.  A weird Kremlin-y view that she has of the world.  Freedom is not free.  I just think that she could be a useful idiot to the Russians.  We must stand united against those in both parties who never tire of war.  It gives the Russians exactly what they want.  To build that brighter future with peace.  She's endorsed by, you know, by sort of the Russians.  David Duke.  She's never renounced the... russian support.  there have been about 20 russian websites that have supported her since she's announced her her run for the presidency.  tulsi gabbard we've seen russia propaganda proper up.  tulsi gabbard's my girl.  i'm voting for her.  the way she talks about regime change wars is exactly the same way that russia talks about them.  i will end these regime change wars and instead invest actually into serving the needs of the american people.  thank you.  there is no question that tulsi gabbard is a puppet for the russian government.  i was a marine in uh.  Vietnam.  And I agree with Tulsi Gabbard.  These regime change wars are just, they're just wrong.  For Russia, what she says is perfect for what they want Americans to hear.  That we're all connected as Americans, united by the founding principles enshrined in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights.  So whether or not Tulsi Gabbard is aware of this, whether or not she's even completely Has complete knowledge of what's happening.  The Russians are propping her up.  My name's Chris from Mississippi.  I believe Tulsi will do all she can to heal our divides here at home.  She wants to work on us first and help this country and help everyone unite together.  Supporting Tulsi Gabbard primarily for her selfless dedication to the country.  What Hillary Clinton is trying to say is the Russians are at their dirty work.  I'm a veteran, and I see Tulsi as honorable, trustworthy.  I'm a Marine veteran.  I served in Iraq.  I agree with Tulsi.  As a veteran myself, she will not treat my brothers and sisters as equipment, numbers on a board.  This is personal to me because I served in Iraq where I served in a medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war.  Oh, look, a useful idiot.  The Kremlin may be focused on Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.  I'm a U.S.  Army veteran and I want Tulsi for president to end these atrocious wars.  Please wake up.  I'm a U.S.  Army veteran, and I support Tulsi.  She clearly cares about the American people.  While her opponents are serving as platitudes, she's serving us in the National Guard.  I am a former U.S.  soldier, and I am unapologetically a supporter of Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.  I had over 10 years in the Army.  I salute Tulsi Gabbard.  I joined the Navy back in 1977, and I support Tulsi Gabbard.  No Democrat really likes her.  She's the candidate I have been waiting for as a Democrat.  Stop calling your fellow Americans Russian.  We don't want any more wars.  We understand if there's a war and it happens and we have to fight, but at the same time, we don't need to create them.  Good night and good luck. ",
