            "text": "Hey guys, it's your old pal Scenable here, so today we'll-.  Are you filming this in your fireplace as opposed to your set?  Mention that.  See, if you follow me on Twitter, which you probably should, it's at I am Scenable.  Yup, I just self-remoted myself.  Am I ashamed of it?  I probably should be, but I'm not.  Do I regret it?  Nope, but I probably should.  So, if you follow me on Twitter, you already know, but I'll explain anyways.  So I am filming in the fireplace as opposed to my set because I am majorly updating my set and I thought it would be very weird to be filming in the set while I'm commencing these updates and commissioning new things to be added to the set.  So for the next few weeks you'll have to deal with me filming in my fireplace.  So when should the new set be up?  I would imagine that the new set should be up by November, so I'm sure that the first video that I film in November will be in the new set.  Okay, so what's this new video gonna be about?  Well, Benga, this video is gonna be about the absolutely absurd and nonsensical things that people actually believed in the Middle E- in the medieval era.  Okay, cool.  So to start off, people in the medieval era actually believed that drinking mercury was a cure-all.  And while as absurd as that is because of how dangerous mercury is to consume or just use in general, Drinking mercury is the only explanation, is the only plausible explanation I can think of as to why anyone on earth would support Donald Trump.  And yes, okay chemistry bros, I know that while mercury is dangerous, it has a low chance of causing brain damage.  It's just a funny joke, and I thought that this was an opportunity to make a funny joke, okay?  God, take some Xanax, dude.  Now, believing that mercury was a cure-all was not the only absolutely absurd thing that people believed back then when it came to medicine.  They also believed that eating mummies and drinking urine served as a cure-all, and that in order to cure hemorrhoids, you'd have to, and I am not making this up, shove a red hot poker up your anus.  Some deviant doctors... Please, Banga, I don't even think that Jeffrey Epstein would have enjoyed that.  Thirdly, people in the medieval era actually believed that sneezing was your soul attempting to leave your body.  Which, you know, considering the kind of person I am, I'm not surprised that I sneeze a lot.  Well, I sneezed like once in my entire life, so I think my solo was successful.  You know, thinking about that actually explains quite a lot.  So, fourthly, people in the medieval era, and I'm not making this up, believed that worms could just create trash and dirt out of nowhere.  So, you know, if you're ever feeling like you're dumb, or just not intelligent in general, Just pull up one of these internet lists, like on Buzzfeed or whatever, talking about the crazy things that people believed in the Middle Ages, and you will literally feel like Einstein, Nietzsche, and Freud combined.  Finally, what would a video about crazy things that people believed in the medieval era be without antisemitism?  about crazy things that people believed in the middle ages just without mentioning their anti-semitic beliefs.  I'm just going to ignore that because that's questioning me and I don't like when people question me.  So in the middle ages and to an unfortunate lesser extent today people, at least gentiles, believed that Jews And I've said this a lot in this video, but still, I'm not making this up, would kill Christian children around Passover and use their blood, the Christian children's blood, to make matzo bread.  And there are still some lunatics like Andrew Anglin who still believe this to this day.  Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this video.  Have a nice weekend.  And again, if you ever get an F on a test or whatever, just go to BuzzFeed.com and look up insane things people believed in the Middle Ages.  You'll feel so much smarter by comparison. ",
