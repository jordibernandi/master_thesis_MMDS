            "text": "Black Ram 313 back at it again.  You know why?  It's because this is therapeutic, man.  Back again with another video, hence another therapy session.  Today's topic is who is Peaches and Nene or the Peaches and Nene debate.  Before I begin, let me first give a shout out to Brainstream Media for coming up with this topic and coining the phrase Peaches and Nay Nay.  Check out his videos.  He has a three part series entitled Peaches and Nay Nay.  Link in the description box to his channel.  So who is Peaches and Nay Nay?  Peaches and Nene are the fee fail equivalent to Pookie and Ray Ray.  I see Peaches as Pookie and Nene as Ray Ray and vice versa.  They're counterparts.  So we have Ray Ray, Pookie and Thuggo and we have Peaches and Nene.  And to quote the Book of Aphoronomy, based upon one of the live streams that I did entitled The Pookie and Ray Ray Debate My Take, he stated that Pookie, Ray Ray and Thuggo were different types of guys from the hood.  And to quote BOA, he says, Ray Ray is the D-boy, Pookie is the fiend, and Thuggo is the banger.  And I agree and concur with Dr.  BOA.  So having said that, let's get into the personality of who Peaches is.  Again, Peaches is Pookie's counterpart.  You recognize her when you walk down the street with the blonde, sometimes red, sometimes blue hair, or at least some streaks.  She's the first to twerk.  when a song comes on that she likes, no matter where she is.  She could be in church, she could be in the middle of the street, she could be in school, she could be on the job, no matter where, she gotta let you know, hey, that's my song, and begin to twerk.  That is the personality of Peaches.  She's quick to argue, fuss, and fight, Even when she's older, she's the mom up at the high school fighting besides her daughter.  She never matures, right?  And most of her appearances can be documented on Worldstar.  She's often the loudest in the room.  Very hood.  In fact, she puts the H in hood.  Now, she mostly dates Thuggo and Pookie.  She's the one who will go if she thinks you're a little bit cute.  The only requirement then is five fried chicken wings with fries plus mild sauce.  Some broccoli slash 420 and some cognac and she's yours.  Peaches has tattoos everywhere.  She has earrings galore.  And she wears the most outrageous outfits too.  She has hundreds of distasteful pictures taken by the photo man at the lounge, often with her middle finger up and her tongue sticking out.  And she has more than one baby daddy too.  You recognize her.  You see her everywhere in the urban community settings, if you know what I mean.  She's quick to give you a piece of her mind.  Quick to want to fuss and fight.  Peaches.  Argue, cuss, drink and fight.  Her vocabulary is on a first grade level.  Her use of grammar is atrocious.  Her etiquette is lacking no manners.  You know her.  It's peaches.  Now move it along to Nene.  Now, usually Nene is a stuck up pretty girl who only dates ballers.  She believes that Pookie and Peaches are beneath her.  In her mind, if a guy isn't known for having that bread, for having that paper, if his cars aren't exotic, if the guy ain't in VIP at the club with the bottles.  Because he can't afford it.  Then she is not interested.  That's Nene.  Nene is always dressed up to the nines.  She got the expensive shoes, the latest shoes.  She wears the thigh high black boots and sometimes red.  And she looks good too.  She has a super long lace front.  And she has the good makeup, not the cheap makeup.  She doesn't buy her makeup at the local Walmart.  Now in her mind, she is prettier and better than all the other females in her neighborhood.  In her mind, she's the dime.  Now she has multiple baby daddies too.  And Peaches and Nene, they both have the high body counts.  Now they both also wear the hair extensions, but Nene's hair is always done versus Peaches is always a month or two past due for her hairdo.  Now the main difference when it comes to Peaches and Nene, when it comes to guys that they date is that Peaches now is gonna keep it hood.  She ain't leaving.  The hood that is.  And she only wants a grimy dude, even when she's older.  Even when Pookie starts using the D and or C, she is still down.  She just becomes more crafty in hiding her five, tens and twenties from Pookie when he starts using.  When it comes to Nene, as she gets older, she wants Rere to change or settle down but wants him still to be a baller, which is nearly impossible.  She tells Ray Ray that he should invest in a business, become an entrepreneur, but she still expects the same amount of success in the corporate world or in the business world as he had in the urban community as an entrepreneur.  Nae Nae is super materialistic, superficial, and quite arrogant.  She's the one wearing the clothes and driving the car that Rere bought her.  She will accept nothing less and she's the first to save.  Boy back.  You ain't got enough money to talk to me.  She's basically the trophy girlfriend for the D-Boy.  So again, in comparison, oftentimes she's prettier than Peaches, speaking of Nae Nae, better dressed, better makeup, better hairdo, and she expects better of a man in that same area in which Peaches lives in.  She wants the top of the top where Peaches is happy and will go for a pookie.  Nae Nae only wants.  Ray Ray.  And Ray Ray gotta be a baller.  And her statement is.  He gotta be a baller girl.  No money.  No honey.  So comparing.  Peaches and Nay Nay.  To Pookie and Ray Ray.  There is no real debate or argument.  Now it is said that the BW, the succubi educated or not, that she prefers hooky and Ray Ray.  I don't see the same thing here for the guys.  I don't believe that most guys prefer, per se, peaches and or nene.  Because for most of us, a beautiful woman is desired, period.  And secondly, the thinking man is going to stay as far away from peaches and nene as humanly possible.  Because their masculine persona and dysfunctional behavior makes her so very unattractive.  Also, peaches and nene are not attracted usually to the thinking man.  But the simp, now that's another story.  Understand that the simp is always desired when it comes time to clean up a woman's life.  But the sump is quickly cast away when all the cleaning is done.  So again, I don't think that peaches and nay-nay are that desired, at least by the thinking man.  And the sump will take anything and anyone that will give them the time of day.  So my question for you, the audience, what are your experiences with peaches and nay-nay?  Growing up in high school and college, did you want Peaches and Nene?  And are there any examples in the movies of Peaches and Nene?  Is Cookie from Empire, is she Peaches or Nene?  What was Taraji in Baby Boy?  Was she Peaches or Nene?  What are the characters on power?  The fee fails.  What are they?  Peaches and nays?  Let me know in the comment section.
