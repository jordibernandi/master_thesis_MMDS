            "text": "Okay, so my question is, I took this course in college a few years back on, it was like religious studies, and I grew up in a Christian family and everything, and I always went to church, and my faith was never questioned.  I just kind of believed what I believed because that's who I was surrounded by and everything.  And then in college, I had this teacher, and she asked this question pretty much over the whole course.  The difference between... Jesus' miracles and magic, and, like, what's the difference?  Because with magic, you have to speak into spells.  I'm a Christian, so just to get that out.  I'm not, like, a witch or anything.  So, like, in magic, you have to, like, speak out the spells and stuff for them to happen.  And then Jesus, there was proof that he was doing the same thing in the Bible and stuff.  And then she was just trying to get, like, what's the difference?  And that's, like, a, like, I kind of forgot that question, but it's something I've been battling.  Like, how can you, i guess tell like i know that jesus miracles are real and stuff and that like the witchy stuff is like demonic?  but how do you prove that i guess to someone who i guess doesn't believe in jesus like how can you show them the difference between like why this one's real and why this one's like um fabricated?

            "text": "well satanic signs are real.  satanic signs can be done by a super normal power satan right that can deceive people But they're done to take people away from the truth, not to direct people to the truth.  And the one thing that we know Satan can't do is he doesn't have the power over life.  There's something in Revelation where he says he reanimates the beast, but he doesn't resurrect the beast.  So if Satan had the power over life and death, then we wouldn't know if the resurrection came from God or Satan.  It could be a deceptive resurrection rather than the true resurrection.  And some of the ways we know this, for example, when Moses and Aaron were dealing with the Egyptian magicians in the Exodus story, they would mimic some of the things Moses did, but when it got to life, even the magician said, this is the hand of God, we can't do this.  So we know that the miracles that Jesus does are miracles that are showing He's the Messiah.  If you look at Jesus's life, there are four miraculous categories that Jesus actually achieves miracles in.  First of all, He's sinless.  While not technically a miracle, it is when you think about us, because we're not sinless, right?  Secondly, Jesus has power over nature.  He can calm the storm, for example.  Thirdly, Jesus has power over sickness.  He can heal people.  And fourthly, Jesus has power over death.  He can raise people from the dead.  If you think about it, those are the four problems we have here on earth.  We're sinners, we have natural disasters that can hurt us, we have sickness that can hurt us, and we have death that ultimately takes our life away.  Jesus says He's the Messiah by doing miracles in those four categories.  They're not random.  Jesus' miracles aren't random.  They're there designed to show people that He can right what's wrong with the universe.  He can take paradise, which we lost in Genesis, and He can make it regained in Revelation.  That's ultimately what Jesus is going to do.  He's going to overcome sin.  He's going to overcome natural disasters, sickness, and death.  What Satan and the satanic signs are doing are all hocus-pocus kind of things that don't deal in those areas. ",

But for natural disasters and stuff, I've heard stories of how witches would either cast something, send something somewhere, and then it would end up affecting that environment or whatever.  And then also how Jesus turned water into wine.  And then there's witches that can make different potions or whatever. ",
