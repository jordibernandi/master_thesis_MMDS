            "text": "hello and welcome back to no bullshit.  today we return to talking about one of the biggest creators on the youtube platform pewdiepie who's getting into hot water in the public again recently and you'll never believe the reason why this time pewdiepie also known as felix well he's in the news again because he recently got married to his longtime girlfriend and sweetheart the very hot and very impressive martzia pie.  this might not seem controversial at first glance either but If you read between the lines and see how people are reacting to this story out there, you'll see there's actually a lot of negative feedback to it.  First of all, Pewds has been a controversial character in the public for a while now, but not really for good reasons.  Basically, many social justice warriors and leftists have tried to come after the guy.  mostly out of jealousy and spite.  Again, Felix is the biggest creator on YouTube, and one of the biggest names on the internet as well.  And since he is his own man who refuses to kowtow to the left-wingers and their politically correct politics, well, this has prompted the SJWs and the mainstream media to come after him in any way that they can.  And Adding to that, of course, PewDiePie is not only a white male, he's also straight and happily married now.  Combine all this together and he's the epitome of what the left hates in current year.  They, of course, favor minorities, gays, and trans people, and anyone who will kiss their ass and support their liberal politics as well.  And since Pewds won't do that, and he's also popular and white, and living in a quaint, conservative, friendly, monogamous relationship with his hot wife, who is also white, well, I guess I think you can see why the SGWs despise him so much.  So this is the kind of stuff that's led to PewDiePie being attacked by the media, who's trying to take him down for wrong think and having the wrong lifestyle and skin color.  And they've done all the usual things with Felix here too, calling him a racist, saying his influence is dangerous, and even attacking him for having the wrong guests on his show, like when he had Ben Shapiro on.  And now with his new wedding in the news this week, many leftists have taken this opportunity to mock and name call the guy, instead of just being happy he got married to the love of his life like everyone else.  Or at the very least, they could just do the right thing and stand down and say nothing for a little while.  Calling someone out on their wedding day used to be something that was frowned upon, but that's exactly what's been happening this week to PewDiePie.  It's really sad to see too that so many news articles have decided to dedicate more time to PewDiePie's controversies than to the actual wedding itself.  And really, this just proves why the mainstream media is hated so much these days.  Maybe it's time they go back to writing about how white men manspreading is the biggest issue in America because bashing an innocent and well-liked YouTube content creator on his wedding day is not a very good look.  For example, here's an article from People about the wedding.  It's called Controversial YouTuber.  PewDiePie Marries Former Beauty Vlogger Martzia Bizonin with the subtitle saying, Felix Kellberg's online career has been mired with controversy and scandal.  Seriously?  There was a hundred different ways they could have went with this, but people thought it was really appropriate to start off by calling the guy controversial?  What a joke.  Then they double down saying his career has been mired with controversy and scandal.  Talk about being dramatic.  Please.  First of all, PewDiePie is not actually very controversial at all.  The guy runs a pretty family-friendly channel for kids and teenagers.  Sure, they've caught him cursing and slipping up once or twice on live streams, but that would hardly make the guy a controversial YouTuber for life.  Come on, PewDiePie makes videos playing games like Minecraft and other scary ones.  And sure, he's got some opinions and even some political takes in his videos sometimes, but he's hardly controversial at all.  Really, the only reason he's gotten controversial is for the reasons I went over earlier.  It's like a non-troversial controversial.  And it's because he's the most popular YouTuber, and since he's white and straight and refuses to go pro-SJW, the left keeps concocting fake news stories about the guy, trying to slander him.  And they've also tried to take down his channel and career completely because of this stuff.  Last year, for example, the Wall Street Journal even did a hit piece on PewDiePie.  And now we're seeing the same kind of tactics used by people.  So with that said, this new article better have some pretty good controversies and scandals listed here in order to justify this horrendous title.  Let's go ahead and read on and see where this thing goes.  Controversial YouTuber Felix Kjellberg is married.  The Swedish gamer who goes by the name PewDiePieOnline married his longtime girlfriend, former beauty vlogger Marzia Bizonin.  On Monday, he announced on Twitter, We are married.  He wrote alongside several pictures from ceremony.  I'm the happiest I can be.  I'm so lucky to share my life with this amazing woman.  The YouTube stars tied the knot in a private London ceremony surrounded by friends and family.  Well, that's a pretty good start, actually.  At least for PewDiePie.  People Magazine, on the other hand, is about to flip out on the guy for no reason.  But it's worth noting that there was really nothing political or controversial about his wedding at all.  And I feel the same way about Felix himself, but many disagree with him specifically.  Certainly, you can say without a doubt that this wedding did nothing wrong.  There's not even anything political at all here.  We're not seeing any MAGA hats or bad speeches or political hot takes that were coming from the event.  All we're really seeing is two young, good-looking, successful YouTubers getting married.  and making a lifelong bond with the ones they love.  Their only crime is being popular and not being PC enough while they do it.  Not to mention, according to the left, they've committed the crimes of being straight, white, and not promiscuous.  Three traits that are exactly the opposite of what the liberals stand for now in 2019.  I'm so thankful for all the people that made me attend the event and helped us celebrate our marriage, she continued.  I feel like I'm the luckiest person and I'm so full of love.  Incredibly ecstatic to be able to call Felix my husband for the rest of our lives.  While Kelberg29 has over 99 million subscribers, making him the most followed individual on YouTube, his online career has been mired with controversy and scandal.  He came under fire early in 2017 when he posted a video that featured two men, whom he hired for the stunt, holding up a sign that read, Death to all Jews.  Well, that video sounds pretty hilarious.  And being good at comedy is why PewDiePie is so popular here in the first place.  People Magazine is now basically joke policing the guy, saying he shouldn't have made this kind of joke.  clearly.  But what they don't understand is, if Felix actually listened to them and was politically correct, like how many of these journalists seem to want him to be, well, then PewDiePie wouldn't be as popular as he is.  And he might not even be famous in the first place.  Basically, the mainstream media is clutching their pearls at a joke on the internet, and they're then implying that said jokester should not be doing what he's doing, and he should stop doing what made him popular and rich in the first place.  This is basically akin to going up to a baseball player and telling them not to swing it outside pitches, because it offends the complainer's SJW newspaper and fans.  But let's say this baseball player they're talking to hits a lot of home runs by swinging at those outside pitches.  And we all know that newspaper criticizing him.  Well, they know nothing about the game, actually.  So why would the player listen to their advice and outrage anyway?  And well, People Magazine has just as much a right to criticize comedy as they do baseball.  And that's to say, they have no right to do it at all.  Sure, this death to Jews joke was a bit edgy, but that's why it's so funny.  PewDiePie wanted to see if he could actually hire these guys online to hold up a sign saying something extreme like that.  But at no point did anyone watching his show, nor did anyone on YouTube, actually think that Pewds wanted that statement to become true.  People Magazine is suggesting he does, though.  Even though they won't outright say it, there's some implication here that PewDiePie really wants all Jews to die, which is absolutely outrageous.  That's a scandalous thing to suggest in this situation, but not surprising, unfortunately, considering the left's track record.  I know me myself.  I've seen left-wingers do this constantly to me and others over the years.  And personally, my channel and online presence is only a very small fraction of what PewDiePie's is.  So I can't even imagine what the guy is really dealing with.  I have a small idea, though.  The people taking my jokes seriously in order to try and slam me are usually just small, no-name YouTubers.  or SJW losers on Twitter.  But shit, PewDiePie has big names coming after him.  Major news sites like the Wall Street Journal and People Magazine are taking PewDiePie's jokes out of context and pretending they were said seriously when they obviously weren't.  And I think we all know the real reason the left has to resort to this kind of bullshit too.  It's because this is all the ammo they have to attack us, which really says a lot.  It's not like we've been caught doing really bad things like, say, cheating on our wives or stealing money from a charity.  We're not getting arrested or even just saying things that are actually offensive.  And because they have nothing really bad to pin on us, that's why, as a last-ditch effort, dishonest liberals resort to digging up old joke quotes.  and pretending they are serious statements the creators said and stand by in the present.  And then to make matters even worse, a simple follow-up or quoted tweet on Twitter could clear all these things up easily.  People Magazine could have simply said, Hey, Felix, do you really want to kill all these people?  PewDiePie would obviously say no, and then, well, that whole story's over.  But that's not how things really play out at all.  Let me tell you from my own experience.  Really, what happens is radical leftists will make an article like this, like the one in People, with really over-the-top language and implications too.  That or, for my situation, it would usually be an overly long response video made about myself, which contains out-of-context clips from old streams that were years ago and weren't to be taken seriously and were on shitty channels that no one really watches.  But whether it's a People article or some anime avatar-led response video on YouTube, well, the format still plays out about the same way.  Eventually, when I or Felix respond to these people, usually with a simple comment saying, we're of course not racist and not advocating for bad things, but instead of acknowledging that, the journalist or responders, they do an interesting thing.  They double down and insist, no sir, you are wrong.  You're wrong about yourself and what you say or think.  The SJWs say, hey, we are the tone police here and we're telling you what you think about what you said.  And this is why many like to mock left-wingers and call them mind readers these days.  It's because even when you defend yourself and tell them how you really feel, they still insist they know more about you and what you think than you do.  It's kind of crazy.  And they say you're a racist for something you said a long time ago as a joke, and they won't let you explain yourself or even have a change of mind.  No, the mind reading SJWs won't even let you speak for yourself anymore.  Because if they're convinced you're racist, they'll make up a way to make it so, even when you're really not.  In the end, after a few days, I still can't believe people are using PewDiePie's wedding and the fact that he's trending as an opportunity to claim that he is racist, anti-Semitic, a bigot, or white supremacist even.  They're just doing it for attention, clearly, but their baseless claims are still harmful, off-base, and just plain wrong.  Here's a few more examples from Twitter, so you can really see how bad this thing gets.  The first tweet comes from Carol, saying, This is a nice day for a white supremacist wedding.  Or, as I think it should be read, in the style of the hit Billy Idol song, It's a nice day for a white supremacist wedding.  Not actually the worst joke ever either, but let's remember two things.  First, there's no actual proof out there that PewDiePie is a white supremacist at all.  Because of course there's no proof, because it's not true.  Secondly, this racist claim against Pewds is being thrown at him on his actual wedding day.  A low blow from lowbrow people who will lie and make shit up to try and make their opponents look bad.  Here's the next tweet, and be warned, it's a lot more vulgar.  Here's what Ruby said minus all the swearing, since if I said this tweet verbatim, I would probably get banned for life.  It reads, Well, this certainly sounds like a sane and well-rounded individual.  And I don't know why liberals always have to get so vile and vulgar either, but they almost always do.  Because they're trashy and classless, I suppose.  And we've already debunked this white supremacy claim time and time again.  We've shown it's never been something PewDiePie has said or even associated with.  In fact, to a greater extent, we've gone over white supremacy extensively on this channel, saying how it's just a baseless claim and usually made up.  It's like how liberals call everyone racist for no reason.  So too do they use this claim in other situations.  But as I said time and time again, have you guys ever actually met a white supremacist?  Have you ever seen or heard of one in your town?  I can't even find one online without searching far and wide.  Surely there would be accounts all over the place if this was a really relevant trend.  We would see screen names, tweets, videos, and websites promoting this kind of stuff all the time.  If it was a really relevant issue and group that actually threatened our world.  Like what the left implies and sometimes says outright.  But the truth is, there are none of those people out there.  And it's not a real threat or issue.  Really, they just call people white supremacists all the time simply for being white skinned themselves.  And possibly also not being politically correct or pro-social justice warrior enough for their liking.  What do you guys think?  Is PewDiePie a pro-white racist?  Or is the left just making shit up about him again?  Because they're jealous that PewDiePie is white, rich, and happily married now.  Comment your thoughts on everything below.
