            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel.  So first things first, it would be a mistake for me not to mention my gratitude for for the support on my last video, which last time I checked is at about a million views.  That does not happen every day on my channel, so I wanted to say thank you for all the support.  and hello to everyone who's new on the channel now.  i was hoping that my next video after that one would be you know not as disturbing but unfortunately i guess i'm on just a kind of dark streak of content right now.  so let's just get into it.  i felt really compelled to talk about this.  so i came across this article.  britain's first transgender family reveals that their son age five age five age five is also transitioning.  See, when you do clownery, the clown comes back to bite.  This is the dad, Greg Rogers, who is a trans man, female to male trans, and his wife, Jody.  This is their son, who is now living as their daughter at the ripe old age of five.  So apparently social services have been called to this family out of their friends and family's concern that they are forcing this upon their child, encouraging their child to be trans just because their dad is, Like, I'm even speaking as a trans person.  At five years old, I didn't want to be a boy or a girl.  I wanted to be a Power Ranger.  Now, I may have wanted to be the pink Power Ranger, but regardless, like, I wanted to be a superhero.  I didn't have this gender ideology thrust upon me.  Now, I don't think that this new gender ideology, which is growing and expanding and making new rules by the month, is something that is super healthy to be forced upon kids.  Let kids be kids.  That shouldn't be a radical concept.  For some reason, this is something that has been popping up a lot more and more lately.  these, you know, parents who are trans and then just coincidentally, out of nowhere, who would have guessed, their child at the age of five, six is as well.  I did a past video on a situation just like this where the dad is trans and then go figure, the child is too.  So you are a transgender boy, you know what that means? ",

            "text": "there are two possibilities here.  either there is a genetic link to being trans for which there is no evidence for that.  that's not something that we know to be true or this is something that is being pushed by the parent onto the child.  so let's just establish a few things.  i am trans myself.  I personally did feel gender dysphoria and, you know, the feeling of being different or something being wrong as early as five.  However, two things can be true at once.  It can also be true that it's highly suspect that all of a sudden there are all these families in the media getting all this attention because the parent is trans and so is the child.  but it is so unlikely.  i mean statistically trans people are like less than 0.1% of the population.  i hope to god these kids are genuinely trans and that this isn't something that's being forced on them.  i really really do.  but even then i take issue with kids, you know, transitioning that young.  i think that it just... i bring my stance very clear on that one.  and then you have this new breed of parents who are raising babies aka non-binary babies.  I can't believe.  that's something I actually said out loud.  Non-binary babies.  Has life really dwindled down to this? ",

            "text": "especially because there have been so many studies that show that gender roles are actually conducive to a healthy environment for a child.  they're actually good for most children.  now of course there's always going to be a subset of the population and of children who don't naturally fall into the sort of hardline gender role that they're expected to fall into, And I definitely do not support treating that child badly or, you know, forcing something upon them.  But that's just that you're forcing non-binary onto children by rejecting that so hard.  Just because a certain set of the population does not thrive under gender roles does not justify tearing the whole thing down.  Does that make sense?  Now make no mistake, transgender people and kids who experience gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder at a very young age have existed forever.  There is a long historical context for those types of things.  What there isn't a long historical context for is parents and children transitioning together at the same time.  And call me crazy, this is just my speculation, my conspiracy, allegedly.  I think in the coming years, when some of these children come of age, and have a voice for their own beyond their parents speaking to the media about them, you're going to find that a lot of them actually have this pushed onto them.  All of them, no.  Some of them, probably.  I don't feel it's even a kid's place to be learning about the intricacies of sexuality and gender and gender identity and what being trans is.  I don't think that there should be these channels like Queer Kid Stuff that gets put on TED Talks and platforms to teach three and four year olds about what it is to transition.  I don't like it.  And what does it mean to be trans? ",

A gender transition is when a trans or non-binary person does something so their gender identity matches their gender presentation.  I can tell that she smells.

Teach your kids that it's okay to be themselves and they will figure it out for themselves.  in the end they will.  they always will.  all right guys.  that is all i have for today.  definitely leave a comment down below.  i will be in the comment section.  definitely consider being a member to this channel.  it helps me out immensely and allows me to continue creating content.  subscribe if you haven't hit that bell and i'll see you in the next video.  bye guys.
