            "text": "Well, it is a special day indeed, as I am joined now by the divine Miss T, our Lord and Savior, King of the Jews.  Am I leaving anything out?  Brilliant, great.  Don't push it.  Donald Trump, you have had a busy few days.  G7 meetings, ongoing trade wars with China.  Bedbugs.  Fake news.  Let's see, you also sent out a controversial tweet saying that you are the king of Israel and told a group of reporters that you are the chosen one.  How you doing?  You okay?  The news about me is largely phony.  Mr.  Not my president, you're acting quite bizarre.  Ruling like a loon behind your Twitter avatar.  Of all your recent antics, this latest one's a pearl.  Now it seems you think you're God.  Okay.  Whatever, girl.  Your crazy's on full display.  Wish you'd just go away.  Take a vacay, hun.  I hear that Greenland's nice this time of year.  Dreaming of walls while the stock market falls.  And now you're shaming the news.  You say you're the chosen one and I know what you mean.  Chosen by the Russian Kremlin in 2016 When will this maniacal messiah complex pass?  I hereby order you to get your head out of your ass And just keep selling us lies and attacking allies.  Go on, you king of fake news.  It's fake news.  It's disgusting fake news.  I read a front page story in the Washington Post.  You're making no sense, bitch.  Why are you still talking?  It's making me nauseous.  Everything you say is bullshit.  Yes, everything's lies.  I don't think anybody's done more than me.  Close your mouth, close your mouth And delete all your socials.  tonight.  The president has said he is the king of the Jews, the second coming of God, the chosen one.  He's not really interested in helping mankind.  When it comes to Bible study, he's way behind.  He can't walk on water or give sight to the blind But he can change a falsehood to a fact with his mind.  When they crucify him in the news he starts trippin' And he kinda speaks in tongues when his dentures start slippin'.  Jeto Christ, Jeto Christ.  He's like if Jesus were pumpkin spice.  Jeto Christ Stupid czar, mad tangerine-colored commissar.  Wow, he prefers profanity to biblical psalms.  But he can stop a hurricane with nuclear bombs.  He's praised by his disciples, though they've all been misled.  And somehow he brought Mitch McConnell back from the dead.  Ew.  He golfs on Sundays, so at church he's not in attendance.  And he makes 25 seem like the Christmas of amendments.  He calls himself the second coming.  Oy, what a dunce.  Girl.  But according to these porn stars, he could not even come once.  Don't you get it wrong.  Don't you get it wrong.  Don't you get it wrong.  Don't you get it wrong now.  Give him what he wants now.  Give him what he wants.  Don't get it wrong.  Don't get it wrong.  Cheeto Christ.  Cheeto Christ.  He's like if Jesus were pumpkin spice.  Cheeto Christ, stupid czar.  Black tangerine colored pop star.  I think I'm doing a great job.  Don't you get it wrong.  Don't you get it wrong.  Let me hear you sing now.  Don't get it wrong.  Cheeto Christ, stupid czar.  Who in the hell do you think you are?  God, clearly. ",
