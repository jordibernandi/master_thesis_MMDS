First of all, Grace, you wrote a fabulous article, we might be able to get it up, for the New Statesman about the Preston model, about what Labour should be doing on the ground if they want to boost their vote shares, if they want to take control of local government without relying on national trends, I suppose.  So what have they been doing in Preston?  What have they been doing right? ",

They've just had this massive turnaround after it was, I think, 2011, a couple of years after the financial crisis.  They had Preston was obviously it was not doing very well economically on a whole load of other social indicators.  And they were putting all their eggs in this basket of this big shopping centre opening.  um and a load of kind of companies were getting in on this and it was going to be huge.  we're going to be one of the biggest shopping malls like in the UK and um but eventually one of the uh parts of the consortium one of the companies in the consortium pulled out and it all collapsed.  so they were like you know shit.  what are we going to do?  um Matthew Brown comes along and says look we need to try this new model.  we need to look over the Atlantic look towards Cleveland which had obviously been suffering from um kind of decades of post-industrial decline and been rescued by a kind of local movement, really, supported by the local government and the Democracy Collaborative, which is a kind of US think and do tank.

            "text": "I've been in the US with them for a while and so that's how they would describe themselves.  they like come up with policy and then try and do it on the ground and the model in the UK is CLEZ the Centre for Molecular Economic Strategies that supported Preston to do the same thing.  So yeah, in Cleveland, they built this idea of community wealth building, which is essentially based on the idea that you attempt to kind of embed local capital by using the combined economic weight of what they call anchor institutions, so institutions that can't move, universities, public services like the NHS, local government, education, et cetera.  get them to come together to use their procurement budgets in order to prioritise local companies, get them to prioritise corporations that are unionised, that may be co-operatives, and bring that together with a load of other strategies aimed at boosting democratic, mutual, co-operative, collective ownership locally, and also doing things like setting up local banks.  Generally, any intervention that's aimed at, yeah, as I said, kind of embedding capital in the local community.  So they did this in Cleveland and they had amazing results.  They set up a load of cooperatives that are still going to this day.  They were really successful in using those procurement budgets to keep to kind of boost the local economy.  And in Preston, they followed that model as well and just had a massive turnaround.  They were rated the most improved council, I think it was last year, and they've succeeded in massively increasing the amount of budget that's spent by all those institutions within Lancashire on the one hand and then within Preston on the other.  And that's, you know, pushed up, obviously, economic outcomes and social outcomes across the board.  And it's kind of a reaction against this... This very like neoliberal model of running a council, which is based on the idea that, you know, you should be outsourcing services, providing them as cheaply as possible and shrinking down the council, which can come to act as a kind of mediator between private interests rather than a provider of services itself.  And the kind of the classic idea of that is like Barnet, which came up with this idea of one council where capital was just kind of brought in to run everything.  And, you know, according to kind of the traditional neoclassical economic thinking on this, where these corporations are and who runs them shouldn't matter.  It's all about doing things as cheaply as possible.  So there's more capital to go around for everyone.  But of course, a lot of these corporations are run out of, you know, by what they're owned by kind of investors in the city.  They pay, you know, we saw like with Carillion there.  highly indebted, they treat their workers badly, they treat their suppliers badly, they pay out huge dividends, and they're just generally kind of mechanisms for extraction, both from the public sector itself and from local communities.  And it was, yeah, kind of a pushback against that.  to say, just because we're living under austerity doesn't mean that this is the only way forward for councils, that they have to do this model of kind of outsourcing that's screwed over so many parts of the country.  And it is really exciting.  I mean, I'm actually writing this week about the limits of that.  So the fact that this is a really exciting new model that Labour Council should be taking up and that the leadership should be encouraging, but it's not enough without much more funding, without much greater devolution, actually, that's a big part of it, without kind of making local government powerful again, which is also about kind of improving democratic accountability locally and making people feel closer to the state.
