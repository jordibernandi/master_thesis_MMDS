You know, people are seeing these things as disconnected.  Outrageification of our politics, teen addiction to mental health issues, social isolation.  But these are all connected because they're all part of the business model of extracting human attention, the race to the bottom of the brainstem.  And that systematically leads to this connected system of downgrading humans.  While we're upgrading the machines, we're downgrading humans.  Talk about changing times.  Even as some American communities are bucking the trend towards stores that don't take cash, Mark Phillips tells us there's already a country that hardly uses it at all. ",

And Pope Francis has written a letter, The Human Community, which emphasizes the urgent need to study the relationship between humans and emerging technology.  Professor Ishiguro says his vision of one day abandoning our current human form is several thousand years away.  Still, many here have doubts about this brave new world.  This dream is a terrible dream.  It is impossible to unify algorithms and love, algorithms and artists.  Algorithm and a little bit of crazy is part of us.  I prefer our limits to our really cold perfection.  We're upgrading the machines.  We're downgrading humans, downgrading our attention spans, downgrading our mental health, downgrading our democracy and our civility because the business model says that outrage works better.  Because outrage works on that part of the brain where you release all the norms and social filters and all that.  It's really your animal brain.  Exactly.  So first we go into your animal brain to get your attention, but then to go deeper, we have to get hundreds of millions of people addicted to getting attention from other people.  So this is how you get the teen issues with mental health, where you have teenage girls who are addicted to getting attention from other people, the number of likes they have.  And it's, I think, two and a half times self-harm and depression issues for teen girls between 10 to 14 years old.  But as a former Google person, don't the companies know they're doing that?  The tech companies know they're doing that, Tristan.  I think that they don't like to admit that the business model of our stock price is directly anchored to.  how many minutes from your mind that I can get from you.

He says for more than a decade, we've been techno-maximalists, seeking out any app or service that provides us a benefit, no matter the cost.  If we go back, let's say, to the iPhone, iPhone is like having your life in your pocket.  The original idea there was to fold.  One, to integrate an iPod into a phone so you didn't have to carry around two devices.  And two, to make both of those experiences better.  Steve Jobs was not thinking about a future in which we would constantly be looking down.  That actually came later and for purposes that didn't necessarily have our best interest in mind.  The social media companies in particular innovated.  What they thought about is how do we get people to compulsively look at the screen?  Newport says the online experience was re-engineered to exploit the psychological behavior known as intermittent reinforcement, a technique popularized by casinos.  If you're getting social approval indicators sometimes, and then sometimes you hit on this app and they're not there, there's no new likes, your brain says we have to keep checking.  There could be more next time.  This is exactly the effect you get pulling the slot machine lever.  And I'm doing this not because I want attention or selling a book or anything like that.  This is because it's an urgent existential issue.  If we don't tackle these issues, we're going to destroy our common ground.  We can't agree on facts.  If we can't agree on facts, you can't do anything.  And the loss of civility is downgrading, as you say, of humans.  It ultimately affects our democracy.

Now the Chinese are also ranked, given a mark out of a possible 950 points.  A score in the 700s is considered good.  Around the 500 mark is not.  For now, the number is a sort of bank credit rating, keeping track of everyone's spending habits.  But in an effort to keep all of its subjects in line, Beijing is taking the system a step further in 2020.  It's aggregating data gathered by banks, private companies and the state to rate if someone's a good or bad citizen.  The state will go over every detail of a person's life with a fine-tooth comb.  The financial situation, spending habits, career, even behavior on social media.  Criticizing the government online or displaying outward signs of wealth is a no-no.  On the other hand, raising the party or giving blood increases your social credit.  Xiaowen Wang is a model citizen.  She lives in Nanjing, a testing ground for social ranking.  In theory, everything can be taken into account in the social school, even the most innocuous errands like supermarket shopping.  When Xiaowen Wang makes an electronic payment, her purchases tell the state a lot about her.  For Xiaowen Wang, there are perks to be had, such as paying half price for the bus. ",
