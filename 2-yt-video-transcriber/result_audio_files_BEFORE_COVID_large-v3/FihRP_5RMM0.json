Now, if the gold moves a little bit, that's all right, because the gold's actually slightly diamagnetic, which means it's going to repel a magnet ever so slightly.  So if it moves just a little bit, that's okay.  but it should not attract to the magnet in any way, shape, or form.  Now, every now and again, you'll see the clasps do have some steel or some metal inside of them, so generally speaking, those clasps will stick.  If you notice, I'm purposefully going over the clasps so you can see what that looks like.  But for the most part, these guys should not stick to a magnet in any way, shape, or form.  Now, when we get to the fake stuff, it's pretty obvious what happens.  Again, the fake stuff... just doesn't. ",
