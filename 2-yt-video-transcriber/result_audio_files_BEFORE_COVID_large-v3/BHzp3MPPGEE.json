The New York Times recently reported Trump ordered then-Chief of Staff John Kelly to grant Kushner the clearance, despite the judgment of intelligence officials.  Then-White House counsel Don McGahn had also argued Kushner should not have been granted access to top-secret documents.  Kushner failed to report over 100 foreign contacts on his initial application for clearance, which was denied by the FBI after a background check into his financial history and contacts with foreign investors.  Kushner later revised his application three times and was ultimately granted permanent security clearance last May. ",

Well, a new book uncovers details about how Jared Kushner has continued to let the financial dealings of his family impact the policy decisions he promotes overseas.  In one case, this almost led to a war in the Middle East between Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  We're joined now by investigative reporter Vicki Ward, author of Kushner,  Inc.,  Greed, Ambition, Corruption, the extraordinary story of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.  Vicki, welcome back to Democracy Now!  VICKI WARD.  Thank you, Amy.  I mean, it may sound a little odd to talk about the senior adviser to President Trump, Jared Kushner, and how he almost started a war in the Middle East by asking you about a New York City skyscraper, a New York City building, 666 Fifth Avenue.

            "text": "You're exactly right to make the connection.  So, the Kushners have this albatross around them.  In the book, I sort of think of 666 Fifth Avenue as like the Maltese Falcon.  It's just always there.  And sort of all roads, when it comes to Jared's policymaking, lead back to this money pit, this disastrous investment, where a loan of $1.4 billion is coming due in February of 2019.  And no American lender will touch it with a 50-foot pole, which means the Kushners need foreign investment.  You know, tricky when it's a family business and the son is now senior adviser to the president.  The Qataris told the Kushners in the spring of 2017, when Jared was already in government, Charlie Kushner asked for over a billion dollars.  They turned Charlie Kushner, Jared's father, down.  Bearing that in mind, Jared has a new best friend in the Middle East who also has money, MBS, the future crown prince\u2014he wasn't crown prince yet\u2014of Saudi Arabia.  And these two form a bond that really alarms Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and James Matthews, the secretary of defense, because Jared and MBS cut out all the national security officials who should be looped in onto their communications, cut out everyone in the State Department.  You know, these are systems we've had in place to protect our security and our government for decades.  And Rex Tillerson, who was very experienced in the region\u2014 The former secretary of state.  The former secretary of state, but before that, remember, he ran Exxon, knew a bit about MBS's sort of brutal track record and was really concerned about this.  Jared sees an opportunity for money, for investment in MBS and for subsidizing his peace plan.  So he pushes the president to make the United States' first official visit overseas not to a country with shared democratic values, such as Britain or France.  but to the United\u2014sorry, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where they have this summit.  that is supposed to be all about cooperation in the region.  Ten days later or thereabouts, Rex Tillerson and James Mattis are mining at a conference in Australia.  To their astonishment, they learn that instead of cooperating, the Saudis have led a group of Middle Eastern countries to blockade Qatar, where America has an air base.  That is our security in the region.  They had no prior knowledge of this.  Tillerson immediately knew that the green light\u2014Saudis would never have done this without support from the White House\u2014it came from Jared.  And what MBS wanted was to\u2014he actually wanted to invade Qatar.  It was worse than that, because he wanted the Qataris' resources, which is why when he\u2014eventually, actually, when he couldn't get hold of those, that's what actually then leads him to round up six of the seven ruling branches of the Saudi royal family later in November.  You know, it's all about money.  Rex Tillerson said to Jared Kushner, Have you noticed that the only branch\u2014there are seven ruling houses in Saudi Arabia.  The only branch that MBS has not rounded up is its own.  Don't you think it's statistically unlikely that they're not corrupt, too?  Jared didn't want to know.  He didn't want to know when Tillerson told him how dangerous this was.  And actually, what Jared did was\u2014 what MBS wanted him to do, which was fire Rex Tillerson.  But there's an ironic twist to this tale.  In the spring of 2018, MBS arrives in Washington, and the president asks him for $4 billion to help rebuilding Syria.  And MBS says, I don't have that kind of money.  This atrocious war in Yemen has cost the Saudis a lot, and oil prices fell.  Well, Trump and Jared listened.  The Qataris then arrived in Washington.  And, you know, strategically, they offered Trump and Jared\u2014they said, we've got plenty of money for whatever you want to do, but you need to end this support of this blockade.  So, what happens is that the\u2014at exactly the sort of same time period, 666 Fifth Avenue.  The question is, trouble building.  gets an extraordinary deal that makes absolutely no sense.  A Canadian firm, whose second-largest investor is the Qatari Investment Authority, says it's going to lease this building.  that someone who's been involved in it said would be worth more valuable if it was just a pile of dirt.  They're going to pay $1.3 billion, a 99-year lease, and they're going to pay all that lease upfront.  I mean, this is a deal that stinks.  So, I mean, quite\u2014you know, it seems hard.  At the same time, the U.S.  changes its policy towards the blockade on Qatar.  I mean, Congress is now, quite rightly, investigating this. ",
