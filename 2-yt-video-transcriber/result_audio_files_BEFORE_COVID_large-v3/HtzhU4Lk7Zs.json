            "text": "So something unprecedented is happening at the two thousand and nineteen Bilderberg meeting.  well that's the fact that still no one knows where it's going to happen and it was not announced.  usually at this time we know where it's going to happen.  the topics are going to be discussed the attendees that are going there in this year.  it looks like the the globalists are uh laying low and that's one way of saying it.  but of course we're going to discuss this plus a lot more and this issue is a very important one because you know a lot of people you know when it comes to this specific topic.  if you even talk about this issue you get slandered you get attacked you get called a conspiracy theorist.  we're gonna forego any of the theories out there.  We're going to stick to the facts here because it's important to understand that, yes, there's elite power groups out there.  They do exist.  Members of these groups even acknowledge and talk about it, but you even talk about that.  You're deemed a horrible human being, a crazy conspiracy theorist, but There's actual important issues to discuss with Bilderberg.  that, by the way, Jason, in 2016, they specifically discussed a proposed Internet ID.  They were talking about regulating, censoring and controlling the Internet for years and years now.  But specifically in 2016, they were even talking about allowing Facebook, YouTube and Twitter to use online passports to revoke posting permissions if it violates a quote term of agreement.  Now we're seeing a slurry of people being banned left and right, mostly anti-establishment figures because of broad ranging generalized terms and services that are not even stated.  But we're seeing the usurping of free speech online, which is important.  And again, this is something to worry about.  One of the other topics that they talked about is the, quote, post-truth world, where, of course, online censorship, Internet controlling speech is the actual issue here that was discussed by many important world figures.  We're talking about the heads of intelligence agencies, the heads of state, kings and queens meeting with individuals from Goldman Sachs.  Lockheed Martin, Boeing, military industrial complex companies, and other titans from Amazon and Facebook and Google sitting down together in secret with predominantly mainstream media, acquiescence, usually silence, usually not even daring to mention that this meeting is happening.  The mainstream media is talking about it like it was something crazy.  150 around the most influential intellectuals, powerful people in the world meeting together.  Jason?  Yeah.  Who cares, right?

OK, this is where literally police officers surrounding me and said, leave the city of Dresden now or we're going to beat you up and lock you up for whatever reason we want.  They stormed and investigated and interrogated our hotel room.  They barged into our hotel room, started searching us illegally, violating our rights in Germany.  So this happened in June of 2016.  They were talking about purging people on social media before these major purges were implemented.  And this is just one of the many circumstances surrounding this group that should be directly questioned.  Sorry, go ahead, Jason. ",

I'm probably butchering his name.  He was the chairman for many years, still involved in the Bilderberg Group.  He openly admitted in 2009 that after decades of the group trying to bring the European Union into fruition, it was they who brought the euro, the euro.  the currency used throughout Europe into fruition, a globalist currency, a move to a more unified, unilateral currency.  These are realities.  However, right now there is a concerted effort to attack people like Nigel Farage, okay?  who I may not agree with all the time. ",

They're saying that's what this really means.  These conspiracy theories means he hates the Jews and the Jews are behind everything.  They were not able to piece together one clip of him saying that.  And of course, with all of the negative press about Alex Jones out there recently, what did they do?  They took a bunch of his interviews with Alex Jones.  They cut them up.  And I got to tell you, I watched it.  It's a huge nothing burger.  And you know that I go to the Guardian quite a bit because, hey, let's be honest, the Guardian was the first one to let Charlie Skelton start reporting fairly on the Bilderberg group.

There is pure conflict of interest here.  And again, what Nigel Farage is saying is not a conspiracy theory.  There's members that actually come out.  like Dave and Jan and brag about this.  Now, there's an important underlining aspect here that I believe has actually been brought into some kind of perspective by Neil Ferguson.  Now, Jason, you found this clip, you played it, you made a whole video on your own about this, but he's talking about how, yeah, elite power groups do exist.  He specifically talked about, well, maybe it's not just about the New World Order, but it's about people coming together, and washing each other's hands, patting each other on the back and helping each other out with, of course, concerted interests that they have, mutual interests.  I mean, it makes sense that people conspire together for their own benefit.  And then the media is going to tell you, you think people are conspiring together to help each other out?  You crazy conspiracy doers, how dare you be?  So racist.  And I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.  Why are we being attacked for even questioning this or even just talking about it?  And again, if you've been watching our coverage, it's been very pragmatic.  It's been like, hey, this meeting's happening here.  Let's go talk to the individuals.  We talk to them.  You're like, let's give it.  We do everything in our power.  uh every year we're gonna be there.  this year we don't know where it is but i'm gonna be there.  uh i'm setting my intentions.  i'm i'm gonna you know make sure i have off i'm gonna be traveling.  uh if we can't find i'm gonna be going to different hotels knocking on the door.  i don't care i'm gonna find this thing.  uh but we go there and and we we talk to individuals we try to get comments.  um and there is an aspect of this that a lot of people play up to seem more powerful to see more elite which we also document and talk about.

Luke, his latest book is called The Tower and the Square from Facebook.  I'm sorry, from the Freemasons to Facebook talking about secretive organizations.  Now, again, he spins it, for instance, for the most part that they are doing good work, at least in the instances that he's seen.  And he refutes that he's ever been to a Bilderberg meeting where the New World Order was on the table or part of the speaking venue.  But after last year, Luke, when we saw the Daily Mail actually somewhat infiltrate the Bilderberg Group for the very first time ever.  For people that don't know that story, check it out.  She was able to get into a dining hall as a worker.  Didn't get a lot of information.  I think that they are very hesitant now.  with all the turmoil going on in France, the yellow vest movement, to, number one, announce where they're going to be, and number two, even hold it in Europe.  after last year they were infiltrated in Turin, Italy, even with all that security that you witnessed.  And now with the turmoil, I really think that's why we're not seeing this.  I wouldn't be surprised if this stuff doesn't leak out or come out into the public about a week beforehand.

Yeah, I'm going regardless.  But yeah, I mean, your donations are more important than ever.  There's a lot of speculation.  There's a lot of theories out there.  Some people are pointing to the fact that last year, Bilderberg talked about Saudi Arabia and Iran, that there might be something boiling up here.  There may be some kind of big event.  We haven't been able to confirm that with any evidence that is not just substantiated.  We can't substantiate it, so we're not going to kind of expose any of those theories on that.

And my last point to make here is with the Logan act actually making its way into mainline American political discourse now with not only Michael Flynn, but the president of the United States, Donald Trump talking about possibly using it against John Kerry.  The question has to be asked, why are we not using it against the American political leaders that attend this meeting?  It is an obvious violation of meeting with foreign powers and colluding with them outside of our government.  That is the truth.  And I really hope that more people make that point.  However, Luke, other than us and a handful of others, no one is talking about Bilderberg 2019 and certainly not the largest name in alternative media.  And that's why, guys, you are more important than ever.  Just like Luke said, without your support, without your donations, how the hell are we even going to cover this this year?
