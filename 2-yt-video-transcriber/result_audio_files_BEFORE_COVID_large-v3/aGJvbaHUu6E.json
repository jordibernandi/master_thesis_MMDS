First of all, he's probably already been, depending on the agency, been told about his rights.  This is an internal investigation.  Your failure to cooperate can count in termination.  You're required to be here.  This is not normally a volunteer.  Cops don't normally volunteer to go in these.  Some cops do, but normally they're told they have to go in.  to these situations and you have to answer questions and you have to cooperate and if you don't you'll be fired.  so this is considered a coerced investigation.  uh it won't be used against him criminally.  not what he says in here because he doesn't have a choice.

I think they might have misspoke.  I bet you they, 106 of his cases total.  I doubt if he just has 176 pending.  You know what we have found?  You like to file resisting arrest.  He's been a cop for 13 years.  Miss Commander that has all the, that has all the, is that her?  Yeah, that chair looks a little small.  Anyway, Miss Commander who's been promoted because she's top notch is going to tell him that we found over 13 years that you like to file resisting arrest.  Really?  You couldn't get that clue in 13, it took you 13 years to get that clue?  This is government failure.  Government always comes in after the fact and says, if we only had more money, if we only had more people, if we only had more taxes so we could buy more stuff.  It's never our fault.  It's never a hiring practice.  It's never a promotion practice.  It's never about lowering a standard practice.  It's always about money or blaming one person when they get caught.  Now, people are going to think I'm defending this guy.  I'm not.  What I'm doing is letting you understand the system makes him, allowed him, hired him, retained him, and promoted him to corporal, which is normally a supervisor when there's no supervisor working, and they've done all this, and now suddenly after 13 years when they get caught, suddenly Johnny on the spot, commander female, promoted for her long service of whatever, is now going to play how great government is and how sharp she is for catching this.  Really?  And you file a really inordinate more than any other officer in this police department.  And we find that a lot of these people get hurt.  Wow, you found that in 13 years?  Man, you guys are quick.  I figured it would have took most people 20, 30 years to find that out.  Really?  You see how this is being played out as government success for catching somebody, yet they hired and promoted and kept this guy, hired and promoted and kept her for 13 or more years, and now suddenly everybody's a good guy except the officer that got caught.  And I'm not protecting him, people.  Try to keep your eye on the ball.  I know it's tough.  And the ones that do are the ones that push your buttons.  That set off a trigger. ",

            "text": "How do you explain that?  Who thinks this is the only cop out there that arrests people for resisting arrest and the charges are never there?  Who thinks that other cops aren't doing the same exact thing this guy's doing and nothing happens?  Like I said, everything's okay in government until they get caught.  And then as soon as they get caught, it's because of a shortage of people.  We need more people.  It's a shortage of money.  We need more money.  We always need more government to fix what government creates.  This is what I call typical look.  All cops are taught how to justify your actions.  We're taught at an academy.  We're not taught to make it up.  We're not taught to say things that aren't true.  We're taught that when somebody resists, here's how you articulate it.  When somebody does these things, here's how you articulate it.  Resistive tension, pulling away, resisting arrest, trying to get away, reaching for my gun, things like that.  You need to be able to articulate that when it happens in order to justify your actions.  The problem is, cops learn, they're not as stupid as people think, they learn how to survive, and they suddenly repeat the company line, and they know that as long as I can say, I believe that I was in danger, The court has ruled that you have to judge my belief by other cops.  And other cops are going to believe the same thing because they're out there doing the job and they know.  Very rarely have you seen a cop get up on a stand and testify that I think the cop overreacted and I wouldn't have done it that way.  You know why?  Because when I was a use of force expert and the DA would call me on a use of force to help his case and to side with the cop, as soon as I said, I think the cop was out of control and he shouldn't have done that, the DA went, thanks for your help, I'm going to use a different expert.  And I was moved to the side and they used an expert who agreed with the guy.  And the public, nobody ever knows how many cops stand up, but they're not used and they're not asked.  and the DA doesn't tell the prosecutor.  We were going to use Rick Gore on this, but he didn't agree with the cop, and he thought the cop.  They don't tell the defense that.  They should.  Under discovery rules, they're required to tell them that, but they don't.  And so that's why you only see cops justifying what other cops do.  People think it's this big blue line.  There are some good cops out there that wouldn't play this, but guess what?  They're not going to be called by the prosecution team because we're all on a team.  You've got to be a team player.  We all work for the government.  We're on the same team.  It's us against them, those pesky citizens and government.  We have to protect our jobs.  We have to protect our pensions.  We have to protect our pay.  We have to protect us and make us look good so people won't push back and fight against us because we're the government, and those pesky taxpaying citizens is just a money source.  That's where I felt it.  That's James Palermo's being opposed.  That's not the state of Texas, people.  Well, obviously it is the state of Texas, because for 13 years, you freaking idiots didn't catch it.  You aren't monitoring.  Nobody's supervising.  Nobody's reviewing these arrests.  The DA, and this guy even says in his interview, the DA never gave me any negative feedback.  Of course not.  See, the DA can always write a report to the police chief and go, hey, this officer was out of control, and I can't prosecute this.  And that would go in the officer's jacket.  but we're on a team.  And I might need that officer in another case, so I don't want to piss him off.  And I might need the DA, so I don't want to piss him off.  So we end up not pissing each other off and playing politics.  Meanwhile, the pesky citizens become our victims, and people running around want to blame me because I'm hating on cops.  Freaking idiots out there.  Notice he says, I believe.  Why does he say that?  Because the Supreme Court has ruled that it's not what you believe, it's not what you think, it's not what the public thinks, it's not what the media thinks.  A cop's actions must be judged.  on other cops, would they do the same thing in the same situation with the same experience?  Those are the rules.  Cops know the rules.  Cops know that if I say, yeah, I just threw him to the ground because he was being a jerk, I'm going to get screwed.  But if I say, I believe he was resisting and he pulled away, and therefore I was in fear, and my belief was real, and I believe any other cop that was in that situation would do the same thing, therefore I know I'm safe.  That's the way it goes, people.  You can hate on me.  See, this guy has a great defense, and all government employees have a great defense, because government doesn't enforce the rules on government.  Then when they try to enforce it, The people's defense is, hey, nobody ever fucking told me I was doing it.  Nobody ever told me I was being a bad guy.  The DA didn't tell me.  My supervisors reviewed my reports.  They didn't tell me.  Supervisors reviewed the video.  I didn't try to hide anything.  I've been totally transparent.  I'm on video.  And nobody has ever told me I'm wrong until now.  Guess what?  That's a pretty good defense.  That's when supervisors and agencies need to be held accountable, but they never are.  You notice supervisors and agencies are never charged with negligent retention, negligent hiring, negligent failure to supervise.  They're never charged with that.  Why is that, Rick?  Well, if you can't figure it out, you're just an idiot.  Here's your sign.  There was no feedback saying.  I read the... So this isn't your fault?  This is someone else's fault?  My perception was the force.  If I was in that interview, I'd be like, as a matter of fact, it is.  I think you need to be talking to the supervisors that reviewed my reports.  They have more experience.  You obviously trust their judgment because you promoted them above me.  You have them supposed to be representing your department agency.  They read the same penal code that I did.  They saw the same evidence that I did.  You've got DAs who are prosecuting that know that penal code better than me.  And now you're telling me that it's my penal code and I'm the only one that didn't see it?  You're the commander.  How do you not know this is going on for 13 years?  You don't want me in there defending this guy.  Don't just say force.  It says force against a peace officer.  You misread obstruction.  You misread interfering.  And you misread resisting arrest.  Oh, well, gee, you're just Johnny on the spot.  It only took you 13 years to figure out that the corporal that you hired to spend a copper 13 year that you promoted to a supervisory position doesn't even know the penal code.  Congratulations.  You're a freaking superstar in government.  That's what they think.  How freaking outrageous.  I'm not defending this cop, people.  I'm just telling you, stop blaming the cops who were playing within the rules and you let the upper echelon get away with this shit and you never hold them accountable.  And you just have some sacrificial lamb cop who's been playing the game.  And suddenly, when they get caught not doing their job, they blame the guy they catch.  You are a 13-year veteran police officer of the rank of corporal Which is, many times, an acting supervisor in this police department.  And you don't understand the basic elements of three statutes in our penal code.  If I was representing this dude, I'd be, excuse me, commander.  He was promoted under your guidelines.  Obviously, you saw something in him that you wanted to promote him above other people.  You obviously have trust in him because you made him a supervisor.  And he was actually reviewing other police officers' reports and responding and making decisions as a supervisor.  And he's been working for 13 years.  And suddenly now you want to say he don't know the penal code?  Shouldn't you have known that he didn't know the penal code before you promoted him?  Shouldn't you have figured that out in 13 years?  That's what my defense would be.  I would hold these people accountable and nobody does.  They just want the sacrificial lamb.  I have to say it again because I'll have to submit it here.  You're just defending the cop.  I'm not defending this guy.  I'm attacking the system that allows, promotes, and builds these guys and allows them to run their tyranny unchecked.  until they get caught.  James, what I said was you're not going to deflect anything away from me.  You are fully responsible.  And even though you do not want to be accountable for your actions and you have not wanted to be accountable in the past for your actions, this is a situation that you're going to be held accountable for.  Really?  That's a situation.  they're going to hold him accountable?  Well, what about you not being held accountable?  What about you not supervising your department?  You're not having competent supervisors that would identify this earlier.  You didn't identify it earlier.  What about the DA who didn't identify it earlier?  What about the entire system for 13 years that promoted my client to the rank of corporal and allowed him to be a supervisor, and now you're trying to tell me, oh, we didn't know?  We didn't know.  he didn't know what the penal code is.  We didn't know he was doing this.  We didn't know he was abusing citizens.  It's not our fault.  It's his fault.  Really?  I call BS.  But that's my take.  You can call him any cop hater or cop lover.  We'll end up there. ",
