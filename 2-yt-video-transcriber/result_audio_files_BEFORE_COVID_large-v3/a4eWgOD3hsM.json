            "text": "Justin Trudeau's arrogance never ceases to amaze me.  I mean, none of us should be surprised, the guy's grown up in the lap of luxury, being a former prime minister's son.  But certain events will happen, exposing the Canadian people to just how out of touch Trudeau is with ordinary citizens.  The latest example was when the PM was in flooded Constance Bay with his two sons supposedly helping stack sandbags.  A volunteer criticized him for reportedly holding up the line while people were filling sandbags.  Here's the confrontation. ",

I'm sorry.  Well, why don't you make yourself aware?  We are going to.  You know, I was with a guy who was a staunch conservative.

Yeah, I'll listen.  Okay.  I'm glad to be here with my kids.  We just filled sandbags for 15 minutes.  But you held people up.  Sorry.  All your RCMP and security held people up for getting their stuff.  I can understand your frustration around security.  I live frustrations with security every day of my life right now.  That's something that unfortunately is the reality of my life.  But I'm happy to be here.  They're about to open these dams.  I'm happy to be here to speak with you, to listen to you, to speak with all... and to encourage more Canadians to come out and volunteer.  More people are coming to volunteer because they're drawing attention to it.  I volunteered, but I was in a rut for an hour waiting while you were here with a photo op. ",

            "text": "We're here to help.  Okay, so right away we see an assault from the woman in Trudeau's entourage as she puts her hand on the angry volunteer.  Laugh it up, but if it was the other way around and, say, Scheer's guy put his hand on a female volunteer, liberals would be going mental.  Sexist!  Abuser!  Don't put your hands on a woman!  Moving on.  When the volunteer accuses Trudeau of soaking up the rays, he's suggesting that Trudeau is using this moment of hardship as a photo op.  He's not the only one.  Take a look at these tweets from other witnesses.  People are pissed at Socks McHairdo.  Now Trudeau's executive assistant tweeted and says no trucks were blocked during the PM's visit to Constance Bay.  But as you can see from the disputed tweets, that's not the full story.  Back to the volunteer.  He then says that no one can pick up sand while Trudeau is on the ground.  Obviously, this would be frustrating if you're actually there to help the people affected by the flooding.  You're doing your best to save their homes, and here you have the elitist PM smiling, laughing it up, not really participating or caring about those on the brink of losing their property.  In my opinion, if you're a politician visiting a disaster zone, you better be ready to work.  Don't bring your kids, take it seriously, and put in an actual effort, like a few hours of real labor.  Otherwise, don't be there because it just comes off as totally arrogant.  Of course, none of this would ever occur to Trudeau.  The lack of self-awareness the PM shows is astounding, but again, not surprising.  Kudos to the volunteer to call Trudeau's photo op insincere because that's exactly what it is, given that he's holding up volunteers from doing actual work.  Trudeau then laments about his woes with his own personal security.  Uh, nice straw man, buddy.  Check out puzzled look on the volunteer's face.  I bet he's thinking, man, what an asshole this Trudeau guy is.  If the PM hadn't been there to begin with, then his personal security detail wouldn't have held up volunteers for an extended period of time, preventing them from getting the sandbags lined up before they opened the dam.  which could potentially cause more flooding to the homes.  But of course, Trudeau makes it all about him.  What an egomaniac.  It's unreal when Trudeau calls the man, quote, unfriendly and unneighborly.  I mean, really.  This guy has taken the time out of his schedule, on a weekend no less, to come and help out his fellow neighbors from losing their homes.  What a dipshit Trudeau is.  Come on, this guy is the epitome of neighborly.  And sure, he's unfriendly to Trudeau, but who cares?  He deserved it.  To insinuate this volunteer is just unfriendly.  in general, again, when he's helping his neighbors, that would make him a pretty nice guy, the opposite of what Trudeau is saying.  Hey Trudeau, how many neighbors have you helped out?  But I think the coup de gras of this confrontation is when Trudeau says, To encourage more Canadians to come out and volunteer. ",

            "text": "This perfectly explains Trudeau versus the real world.  While the PM gallivants all over the globe on taxpayer dollars, raising awareness, he doesn't take action anyway to help the cause.  Unlike the angry volunteer who is there to improve the situation through hard work and labor, we can certainly see the parallels.  when pampered, spoiled, and useless bureaucrat Trudeau doesn't get his hands dirty, but gets to tell the public what they must do to help without being affected himself.  Meanwhile, all the actual back-breaking work is done by real Canadians who aren't there for attention or the latest pretty picture.  The difference is the volunteer cares about his fellow citizens, while Trudeau's only interest is himself.  So what do you think about this situation?  Let me know in the comment section below.
