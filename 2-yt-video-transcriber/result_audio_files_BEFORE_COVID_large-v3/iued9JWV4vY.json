They're just, like, trashing their bodies every week on a Friday.  Well, yeah, it's like they don't know how to have fun if they're not drunk.  Right, right, yeah, I always think about that, like, I'm so glad I don't have to, like, rely on... Alcohol, like poison, it's poison.  It's a poison that you drink.  Like, to have a good time.  Like, I mean, we have like so much fun.  It's called intoxicated.  Yeah.  Toxic.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm too crazy sober, you know?  Like, if I had alcohol, I dread, and I'd be addicted for sure.
