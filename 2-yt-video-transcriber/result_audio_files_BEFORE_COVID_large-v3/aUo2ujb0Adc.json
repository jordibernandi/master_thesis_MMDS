They are arguing on the record that there was no\u2014that this case\u2014 should be dismissed because there is no injury and no harm created by the disclosure of people's personal credit information.  Yet I understand you, as I would, to believe that the exposure of that information, I asked you if you would give it to the committee and you understandably said no, would in fact create a harm.  So I guess I would ask you to please look carefully at what your lawyers are doing and the arguments that they are making because I feel they're inconsistent with some of the helpful testimony that you've provided today.
