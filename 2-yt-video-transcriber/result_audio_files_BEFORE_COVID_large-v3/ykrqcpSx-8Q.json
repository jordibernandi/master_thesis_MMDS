I was on my way to an audit today and I noticed this armored guard truck much different looking than what we have in California.  So here we go.  Thank you.  you Thank you.  Wow, even the armored guard carriers out here don't tell you to stop filming them.  It's like a different world out here.  I'm just out here recording, sir.  My parents told me long ago to make something of myself, so I saved up my lunch money and then I just escaped from my bedroom and now I film.  That's what I do.  Well, that was rude.  You shut the door on me.  I was explaining, sir. ",

Yeah, I just want to make sure because I couldn't hear you.  What did you say, sir?  I said that your videotaping it makes it look suspicious because we can't be on a camera.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you're on a camera, but I'm not suspicious.  I just came out to record because that's what I like to do.  Anytime when we... Everybody looks suspicious.  Everybody does.  Yeah, but you can look suspicious, but it's not illegal, sir.  No, but with the bank truck, it does.  Okay, but yeah, it's suspicious, but it's not illegal.  You don't have a peanut butter cup in there, do you, by any chance?  Because I love them, although I'm allergic to them and they break out in hives.  Are you, what are we videotaping?  I'm just out here in public videotaping.  Sir, you gotta delete whatever you're doing with our truck.  You gotta delete it off that video camera.  You cannot have it in your video camera.  Okay.  I mean, you gotta stop now.  Yeah, okay.  Otherwise, I'll call the law.  Okay.  You better call the law, sir.  Call the law.  I told you.  My parents said to make something of myself, and that's what I did.  I saved up my lunch money, I got a video camera, and I go out and I record.  I traveled cross-country in a train with some hobos.  Now these nice ladies are going to call the police on me.  Uh-oh.  I have to delete this video.  I guess I'm a bad, bad boy.  It's gonna call the law on me.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here comes the fuzz.  The Constitutional Rain Man is now going to be charged with being an accessory to a felony, a misdemeanor, and just a public nuisance.  I don't think any of those charges are going to stick, to be honest with you.  Uh-oh.  Don't be a tattletale, sir.  It's perfectly legal what I'm doing.  I escaped out of my bedroom window once my parents said to do something with yourself.  I saved up all my lunch money and I jumped out.  I've ridden throughout the United States and now I film.  That's what I do.  But I'm not going to delete my video, sir.  No way, no Jose.  Make sure you tell them.  I'm on the public sidewalk, sir.  Orange shirt, a hat, glasses, quite attractive, tan pants, and shoes.  I'd go barefoot, but it's too hot here.  Oh, we're close.  Oh, we're close.  I just heard you say he's got a big what?  I hope it's a tripod.  You don't want to go and talk about something else.  That would be rude.  I doubt how long it's going to be because I'm going to leave pretty soon, sir.  I'm going to go buy myself a sparkle donut.  Although I shouldn't have it because it's a sugar high, but I do enjoy sugar.  Okay.  Your slogan is, we shall give good service at a profit if we can, at a loss if we must, but always good service.  That's a wonderful slogan, sir.  I commend you for that.  Okay, here come the police.  They came the back way, thinking they're going to sneak up against me, but not the constitutional reign, man.  I may be slow, but I ain't that slow.  There he is up there, sir.  He's right there.  Hi.  Hello, officer.  How are you today?  I'm good.  How are you?  Very good.  I'm just out here filming in public.  Okay.  That sounds good.  Yep.  He's all got his underwear in the panties here. ",
