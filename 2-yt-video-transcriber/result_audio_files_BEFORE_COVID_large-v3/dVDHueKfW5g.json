            "text": "I'm constantly getting calls.  It started yesterday for me.  I've been getting calls from Parchment Prison concerning the death of about 15 GDs down there at the hands of the Vice Lord.  The situation is this.  There's a female officer in Parchment Prison that's our Vice Lord.  She was dealing with a GD down there in that prison.  Whatever happened, they had a misunderstanding.  She further went on to allow vice lords into this particular unit with knives as well as keys.  She let them in on unsuspecting GDs.  The end result is that 15 GDs had lost their life in that prison thus far.  The National Guard is standing by.  It's a lot going on.  What the problem is, is this, that we don't want this situation to spill over into the streets.  It's already transitioning to other prisons down south.  I've been getting calls in Texas from prisoners saying that word came in to start hitting our vice-law.  I told everybody to stand down because we in Chicago, has the situation at hand you know.  and uh what's what's going on right now?  myself as well as uh cheeto hardeman a lot of different vice lawyers as well as gds are at the table communicating about this situation.  whatever go on man the streets of chicago and all the streets throughout the united states stand down.  This is a situation that's isolated.  That incident, yeah, we cannot do what can happen.  We can't bring back our brothers that they lost their life.  But we don't need other brothers unnecessarily losing their life to this situation.  Let the authorities deal with it as they must.  Those responsible in the times to come will be dealt with.  It's a way to do everything.  But for us to lay there and buy into this situation and become a part of the problem is not the solution.  The solution to this situation is for us to stand down.  Man, dead men do not change living man conditions.  We can't undo what can happen.  But moving forward, we can be conscious, man.  of our actions.  we have to not move on this situation.  if you have any influence in any of these nations gd vice lord stones disciples whatever man.  use that influence to stop the bloodshed to stop what can happen.

If we can't come together in some type of unity, some type of understanding to say stop the violence, peace be still, don't nothing change, man.  Our youth are looking to the elders for guidance and direction.  But look at the guidance and the direction in which we're giving to these brothers, man, and these sisters, man.
