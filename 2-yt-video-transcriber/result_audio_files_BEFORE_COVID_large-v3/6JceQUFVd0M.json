            "text": "November the 9th, 2019.  As you're looking at an article that's current, it's from Joseph D. Alio, CCM, and he says that starting in January 2019, and guys, we've been looking at this, we've been talking about grand solar minimum and going into colder and colder winters for the last few years.  But it says, starting in January 2019, unusual and at times record cold has been locked in over the north central states.  though there was heat in late summer in the southeast and eastern guff to the mid-atlantic the cold held in the northern central.  but guys we're going to see this in grand solar minimum.  as we decline each solar cycle into a lower peak we're going to see intense days during the summer.  why?  because the shields are weak and more cosmic radiation is penetrating.  it's easier for solar radiation cosmic radiation everything to penetrate a weak shield.  but those days will become fewer and fewer.  the winters will become longer and longer because it's really declining at a rate more rapid than a lot of scientists predicted.  after a cold spring with late snows which significantly delayed or prevented the grain planting a cool summer followed and gave way to a very cold shot in late september.  and in the middle of this don't forget the flooding that also affected the crops.  It says this cold shot in late September that brought early deep freezes and even record snows in the north central leading to significant crop losses.  Again, what crops made it through the floods and the late planting got wiped out by the early snow.  Guys, it's like the moderate minimum on repeat.  And this cycle at minimum should last at least 80 years.  in this decline of each peak in the solar cycles.  There have been 90 all-time record lows versus just 44 all-time record highs this year.  That included the all-time state record low of minus 38 degrees Fahrenheit in Mount Carroll in Illinois on January 31st.  Now, this is talking about October, and we're just into early November, but it says the cold central deepened in October and pushed to the east, bringing very early snow into the Midwest.  October saw 3,680 record daily lows, 32 all-time record lows for the month and no all-time record monthly highs.  Guys, and starting this coming Tuesday, even though it's been cold the last couple of nights, starting this coming Tuesday night, things are going to get bitter even here in central Mississippi in the 20s and possibly in the teens with the wind chill factor.  This goes on, it says, after bringing heavy snows to the Rockies and high plains, the cold rolls south with temperatures 30 to 50 degrees below normal.  Temperatures dropped to a record at minus 35 at Logan County Sink in Utah and minus 46 degrees Fahrenheit at Peter Sink.  Record coldest for the U.S.  in the month of October.  Guys, do you see what's going on?  The cold also follows the solar activity.  We are currently in a century or more quiet sun.  In other words, a declining solar peak every 11.8 years.  for the last century in the period in and following the last eleven cycle lows two thousand seven to two thousand eleven we had brutal cold and snow here in the u s and europe.  december in twenty ten the central england temperature's longest continuing record going back to sixteen fifty nine was the second coldest.  december Snow, which was forecast to be a thing of the past, instead buried the UK for long periods, reminiscent of the adulterous solar minimum of the early 1800s, as evidenced by Dickens' novels.  In the  U.S.,  record cold and snow in Snowmageddon, Mid-Atlantic, 2009 and 2010.  Now, guys, what you're looking at is the drop of the last solar cycle.  In other words, it declined, started rising back up for solar cycle 24, and now we're getting at the bottom of that and about to go into solar cycle 25.  So it says again, Snowmageddon Mid-Atlantic winter 2009 and 10 was eclipsed with the record winters of 2013 and 2014 and 2014 and 15, which brought the coldest and snowiest winters in modern day peaks of Great Lake Ice.  So even though we had hot summers, the winters have continued to get worse, even through, and when you go from 2009 to 2010, you're going into the peak of the solar cycle.  But what happened when we got to 2013, 2014, look at this, 2014, 2015, in the peak, we were still getting record winters.  Why?  Because the peak of the cycles is declining.  Now, this is coming out just as I think it was yesterday.  The Weather Channel decided to do its own history lesson on why we're going into global warming.  Think about it.  The snow in the hemisphere is increasing very rapidly and is above normal, which should expand and enhance the cold.  Given the projection by Russian scientists and many in the West, including some at NASA, we could be heading into a deep and long solar minimum, like the Malta minimum, with major cooling.  Whether it is a several-decade-dalter-like period or a Malta, this is no time to abandon cheap, available energy.  That's kind of where this article is coming from, guys.  But the people are the experts that deal with the energy.  They also deal with the insurance companies.  They have the real data, not these climate change freaks, but the real information.  And my point of the video is this, you better prepare for these longer winters.  As long as we're here and in our physical bodies, in the next foreseeable generations, And this could last, guys, for 70, 80 years minimum.  And we do have 300-year intervals to where this happens.  But then there's grand solar minimum cycles that can fall even deeper as far as colder winters.  And that may be what we're seeing.  says even in the warmer interlude we have enjoyed.  cold weather kills 20 times as many people as hot weather according to an international study analyzing over 74 million deaths in 384 locations across 13 countries.  Now, I just want to show you the weather for the next week or so here in central Mississippi.  Guys, we're approximately 120 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico.  Current temperature, 59 degrees.  Today's high was 60.  Tonight will be 38.  Tomorrow, very nice day.  On Sunday, 68 degrees, 46 for the low.  Very good weather.  now monday we're going to see a change from that sun and to rain.  you can again see monday on the 11th 67 for the high 32 for the low.  as you're dealing with a temperature change.  it could uh could create tornadic activity and severe thunderstorms because it's such a drastic change.  but it goes to 32 again monday night the high tuesday only gets up to 39 and then 22 degrees.  um tuesday night back up to 48. wednesday 28. wednesday night we'll pull this down in the 50 to 56 60 63 for the highs starting to climb back somewhat.  but guys i know in the north when we're talking about 22 degrees that's nothing to you guys but here it is different And we do have a longer crop growing season.  And so when that's affected, the whole nation is affected, especially when you see it happening across the Midwest and the North also.  Again, guys, be prepared for this winter.  And be planning this and everything that you do for the next few winters.  But we're watching it, guys.  You watch it.  It's a heads up.  Be safe. ",
