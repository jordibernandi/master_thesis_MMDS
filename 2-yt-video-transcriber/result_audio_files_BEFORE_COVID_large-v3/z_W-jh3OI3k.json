Anyway, so this is about the still-in-cancer-ward episode 5.  I'll splice this in.  Basically, what I was going to say, though, was that the hypervibe and everything is... And I use other exercises.  I've got all different kinds of things here for various different kinds of... muscle responses.  so I don't usually do these kind of things.  but you can see building back up the muscle mass got a decent amount coming on in and it's a. It's an effective kind of an exercise because it aids the hypervibe, because it aids the ability to actually do real movement exercises.  Let me see if that will affect.  There we go.

Cancer is indeed a very painful, nasty scourge, but there are many things that we can do to deal with this shit.  I guess that's it.  So now on to the next one. ",
