            "text": "Well, I'm up here tonight not to say go to hell, but rather go to heaven.  And I'm urging you not to say I'll be damned, but instead I'll be saved.  And the word hell today is constantly used as a swear word.  You hear it on television, you see it in the films, you see it in the writings of people, and you hear it at work, and you hear it in school.  You can never understand hell though until first you understand the great love, mercy and grace of God.  And it should never be preached by any preacher without tears.  I've heard some preachers preach on hell as though they were glad there was a hell and glad that people were going there.  You see, hell was not made for man.  Hell was created for the devil and his angels.  But some have taken license and imagination and distorted the idea of future judgment.  It causes some people to say that God is not a God of love.  And they've distorted the biblical concept of the love of God.  A lady said some time ago, I hate the very thought of hell.  So do I. And I also hate the sin that sends them there.  I hate war.  I hate the fact that people are starving in the world.  But war is a reality in Lebanon and places like that.  And starvation is a reality in our world, unfortunately.  My hating it does not change the facts.  And hating to die doesn't change the fact that I'm going to die.  Well, I know that down in South Carolina, I came to a place some years ago in which they had 13 or 16 slow down signs and stop signs because so many people had been killed at that intersection.  Now, is that right for the state of South Carolina to put those signs up and warn people?  Is it right for me to warn you tonight what Jesus taught and what the Bible teaches from cover to cover?  Is it wrong for a man to wave a lantern to stop people at a railroad crossing?  Is it wrong to wave the flag and warn of coming judgment?  Now Jesus cured a mentally ill person, the Gadarene, and a demon-possessed man, and the people asked Jesus to leave them alone.  And he answered their prayers.  He left them alone.  You don't have to listen to this sermon tonight.  You can say, I don't want to hear about it.  Leave me alone.  People do not want to be warned of judgment in hell, and you say it's none of my business.  Well, suppose you were a drowning man, and I have the gospel lifeboat, and I'm not going to let you drown, if I can help it.  You're a starving man, and I have the bread of life, and I'll not leave you without some bread.  You're a poisoned man, full of the poison of sin, and I have Christ's gospel antidote, and I will not leave you to die.  I will not leave you alone.  You're in the dark and lost and I have the light of the gospel and I'll not leave you alone.  You're in bondage and I would speak the truth that would bring you to liberty.  You're in sickness and I would speak the truth that would bring you to health.  You're on a broad road that leads to destruction and I speak the truth that would get you transferred to the narrow road that leads to eternal life.  You're on a wild stormy sea and I would speak the truth that would bring you to the harbor of safety.  And some people say we're not really lost.  The devil said that to Eve in the Garden of Eden.  When God said you'll die, you'll die if you eat of that fruit, of that forbidden tree, The devil came and whispered in her ear through the serpent and said, you will not surely die.  Now that is called universalism.  In other words, everybody is saved.  They just don't know it.  Some people are saying, and we have a subtle form of universalism that's sweeping through even evangelical groups today that will not surely die.  that there's no such thing as hell.  Conscience seems to teach it.  There's a little red light that goes on in the soul when we do wrong.  And the fear of judgment is also needed to restrain men from sin.  Suppose you took away the police force of Sacramento, what would happen?  Just the fact that you have policemen.  The fact that you have policemen parading up and down the highway, you don't have to stop anybody.  Just the fact you see the police car, you slow down to 55 right away.  It's a discipline.  And then human experience teaches it.  Voltaire said, I'm taking a fearful leap into the dark when he died.  And how many experiences I could tell here just of my own knowledge of people who were screaming as they went out into eternity.  And how many experiences I could tell of people who were going to heaven and the joy that was in their heart, the excitement in the room.  And you were blessed by being there.  And then Jesus constantly taught it.  Nobody in scripture talked about hell more than Jesus.  He said, Whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  He said in the 13th of Matthew, The Son of Man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  Matthew 25, 41, he says, Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  And if thy right hand defend thee, cut it off.  It's better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands and to go to hell.  He said it's better to go through life with just one eye, one hand, one leg than to go to hell with it all.  And if you accept the teachings of Jesus, you are forced to accept that there is a place of judgment for those who reject Him.  The Bible teaches that there are at least three kinds of hell.  First, there is hell in the heart.  Thousands of people here tonight have hell in your heart.  And that's where it all begins.  Much of the world assumes that human nature is good.  But the Bible teaches that it's basically evil.  By nature, we are selfish, sinful, wayward, and lost.  In sin did my mother conceive me, said David.  We're all sinners and we were born in sin and then when we reach the age of accountability, maybe seven, eight, or nine, or ten years of age, we chose to sin.  Then we became sinners by practice and we practice sin even if we have computers.  We're using computers today for fraud and all sorts of things.  Everywhere you look and whatever investigating committee you appoint, you turn up some snakes because human nature is evil.  Human nature is bad.  And that's the reason it needs redemption.  It needs transforming.  It needs the new birth.  And that's what Christ came to do.  Hell in the heart.  There's the hell of guilt.  I know a woman, a fine woman, beautiful woman.  Her husband was one of the leaders of the community.  And without hardly any provocation at all, while he was asleep, she took a pistol and shot him, killed him.  She's in prison now.  And we read about that every day in the paper.  People they say that were good people, fine people, are doing all sorts of things that they never dreamed that they would be doing.  So there's that in the heart, guilt.  Then there's the hell of unrest.  The Bible states the wicked are like the troubled sea.  People are like an army of ants trying to escape from the destruction of their own anthill.  They spend a great part of their savings trying to find some Shangri-La where there's peace.  There is no Shangri-La.  All Shangri-Las without Christ are dead ends and lead exactly no place.  And when you arrive at your Shangri-La, you may find one.  When you arrive there, you're going to find your problems, your guilt, your sins will arrive with your luggage.  You cannot leave it behind.  But Jesus said, my peace I'll give unto you.  Not as the world gives.  The world cannot give you peace of heart and forgiveness of sin and take the guilt away.  But Christ can.  By his death on the cross, he can forgive your sins.  The guilt can be washed away and his peace can be yours.  Secondly, the Bible teaches that there's hell around us.  Isaiah 14 9 has a very descriptive verse and a very mysterious verse and a very interesting verse when you study it.  Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming.  Hell from beneath is moved.  Read it in the Living Bible, the 14th chapter of Isaiah, the whole thing.  And it's an interesting passage to read.  There's hell in the home.  Hell in society.  When a situation becomes intolerable, many people say, all hell is broken loose.  If ever there was a time in human history when hell has been unleashed, it seems that it's now in our world and in the world in which you move and live.  There's the hell of lust.  She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.  The fury of sexual hell has been unleashed in our world.  The commandments of God against impurity and unchastity are trampled underfoot by our generation.  Our literature and entertainment are playing up sexual perversion.  They're calling evil good and good evil.  Isaiah said, hell from beneath is moved.  It has been moved to earth and a secular godless world revels in its lust.  It rejects the gospel and takes lust.  The Bible teaches that as we approach the end of the age, that people more and more will be taken up with greed to get what we can get now, live for the now.  And then there's the hell of hatred.  This hell of hatred has erupted into wars and riots and all kinds of conflicts.  Hell has been moved to earth.  And then thirdly and lastly, there's the hell in the future.  And the future hell is a projection of the hell that you have now in your heart, in your home, in our world, except it goes on and on.  Jesus spoke more about hell than any person in the Bible, as I said a moment ago, but he warned us to flee from it.  It is the very fact of hell that makes the love of God so amazing and so glorious.  The fact that it was made for the devil and his angels and we listened to the devil and followed the devil and we do what the devil says, And yet God loves us so much that He devised a plan to save us so that we'll never have to spend one day in hell.  Essentially and basically it is separation from God.  We're separated from God by sin and that continues out into eternity.  And there are three words that Jesus used to describe hell.  He used the word death.  You see, God is life and you're separated from the life of God.  You're dead.  Spiritually dead.  Separated from God.  And then he used the word out of darkness.  God is light.  We're separated from the light.  So we live in darkness.  And then he uses the word fire.  And I've often wondered if that is a terrible fire within our hearts for God, for fellowship with God that can never be quenched.  We've rejected God.  We've turned our back on God.  We can never know God.  And the scripture says, prepare to meet thy God.  You know, we prepare for everything except death.  We prepare for education, business, careers, marriage, old age, but not for the moment of judgment.  We take out every kind of insurance that we possibly can and we worry about our old age pensions and social security and all the rest of it.  But do you have assurance that of your relationship with Christ.  It's appointed unto men once to die, but after that, the judgment.  Death is an occurrence that each man deems unnatural when related to himself, but natural when related to others.  We know the other man's going to die.  We know that cancer's going to hit the other person.  We know that that other person may die of a heart attack or be in an automobile crash tomorrow, but not me.  And we live as though we're going to live like this forever and we're not.  It'll all be over in a short time for everybody here.  And you'll be in eternity.  Where will you be?  Banished from God or with Christ in paradise?  The man on the cross that was dying with Jesus was a terrible sinner.  he deserved to be crucified.  he deserved the punishment according to the law and he said he deserved it.  and he turned to Jesus and he said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom.  that's all he said.  remember me.  he didn't have time to be baptized he didn't have time to join a church he didn't have time to do anything except just believe.  and Jesus said today thou shall be with me in paradise.  Think of it.  The first person that Jesus took into paradise with him was that thief, that murderer, that man that deserved hell.  But on the cross, Christ was dying for people like Him.  And Christ was dying for people like you.  The Bible says now is the accepted time.  Now is the day of salvation.  Come when you can.  You can't come to Christ just any time you want to.  You can come only when the Holy Spirit has convicted you and drawn you and where the Word of God has been proclaimed.  Have you come to Christ?  You say, well, Billy, what would I have to do?  alright you'd have to do three things.  first you must repent of your sins.  repent means to change.  change your mind change your way of living.  let Christ come and help you change.  he'll help you do the changing.  you can't change by yourself.  you're too weak.  but if you'll say Lord I'm willing he'll help you.  and then the second thing is by faith receive Christ who died for you and rose again by faith.  You can't understand it all, but you come by faith and you trust and you put your total confidence in Him, in Him alone.  And then thirdly, you obey Him and follow Him and serve Him and work for Him and do all the good works that you possibly can for His sake.  In His name, helping your neighbor, loving your neighbor.  By this shall all men know that you are my disciples and that you have love one to another.  Are you willing to do that tonight? ",
