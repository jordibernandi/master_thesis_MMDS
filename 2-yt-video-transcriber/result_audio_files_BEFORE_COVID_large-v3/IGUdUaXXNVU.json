Okay, see, this is a problem with people in modern culture, especially city people, who think that people who were farmers and ranchers did not see... Embryos.  Miscarriages happen all the time with animals and with humans.  The very notion that at any point in recorded history there was nobody who was familiar with what an embryo looked like is bizarre.  It's absurd.  We've always known.  Now, what we knew about it specifically is perhaps subject to debate.  But saying that there's an embryo that looks like chewed gum is absurd.

Yes, they would have.  And there's absolutely nothing in that passage that it was of any scientific value.  And the other problem here, which you're gonna get to when you get to your next one, is that when people say, oh, well, the Bible tells us things about science or the Quran tells us things about science, even if the Quran said, Even if the Quran described the germ theory of disease, that is of no use to us as a pronouncement from a holy book until such time as science confirms it.  And then you also have to look at what other passages were made where the pronouncements were actually shown to be wrong by science.  So when we talk about the Quran having passages that, oh, these couldn't have been known by people, Well, that's the first one people go to.  It's the first one you went to.

And Sir Arthur Conan Doyle famously wrote Sherlock Holmes and gave this statement of, once you've eliminated all other possibilities, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the right answer.  And a lot of people think that this is a profound statement on skepticism.  It's not.  It is a fallacious thing.  I call it Doyle's fallacy.  Because the question is, how do you know you've eliminated all the possible explanations?  In your case, and this is where we get an argument from personal incredulity, which is a fallacy, you took a look at this, and based on the information you have, you don't think there's any way somebody could have known what an embryo looked like.  And you also seem to think that chewed gum is an accurate description of embryo, which I would not say it actually is.  And because you couldn't Your information did not allow you to come up with any other explanation.  You jumped to the explanation that the best or only explanation was divine intervention.  When Houdini would escape from ropes and chains, he would escape and the ropes would still be tied in knots and the chains would still be secured.  And Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his infinite genius, concluded that he had ruled out all other possibilities and reached the conclusion that Houdini could physically dematerialize.  This was his explanation for how Houdini could escape.  We know that this is not the case.  I can escape from things and have escaped from things.  Even, well, it's not much to say faster than Houdini because Houdini would sometimes take forever.  But... I can do those things, escape from ropes where the ropes are still knotted, would it be reasonable for anybody to conclude that I can actually dematerialize?  Of course not, because they can't have eliminated other possibilities.  And so you're looking at the Quran and seeing this passage, and you're committing what I call Doyle's fallacy.  You look at it and you say, wow, I can't imagine how people could have known about embryos, so it must have been divine knowledge and divine intervention.  And yet I just described to you a number of different ways that people throughout all of recorded history and before could very well and likely did know about embryos.

And what makes this worse is you are then trying to use this conclusion as if it is evidence for the supernatural, which makes your entire argument circular.  So you start with an argument from personal incredulity.  I can't believe people understood about this.  I haven't looked into it.  I haven't researched it.  I haven't figured out what people did or didn't know.  But I just can't believe that they knew about embryos.  Therefore, God must have said it.

And so I asked her, how do you know that?  And she said, well, it couldn't be any other way.
