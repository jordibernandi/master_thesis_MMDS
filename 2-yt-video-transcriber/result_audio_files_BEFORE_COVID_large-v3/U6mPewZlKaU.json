            "text": "So I decided to write a book about my crazy ass life.  Oh, hi wife.  Thank you.  In this book, I talk about my time in special operations and as a contractor.  I had to redact that.  Go for poster.  Anybody need a hand?  You see, this isn't your average military book.  I talk about being an internet douchebag, business, and getting a flesh-eating bacteria in Florida.  I feel like a Navy SEAL.  I discuss how I own too many guns.  Just kidding.  That's not a thing.  Trade how you fight!  And even if you hate my book, there's plenty of other applications for it.  Balancing a table.  Or a non-lethal concealed carry-off.  That's toilet paper.  I talk about why I love this country so much and all the amazing opportunity it's provided me.  Patriotism is racism.  Okay.  What's up, man?  American Appreciation Month?  Yep.  Ooh, where'd you send it?  Syria.  Sweet.  And actually, I am going to need that back.  All right.  Jared, let's fold this up.  Woo!  Publishing day, baby!  Hey, guys.  Finally, my book is out, available everywhere.  books are sold.  I don't think a book like this has ever been written.  And most importantly, I just want to say thank you for the support over all the years, all the crazy times.  The love and support means everything to me.  You going to bring back that guy from Syria?  Oh my god!  Oh, it's America!  God bless America!  God bless America!  God bless America!  Can I have this?  You can have it.  Cheers, buddy. ",
