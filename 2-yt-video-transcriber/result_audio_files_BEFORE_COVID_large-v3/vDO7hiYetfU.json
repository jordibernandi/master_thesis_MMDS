Like they had to be Blackhawks only because of the loudness of them and how they are, you know, they have a distinctive sound.  But anyway, they, um, uh, we've been getting a lot of, we usually have it on the weekend they practice, but this is like every day now.  So it's been a little crazy over this way.  Um, but secondly, the, my daughter had been, she went into the auto store.  And that they changed, you know, to get her light bulb changed.  And the guy that waited on her happened to be in the National Guard.  He said he was just on this three-day weekend there and that it was really hectic.  So basically, she said that he said to her, I'm reading, so I kind of got the phone a little bit away.  But he says, we've been moving a lot of troops and equipment, way more than usual.  I casually mentioned that I stay aware of the things, and he looked at her dead in the eyes and said, please keep prepping.  Get your firearms education and time on the range as soon as possible.  And yes, things are just beginning, especially in Indiana.  He said that they've been moving a lot of equipment and troops to Indiana.  So I don't know what's going on with that, but I just figured I'd mention that in case anybody was aware of what's going on there. ",

It's one of few sports events that has secret service and like actual military there to protect people because it is such a gigantic event.  And they talked about the this device.  that basically detects nuclear devices or it detects chemical devices.  It's like a sniffer or something, but it's a tiny device.  And they're talking about making these and sending these out right now.  Not only that, they're drilling for chemical... event to happen.  they're actually doing false uh triage with quarantines and all this stuff.  and what happened in la?  with that helicopter getting sprayed down in court?  uh quarantine.  and then they said that it was a um a chemical spill.  but yet they knocked on every last door of every neighbor and said keep your doors locked.  why would a chemical spill need you to lock your doors?  Things aren't lining up.  That don't make sense.  It doesn't make sense at all.  It's like, do you want me to tape up my door?  Do you want me to tape my windows?  No, no, no.  Lock them.  The chemicals have actually grown into a blob and it's attacking and killing everyone. ",
