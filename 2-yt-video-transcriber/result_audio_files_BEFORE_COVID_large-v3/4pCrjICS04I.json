Once in the head.  Two other men shot.  One also dead.  Other one in critical condition, who knows if the other one gonna make it too.  This man, who like I said earlier, for the most part is one of the more positive artists, worked with people who are outside of his game, YG, and the game.  One who gave back to his community By opening this store.  In the same area.  Where he's from.  In marathon clothing.  A man who saw.  Some problems in the world.  And decided okay.  Here's how I'm going to help.  And it was.  In a way that would help people.  See what's really going on.  He was bringing awareness to people.  He never did follow that path that everybody else was doing.  And in this world, it appears people like that don't get to last long.  I'm going to let you hear something that he said.  That's what you need to hear.  You don't need to hear me talking.  Listen to what he planned to do.  It's going to be a lot of stuff said about what happened.  The main thing you need to understand is it's over.  Ain't no more Nipsey Hussle.  And one thing you can't say, you can't say that this man wasn't for his people. ",
