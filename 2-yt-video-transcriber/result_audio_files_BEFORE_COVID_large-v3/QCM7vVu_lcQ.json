            "text": "Look it up.  Look it up online.  Tens of thousands of Mormons are streaming in late.  They were specifically asked to be in their seat by 530.  Folks, you've got to say why you're not in your seat by 530 in direct disobedience from the prophet.  Mormon Standard Time.  There you go.  Mormon Standard Time here in Glendale, Arizona.  When asked if they're sad they'll be disappointing the prophet by being late, all the respondents apparently said no.  None of the thousands of people streaming past me at this time seem to care that they're late to the event.  The prophet asks them to be in their seat by 5.30.  Every person walking behind me is disobeying the prophet.  We have gotten approximately 15 recipes for green jello salad this evening, but yet nobody can name more than two of Joseph Smith's polygamous wives.  Russell M. Nelson is speaking.  Are there any specific prophecies that Russell Nelson has given in the past that are your personal favorites?  I think shortening the block from three to two hours is a good one.  So last church, 33%.  last church is his favorite revelation.  I appreciate that.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Another group of people showing up from Mormon Standard Time approximately 15 minutes late.  Back to you, Susan.  When asked if they care that they're late in disobeying the prophet, all of the Mormons we asked seemed to not care.  However, they were happy that they have one hour less church on Sundays.  Many of them are hoping that the next revelation will be a further reduction in church time from two hours to one hour.  Mormon prophet Russell M. Nelson will be speaking to a capacity crowd of approximately 62,000 people.  Shockingly, not a single Mormon is able to actually name more than one of Joseph Smith's wives.  He had 34.  Dallin H. Oaks said that research is not the answer, so most Mormons refuse to research their religion.  When asked how many wives Joseph Smith had, none of them were able to give the correct answer.  None of the people interviewed today were aware that the changes to the temple endowment ceremony ever occurred in the first place.  None of them knew that Joseph Smith's first wife was 14 years old.  Dallin H. Oaks, eight days ago, said that research is not the answer.  We'll see if tonight he gives the same message.  $10 to the first person who can name at least three of Joseph Smith's polygamous wives.  No?  So close, so close.  Oaks, who identifies himself as a prophet, seer, and revelator, told a Chicago crowd eight days ago that it's important to not take the sacrament with their left hand.  That's the message of a living prophet of God.  Of Joseph Smith's 34 wives, no Mormons yet have been able to identify more than one of them by name.  Mike Norton, KULT News, Glendale, Arizona.  That's some Christ-like Mormon behavior right there.  When asked what they thought about women no longer having to veil their faces in the temple, many of the younger Mormons were unaware that this was ever a practice.  This is the largest gathering of cult members since Jonestown in 1979.  Many Mormons are hoping that Russell M. Nelson will reduce the amount of time they spend in church by another 33% this evening.  That revelation hopefully will be coming tonight.  Do you believe that the word Mormon and the use of the word Mormon is a personal pet peeve by Russell Nelson, or do you believe that it was a revelation from God?  That's a pretty straightforward question.  Why do you refuse to give straightforward answers? ",
