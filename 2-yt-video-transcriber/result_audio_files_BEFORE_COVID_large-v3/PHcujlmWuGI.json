            "text": "How's the royal family?  I pray that everyone is doing well.  My royal family, you know what kind of video this is.  And yes, the title is true, real, and correct.  You talking about sweet.  Oh, wee.  Oh, so sweet to me.  Boy, boy, boy.  Just when I think, just when I think, I feel something coming.  I feel something coming.  My royal family, when I say juicy, this is real juicy.  It's sweet.  So what you need to do is stop everything you're doing.  Get that, you know, roll that blunt.  Get whatever you're going to drink.  I got my grape juice on deck because I'm about to slay.  I'm about to drag this motherfucking coon because he didn't got the pimp hand.  Oh, we sweet.  Oh, my goodness.  That shit is sweet.  And as the plot thickens, you thought you was in.  I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen to me.  So my royal family, I have an article to read for the royal family, and then I have a bonus video.  that's juicy, juicy, juicy.  So my royal family, let's go on this journey.  Ow!  Trump-loving Sheriff David Clark gets the boot from Fox News.  Oh, shit.  Well, let's see what's really going on.  Oh, Mr.  Bootlick.  The Daily Beast reports that Fox News has quietly parted ways with a one-time staple on their network, Sheriff David Kuhn Clark.  The one time Fox News regular, who was previously considered for different senior posts in the Trump administration, was effectively banned last year by the network, according to two sources familiar with the situation.  The Beast reported, Tuesday, additionally, the website say that Clark has also been pushed to the side by pro-Trump PAC America First Action.  Two knowledgeable sources confirm that Clark is no longer a senior advisor and a spokesman for pro-Trump super PAC American First Action, where he landed.  where he landed in late 2017 after he resigned as sheriff and was repeatedly blocked from getting a position in the Trump administration.  And I'm going to reveal to you who was doing all the blocking.  Y'all won't be surprised.  Clark has raised eyebrows on both sides of the aisle since it was revealed that he went to Russia on a NRA-related trip in 2015.  The Wisconsin-born ex-sheriff has been trashing Fox on Twitter and praising more conservative networks lately, the Beast said.  Clark lashed out at Fox News for having crawled into bed with CNN by backing the rival network's lawsuit against Trump's administration.  For stripping CNN reporter John Acosta, White House access, the Beast wrote Tuesday.  he had then declared that the insurgent right-wing cable network, One America News, which side with Trump has some balls by comparison, they add.  So, I'm going to pin this article.  If somebody want to, oh, I went to the wrong one.  Let me back up here.  Here it is.  I'm going to pin this article from Daily Beast.  If anybody want to read deeper into what happened, everything about him and the person that blocked him from having any position at the White House was John Kelly.  See, John Kelly is one of these type of racist people.  He don't even like coons.  He don't like nothing black.  You know, if he could, if he could, he would even get rid of diamond and silk with a coondalette ass.  So, he got the pimp hand.  Ain't he sweet, my real family?  This shit is juicy.  And I figured, you know, we don't know if he's going to be pulled in with this stuff with Russia.  We don't know.  But he left a stain in Milwaukee.  prisoners came up dead a baby came up dead and also to add one of his guards was raping someone that they've been keeping hush-hush and in Milwaukee they have had to clean up a lot of shit.  so he was you know he was stained Just stained.  And that just gave them an extra excuse because they didn't want to be bothered with him.  Because a coon shelf life ain't very long.  But he a different type of special coon.  So my royal family, I got a bonus video that I want to show the royal family.  And I want y'all to listen to this very beautiful speech that Clark gave.  It's very important that we listen to this stuff.  Donald Trump is the steadfast leader our nation needs.  He has spoken passionately to me of his belief in our American system of justice, and he speaks to the values that are at the foundation of our social contract.  And over the many years before, he has consistently and constantly raised his voice, not only in defense of the character of the American police officer, but the need for all people to feel that they are being treated fairly and respectfully by law enforcement.  You see, Donald Trump understands that what can make our nation safe again is a recommitment to a system of justice in which no government official, not even those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington, no private citizen, no elected official, even Hillary Clinton, And no group of people, despite the further with which they press forward their grievances, can claim privilege above the law.  It cannot happen in the United States.  I am sensing something is happening here.  I really am.  And I'm really excited about it.  And I'm so proud to be a part of this Donald Trump campaign, Donald Trump understands us, he understands you, and we understand him.  This is a movement like this country has not seen since the 1980s when Ronald Reagan ran for President of the United States.  Donald Trump is very important to this country and he knows how to jump start this economy again and put people back to work and to change the tone in Washington because you know as well as I do that the people in Washington that you see inside that bubble are disconnected from us here at ground level.  So hang in there.  that there are people who are defiant for a moment in our great American history.  George Washington was made for the American Revolution.  Abraham Lincoln was made for the Civil War.  Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr.  was made for the Civil Rights Movement.  Ronald Reagan was made to win the Cold War.  And I believe that Donald J. Trump was made for this moment of turmoil here in the United States.  Together, Donald Trump and we the people are going to make America great again.  it's it's it's it's.  I love this shirt.  Oh my goodness.  Oh, that was juicy.  Oh, that was juicy.  So, um, ex-sheriff David Coon Clark, you got the pep in.  Now, you went and did that little speech.  They wasn't feeling you.  You've been on them puppet strings for a while.  They made a mockery of you.  They really did.  I've been talking to you for three ass years, and everything that I predicted about your funky ass came true.  And it is sweet.  Ooh, real sweet.  I mean, juicy.  You're the gift to keep giving.  I waited patiently, and I would look up in the night to see.  If you was fucking up, and I know your nature, eventually you're going to do some buck dancing.  And John Kelly didn't like your ass at all.  He didn't care how hard you licked ass and all of that.  It didn't pan out.  But see, you're a special type of coon.  You will never get it.  You will never, ever get it.  the royal family they gonna drag you.  oh oh you got fired by Fox News.  they got tired of you.  they got tired of you.  cooning doesn't pay off at all.  you know I'm gonna be on your ass.  I'm gonna be on your ass cuz I'll look for you in the night.  I have what you call relentless drive.  I can't stand a motherfucker like you.  And thank goodness you didn't have no children because we didn't need any of that running around on this planet.  Really.  Mm-mm-mm.  Juicy, juicy, juicy.  Sweet.  I don't even want to get off.  If I could, I would drag him for hours.  But I can't do it, Monroe family.  So check this out.  Render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, I shake.  Oh, wait a minute.  I can't help myself, my royal family.  Is this the chick that you divorced?  You better hope she don't write one of them books.  And really expose your cool ass.  We heard about you beating on Becky's ass.  Black eyes.  I've had people come to this channel that said they used to work up under you and how you used to get down.  I know about you pulling a gun on a 15 year old child.  I know many things.  so you better make sure you break her off real good real good beg and plead or whatever because she put that book out.  oh my goodness oh my goodness.  okay my royal family let me get on off of here because i just love this.  i'm just savoring every moment juicy juicy juicy And that book makes a lot of sense now.  Cop Under Fire.  You got the pimp motherfucking hand.  Ashe to the royal family.  Oh my goodness, this shit is sweet. ",
