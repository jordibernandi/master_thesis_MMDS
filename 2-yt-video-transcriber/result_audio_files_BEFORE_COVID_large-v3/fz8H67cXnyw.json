Yes, I'm in my jammies.  I just spent the past several hours painting the ceiling of my office.  I was in the process of getting an ice pack.  I had true reporting playing and the president said something, Trump.  And then next thing I know, I got a download.  I'm like, oh my God, I really don't want to say this, but then why not?  God knows I've said plenty of other crazy things.  So why not go all the way?  Going all the way.  It's good news, though.  It's really, really good news.  All right, let's hop to it.  All righty.  Okay, this is true reporting.  This is what he put out today, right?  True reporting.  And I'm going to play you the snippet of Trump's speech.  and where I got the download, and I'm gonna share the download with you guys, okay?  Here we go. ",

            "text": "Right when he finished saying that, I'm still a bit emotional.  I got the download, okay?  And it was just, let me get over to the camera.  It literally was like, boom, it hit me in the chest.  And then it showed me what I heard, what I heard, quote unquote, heard right after he said that was, it was like almost a smile.  I sensed a big smile and a sense of approval and accomplishment and heard, We couldn't have gotten there if it wasn't for you.  And I literally just froze.  I was just like, this is completely different.  This is not my oversoul.  This is not any of the masters I usually talk to.  And then I was flashed a cue.  Kid you not.  And then I was shown, then I heard, was told, It is not CERN.  We took over.  We couldn't have done it without you.  I nearly lost my breath.  I still feel breathless.  And then I was shown giving these breadcrumbs to prove it, basically.  Okay, so yeah, let's get to it.  Oh, it's a blessing.  It feels almost like a curse sometimes.  Alrighty, let's get to it.  Okay, so we heard what the press said, right?  The 17, 17 we know is Q, because Q is the 17th number in the alphabet.  But that 17 holds so much importance.  I know astrologically that 17 always meant something to me.  But we're going to take it from here.  Okay.  I was guided to look at this.  Well, this is the Schumann from today.  We all know it's up to 60, right?  This is where 5D keeps appearing.  And here is that code, that 17 code.  right there, that code that's coming in at 17.  Now, when I first learned about the code, the message I received from my oversaw was that it was CERN, right?  I did feel a change.  I know I felt a change because I saw 5D appearing.  I'm like, yes, we totally broke through it completely.  5D is not The 5D frequency is not something that's fleeting back and forth.  It's like really there.  Whenever the Schumann hit, you know, high, whenever it hits over 50 or 60, I was shown that 5D literally shows up physically.  It's more accessible and 4D, positive 4D, higher 4D right here is constantly.  now, ever since then, it's constantly accessible.  All right.  And here I go with the fluttering again.  And again, like I was saying, this is the ethereal, this is the frequency 7.83 Hertz.  This is what maintains 3d.  And as you know, um, we broke through that without all everything we've done and we got past the ethereal.  Now what's been keeping this.  Keeping this up, CERN has a lot to do with it.  Okay?  Now remember, well, okay.  So this is what I was shown.  And then I was shown the number 144 and shown this video.  God, I'm still getting the downloads all over my body.  Shown the number 144.  And I was shown this video from Wages World.  Now I'm going to play this video right now.  And this is what Q is showing me to show you guys.  Listen up. ",

            "text": "Pretty decent amount of disruption here on our magnetics.  Okay, so check this out.  Okay, there's one little one there.  And again, these are like little pulses.  that are just like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And again, true solar wind typically doesn't hit us like that.  Typically, we'll get waves of them coming in at the same time, but they usually are not little hits like that.  They tend to be longer lasting.  And as you can see, look at that.  That's a very good example of what I was talking about a few weeks back, that because our magnetics are tilted right now, and you can clearly see that.  It's tilted like that, and the sun's over here, but whatever's sending this energy right now is not from the sun.  What we think that it is, most likely, is probably our object out there interacting with the sun.  We've talked about this before, and it's sending energy our way, but it's still coming from the direction of the sun because of that, because it's hanging out that direction.  But when we go look at the sun during these things, we're not seeing any kind of coronal holes or any of that kind of thing.  And that sunspot, we would not be seeing energy from it until two or three days from now.  Probably right around two days from now, probably.  Maybe three at the most.  But as you can see, guys.  This right here is definitely something, you know, I think I talked about this a couple videos back.  Because we're tilted, you see how the energy is getting in more.  so on the south pole.  Okay.  It comes in quicker that direction.  All right.  It comes in easier on the poles. ",

            "text": "Okay, guys, this is the screenshot of Schumann last night into early this morning.  That is a massive spike, long-lasting.  Okay, we're talking from 0600 to 1900.  So, yeah, I mean, that's just an insane amount of time for it to spike like that.  Now, I did videos back in February and March showing 24 hours to the day, to the time, to the hour.  I mean, back-to-back three months in a row lasted 24 hours exactly.  To me, that's not a natural thing.  That had to be something that was done intentionally by something or someone.  We're told that CERN's down, but we have to keep in mind that CERN is not the only particle collider.  There are bunches of them around the planet, okay?  So anything that's going to change our vibration like that, you know, maybe that's what we're seeing here because it does abruptly start and abruptly stop like a straight line.  Now, this only shows up to 40 hertz.  I'm not sure exactly what hertz level this actually reached, but you can clearly see, like I said, It was an on and an off.  I mean, it's like somebody flipped a switch again.  When I see this kind of stuff, I immediately think unnatural.  This isn't something that the Earth would do on its own.  This is something that's affecting it and causing it to do this.  Now, like I said, we were getting this hit at the same time.  So did the energy coming from space cause this, or did the vibrational frequency of the Earth caused our magnetics to shake around a little bit.  Was it both?  Who knows?  You know, I really... ",

            "text": "Mind blown yet?  Well, let me blow your mind a little bit more.  Okay?  That, as the voice was telling me, the cue voice was telling me, this was the switchover.  This was when they took over from the dark ones.  The 17 mark, which is very important.  The 17 mark, and I've been saying this since I started, right?  January 4th is the first time I did a video with this.  The 17 mark on the Shuman is the crossover from the ethereal realm, which is the lower and middle 4D, which has both positive, negative, to cross over right here into positive 4D, higher 4D, which is only positive.  This, oh my God, this was the switch over.  And yeah, the Schumann must have been like 90.  Between 70 and 90, that's what I'm getting.  Okay, let's blow your mind some more.  Now I was told to go to 1111. on my video on the sixth, that I did on the sixth.  Here we go.  I want you guys to see and keep in mind the entire time that we're doing this and moving forward, this line right here.  This is the baseline.  This is the heartbeat of her.  This, I just want a comparison real quick.  You guys know I'm in the medical field.  Well, it was conventional medicine.  This is 12-lead EKG.  All right, this was my specialty.  Still kind of is, since I'm going to probably be teaching rescue medicine.  This is 12-lead EKG.  This shows the depolarization and repolarization of the cells in the heart, in the electrical activity in the heart.  This is the human heartbeat.  So that's what happens.  Depolarization and repolarization of Earth's heartbeat.  Because I was told this would explain what happened.  I have chills all over my body, my scalp.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Okay.  Let's just keep listening to Lady V. All right.  And this is the Earth's heartbeat.  And this is the baseline for the Earth's heartbeat.  It's always there, always steady.  It's 7.83 hertz right here.  It's been chilling out there.  OK.  Well, as you could see, like Q pointed out, that this was the reset.  And the takeover that allowed for 5D right here to come online, allowed us to escape, allowed us to go.  Wow.  Okay.  That was it.  Yeah.  I don't even know what to say.  I'm just going to go put an ice pack on my neck now.  And my scalp is tingling like crazy.  It feels like it's wide open, my crown chakra.  So it's probably going to be a doozy of a night.  I hope it's not too crazy because I have to get up like at 5 a.m.  to go paint.  Lady V out.  Are there any questions about us having the victory already?  I don't know what you're questioning.  It's already done.  This is the highest timeline.  Choose it.  Like I said, you could choose to be in heaven or you could choose hell.  Hi. ",
