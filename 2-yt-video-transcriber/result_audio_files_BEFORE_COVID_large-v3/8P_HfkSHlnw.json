            "text": "What's going on, guys?  So I just got into Virginia.  Right.  And I got to the airport and I went to baggage claim.  I was looking for my bags.  And while I was waiting there, the Lord just showed me something, which was just very beautiful, very beautiful.  Just amazing.  the way that the Lord always speaks to me, you know, through the Holy Spirit.  It's just through pictures and images and dreams, you know, and visions and things like that.  So I wanted to share this with you guys very quickly.  We're waiting for our bags and it was taking longer than usual, right?  There's a whole bunch of people and for whatever reason, the bags just weren't coming.  And so this guy, he's kind of sitting there and it's obvious, you know, he's looking around and he's waiting for somebody.  And this woman comes up and as soon as they make eye contact, I mean, they just run to each other.  He embraces her.  They start kissing.  They start, you know, doing what lovers do.  They're so excited to see one another.  And she just, you know, she's all up in his arms and she rests her head on his chest.  And he's just got her like, you know, he's got her completely there.  Like, you know, like, OK.  So when you go certain places, say you go to church, right, and you see a sister in Christ and, you know, you give her that that holy hug, you know, kind of the side hug.  You see your homeboy, you know, you shake his hand and you kind of, you know, bump shoulders.  Right.  But then when you see your lover, right, when you see your lover is a whole different type of embrace.  It's a whole different type of hug.  And while I was watching them, I wasn't being creepy, you know, just sitting there watching what they're doing.  But, you know, I saw them embrace each other and the Lord showed me something.  He said how he just embraced her.  I would love to embrace some of my people.  Everything that they're looking for.  A lot of us, we were looking for our bags, right?  Some of us are so caught up with our baggage and our problems that we go through this whole life just dealing with baggage, dealing with problems, and we're distracted from the love of God.  And everything that we need can just be found with one touch from God, one embrace from God.  You're so depressed because you're sitting there, where's my bags?  And I got this problem and I got that problem.  And all you need to do is get one embrace.  One embrace, one touch, one moment of intimacy with God and man, everything can change in your life.  He desires to just pull you in the way that that man pulled in his lover and just embrace you and tell you that everything's going to be okay.  He desires to pull you in and embrace you and say, look, I've got the blueprints for your life right here.  I've got the healing for your life right here.  I've got the answer to your problem right here.  right now.  But we're so caught up dealing with our problems, dealing with our baggage, dealing with our nine to five, dealing with the cares of this life.  When is the last time you just stopped to get in his embrace?  When is the last time you stop?  You say you love him, but when is the last time you've embraced him the way that lovers do?  Lovers ain't real lovers if they don't get intimate.  When is the last time you claim to love God, you claim to love being a follower, being a believer, but when is the last time you really got into the holies of holies and got intimate with God and stopped being distracted by the cares of this life?  Now, check this out.  When the bags come down, they just keep going around and around and around and around till you pick them up and you take them off.  Some of us are sitting there just going around and around with the same old problems, same old depression, same old struggles, same old fears.  And the Lord is standing right there just like, man, I would love to embrace you right now, but you're preoccupied.  Just something to think about.  Love you guys.  Be blessed. ",
