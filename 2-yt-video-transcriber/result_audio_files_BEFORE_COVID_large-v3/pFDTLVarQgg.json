            "text": "I don't believe in God.  He believes in you.  I absolutely believe in God.  Let me tell you why.  True story.  They say I act like my mother's son.  Mount Vernon was the streets that I loved to run.  Found myself on the wrong side of someone's gun.  Breathing hard, but I made it.  You're damn right.  I believe in God.  Every time I try to get out the game, it's like somebody keeps pulling me back in.  They don't want me to leave.  Can't leave.  Rap alone, the game needs me.  I try to get out this game, it ain't easy.  It's what they're telling me, but I don't know because this game is full of jealousy.  I can't leave.  Rap alone, the game needs me.  I try to get out this game, it ain't easy.  It's what they're telling me.  But I don't know because this game is full of jealousy.  This new rap is dead.  It's too late to restore its true state.  MCs are too fake because truth's the new hateware.  Nobody's rhymes are potent for those whose eyes are open.  Because see, the game is full of liars and these liar Coens.  Now that's an omen omer.  That means a name sign.  How they claim that they woke but sleep the same time.  How they claim that they float.  But they not impressive.  How they claim rap evolved?  There ain't no fossil record.  But they push that.  And so I push back.  And reminisce bout the days when they made good rap.  And the beats were fire.  Had to adjust the volume.  Now you gotta mumble and sell a couple thousand.  Yup, the game has changed.  There ain't no standards.  You gotta wear tight jeans and rock a man purse.  But I'm killing them up in my street clothes.  Second verse, watch.  I'll drop the cheat code.  Can't leave rap alone.  The game needs me.  I try to get out this game, it ain't easy.  It's what they're telling me.  But I don't know because this game is full of jealousy.  I can't leave.  Rap alone, the game needs me.  I try to get out this game, it ain't easy.  It's what they're telling me, but I don't know because this game is full of jealousy.  And I don't mean to sound boastful, but when she sings, she make it sound so soulful.  So I made an anthem for my corner vets.  These verses ain't my single, they're just my warm-up sets.  I praise you, Howard, on this paltry, a sacrifice that I don't think that you can alter me.  Get a sacrifice, and that's it all to me?  Misunderstood, they speak in Paul to me.  And switch my style from random gun lines To knowledge pop with a slight sprinkle of punchlines.  And I'm not ashamed, I tell them we don't care.  Flow is tight light, outfits that bigos wear And you know that that isn't right In the dark, what good is a hidden light?  And the end is near, so we sent the fishes.  And I speak the truth because I know the scriptures.  The game needs me.  I can't leave the game alone, y'all The game needs me.  They keep pulling me back in.  Can't leave rap alone.  The game needs me.  I try to get out this game.  It ain't easy.  The game needs me.  It really, really needs me. ",
