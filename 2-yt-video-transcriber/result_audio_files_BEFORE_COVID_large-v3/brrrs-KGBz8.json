It did not prove the Earth was stationary.  It tried to find the existence of ether, which we originally thought had to exist because waves travel through a medium.  Since light can be treated as a wave, scientists proposed that an invisible medium called the ether had to exist.  The failure of the experiment disproved that, which eventually led to the development of the theory of relativity.  It didn't prove anything in regards to the Earth being stationary.  That's just ridiculous and a huge misrepresentation of the experiment itself.  You know, it's absolutely annoying when people just believe whatever they see without verifying if what they saw is true or not.  Like the Michelson-Morley experiment has absolutely nothing to do with the Earth being stationary, but yet I see this point being brought up everywhere.  Literally all the flat earthers use this point, when they could just do one simple Google search and find out what the purpose of the experiment truly was.  Ridiculous. ",

But this has been proven to be false for centuries.  from the Bedford-level experiments of 1838 to modern photography.  This photograph of Chicago was taken almost 60 miles away from Grand Mere State Park in Michigan.  On a spherical Earth, this would be impossible.

For example, in this case, if you have a relatively rare condition in which a set of cold air resides below hot air, it could produce an index of refraction gradient where it is higher near the water.  Since light bends towards the normal when entering a high index, this allows the light to curve around the Earth so that we can see the Chicago skyline from over 90 kilometers away.  This actually shouldn't be a surprise to many, because light bending can be seen almost everywhere.  If there are patches of heat, for example, you can see some wavering of light because temperature can mess with the air's refraction index.  If you look at water of any sort, the light is clearly bending as well.  Hell, even the sun isn't seen to be in the correct position in the sky due to the refraction of light through the atmosphere.
