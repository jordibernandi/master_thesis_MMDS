But I lost the bunker.  I couldn't find the bunker.  Since I was there, the grass had grown up, trees had grown around it, and I lost the bunker because I put it on a 6,000 acre ranch.  And I couldn't find the bunker.  But I eventually found the bunker.  But you are going to be shocked how well concealed it is among the trees and the brush down.  So guys, enjoy this video.  At the end, I want to talk to you about this bunker some more.  So enjoy this video. ",

Now I put this bunker in like 10 years ago, and this particular bunker wasn't galvanized, but I did sandblast, and I did prime and paint it using a good paint, is why my hood, which covers my air pipe, is not rusted.  So, where is the rest of the bunker?  Oh, there's the hatch right there.  I found it.  See that right there?  That's the actual hatch to the bunker.  So here we go.  Okay.  So this is what happens when you don't come out to your bunker for a year.  The grass grows over it, trees grow over it, and you can't find it.  So where's the other air pipe?  Oh, I see it's over there.  Okay.  This will make a good video.  Okay.  So there's the other air pipe right there.  And again, the paint's holding up really good.  This is a. It's a metal hood that covers a six-inch air intake pipe.  But paint's holding up good.  But I hot dip galvanized everything now, as I was telling you.  And those two air pipes there, there and there, those are air intakes and outtakes and exhausts for a generator pod.  So... ",

And, uh... can't find it.  so you know if you fit in a bunker and give it you know a few years this is what happens.  all these trees grow up on top of it because you had fresh soil that was dug up from when you put it in the ground and the thing just disappears.  people worry about people finding it ain't gonna happen.  this ain't gonna happen.  so there's a. that's an air vent to the uh septic tank.  see there's the manhole to the septic tank right there.  all right and that's the air vent for that.  this is the fill spout for the water tank.  so you can fill it from the top.  that just turns and you can put add water to it.  um And then the entrance is right there.  This is the house.  Okay.  Wow, it's cool.  so this is a bunker we did for doomsday preppers.  you know like eight nine years ago.  i don't know how long it's been it's been a while but uh boy i'm telling you did the grass and trees grow up around it or what there's?  my little camera keeps an eye on my hats.

            "text": "so guys Damn, yeah, you can lose a bunker.  I'm not kidding you.  So let me tell you a little history about this bunker.  so you're not all hating on me in the comments below.  So when we did Doomsday Preppers, we filmed it in August, okay?  It was 100 degrees that day.  And we had this big giant film crew there, and they only give you like two days to do one of these reality TV shows.  So we had to like get everything done really fast, and it was hot.  And not only was it hot, when we finally got the bunker in the ground and we put the dirt on top of it, When you go down in the bunker, it would be like 140 degrees in there because the metal was so hot you can't even touch it.  And then we put the earth on top of it, and it concealed the heat in there.  So when you put these bunkers in the summer, if you put them in the middle of the day, man, they stay hot for like at least a month or two.  It's like, you know, it's like the earth is a great insulator.  So... So this bunker, we did not put concrete around the hatch.  We didn't do a lot of the normal things, but it was back in the early days of me doing my bunkers as well.  So, you know, the changes I've made now, we put the concrete around the hatch.  The air pipes are hot dip galvanized.  The hatches are sandblasted.  They're painted with an automotive primer and paint so they don't rust.  Just so many things that are better now.  But this is back during Doomsday Preppers, and they wanted to do an episode where my buddy Brian bought a bunker and put it in the ground.  And because we didn't really want to do it in Florida, we kind of staged it, and we did it in Texas.  Now, all my other reality TV shows I've been on, which is like 15 or 16 shows, it was all real.  And this was a real bunker.  But the only thing is we staged it on this big ranch in Texas instead of doing it in Florida because he didn't have the land to do it on.  And we're going to hit a high water table.  And in Florida, when you do a shelter and you hit water, you got to do a watertight shelter.  And this was a culvert shelter.  I'll show you a little footage of inside the bunker during the episode.  Now, as you can tell, it's a really nice bunker inside.  It has eight bunk beds.  It's got a master bedroom, a kitchen, a living room, a den.  It's actually beautiful.  And we've actually had like four or five Thanksgivings in that bunker.  But this one, as I told you, we did it just for the doomsday preppers.  And we were supposed to pull it out of the ground the next day, but it was so dang hot.  I'm like, screw it.  I'll leave it in the ground till winter.  Then I'll pull it out.  Well, Here it is like eight winters later, and I still haven't pulled it out of the ground, so I got to do it pretty soon.  So guys, I hope you enjoyed that video.  Listen, guys, I put out videos constantly.  I cover everything from bunkers to prepping guns to survival bikes.  or bug out bikes, whatever you want to call them, to anything related to prepare you for when the shit hits the fan.  So guys, if you're not a subscriber to my channel, and you better be, like and subscribe and share this video if you liked it.  Give me a big thumbs up and also hit that little bell right there so you know when more of my crazy ass videos come in.  But guys, as always, I love you.  I'll see you on the next video. ",
