            "text": "Well, it is truly a glorious day.  Thumbs up this video for the removal of the review embargo on Captain Marvel.  So now we can see what actual people give the film.  Now, in general, the way I look at reviews, it's funny to meme on it, but... It's usually somewhere between where the critics say the movie is and where the fans say the movie is.  Oftentimes, there's movies that the critics might give a 60% or 70% to, but the fans give an 80% or 90%, and I'll look at that and say, that's probably an okay movie.  Likewise, a lot of times critics will give something 80%, 90%, 95%, and the fans will give it 50%.  I'm thinking... Probably a lot of woke points.  Going to probably skip seeing that for $50 in the theater.  Early reviews are in just based on 37 in terms of Metacritic.  And we're going to look at Captain Marvel on Rotten Tomatoes, which has been going down all day.  I saw it this morning at 92.  Last time I checked, it was at 87. which is probably a middle-of-the-road Marvel film, which is exactly what I thought it would be.  But you see, The Verge giving it a 90, LA Times giving it a 90, Variety 90.  No, of course.  But let's look at IGN.  Meg Downey gives it an 83.  Rolling Stone, 80.  The Telegraph, 80.  A lot of real middling scores.  Chicago Tribune, 75.  It's just an average film.  The Playlist giving a 67.  Movie Nation, 63.  The Associated Press giving it a 63.  I spent over two hours with Captain Marvel Carol Danvers, and I still have no idea what her personality is.  Sure, there's a lot more going on in Captain Marvel, but it's pretty egregious failing considering that the creative bigwigs at Marvel had 10 years and 20 films to work it out.  Vox, Vox, one of the most far left reading outlets.  I thought they would have given this 100%.  I really did.  Vox, 60.  I was hoping for something higher, further, faster, and more.  I mean, you've got Screen Crush, another review from The Guardian.  Peter's Bradshaw giving it a 60.  I wanted a clearer, more central story for Captain Marvel's emergence to the stage and subsequent films.  if she isn't simply to get lost in the ensemble mix.  There should be more of Larson's own wit and style and indeed plausible mastery of martial arts.  In any case, Captain Marvel's entertaining.  Yeah, great translation.  It's a fine popcorn film.  And I would say really any critic is probably inflating their scores by 10 to 15 points in general.  Um, just like any real haters, probably D decreasing it, but you gotta remember these people are paid.  These people have premium access and they're still pretty, pretty strongly roasting this film.  I mean, the guardian, geez, Washington post and Hornady.  50, 50, uh, As shaky and unfocused as Captain Marvel often seems, it manages to reach its destination with confidence.  In the end, Larson sticks to landing, albeit with something more muted than absolute triumph.  The final takeaway is clear.  More movies ahead.  Sucks.  That's like, don't see it.  The A.V.  Club coming out of the onion, giving it a 50.  It's comparatively short and fast-paced by modern centers.  Unfortunately, it also has a lackluster plot, bog-standard chase scenes, and pew-pewing spaceships.  Its notable shortage of interesting characterizations and fight scene, set to no doubts just a girl, is nowhere as awesome and as silly as it should be.  Slant Magazine, 50.  IndieWire, 42.  Time Magazine!  Time Magazine giving it a 40!  A 40 out of 100!  By the time I got to the end of Captain Marvel, I heard a voice of my own inner superhero, Peggy Lee, whisper in my ear.  Is that all there is?  The most heinous supervillain of all is boredom.  The New York Post.  The New York Post giving it a 38.  What's said to be Marvel's most powerful superhero ever is served melatonin by Larson.  What?  caving there's precious little texture detail ups and downs or emotions of any kind in her performance.  oh wow imagine that it's almost like everything everybody said was true.  the character when kicking butt is a total bore whoa whoa.  And we see earlier today, Rotten Tomatoes.  Now, this is based on about 100 reviews, about the same as Metacritic.  Although the certified fresh thing on Rotten Tomatoes is always absurd.  You have to refresh this a couple times to get the most recent score.  I saw it at 92 or something earlier this morning.  It looks like the most recent score is 85.  Respectable.  However, Rotten Tomatoes will give like.  basically if you look at some of the positive reviews, OK, this is something that they reviewed as positive as shaky and unfocused as Captain Marvel often seems it manages.  Oh, we saw that.  But they rate.  they rate that as a positive.  You give it a two out of four.  A two out of four.  But then here's something interesting, right?  A plucky, pleasing, if predictable excursion that burns brightly, if briefly.  2.5 out of four.  They gave that a positive.  What?  That's a review?  That's a positive review.  But here's the interesting thing.  Here's another 2.5 out of 4, but they give that a rotten.  Shouldn't this other one be rotten or they should both be positive?  It succeeds more as amusing fill-in-the-blanks Marvel backstory provider than a confident standalone tale of a woman discovering her fierceness.  If not too long, not too self-important, it benefits from the craft and the talent of the cast.  that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law, and Ben Mendelsohn.  Didn't seem to mention Brie Larson there.  You know, it's none of these scores are that great.  I mean, three out of four.  And only the most dedicated Marvel fans will follow this captain.  Two out of four.  The character, even when kicking butt, is a total bore.  One point five out of four.  And here's a weird thing from CNN.  This is why the Rotten Tomatoes score is BS.  You tell me if this sounds positive to you.  Captain Marvel feels more obligatory than inspired, a movie that basically gets the job done and little more.  positive that's obviously a negative review.  i mean the rotten tomatoes is an absolute joke.  uh if the if the critic score is in the mid to low 80s i would predict the user score for this movie to be in the low 70s which would be brutal for marvel.  um you know you have some overwhelming positive reviews and they're entitled to that of course.  um you know it's.  It's.  nothing's really that excited.  You know, it's like scenes between Fury and Larson's.  Carol Danvers rediscovering her human past are oddly inert.  And the film's much vaunted feminism promise in months of run up advertising and interviews gets short shrift.  meaning it doesn't really cover.  And here's the other thing.  Here's a 3.5, but it gave them a rotten.  And a 2.5, I don't even understand.  I'm just looking at top critics.  You can see, obviously, there's definitely plenty of positive, people saying positive.  But again, do you think Marvel's happy with a B-?  Do you think Marvel's happy seeing positives, getting a 6 out of 10?  a six out of ten to me is absolutely a negative review.  captain marvel is a recorded mixtape of familiar mcu beats that set carol danvers up for success but as a period standalone struggles with anything we haven't yet seen from superheroes.  so boring right boring um.  and it'll be interesting to see how far the actual um Superhero reviews go.  The formal reviewers probably all be in by Thursday or Friday.  Being in the mid-80s on Rotten Tomatoes means it's currently getting beat by two other films in the movies right now.  How to Train Your Dragon and The Lego Movie are both outranking it.  Here you have David Elric from IndieWire.  captain marvel is just another superhero movie and not a particularly good one at that deep sigh.  my review uh as generic and retrograde as black panther was specific and revolutionary.  captain marvel is a frustrating disappointment and at a time when every inclusive blockbuster is fought over as though it would be decisive battle in our never-ending culture wars wow So what they're saying is, I wanted this to be a woke moment, but unfortunately, I have to be honest, and the movie stunk.  And then there's also a lot of really interesting stuff going on with reviews that, in my opinion, seem like people are afraid to tell the truth.  Here we have Rodrigo saying, who is, uh, an editor at rotten tomatoes.  Okay.  Uh, very sad and bummed to report.  Captain Marvel did not do it for me at all.  Could say so much more, but don't want to feed the incels.  Maybe later in this thread could say more, but feminists and my employers would ruin my career.  If claims of me being a Nazi.  Yeah.  I knew it.  I knew this movie would suck.  I knew it.  I knew it.  And then this is not just like bits and pieces of reviews.  Okay.  There are, I mean, I think I might do a live stream.  Should we do a live stream tonight and just read through all the reviews of the movie and laugh?  Get our popcorn together.  That might actually be more entertaining.  In fact, I've just decided.  Watch out for a live stream on this channel somewhere around 6 o'clock tonight.  We're going to read some reviews.  Captain Marvel review.  Brie Larson underwhelms in clumsy, clunky superhero movie.  Here's another one.  Review.  Captain Marvel sputters and sparks but never gets to escape velocity.  The film is an un-aerodynamic vehicle of uncertain design packed carelessly with origin storylets and pop-cultural flotsam.  Floatsam?  I don't know.  Captain Marvel.  Review.  Brie Larson isn't given enough to do in the Marvel movie that marinates in 90s nostalgia, but doesn't quite rise to the occasion of its own significance.  Zoinks.  I mean, AV Club.  The dream of 90s is alive in the underwhelming Captain Marvel.  How about The Hollywood Reporter?  Captain Marvel.  Film Review.  Brie Larson stars as a titular hero in the Marvel adaptation, also featuring Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law, and Gemma Chan, and Annette Bening.  Seems good, right?  Okay, all right.  Captain Marvel has two distinctions.  In its first Marvel Studios film, they built around a female superhero, and it is the least of Marvel productions made since Kevin Feige took the reins.  The least, and it is the least.  Oh, yikes.  The picture is not dull, exactly, just mundane.  Marked by unimaginative plotting, cut-rate villains, bland visual style, and a lack of Elan in every department.  Or put it this way, what Black Panther did for representation in superhero realm is not done for women in Captain Marvel.  And if it came down to one-on-one between rival franchises Uber Warriors, Wonder Woman, and Captain Marvel, there is no doubt who would inspire the heavy betting.  As had been widely recounted during the ramp-up of the film's opening, the history of women in Marvel Universe is a patchy one, very much so.  The latter first appeared as a man in the comics in 1967.  Miss Marvel counterpart, blah, blah, blah.  This much is clear.  One should be grateful for small favors as matters presently become more than murky.  This does not sound like a great review.  Still the focus and big selling point here is Captain Marvel herself and Larson's impersonation of her.  So what does a Best Actress Oscar winner bring to a performance as a Marvel superhero?  Larson makes Carol Captain focus... solid, ever alert to what's going around her, a quick learner and determined and unafraid warrior.  In other words, she's everything you'd want and expect in a soldier, intergalactic or otherwise.  But all of this is more or less prescribed by the role.  What's lacking is humor, a hint that she might get off on the action and violence or the indication of a deep desire or spark to ferret out evil and right the world's wrongs.  The performance is fine.  even if not exciting or inspiring.  Yikes!  Yikes!  Jackson aside, the other actors are stuck with one note on interesting roles, including Annette Bening, who is very briefly as a character called Supreme Intelligence.  Maybe she should have been taken a pass at that script.  Whoa!  Zoinks!  Zoinks.  You know, again, just a meme.  Not having a mental breakdown.  Definitely enjoying the warm touch of a woman every now and again on my birthday and on anniversary.  So I'm definitely not an incel.  Just laughing when, you know, the main takeaway here is when you expect ideology to buoy a film, you're going to fail.  OK, they should have focused on making the film good first rather than obsessing over message.  This is like the same thing that we saw with The Last Jedi.  And now we're seeing it happen to Captain Marvel, which will be all but forgotten in a year's time.  I hope you enjoyed this video.  We'll talk to you again real soon. ",
