            "text": "I've never done this before.  I'm going to talk about my experience with the Mormon temple rituals and explain a little about them.  If you're not familiar with those rituals, you're not alone.  To the extent that non-members are familiar, the information is likely plagued with misconceptions.  There are four Mormon temple rituals, baptism for the dead, washing and anointing, the endowment, and sealing.  Baptism for the dead is where you get baptized into the Mormon church for someone who is already well into their dirt nap.  This gives them the opportunity in the next life to either accept or reject that baptism which must be done with a physical body and is required to reach the upper echelons of the Mormon heaven.  Mormons don't really have a hell and that's admirable.  But honestly, if you're already in the next life and you're still existing, I don't quite understand why anyone would reject such a thing if that's what it takes to climb Mount Godhood.  Seems like a no-brainer to me.  But perhaps the brain doesn't survive death.  The washing and anointing ritual is the strangest.  In this ritual, you go into a curtained, shower-like area with very little clothing on, though it's not sexual in any way, for most.  There, a worker of your own gender washes your various body parts, the non-filthy ones at least, first with water and then oil, blessing each body part as they go.  If I'm remembering correctly, this is also where you get your new name?  I have no idea what that's about, but I thought my new name, Moses, made me a badass.  Let my peeps go!  The endowment is the biggie.  This is where you get all the really deep, under-the-radar spiritual enlightenment.  Not.  In most cases, Mormons are shown a film about Adam and Eve, Lucifer, the creation,  etc.,  which is constantly interrupted by the need to get up out of your seat, put on various items of clothing, take certain oaths, and learn various special words, phrases, and handshakes.  It almost feels Catholic with all the up and down.  Then you go to the veil and demonstrate your knowledge of the various elements of the endowment ceremony.  Phrases, handshakes, etc.  Which is a little like YouTube keywords or Twitter hashtags.  Once that's over, you go through the veil and are welcomed into the celestial room, the crown jewel of the temple.  It's a little like a library without any books.  Woohoo!  Finally, when you find that certain someone to love, so long as they're of the opposite gender, you can be sealed to that person for time and all eternity, what Mormons call eternal or celestial marriage.  Somehow this applies to children as well, though no one has really seemed to work out the logistics on that one.  Do you belong to your spouse or to your parents?  I guess it depends on whose seal is the better swimmer.  Honest to Hitch, we live to 80 and can't keep it together with one other person.  What are these people thinking?  And do you really want to be tied to your family for time and all eternity?  I don't know about you, but I'm pushing the down button on that elevator faster than you can say.  health in the navel, marrow in the bones.  The worst thing you can say about these rituals is that They are boring as f***.  I was always having to wake up the person sitting next to me as one of the standing parts was coming up.  My old music partner fell asleep almost every time, though he was diagnosed with sleep apnea some 30 years later.  My favorite moment in a Mormon temple came when my bishop seated next to me offered me a lifesaver in the middle of the endowment ceremony, which seemed really inappropriate, especially coming from a bishop.  Then he proceeded to nearly choke to death.  I actually let him gasp and struggle longer than I should because I felt weird about Heimlich-ing him in the temple.  I mean, we're in the temple.  God's got this, right?  Sorry, Bishop.  I still feel bad about that.  Though the real fun came when the lifesaver flew out of his mouth, hitting the person in front of him in the back of the head.  We spent the rest of that ceremony trying to keep ourselves from laughing our asses off.  That was my most enlightening visit ever.  If you'd like to know more or want me to go deeper, leave a comment with your questions and... comments.  Till we meet again, I'm me.  Thanks for watching. ",
