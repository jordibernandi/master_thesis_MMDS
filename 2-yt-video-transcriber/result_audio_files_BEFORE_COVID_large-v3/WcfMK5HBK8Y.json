            "text": "I built this in... April, this year, sorry.  April 2019.  And so, we're just getting there.  Oh, people often ask me, why do the houses have burglar bars?  Because the windows are open.  It's a hot country, so you always leave your windows open.  So for security reason, you just have these bars in order to stop people from just walking into your house.  So that's the reason why.  So people were asking.  So this is the living room.  So these are the wires.  Hello, my darlings.  How are you?  Thank you for working.  You all right?  So what are we doing?  So all the woodworks have been done.  Obviously, the roof has been done.  What we're doing now is putting up what here is called the platters.  But in England, we call it the ceiling.  So this is what these guys are doing.  They're doing all the coves and the alcoves.  and putting them up.  So this is the living area.  This will be the living area when it's done.  And that leads into here.  Imagine the doors have been done.  Into a kitchen diner area.  Now for me, I'm a modest lady, so I just wanted a simple lighthouse.  So this is the kitchen diner area.  And that's the storeroom.  And this is the back door, which isn't open at the moment, but which will.  Here we are, all of my lovely fruit trees and my swimming pool.  So, going to have a pool.  But let me show you the bedroom.  So this is the four-bedroom house.  And I've gone for the open plan.  look because I'm an outdoor person so I probably won't be spending much time actually in the house.  I'll be spending a lot of time outside the house, probably by the pool or even in all of these beautiful natural areas around here.  But I'll show you the first bedroom.  So this is bedroom one.  Now you see what I was saying about the boat, the faster you leave the window open, you've got here, so you've got security.  But there's still air coming in.  This is a very cool, the en-suite bathroom for bedroom one.  At the moment, it's gonna be quite dark for you to see.  So, this is the room.  This is area two.  Sorry, area two, did you hear me?  The windows being opened for air.  And also, they have on these things, which are called nets, so they prevent any insects from entering into the house, as you can see.  They find it quite hard to enter in through the little meshes.  So this is the ensuite shower, toilet, ensuite bedroom two.  This is the guest bathroom.  And this is the guest bathroom.  which will have a shower, toilet and sink in there.  And also probably a small TV.  And this is the guest bedroom, which is bedroom three.  So they're fairly nice sized rooms as well.  And you imagine, for \u00a31,800, the fact that it's worth between \u00a36,000 to \u00a38,000 now, is that a good profit margin, isn't it?  Yes.  Really?  Yeah.  So, and putting a house on it, of course, exponentially increases the value.  So, this is the master bedroom.  And the master bedroom.  Hey, guys, I'm filming.  You have to be quiet for me a minute.  Okay?  Thank you.  So this is the master bedroom, which of course is the biggest bedroom, which of course is mine.  Look at the view.  Imagine waking up and seeing that.  And people have talked about why do you have walls.  People have walls because they're compounds.  But as you can see, you can stand up and look over the walls.  So it's not like you're in prison.  This is a country location.  And it's a provincial location.  So much nature in this jacuzzi bath in it.  And a shower unit.  And a toilet.  And basin.  And that all-important bum wash.  Yeah, got to have one of those.  Yeah.  This is the inside of the house.  And then, of course, the whole thing is surrounded by one passageway and back into the open, planned wooden room.  And I'm very minimalist, so there's not going to be very much in here except for maybe a television and a couple of sofas and maybe one coffee table.  So you'll have enough space to run around in and be comfortable.  And also, there will only probably be one dining room table.  So I'm going for the minimalist effect.  So it'll be comfortable and... It will definitely be home here in Gambia.  And the price, people have asked me, you know, how much have you paid to build?  How much have you paid for this?  We're actually still working on those costs because we're actually still building.  So I can't give you a full cost because we're still paying as we're going.  And you pay as you go Africa.  But what I can say is if you're going to look at building, you're probably looking at between 150, depending on the size of the house, up to 300,000, depending on the size of the house, if you're working with local builders as opposed to contractors, or you can work with a contractor.  And, of course, for those assurances and guarantees, you can pay a little bit more.  And so this area is going to be like a sort of chill-out area around the side.  So we're going to have a thing called a banter bar.  Not very popular in England because you don't have the sun, I guess.  But a banter bar is like a bar area outside.  So we're going to have that here, there.  And then this area, this whole area... From there around there is going to be a swimming pool all the way down to here and then here we're just going to have some plants which we're going to have around the front as well.  We're going to have our mango trees, our coconut, our palm trees, orange trees and so on and a pool, a swimming pool.  So the pool will probably come up to about here from that wall all the way across.  And what that is, you might be asking me, what is that structure there?  That is our borehole.  So we actually get our natural water from inside of the ground.  So when I was talking about people drinking desanitized water, this is what I was talking about because you're going through sewage.  When you drink, there's obviously a lock on it and a cap, so I can't actually show you, but that's just because we're not on the property at the moment, and that's the pump down here.  But the water comes from the ground.  So you're actually drinking natural mineral water.  You're not drinking reflushed toilet water that has hormones and medicines and pharmaceuticals in it.  You're actually drinking fresh, natural groundwater.  And that's really important.  So this will actually serve the whole house.  And so it's important.  We're also going to have solar panels on our house, so we're going to be off the grid.  So we'll be relying on the sun for our energy.  And we're going to have a barbecue area, which is going to be around the front, which we're going to depend on in order to cook our outdoor meals and to have lots of fun, because we're going to have lots of parties here.  so yeah if you're coming home and you wanted to see you know actual build.  um we're going through the process.  so we're just showing you what it's like.  and also like i said you can choose the kind of roof you want as well so you can reduce the price of your build.  so yeah this is um Wow, it's been an amazing day, just out in the sun, out and about at Blacksit.  And I want to go through the other points, so I'm going to quickly pull out my phone, because I wrote notes for you.  See, I've been doing preparation.  And these notes are based on... These notes are based on the fact that you've asked me questions.  And so I'm trying to answer all your questions.  And so what I've done is I've created a five point plan.  And so that's what I did.  So the first point I shared with you out front was you must go see.  Very important.  uh the second is research everything that you need to know.  so research building materials research the area that you want to live in research the business that you want to do.  now i've got a lot of businesses to show you and so just bear with me every time i put out another um vlog.  we put out another vlog black sit vlog.  it'll be sharing um another aspect of life here.  and the third point i thought is do a budget do a financial plan and a business plan based around your business.  So say, for example, for us, we went to see and we realised that retail business is booming here, so we decided that we wanted to do a shop.  But we also realised that we wanted to do import-export, and we also wanted to do consultancy.  So those are the areas that we wanted to do.  What was the consultancy we wanted to work on?  was looking at potential development areas and also tourism businesses.  So while you're here, living here, you can also be doing that very important feasibility study.  That's really important.  And then four... go back again.  So you've been, you've seen it, yeah, you've fallen in love, you know, that was your romantic or if you like, afromantic trip.  Now, when you go back, you must have practical eyes on and then you do your costing.  This is when you do everything.  You look at estimates for everything.  You meet with your builders.  You look at various plots of land.  So this is what I would do.  Or you go and look at houses that you're potentially going to buy or you're going to rent.  You look at vacant shops or... If you're going to do a workshop, for example, you fix cars, then you look at workshops where you can put that workshop, for example.  Or if you want to go and do sewing here and you want to make bedding or what have you, then you look for that all-important place where you can go and do that and the kind of staffing you can get and support.  And you look at salaries.  You look at practical aspects of being here.  So that was number four, I think.  Go back, see again.  Oh, yeah.  And I just said, look at.  Yeah.  And I also look at the conversion.  Look at your currency conversion and look how far your pound or your dollar or whatever currency you have goes.  So another thing is always, always, always, you know, keep your connections that you've made here and keep in contact with them.  Very important.  so that you keep that ongoing relationship so all the work you've done isn't lost so you don't have to come back and start again and you can't remember where they live.  you can't remember where they were you can't remember their number you haven't got their email address so keep everybody's contact details.  and five Before you go, obviously, if you're coming here to stay, make sure you've renewed your passports, you've got a few years on it, your visa.  when you book your flight, and when you arrive, you organise your residency and your work permit, your driving licences, and they're all very simple, to be honest with you.  Very simple, quick and easy to do here where we did ours within a few weeks.  And so, you know, you give yourself time to acclimatize into the environment.  So don't start work straight away.  Actually give yourself like a two week holiday and explore the country.  And here in Gamia, there's so much to see.  So yeah, those are my five points.  I hope you like them.  Juliet saying, smash that like button.  Yes, I haven't forgotten.
