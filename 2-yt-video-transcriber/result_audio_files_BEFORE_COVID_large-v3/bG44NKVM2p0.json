For freedoms, choices, beliefs.  Thank you for your oath.  Thank you for 2 a.m.  night watches, 5 a.m.  rocket watches, for scrubbing, mopping, and plunging, for papers, plans, and routes.  Thank you for following orders, leading your team, and carrying your brothers back home.  Thank you, veterans, for sticking to your oath so that we all can wake up to another quiet morning tomorrow.
