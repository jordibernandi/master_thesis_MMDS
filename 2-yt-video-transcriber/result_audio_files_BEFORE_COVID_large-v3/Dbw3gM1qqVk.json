            "text": "This is an Instagram post from March 1st, 2019.  It shows three men in front of a bullet-riddled sign memorializing Emmett Till, a Black 14-year-old who was tortured, shot, and killed by white men in 1955.  In July, ProPublica and the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting published the names of these men.  Here's how we figured out who they were.  The picture was taken here in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, close to where Till's body was found in the Little Tallahatchie River.  The original image was posted by Ben LeClair, who was wishing his friend John a happy birthday.  This is LeClair on the left.  The post included these two other images that we assumed were of John, and a user named John Lowe commented on the post.  We looked at Lowe's Instagram feed and saw this photo of him with his dad.  He tagged the photo in Glendora, Mississippi, just a mile and a half west of the Emmett Till Memorial.  A quick property record search showed that this property was owned by Lowe's grandmother.  So we knew he had been in the area.  We also compared one of the original images in LeClaire's post to a photo Lowe posted to his own Instagram.  The source who sent us the picture thought the man on the right was Lowe, and we initially identified him that way.  But after more scrutiny, we realized that Lowe is this guy, squatting, and we corrected our article.  So who was the man on the right, holding an AR-15?  We found LeClaire and Lowe were members of the Kappa Alpha fraternity at the University of Mississippi, so we reviewed dozens of Instagram posts by Kappa Alpha members looking for the third man.  We identified three people in LeClaire and Lo's circle of friends who physically resembled the man, but to confirm anything, we needed more.  So we asked our Instagram followers for help.  And they sent us names, one we already had, HowLogan, showed up again and again.  We'd already identified Logan in pictures with other Kappa Alpha members.  His Instagram is private, but we compared our images to other pictures on social media, including Venmo and Facebook.  We also found this video of him posted by his high school.  His face clearly matched our guy.  At that point, we were totally sure that the man on the right was Howell Logan.  So we published his name and identified him as the man holding the AR-15 in the photo. ",
