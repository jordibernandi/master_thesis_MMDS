            "text": "In the US, the rich enjoy many benefits that allow them to keep their wealth in the family.  One of those is something called legacy preferences or legacy admissions.  That's when colleges and universities give preference to applicants based on their familial relationships.  So if a student's parents attended the school, the student will receive preferential treatment and be more likely to be accepted over students whose parents didn't go to that school.  Schools call those students by many different names, legacies, legacy affiliation, even scions, but all share the same traits.  They're usually white and rich, and they typically have lower GPAs and test scores than the rest of the incoming class.  That might sound extremely unfair, but the reality is it's incredibly common, especially here in the United States, and it's been going on a very long time.  Throughout the 19th century, wealthy Americans routinely received priority in college admissions, but colleges became frustrated by these privileged students' academic performances, so they raised admission standards.  As a result, more poor people, immigrants, Jewish people, and Catholics were admitted to schools.  This upset wealthy Protestant Americans who were used to their kids getting into any school they wanted.  So the practice of legacy admissions began and continues to this day.  More than 33% of legacy applicants are currently admitted to Harvard.  That's more than five times the rate of non-legacy applicants.  The University of Virginia currently admits about 47% of legacy applicants.  That's about double the rate of non-legacy applicants.  Princeton, Brown, Yale, Notre Dame, they've all admitted to giving preference to legacy applicants.  Of course, just getting into an Ivy League school doesn't guarantee that you'll be rich or successful in life, but the majority of the world's wealthiest people have degrees from prestigious universities.  Our presidents, Supreme Court justices, and corporate elite attend Ivy League schools more often than not.  And it's not just because they have access to the country's best professors or curricula.  A lot of it has to do with the access to peers who will go on to hold influential positions or in other words, networking.  Today, 67% of Americans believe academic achievement should be the biggest factor in college admissions, and the same amount believe the application process favors the rich and powerful.  That's why it's time to revisit the unfair practice of legacy admissions at our top universities, just like we did a century ago.  And you don't have to attend an Ivy League school to figure that out. ",
