            "text": "Hey guys, it's your old pal Senable here and today we'll be discussing fringe political ideologies.  Fringe as in odd, they, don't make much sense, and probably only 12 people actually believe in them, unironically.  Wait, fringe political ideologies?  So, like, liberalism, because clearly no one wants liberalism.  I mean, it's not like it's a huge portion of the world that wants liberalism or something.  Everyone hates them liberals.  So, the first fringe political ideology that we'll be talking about... Although when you actually got to the top of the video, instead of spending 700 million years telling us about the topic... Followed by an unfunny skit.  So, the first ideology we'll be talking about is Passatism.  Now, Passatism was founded in 1962 by J. Passatus, and Passatism is a branch of Trotskyism, which itself is a branch of Marxism, which itself, Marxism, is a branch of Communism.  Now, Passatism I have some pretty weird ideas.  One, they believe that humans can communicate with dolphins and possibly other animals.  Second, they believe that the only way to bring about a workers' revolution is a nuclear holocaust.  Wait, wait a minute.  Nuclear?  Nuclear?  Not nuclear, nuclear, nuclear, because there's totally a Y in there.  So the third thing that Posadas believe in is water birthing.  Don't know what it is, it's like water birthing.  The fourth thing they believe in is that eventually humans will produce asexually or they won't need a partner to create another human.  Again, I really don't know what this has to do with anything, but it's part of their ideology, and that's not political in any way, shape, or form.  And fifth, they believe that any aliens who do visit the Earth will have to be communist, or else they would have never developed the technology needed to leave their home planet.  So it's basically Heaven's Gate, but instead of Marshall Apple White, it's Marshall Apple Red.  Get it?  Communism?  Red?  Wait, wait a minute.  Am I outside?  Ew, I better get inside.  I probably caught something.  Ah, now that I'm back in the set, let's talk about strasserism.  Now, strasserism.  is a political ideology that calls for the heavy persecution of Jews.  But tracerous anti-Semitism isn't based off of racial reasons, which by the way, Jews aren't a race, but you know, let's not think about that because if you ponder Nazism for more than 10 seconds, it makes no sense.  But back to what I was saying.  A Strasserist anti-Semitism isn't based off of racial, cultural, or religious reasons.  Strasserists hate Jews because of an outdated stereotype.  Ooh, I love outdated stereotypes!  Which one is this?  So, the stereotype that builds up Strasserist anti-Semitism is the idea that Jews are greedy, which that might sound weird to you because Nazis love greedy people.  I mean, they're all anarcho-capitalists, but here's the thing.  Stressorism is basically communism, but it hates Jews.  Wow, what a combination.  Last, we'll be talking about anarcho-monarchism.  Yes, you heard that right.  Anarcho-monarchism.  Anarcho, meaning no leaders, and monarchism, meaning a hereditary line of leaders.  I know, it makes absolutely zero sense, but just stick with it, because a lot of things don't make sense.  Anarcho-monarchism.  That's a good joke.  I'm going to write it down.  If only I could, because I'm a doll.  So, anarcho-monarchists believe in abolishing the government and then founding a royal family whose sole purpose is to prevent the government from being reestablished.  Yes, there are people who actually believe this.  And all this leaves the question, how did anarcho-monarchism emerge?  How many people really believe in it?  How can a single human mind be so incompetent that it would consider itself an anarcho-monarchist?  I'm Seamble.  This has been National Geographic. ",
