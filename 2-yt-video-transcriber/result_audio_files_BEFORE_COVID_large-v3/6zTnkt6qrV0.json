            "text": "You know, looking back on 10 years of doing these videos, the worst thing by far has been the slow, depressing, in fact, heartbreaking way that I've learned to correct myself when I'm speaking about my own country.  I find myself saying, this used to be a free country, or the Constitution clearly states, you remember the Constitution, don't you?  Or that's just a red-handed, open felony.  You can't get away with something like that unless, of course, you're a high-ranking Democrat or liberal celebrity, you know, those kind of things.  I've been so heartbroken for so long that I find myself able to speak of freedom, our rights, and most especially the rule of law only in the past tense.  Now I remember parts of this ongoing process.  I remember President Obama's brand new Attorney General, Eric Holder, publicly refused to prosecute flagrant voter intimidation on the part of the Black Panthers because, quote, I think it does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line, who risked all for my people.  I remember hearing that, and I said out loud, I thought, we're all your people now, Mr.  Holder.  I can remember Nancy Pelosi saying that we had to pass the health care bill in order to find out what was in it.  I remember Chief Justice John Roberts later ruling that the penalty provided for in that health care law was indeed a tax, and that if it had been called a tax at the time the bill came up, it never would have passed in the first place.  I also remember that he didn't vacate the law on this basis.  It was just something of passing interest to we history fans.  I remember men dying on a rooftop in Benghazi, giving their lives for a government that had already canceled a rescue attempt, leaving them to fight for six or seven hours, wondering when the good guys would arrive.  I remember a filmmaker being arrested by 26 state troopers in the middle of the night and then spending a year behind bars for having made a film that Secretary Clinton and President Obama claimed was responsible for that catastrophe in Benghazi.  And I remember Dinesh D'Souza doing six months in prison for an innocent and trivial violation of a campaign law that Democratic donors flouted with impunity and continues to do so to this very day.  I remember the treasonous breach of national security set in motion by Hillary Clinton's arrogance, laziness, and corruption.  I remember her lying to the American people on camera and then to Congress under oath that no laws had been broken and that no classified information had been sent.  And I remember as the leader of the law enforcement agency formerly known as the Untouchables.  See, I did it again.  Formerly known as the Untouchables.  stood in front of the world's television cameras and spent 40 minutes confirming that every assertion that Mrs.  Clinton made was untrue, that multiple felonies had occurred, along with massive and criminal breaches of basic national security, but that no reasonable prosecutor would take the case.  Yes, I remember exactly how I felt when I heard that news.  I remember Brett Kavanaugh defending himself against the charges brought by a liar and a perjurer assisted by a senior United States senator in a last-ditch effort to derail the constitutional approval process for the Supreme Court in a desperate bid to keep hold of power for the Democratic Party.  And I remember that Democratic Party's presidential candidate leaving her supporters literally standing out in the rain because she was either too drunk or too hysterical or both to perform the simple courtesy that marked every other presidential defeat in living memory.  I remember her charge that she lost because of the Russians.  I remember an investigation that was built on lies told by the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, another group of Americans whom I had formerly great respect for.  I remember all of that, and so do you.  I watched them all walk away, scot-free and smirking, and I've had to spend the last three years of my life explaining to my Russian wife that this country used to be different, that you used to be able to speak your mind without fear of being assaulted based on who you voted for.  that you used to celebrate the opportunity to hear differences of opinion on university campuses rather than smashing windows and burning them to the ground in order to avoid having to hear any different opinions.  And the hardest part has been trying to explain that there was a time not too long ago when a sitting president of the United States was forced out of office, rightfully forced out of office, for covering up some minor burglary.  back when there was some semblance of a free press that was duty-bound to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, regardless of what party they belonged to.  But, but, a few days ago, I watched one of these deep state elitist determiners of what was best for the American people answer some questions about how the Mueller investigation started.  John Brennan, who was instrumental in launching this slow motion failed coup d'etat, was explaining how everything he did was completely legal and overseen by the FISA court the whole way.  And I had two instant reactions to that interview.  My first thought is that he's doing precisely what Hillary Clinton did when faced with her criminal email practices, namely assert and then reinsert that everything she did was strictly legal and had been overseen every step of the way.  She was lying.  I knew she was lying.  You knew she was lying.  And I knew Brennan was lying, too, when he said that the court had approved the surveillance of candidate Donald Trump, although it did take Trey Gowdy to point out to me what should have been obvious, namely that courts rule based on the evidence presented to them and have no way of knowing the information given to them is indeed factually accurate.  And that's when I realized my second thought.  He's scared.  Brennan is really scared.  Comey's scared, too.  They're all scared.  they're throwing all the mud they can to convince the American people that Donald Trump is a tyrant and Attorney General Bill Barr nothing more than a political hack, which is pretty rich, really, coming from a peerless American tyrant and her retinue of political hacks.  But for the first time in 10 years, ",
