            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with the weekly perspective for the week ending 27 December 2019.  Well this will be obviously the last one for 2019 and the next one I do should be on the 3rd of January 2020.  Well the last week or two I went through the um all the metals basically what they did for the year.  But just in case you missed that podcast, it won't take but a few minutes here or a minute or so.  So for the year, aluminum was off about 5%.  Cobalt was down 42.  Copper is only up 3%.  Lead off 5%.  Nickel was the big winner there in the base metals.  And that was 34%.  Tin off 11% and zinc down about 7%.  For the precious metals, Gold was up 15% on the year.  Palladium, 46%.  Platinum, 14%.  So almost as much as gold, not quite.  And silver was laggard, up 11% for the year.  And of course, the gold-silver ratio got to pretty much, not record high, but as high as it's been for some time.  It's backed off somewhat.  And the equities... The HUI was up 37%, and the XAU up about 38%, so obviously the equities outperformed the metals themselves.  And then crude oil was up 33.7% for the year, heating oil up about 20%, natural gas off about 21%, and gasoline up around 30%.  So although we are hearing constantly from the mainstream financial press that that the economy is strong and lots is going on with the new administration and on and on.  The truth of the matter is the Baltic Dry Index is actually one of the best indicators as far as what's really going on.  There is a little bit of discrepancy in any of these graphs because the way these ships that are used to transport goods across the oceans are now relative to what they were a decade ago, but I don't have time to go into that.  Generally speaking, the index is pretty representative of how much trade's really taking place.  So you can see from this zero hedge article that the Baltic index has basically been falling.  Oh, since what?  September, August, September of this year.  And it's not as low as it's been back in February, but obviously it's trending down.  So this next article, Charles Hugh Smith, obviously I bring him up fairly often and he is a great thinker.  I have not yet to meet him.  Hopefully I will at some point.  Regardless, the market crash is baked in.  Here's why.  I won't read the whole article.  If you get this on Friday or even Saturday, it might be worth reading.  I certainly think it is.  Basically, control markets never work.  He goes into, I'll give an outline of that at the beginning, and then he talks, if you want a refresher, you can read The White Man's Burden, why the West's efforts to aid the rest have done so much ill and so little good.  Excuse me, the only programs that work to improve the lives of the impoverished are those that enable small-scale markets in which participants make their own decisions rather than the consequences of decisions made by central planners.  Something to say about socialism.  I won't read the whole thing.  I will say that he's a great thinker, deep thinker, and he writes some great stuff.  I'll leave it there.  Well, a lot is going on in the banking system, and I've already discussed the... My thoughts on the repo market, I won't do it here, but my last interview with Reluctant Preppers, I went into it fairly deeply.  And there's a lot of people commenting on it.  Bixweir just did an update, I think, the last day or two.  There are others.  But the point of this update or this perspective at the end of the year here is how many jobs have been lost.  In the banking sector, tens of thousands of jobs have been lost across Europe's banks this year as lenders get grips with stricter research rules, lower negative interest rates, and depressed market activity.  There will be a shift.  There will be a reset.  There will be something that takes place, probably not only in the monetary system, but probably in the currency system as well.  And it looks to me as if the push toward a cashless society is almost 100% predictable.  Of course, nothing in life's 100%, but I think it's very, very likely that we will see a cashless system.  Stansberry Research did a update on one of the best money-making opportunities ever.  The whole hour and a half presentation was basically about China, and it's a very good overview of China and what's really going on in China without the American propaganda to filter your thinking.  And in that documentary, what it shows is over and over again, that almost everyone that's in a city or town, whatever town means with a 1.4 billion population uses their phone for transactions.  There's like no cash, and there's like no credit cards.  It's like everything is done through, I think it's called WeChat or there's one other, I think it's Tencent or something like that, that uses the phone only for transactions as small as a 7-Eleven type store all the way up to your car payment or anything else.  So quite interesting.  So coming back to this article on the banks offering so many employees and that trend to continue, Competition in Europe is fierce.  The top five investment banks in Europe's all bulge bracketed American institutions able to defend their market share with huge balance sheets on the other end of the market.  New boutiques such as Roby Warsaw have won a staggering amount of share in the merger and acquisitions markets.  This is talking about the investment banks and what they're doing.  And of course, there's so much that they do with nothing more than a lot of paper and a lot of leverage.  If things continue to be concerned, the question for the staff of big banks is whether the bloodletting will continue to 2020.  I would say it will.  And we may come back to this Deutsche Bank.  I think it's interesting to use that as a picture on this article.  So let me move forward.  And this is from, I will call him a friend, Casey.  I don't know if Doug wrote this article or not.  Jeff Thomas wrote, sorry.  Farewell to paper money.  You can read it.  It's basically what I talked about just a second ago.  But there is a lot going on in China with their social credit system and the way they transact their monetary affairs on a citizen up level.  And this is what's coming, folks.  This is what you can look forward to.  And of course, cryptocurrencies are not what a lot of people think.  A lot of people think that they're basically free of government control.  And some are at this point in time, but any government with the power that they have to flick the internet on and off, think about it.  If there is a competing cryptocurrency that is strong enough to really upset the powers that be, what do you think will take place?  And I wrote about that on my two bits on Bitcoin Mini Mini.  Years ago now and I stand by it and I'm not against it.  I'm for monetary competition, you know, whatever the people can come up with to compete with the banking elites system.  However, I am a little remiss to think that these cryptocurrencies are totally the answer.  I'm really not sure.  I really doubt it personally.  But if you're involved and you like them and you think they're great, go ahead.  But think again as far as how anonymous you are.  First of all, you've got to go through an exchange usually.  I know there are ways around that.  I don't know exactly the details, but I'm sure there are.  There always are.  But for the most part, you're going to have to register with the stage, know your customer, know who he is or she is or they are, what the principle of the business is or the entity involved or whatever.  So basically, this is a track all, know all, see all, do all, be all, and have every transaction started.  Basically on the blockchain so it can be tracked and taxed.  That's really what it's all about.  And of course, remove cash altogether.  The next article up is from Reuters.  Russia could consider investing part of the National Wealth Fund in gold.  From Moscow, Reuters.  Russia could consider investing part of its National Wealth Fund in gold, finance minister.  Anton, which was last name, said, adding that he sees investment in the precious metals as more suitable in the long term than in financial assets.  What a concept.  And by the way, this is really what's going on.  I mean, the banks have been buying.  I did an interview with Kitco.  It should be written up and out shortly.  And I'm sure that the writer for Kitco interviewed many, not just myself.  But you've got to watch what's being done and not what's being said.  And what's being done is these banks continue to take on more metal.  Russia is one of the world's largest gold producers.  While Central Bank has been the main buyer of its metal in recent years, when partly due to Western sanctions imposed on Moscow in 2014, the Central Bank was reducing the share of U.S.  dollar assets, U.S.  reserves.  So I'm going to just conclude with a little bit about... where we are in the market.  on the metal side gold has turned higher.  i put out a update on a video for our paid members.  there was a gap up a couple weeks ago.  i said i'm pretty certain that the bottom is in.  i know i've said that the metals have gotten the lowest uh print of the year at the last trading day of the year several times and that's true that's a fact but that doesn't necessarily mean this year would be the one it's not.  I did put out an update again, as I said, to say this is it.  I'm pretty certain that we're going up from here.  And since I made that update for our paid members, it has done exactly that.  The gold miners have been doing better than the metal over the last couple of months.  And you can see that if you plot the GDX versus the GLD relative strength ratio, give you a good picture of it showing that the shares are outperforming.  Silver and its miners are even stronger, and this is just short term.  This is for the year, what I read at the beginning here.  We're just talking about the recent weeks, the last three weeks or so.  But in that time frame, the silver shares, the SLV, is rising above the trend line, and it's in the process of turning up rather substantially.  It's rising faster than gold.  Remember the time frame I just told you.  And this could be seen if you, again, plot the same ratio just on the SLV versus GLD or a gold-silver ratio.  I'll show you that.  Silver led gold higher in July and August when they were both rising.  And that is interesting.  And the silver miners are outperforming the gold miners.  They're actually leading the rally.  Global X silver miners ETF, which is symbol SIL, is rising to the highest level in nearly four months.  And nearing a test of the early September high.  So silver shares are pretty much screaming at you that silver is doing well right now and probably will continue for at least into the early part of January 2020. think that uh and i'll be writing about this probably in the public domain or at least be doing probably a webinar what i see for the 2020 uh time frame as far as precious metals are concerned very few are willing to say the stock market's not going to have a good year especially knowing that the administration wants a very strong stock market.  so they can point point point at the big big big number and say everything's wonderful.  look at the stock market which Anyone that reads Charles Hugh Smith, myself, or several others in the, let's say, alternative financial press, have said over and over again that these all markets are manipulated, and it's easy for the public to fall for the big lie that the stock market's good, the economy's good, and they separated that relationship a long, long time ago.  So, At the end of the year, what do I say?  I just say I wish everyone the best.  I want everyone to be happy, joyous, and free.  I would like to see what I think is going to take place next year, which means, and this is talking about a book, so I admit that, but I think we'll see the commodities stronger.  I think we'll see the stocks weaker.  There could be something that takes place in the bond market.  Watch oil.  Oil is probably bottoming here.  The energy push during the election will be renewable green, green, green and solar and that type of thing.  So solar will probably do well at least for trade next year.  I think oil could do well also, and I think the metals will do at least a 30% return at some point during the year.  I'm not looking for a runaway, super-duper bull market.  I'm looking for a bull market, but I don't think there's anything excessive in 2020, but I do believe that 2021 at some point will probably be the beginning of the acceleration phase.  But it's always difficult when you say these things, because one, to come back to grab you, and two, predicting the future is almost impossible.  But I will stick to my final wrap up.  I really enjoy doing these for the public at large.  I hope they're valuable to you.  I am going to do my best to maintain doing one a week, and I may decide to do a metals wrap-up midweek on a weekly basis, kind of as an experiment to see if it's valuable or not.  There's a lot of information on the web, so I'm trying to keep this under 15 minutes.  Happy New Year, prosperous New Year, healthy New Year, and a freedom-filled New Year for 2020 to all.
