You drag someone up for a beating and then you beat them about things that may or may not be related to their business at all.  So we decided to do an exhaustive fact check of both what she said and also our interpretation of what we thought she was trying to say.  I mean, she's talking about the caging of children.  And as we look through it, I mean, he looked... befuddled, and rightly so.  There was one company that Wells Fargo was involved with that they provided financing to this company, which built one detention center under President Obama, and they sent us so many photos of it.  It has no cages, and it's much nicer than any school my child has ever attended or summer camp.  I mean, from what we saw, it's lovely, but there's definitely no children that are separated any way from their families at this location which I'm guessing was her point.  but they also built the facility under President Obama and it looked rather nice.  so the premise of her question was a gotcha that seemed to have no connection to anything that you said that Wells Fargo has done.  that that hasn't been great in the past.  that's just what wasn't one of them.  and on the pipeline question You know, I mean, she she's going down this road.  She names a pipeline that doesn't exist.  So you give her the benefit of the doubt.  And he kind of pivots to one that does exist, that they did help finance along with a bunch of other banks.  And the premise is sort of like if you provided finance to a builder, if then the operator down the line does something bad, you are responsible.  That's like saying if I kill someone in my house, you should go put in jail the mortgage broker at the bank that gave me the loan.  I mean, it's so many degrees of separation.  It just seems like there was enough to pick on.  Why are you pivoting to your issues and sort of beating this guy? ",
