            "text": "Final piece.  The cabal are now in full panic and crazy mode now.  There's no getting away with it.  And we all should be ultra vigilant, particularly around energy plants, be it oil, gas or whatever, and also pipelines.  They are trying to shut this country down in every way possible currently.  and you have to do your utmost to prevent it.  by standing strong in the face of such evil.  It should matter not whether you like Trump or not, whether you are Republican, Democrat, Liberal or some other banal branch of politics.  Politics or not, what is at stake here?  It is your very freedom and way of life they are intent on destroying.  We the people are what counts.  If you are marching for blacks only, women only, natives only, anti-immigrants or some other one-sided movement, you are part of the problem, all of you.  March for all the people.  Until you realise all lives matter, you are part of the problem.  the system created for you and you went along with it.  Trump or other presidents before him never made the policies.  They just passed the message forward to you from the system and you ran with it.  We have to be a lot more clever than that going forward.  Should we blindly trust Mr.  Trump?  No, he's still in the system.  In my opinion, based on my interactions and the team's interactions with him, with our help, he is breaking down the system to allow the people to have a say in things again.  Look at the bills that have gone in for voting that the trust and the team play a large part in.  The Sovereignty Act, the tax reform, the disaster relief program.  None of them came from the politicians.  It came from the people via the trust.  And Mr.  Trump ran with them.  Now, whether you like Trump or not, that is a significant change in policy from all previous presidencies, is it not?  This is not about personalities or image.  That is all part of the old system.  This is about people making change.  Real change.  And as long as Mr.  Trump is doing more right than wrong, this show will be supporting him in his endeavours.  But with caution.  Not because of Mr.  Trump.  but because of the nest of vipers around them that coerce, threaten and abuse the man.  It can all be so easy to buckle to their demands under that type of pressure.  So far, he hasn't.  To the people who point to the US invasions in various countries as evidence Trump has lost the plot, not one of those invasions were implemented by Mr.  Trump.  all of them by the people who really ran this country, the Rothschilds, the Deep State, the Dragon Groups and the various rogue agencies.  They are your target of ire, not politicians per se.  They're doing everything now to shut us up.  Police thugs attacking yellow vest movement people.  Police thugs attacking young children protesting outside of a school.  Jailing Ben Gilroy and Brian McCarthy in Ireland, to name but a few.  Why?  Because they're shitting themselves, quite frankly.  That we the people are now rising up.  They wish to shut us up.  but we will shout louder.  They wish to knock us down, but we will stand up and stand our ground.  They use violence to shut us up.  We will use peace and nonconformity in return.  Remember, these people are not all powerful.  They never were.  It's all an illusion.  Only our energy gave them power.  Only cowards control other people.  Why?  Because they fear us.  It's the top and bottom line of it.  The key is what we do, not what they do.  Do we cower in fear?  Do we play divide and conquer games?  Do we dance at the behest of the Luciferian satanic clowns?  Or do we stand up and fight for all people of the world?  And rest assured, this host, show, OYM and Off Planet Radio along with the Trust will back you all the way.  This has been the Truth, Honour and Integrity Show.  My name's Thomas Williams.  Bye for now. ",
