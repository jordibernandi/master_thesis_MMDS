That's still not evidence that I strangled Don.  Because those two things are true.  whether I strangle Don or not.

And there's nothing in the Bible that, that could ever substantiate acceptance that that claim is true on its own.  There's certainly the, you know, various attestations to this happening count as sort of anecdotal evidence, but it's not like that would be, could be or should be convincing and not even apply.

One is like the Hebrews 11, 1, where faith is the evidence of things unseen.  And then there's another usage, which is just faith just means confidence.

So you can exercise faith in... in such a way that you can be confident in something that is true, and you can do it in a way where you can be confident in something that's not true.  And what I care about is whether or not we have good reason to believe that something is true, which is why when I talk about faith, I say that faith is the excuse people give for believing something when they don't have a good reason.  Because if I ask someone, why do you believe this?  And they have a good reason, then they give that reason.  When we're talking about scientific facts about the universe, nobody says that they take it on faith.  that the sun is at the center of our solar system.  At least not anymore.  Yeah, not now.  But the reason I use that example is because there are people who think that reasonableness corresponds to truth.  And that's something I try to correct people on when I can.  At one point, given all the available information, it was reasonable to conclude that the sun went around the earth.  And yet it's wrong.  So it's entirely possible to be reasonable based on evidence, based on what you see, and still be wrong.  And so knowing that that's the case, it makes it even more repugnant to me for anybody to ever appeal to faith.  Because knowing that our best efforts, looking at the best available evidence, we could still turn out to be wrong.  to then take an extra step and say, you know what?  There's not sufficient evidence for me to make a conclusion, so I'm going to make a conclusion anyway.  That has to be a bigger mistake than following the evidence to an error. ",

And then, you know, kind of leave us to our own devices.  Sure.  And it was just one of those things, you know, when you start looking into say quantum mechanics, there's an aspect of quantum mechanics known as superposition.  And then when you begin to look at that, all particles before you observe them will be in any and all states that they can possibly be within given probabilities.  Now, there's a fringe theory based on that called quantum consciousness.  I heard somebody, I'm trying to remember his name now, Michio Kaku, I believe, was talking about it. ",
