It's just an empty stadium now.  There's nobody there guarding it.  So I went inside.  It felt haunted, you know.  Raqqa was the capital of the Islamic State and the stadium was its central prison.  I met a guy who I'll call Zain, it's not his real name, but he had been a member of the Free Syrian Army years before and was imprisoned in the black stadium.  He took me and showed me around the prison.  So it was the first time he had been back since he himself was imprisoned there.  He had been accused of killing an ISIS member and they came to his house one night and took him. ",

They would watch battle videos over and over again.  The people that got out, got out by convincing their captors that they were true believers, which also is what Zayn described to me, that he just, you know, tried to convince them that he was one of them.  You know, they're tortured to such a degree that they will go into this kind of extra, you know, mode of trying to zealously kind of convince them that what they're saying is true.
