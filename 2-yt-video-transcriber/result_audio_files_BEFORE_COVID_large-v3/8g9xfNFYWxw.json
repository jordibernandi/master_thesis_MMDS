            "text": "What's up, people?  What's up with you?  News Now South Carolina, I'm back with you.  I got my buddy Audit in America here.  He came down, made the trip.  T.D.  from Carolina Accountability Auditor.  Will.  Jeff is here.  Carolina Auditor and Wing.  Yeah, whatever.  So we're going to go make this happen here, and hopefully, hopefully, We're gonna see how bad they say Horry County is.  We're gonna find out.  So we're in the city hall, and Jeff just got assaulted by this gentleman here.  You don't have no expectation of privacy in public.  Jeff just got assaulted by this gentleman here, and apparently he thinks he can get away with it.  Sir, you can't touch me.  My camera is an extension of my arm.  That's assault.  Can I have your name, please, sir?  I can't have your name.  Do you work here?  If you don't work here, I don't want to talk to you.  If you work here, I wouldn't want to talk to you.  Pardon me, sir.  I'm sorry about that.  I don't.  Well, I was just asking.  I know people put clip-ons on belts and stuff.  I was just asking.  That's all.  How you doing, ma'am?  I'm all right.  Thanks for asking.  I didn't appreciate you grabbing my camera.  You can't do that, sir.  You're a public employee.  You grabbed me when I went over there.  Okay.  I'm sorry?  I said you grabbed me when I went over there.  So now they're going back and forth about the assault.  Oh, I grabbed you?  Really?  Listen, if y'all don't know who Arnie the American is, let me help y'all out here.  Listen to him.  I didn't grab him.  Why would you say that?  It's all on video.  We have five cameras.  I love it.  Alright, y'all stay tuned.  Can I ask you a question, sir?  No.  Well, I'm going to anyway because you're sitting... I'm not going to answer it.  Okay, well... I'm not sitting here.  Okay, listen.  Why does he get to put his hand on people?  That's not... It's time for you gentlemen to go.  You didn't have a problem there, right?  It's time for you gentlemen to go.  Can I tell you something, sir?  Yes, sir.  Well, I'm going to anyway.  You can't make us leave.  I'm not leaving.  Yes, I am.  No, you can't.  You can't make me leave.  Yes, sir.  I'm standing right here.  You can't make us leave.  No way.  No, I'm not.  You're going to go.  You cannot vacate me from this property unless I'm broken the law.  Okay, so listen.  I can trespass you.  You're... Travis, just laugh at him.  You can't trespass us.  Watch this.  They're calling the police on us because they think they can make us leave when we pay.  How you doing, partner?  I won't get your head on by, partner.  Do you know that if you illegally make us leave, we could sue you and own this building?  But I'm not interested in talking to you.  You're not interested in talking to me?  Nope.  Okay, that's fine.  I just want you to understand the litigation that you're going to tie yourself up into.  Okay.  They won't come because they know why we're here.  They're going to tell you to ignore us.  We'll see.  Okay.  Yeah, you're right.  Absolutely.  And Mr.  Peterson is here with me and he's asking to leave.  Thank you.  That's the information we need.  Here.  That's fine.  Here's my card.  I'll get you a card so you can do whatever you want to.  Would it be John Peterson?  Yep.  Since you can't find your own card.  Supervisor, not a supervisor.  Okay, that's our supervisor.  Can I at least figure out what's going on?  Wait, so he's the supervisor?  So he's the supervisor of the police department.  No.  Okay.  City manager.  So we came in here strictly to get photos and pictures because we're in the area.  This gentleman here asked us to leave and we actually told him before he decided to say that we're the disturbance.  He became the disturbance because he was loud and belligerent.  We told him we're taking pictures, taking photos to go about your day.  No, I'm making y'all leave.  And he was assaulted when we first came up here.  He overlooked that by telling us to leave.  And we tell him, we don't have to leave.  We're not open.  I'm not serving anybody.  All we're doing is filming.  He doesn't like it.  He's trying to make us leave.  And I would tell him, this is a publicly funded building.  We can be here as long as we want to, as long as we're not behind any doors.  that says restricted.  He doesn't seem to understand that.  And so we tell him that and he'd get upset because he thinks he can just make us do what he wants us to do.  And it doesn't work that way.  So I would honestly, all we need for you to do is tell him that we can be here.  That's all we need.  Okay.  That's all we need.  This is city property.  Which is publicly funded, correct?  This is city property.  Which is publicly funded.  Is that private property?  Yeah.  It's private?  The city owns it.  But who pays the city?  This is city property.  How does the city get their funds?  But where does the city get their funds from?  I'm not getting into funds.  Because you're going to lose that debate.  We can leave it.  The city owns this property.  This is city property.  But who pays?  It's city property.  But it's tax funded.  Okay.  I understand that.  So if you understand that, why are you still going to pay for this?  I'm not getting into taxes and all this payment stuff, okay?  Are you telling me we can't be here?  Just answer that question.  Can we be here?  Ask the yes or no question.  They are in charge of this building.  You're not answering my question.  No, we're in charge here.  They work here.  I don't care what he's asking me to do.  I don't care what he's asking me to do.  Can we be here?  Ask the yes or no question.  You're not giving me yes or no.  I'm done.  You can ask me anything.  You're not getting my husband.  So, here's what he's saying.  He's telling us that this is city property, which we all know is public property, but he's saying that when they ask us to leave, we have to leave.  That makes no sense at all.  And he's saying that it's private property because the city- Okay, I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you what.  No, we can't.  That's our fourth amendment.  Brother, listen to me, okay?  No, are you familiar with the fourth amendment?  That's because if you outlist him, if you force his ID, you're going to be tough.  We didn't say nothing to anybody.  I can tell by your actions.  But I didn't say anything to anybody.  No, we're asking for a peaceful solution.  The peaceful solution is y'all leaving us alone.  You're trying to put me out of a building that is public.  Nobody said anything.  We came in here to say nothing to anybody.  Because we're looking into all this.  But, so you're looking into illegal activity?  The city wants you to trespass from the building.  Do you need an ID for trespassing?  Yes.  that way you can get trespass from this building.  so if you come back you only need my ID is trespass after notice not to place someone on trust.  and we have a city trespassing ordinance.  okay well what is the ordinance?  and if you're correct then I will walk outside Right now.  Well, he's already noticed you.  Why would I leave if the police are coming?  Because you have to leave the property when you talk outside.  You're making this more difficult.  No, y'all are making this difficult.  This is public property.  This gentleman here was assaulted.  And nobody's saying nothing about it.  Who's the highest ranking officer here?  I don't want to argue.  I just want to talk to somebody.  Who's the highest ranking officer here in this situation?  He is?  You are?  I am.  Sergeant.  Sergeant, how you doing?  Good, how are you?  Dave, nice to meet you, partner.  We've talked to him.  He's irrational.  We've talked to him.  He's become irrational.  All we want somebody to do is to tell this gentleman that it's forcing us to leave, that this is a city voting.  We can be here, and we can only be trespassed when he's committed a crime.  We don't have to leave just because he's asking what his report is here.  Photography.  That's what we're doing here.  We didn't go in any private doors, nothing.  We stayed in public foyers.  We didn't go anywhere.  This gentleman here said, I want y'all to leave.  Y'all have to leave.  And now they're telling him that he's being placed on trespass for a constant\u2014 For a constitutionally protected activity?  You can't do that.  You can be trespassed from a public building.  For doing what crime?  What crime have we committed?  This is business.  Our First Amendment is a protected activity.  Yes, it is.  It is.  You've done your business, correct?  No, we're doing our business.  This is restriction.  we're in exactly.  we're in public.  so what's the problem?  what you need to do?  no y'all have interrupted us but we haven't done it because we got interrupted.  that's what i'm saying.  so we're talking about the same situation.  what is your purpose of photograph anything that we can see from public?  that is our first.  i just told you my purpose and we do that right to film and record.  take photographs anywhere in public.  this is a public.  This is publicly assessable right here.  We haven't committed any crime.  And that's why he left.  But y'all are overlooking that because we got a camera out.  But if you're going to tell us that you are uncomfortable with our Constitution protecting activities, just tell us that.  I just like to know what your purpose is.  We just told you that.  I just told you that.  Tell me who you are.  My name is Dave.  Why do you want that?  I have committed no crime.  I just told you that.  I don't know what your intentions are.  So that's what you're getting into now.  I have no ill will intentions at all.  Your job is to do what I'm asking you to do, sir.  I've committed no crime.  Tell this gentleman that we can do this.  Also, if I ask you for ID and you fail to identify yourself... This is not stopping Identify State.  No, this isn't stopping Identify.  I've committed no crime.  You don't identify yourself.  Please call the state attorney down here.  Before y'all get yourself in litigation that you can't get out of, please just leave me alone.  I've done nothing wrong.  You have no reason to go any place past this.  I'm not anywhere.  I'm here.  You've done what you need to do.  You told me I can be in this area.  Everybody's filming right now.  Can I be in this area?  That's the answer to my question.  Can I be in this area?  What is your purpose?  Is there a time frame that I have to be in this area?  Nobody's answering my questions.  You're telling me that I can be here.  But you're telling me I can be here and then telling me I have to leave.  That doesn't make any sense.  So you're telling me I can be in this area.  So... What you just said is, and I want to make sure I heard you correctly.  I can be in.  Go ahead.  We're not getting guys to understand.  You've been told by everybody here.  That we have to leave a public building.  So you can keep.  So can you keep me off the public sidewalk as well without no crime being committed?  You have no intention to be there if you're obstructing the sidewalk.  Yes, I can.  I'm not obstructing.  You just told me I can be here filming.  They want to come in here and film.  It's filming illegal, sir.  Lieutenant Altman, it's filming illegal.  That's not a legal film, but if there's no reason for you guys to be here for any other reason.  That's our reason to be here.  We haven't filmed everything because we got stopped.  You've been filming for 15 minutes.  We've been talking to you for 15 minutes.  Okay, there's nothing else to film.  everything back there.  if you would know everything behind doors this goes all the way around.  i'm not walking into any doors.  i didn't want to argue sir i don't want to argue.  i just want to be understood here.  if this is our constitution to take the activity so can we finish our video in this public foyer and then leave?  that's all we want to do.  he's saying that we've been here 15 minutes but we've been talking to y'all for 10 minutes.  Okay, but this is the only area.  There's nothing to film here.  We haven't made it past this area.  We got stopped right here.  You can't go past that.  Why can't I?  That's public.  All the way to that door back there.  There's a public restroom right there.  See, that's the thing.  We didn't create the disturbance.  We didn't create the disturbance.  No, we just crossed one that you don't know.  It's different.  You begged this man for his ID.  That's all that is.  None of you have given us your IDs.  We don't know who you are.  Because we don't have to.  Yes, you do.  Jesus Christ.  Okay, I guess I'm in a motor vehicle and I've committed a crime.  For what crime?  You're not in a motor vehicle.  Absolutely.  So I'm not required to give you an ID.  Sir, I just told you, we have an ordinance that requires you.  And I also asked you for an ID and you failed to produce it.  But you're saying... Just like you said, you don't have an ID.  I'm not going to argue with you.  You're not going to argue with me.  Give me one second.  His city ordinance doesn't trump the Constitution.  My Fourth Amendment right says I have the right to reframe my identity.  That's my constitutional right.  And you're going to tell me that has to go hand in hand with the Constitution.  Nope.  Is it higher than the Constitution?  Is that what you're telling me?  So then why you ask for my ID if I have a constitutional right?  And it's my right to say no.  Are you threatened to arrest us if we don't leave this public building?  Why are you so hostile?  Under the threat of arrest, I'll leave.  Under the threat of arrest, I'm leaving.  Why are you so hostile, Mr.  Alford?  Rick, let's leave.  Come on, because we're threatened to be arrested in this public building.  Come on.  Okay, yeah, this is a public building.  We don't have any bad intentions, but.  Come on, let's leave.  We have freedom of the press.  You guys fought to protect the Constitution.  So we've been threatened to be arrested.  And this guy here is a tough guy here.  That's an assault.  See that?  That's an assault.  Wow.  They called all these people out here.  And the undercover guy.  That's the tough guy right there.  That's the tough guy who hides behind his badge.  His name is Crawford.  What did I tell you?  A shit ton of cops are going to arrive in there.  Hey, Crawford.  Crawford, you ain't got to be so hostile, buddy.  No, we were threatened to be arrested by a tough guy Crawford here if we didn't leave.  That's who hides behind his badge every day.  Yeah, because he doesn't run his own household, so he tries to come out here and control us because he can't control his house.  Yeah, that guy.  You can see it in his activities.  Because they swear they can read us.  And now he hates the First Amendment of my freedom of speech.  And they can't be the complainant of my language.  God, they hate it.  That's him trying to play tough.  He's about to blow his lid.  About to blow his lid on me.  He didn't give enough nipple time at home.  That's all that is.  So we were illegally removed from the city hall building in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina here.  And now Travis.  Travis just told Crawford that his wife wears the pants at home.  That's why he comes to work and tries to bully people with that little bitty ass shirt on.  There's over $100,000 in chowder right there.  That's a lot of chowder.  I told y'all, keep moving.  Keep moving.  I told you that.  Keep moving.  Anything that they can use to get your, all they want is your ID.  So anything that they can do to get it, that's what they're going to do.  Just keep moving.  Yep, yep, yep.  All that money, and y'all can't buy Crawford a bigger shirt.  Crawford got the smallest shirt on out there and the biggest ego.  Too many ceremonies.  The whole building watching us.  They're trying to get us for obstructing the walkway, so we're going to keep walking.  We can't stop because Crawford here is looking to bully somebody because his wife bullies him.  So it's okay.  So it's okay.  Oh, my God.  What if I was channel 10 and I posted up right here?  No, they're allowed to, right?  Try to keep walking.  Hey, your body cam's on.  Don't talk to your wife on camera.  No.  So they sent everybody inside the building home and we still got more police officers showing up here.  We still got more people showing up here.  It's absolutely crazy that they called SWAT.  And the people, the guy that was outside, you guys didn't see because you were inside.  The dude that called, he said, oh yeah, they just have cameras and they're filming.  He didn't lie and say, oh, you guys are being violent.  Oh, you guys are being disrupted.  Oh, you guys had a weapon.  No.  All these cops and SWAT came because you guys were filming with the camera.  Mind you, inside there, everything's on video.  The cops have video cams.  There's cameras everywhere.  The NSA is listening to every single thing that we say and do.  But when a slave, a person from the general public, wants to go ahead and use their camera, oh, now all of a sudden it's evil.  They just shut down the city hall for First Amendment.  No violence, no nothing.  These people sworn oaths to the Constitution.  My grandfather, my great grandfather are rolling in their graves right now because the city hall in United States is shut down because a threat of the First Amendment.  So now what we're doing?  in the dead of silence, we're in here now getting complaint forms for what just happened.  And we're going to get some litigation following behind it as well.  That's what we're doing now.  So we can get that done.  So that's what we're doing now.  I keep y'all updated. ",
