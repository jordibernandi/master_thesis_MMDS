            "text": "You don't even know what the neighbor's dogs are barking at.  Anyway, I'm just here to give everybody a little bit of an update on what's going to be coming up in November.  I was invited by an organization called Man's Forum to come and give a talk in August.  To come and give a talk in Oslo, Norway.  That will be happening on International Men's Day on the 19th of November.  I believe Dr.  Warren Farrell is going to be there, among others.  And that should be a lot of fun.  It'll be nice to see him again.  And... I will also be heading from there.  The timing was just really perfect.  If it had been anything further away from the 19th than the 23rd, I would have probably said no to two transatlantic flights in one month.  But go away from the stuffed dog.  But as it is, I... I thought, geez, I'll be in Oslo.  It's just a little jump across the water to get to Ireland.  So that will be held by Men's Voices Ireland and that'll be on the 23rd and I will be presenting there as well.  So my topic in Oslo is going to be, I guess, I haven't quite decided yet.  They asked me to talk about the state of men's issues in Canada.  That's a pretty broad subject, and I would probably need about five hours rather than the allotted 45 minutes to discuss that thoroughly.  So I'll have to sort of pick the topic still, but it'll have something to do with the state of things in Canada.  And Ireland is currently considering reforming their sexual assault legislation.  And can you not sniff everything?  It's not... What?  Are you okay?  Are you jealous?  Super jealous?  Yeah?  Okay.  You guys can both get lost.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Okay.  Now go lie down.  Okay.  No, no, no wrestling on the couch.  Um, so I will probably be talking about Canada's sexual assault assault reforms, uh, which are kind of a primer on what not to do.  Um, so that should be a good presentation and, uh, I will also probably, and I'm saying probably, uh, because this is going to actually have to be crowdfunded.  Uh, there will be a link in the low bar to the feed the badger page to support, um, this particular event, uh, doing a honey badger meetup with Alison, uh, T-Men and her husband, Jonathan, um, probably Dr.  Random or Cam.  And, uh, geez, I forget if there's anybody else who's going to be there.  Um, but, uh, That will be in Amsterdam, and that will be happening on the 16th in the same little district, little sort of set of little walking streets or whatever called Westergas Fabrique that we held our last Amsterdam meetup in.  But we will have an actual venue that we'll have... Arranged beforehand and and be able to maybe do some speeches and things like that.  So Not that I want to give yet another speech, but there you go.  And So, I mean that's really What's going on in November?  I hope to have a video video up fairly soon.  I'm not sure what exact topic I want to do.  Um, but, uh, if you guys have any suggestions of videos, you'd like me to rip apart, uh, please, please link them in the comment section, um, or suggest them, uh, in the comment section, but, uh, please nothing, nothing more than like an, uh, a half an hour or something like that would, would be nice because.  You know me, it takes me forever to pick apart something.  So if it's an hour-long video, it's going to turn into three hour-long videos ripping it all apart.  So I guess that's it for me for today.  It is now... Pretty much winter here.  I'm super, super happy that it rained all summer, and now we're right into the minus 10, minus 15 Celsius.  That usually doesn't happen until mid-November, sometimes even December, but we're getting it early.  And we had our first snowfall last night, so super pumped about that.  Um, but, uh, at least my gutters got cleaned before it froze.  So I guess small blessings, something like that.  Um, anyhow, I guess that's it for me.  And, uh, now these dogs have sorted themselves out and calmed down.  Um, I will see you all later.  This is my life. ",
