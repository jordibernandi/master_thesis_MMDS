            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back.  I appreciate you stopping on in for today's video where I want to run through my projection and what I predict for the 2020 Electoral College.  And I'm going to go through and do this series again.  It's been a number of months since I've gone through some of these upper tier Democratic candidates going head to head against Republican President Donald Trump.  So I'm going to start right now with who many perceive to be the Democratic frontrunner, at least at this point in time, and that is Elizabeth Warren.  and then I'm going to go through and do basically the upper tier Democratic hopefuls those that have a shot at going on in winning the nomination.  but going to start with Elizabeth Warren and going through all of the states and I'm not going to leave any in the toss-up range I'm going to give even those very very competitive states that could go either way.  I'm either going to give a lean to Warren or Trump and give my reasoning as to why I think that could be the case once we reach the 2020 general election.  So starting off out west and then I'll work my way back east, touching on all of the states.  So up in the great state of Alaska, going to be putting that one obviously towards the Republicans.  They have consistently taken that state by a comfortable margin in presidential elections.  No reason to think that'll stop now.  And then the same thing on the other side.  for the Democrats in the state of Hawaii, one of the most progressive and liberal states in all of the United States.  Now, the biggest population is out there in California and a very easy state in general for the Democrats to pick up and getting those important 55 electoral votes.  Also, Oregon and Washington, very liberal, progressive states that will be going to the Democrats.  Essentially, no matter who they nominate, these are going to be safe areas for the Democrats.  Now, moving over into areas of the country that start being a little bit more Republican, and very much so in the case of states like Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah.  Now, Montana, it can be interesting at times.  Now, in general, in presidential elections, it almost always goes to Republicans.  We have had some close races now and again over the past 20 plus years, but the Republicans seemingly almost always take it.  And Trump absolutely routed Hillary Clinton in the state back in 2016.  Now we have seen Democrats can win their statewide in terms of the Senate as well as governorship.  But again, it tends to be a pretty consistent result there for the Republicans in presidential elections.  And that also is going to be the case likely in states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, minus the second congressional district.  that I actually think, if it was a Warren versus Trump situation, would just slightly potentially lean towards The Democrats, they've shown \u2013 at least the Democrats have shown that they can win this second congressional district.  It was very close back in 2016 with Trump versus Clinton.  Of course, Clinton coming up just short.  But I don't think Clinton necessarily the most ideal Democratic candidate.  candidate to have to win the second congressional district in Nebraska, where I think a Warren with her populist progressive message can possibly do a little bit better.  Kansas, one of these other states that almost always goes towards Republicans.  Now we saw statewide the Democrats win there in 2018, and they could actually feasibly have a competitive senate race there and maybe even uh in the presidential race.  but um still gonna be giving this one at least based on the data that we have at this point in time.  uh leaning over to the republicans and of course trump winning the state back in 2016 and then oklahoma Very secure for the Republicans in the statewide election, especially for the presidency.  Colorado has been trending more towards the Democrats.  That one's going to likely go to them with Elizabeth Warren, as well as New Mexico, even more so trending towards the Democrats, maybe even more so than Colorado.  It tends to be a little bit even more safe for the Democrats than the state of Colorado.  And then Nevada, shifting demographics have kind of turned this from what was a true toss-up, maybe even more so to being lean Democrats.  leaning towards the Democrats in these statewide races.  They swept the state in terms of flipping a Senate seat as well as picking up the governorship in 2018, and then also Clinton winning the state back in 2016.  Arizona, right down the middle, it is a purple state through and through right now.  It's actually shifted quite a bit where it was consistently Republican, but given the changing demographics, also a popular area for people to come and retire from other parts of the country, specifically just a state over from California where you can potentially get some Democratic retirees coming into the state to help it out.  But on top of that, probably even more important is the demographic shift that we're getting here in the Southwest.  that's helping Democrats win states like Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado, and potentially even Texas.  The Democrats picking up a Senate seat, flipping that to their side in the 2018 midterms, and they could very well go on and win the 2020 Senate seat, in the state of Arizona.  And then at that point, we'd have two Democratic senators from the state of Arizona.  Clearly something that has happened, at least in my recollection.  I don't know if that's ever been the case in the state, but I'm not sure that it has.  Definitely a swing in demographics here helping the Democratic Party.  And I actually think with a Warren versus Trump, I think that they can take a state like Arizona and what's going to be a very competitive result could really go either way.  But if I had to place money on it myself, I'd actually give it as a lean to the Democrats.  Now, Texas is going to be a fascinating state, kind of like Arizona, but a little bit more to the right, I'd say, at this point in time.  Texas is just a fascinating state in general.  Very large population, 38 electoral votes.  The rural areas are extremely Republican, but the urban areas, very Democratic.  And that's spreading into the all-important suburban districts and areas in and around these very populous cities like Dallas, Houston, even San Antonio, Austin.  You have all these different areas that have their Democratic places, but we have seen the suburbs in a lot of these regions start to shift towards the Democrats, which is giving them a chance statewide.  We saw Beto O'Rourke come up a couple points short in his Senate bid in 2018 against Ted Cruz.  We're going to be two years removed from that where the demographics have shifted even a little bit more to help the Democrats going into 2020.  We could possibly have a competitive Senate race there as well.  Something to keep an eye on and a state that we're going to continue to get a ton of polling out of.  Actually, we have seen head-to-head matchup polls where the Democrats are defeating Donald Trump.  We've also seen polls the other way that show Trump defeating the Democrats.  At this point in time, if I had to bet money on it myself, I'd still give it as a lean over to the Republicans, but likely going to be very interesting and competitive, likely within around three percentage points one way or the other.  with how this one ends up in Texas.  Now moving over to some more, at least at this point in time, very consistently red states, more so than what we're currently seeing from Texas.  Those being areas of the southeast like Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, and then up into Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia, which have been very strong for President Trump, where these are some states where he has some of the best approval numbers out of any state in In the U.S.  as well as Alabama, you can throw right in that mix in terms of his strongest states for approval numbers.  Now, Missouri has been trending in a Republican direction over the past decade.  If we look back in terms of presidential elections, Obama was extremely close with McCain there back in 2008.  But since that point in time, it's been trending back towards Obama.  the republicans and rather significantly so in 2016 with trump dominating clinton.  so i would put that one as red for the republicans.  now moving into the all-important midwest where you have illinois the most consistently democratic of all of these midwestern states and then one tier To the other side of that, just below Illinois in terms of consistently going towards the Democrats, you're going to put Minnesota.  The Democrats dominated there statewide in the midterms of 2018.  Iowa's going to be a fascinating result.  We actually just got a poll out.  It was either today or yesterday, but it was state of Iowa, head-to-head matchup.  Bernie Sanders had a two-point lead over Trump.  Warren and Biden were each losing to Trump by two percentage points, but we've also seen a lot of polls say that had these other democratic candidates defeating donald trump and i actually think the democrats can do really well in a state like iowa because the trump tariffs in particular have really hurt a lot of the farmers in this state.  so that can help.  but also what we see in iowa it's a very important state in terms of uh the primary season.  it's the first state to go for the democrats and republicans and what we see a lot of times is The party that's having these competitive primaries, they spend a lot of time in the state, and that ends up helping the party as they go into presidential election.  Now, we saw this, for instance, way back in 2008 where the Democrats had a competitive primary.  Obama spent a lot of time in the state and got a lot of followers and supporters, was able to win the state in 2008, and then he also carried that success over 2008. into 2012.  Now, whereas in 2016, there was an extremely packed cast of characters there in the Republican primary in 2016, they spent a lot of time in Iowa.  And at the end of the day, that ended up benefiting the party as Trump went on and won the state rather considerably back in 2016.  But here in this 2020 process, the fact that these Democrats are spending so much time in the state, I think that that's a big help for them to potentially go on and win.  And at this point, I actually think that Somebody like an Elizabeth Warren can go on and beat Trump.  And I think because of how much time herself has spent in this state, I think that helps her to try to take down the Republican president.  Now, some of the most important states that we're going to have through this process are Wisconsin, Michigan.  Pennsylvania.  I'll actually end with those three states in particular.  I'm going to be touching on the rest before getting there.  So let's go down.  Indiana has been trending towards the Republicans recently.  Obama was able to win it back in 2008, but since then it's trended back towards the Republicans and considerably so back in 2016 with Pence as the VP.  You would expect Indiana to continue to go that way.  And then also Ohio.  Obama was able to pick it up in 2008 and 2012, but then Trump did very well in the state Back in 2016, there's a lot of love in particular areas of Ohio for Donald Trump.  Kind of what we're seeing in this pocket of the country where Trump does extremely well in places like West Virginia, Kentucky, and also parts of Indiana.  And that kind of trickles over here into Ohio.  a similar type of voter and electorate in Ohio, giving that one and it's importing 18 electoral votes to the Republicans.  Also, Ohio, very predictive of who goes on and wins the presidency.  But given how the map has shifted a little bit, where now the Democrats are doing a bit better in the Southwest, there's a lot of pathways forward where the Democrats can still win the electoral vote and not necessarily have to pick up a state like Ohio.  It is an important swing state, but maybe not quite as important for the Democrats.  as it used to be in the past.  Now going down, Virginia has been actually trending towards the Democrats, and particularly the suburban areas, very important in and around some of these populous parts of the state of Virginia, have been trending towards the Democrats.  I think Elizabeth Warren would be able to pick up the state.  Now a true toss-up, in my opinion, is North Carolina, where if we take a look at the history, of course, Obama winning it in 08, actually losing it in 2012, and then Trump was able to win in 2016.  So the last two Statewide presidential races have gone to the Republicans.  We've seen a bit of polling out of the state that's shown a very competitive race between these upper tier Democratic hopefuls and Trump.  At this point in time, I'm going to be giving the slight lean over to Donald Trump.  I could see this one going either way.  And I actually wouldn't be completely surprised if the Democrats were actually able to pick up this Senate seat.  Tom Tillis, the current Republican senator there, has really bad approval and favorability numbers, and they could still possibly, the Republicans go on and win statewide.  We'll see if that is the case or not once the time rolls around for North Carolina to be casting their ballots.  One of the most important states probably in 2020 and likely to be one of the most competitive, just giving it as a slight lean to Trump at this point in time.  Georgia becoming very competitive down here in the southeast out of all of these southeastern states other than Florida.  It's one where the Democrats actually have a shot.  There's another very interesting Senate race that's going to be going on in the state of Georgia, where I do give the lean at this point to the incumbent Republican, but likely to be competitive.  We saw this in the governor's race with Stacey Abrams getting extremely close to Kemp.  And Again, it's a situation statewide that's actually becoming more competitive between the Democrats and Republicans.  Trump was able to beat Clinton there by around five percentage points.  Still going to be giving him the lean in this one.  Now, Florida, always competitive in these presidential elections.  Out of all of the states that we had, especially these competitive states back in the midterms, one area where the Republicans actually performed better than many expected was Florida.  I think that's a very positive sign.  for Trump.  The guy that he supported in the 2018 election for the governorship, DeSantis went on and won that statewide election against who the Democrats were backing in Gillum.  It's a positive sign for the Republicans.  I expect this to be within one percentage point one way or the other, but going to be giving it as a slight lean over to Donald Trump in his head-to-head against Elizabeth Warren in this instance.  Now moving up, into a part of the country that is very consistently blue and Democratic, starting in the state of Maryland.  That one is going to be going to the Democrats as well as the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, those important 29 electoral votes from the state of New York.  Vermont, as well as Maine.  Now, the second congressional district, there's an argument to be made clearly that Trump can win that one.  He did very well in the second congressional district back in 2016.  But the Democrats were able to pick up this district and taking it away from an incumbent Republican in the 2018 midterms.  I actually think, especially with ranked choice voting, I think that's going to be part of the ballot here.  on the presidential ticket in 2020, which can help the Democrats go on and win that one.  And especially if Warren is the nominee, the state of Massachusetts, very close in proximity, she's well known in this part of the country.  I actually think that the Democrats could pick up the second congressional district of Maine in that instance.  And if they're picking up something like the second congressional district of Maine, I also expect that to be the case in New Hampshire.  And kind of a similar scenario to Iowa, where The Democrats are spending a lot of time in the state.  It's very early on in the process, right after Iowa.  Very important in terms of building momentum for your campaign to go on and win the nomination.  And then it's also a bordering state of Massachusetts.  I think that one goes to Elizabeth Warren.  The three most important states are going to be Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.  All of the other results that I've put in have it the Democrats at 251, the Republicans at 241.  And I'm really bullish potentially on the Democrats' chances to reclaim these states.  We have to remember that in general, in presidential years, the Democrats usually pick up these states.  If we look at what Obama did winning these states in 2008 and 2012, but even going back before that with Gore and Kerry having success particularly in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and picking those up, even when the Democrats didn't go on and win the presidency in those particular years.  The really positive sign for the Democrats in these three states are if we look at the 2018 midterms, they absolutely swept across all these statewide elections for the Senate as well as the governorship.  They actually flipped the governorship in Wisconsin away from incumbent Republican Scott Walker and And then also Tammy Baldwin retaining her Senate seat by a very wide margin, double digits.  So going to be giving Wisconsin as well as Michigan, of course, Whitmer winning the governorship, giving that back to the Democrats after it had been in Rick Snyder's hands.  the prior two terms, and then Debbie Stabenow winning statewide there in the Senate, and then also Pennsylvania where the Democrats absolutely crushed it with retaining that Senate seat and then also doing very well in the statewide election for the governor.  So at the end of the day, that's where I currently have things for Elizabeth Warren, 297 to Donald Trump at 241.  Potential where I could make an argument going the other way is you could have something like the 2nd Congressional District of Nebraska as well as the 2nd Congressional District in Maine followed by Iowa and Wisconsin.  That gets you up to 259 for the Republicans, so within 20 electoral votes.  And at that point in time, you just have to pick up the state of Arizona and it becomes 270 to 268.  So that is what I think is the best pathway forward for Donald Trump to go on and potentially retain the White House and win it by a very slim margin.  But on the other side of that, for the Democrats, if they're able to pick up these seats that I had or these particular states and districts that I had them picking up, to get back to that 297 to 241.  You could also get a scenario where the Democrats also pick up North Carolina.  They could pick up Florida.  They could pick up Texas and possibly even a state like Ohio.  And at this point, I think this would be the best case scenario for the Democrats at 397 to 141.  So that's where I'm at at this point in time, guys, in terms of where I'm seeing the Electoral College play out.
