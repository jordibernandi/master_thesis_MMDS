The individuals who manage those departments are responsible for annual performance reviews of the individuals.  We have a pay for performance program, which we implemented two years ago, so that individuals who perform at an average rate would be given an average or possibly no increase for the year.  Those who receive performance expectations might get a little bit more than the average.  Those averages are all calculated and determined based upon a variety of factors, all of which go through a human resource director and those actually come to us from various federal agencies and also employment groups who determine wage rates for this region.  Obviously the wage rates for this region are higher than the wage rates for central Pennsylvania and to keep a competitive salary and compete and individuals of high quality will be paid for the performance.

And I found that for the positions, and I picked 10 random positions and got salaries and information from Upper Merion, and the other townships are about $8,000 to $12,000 over the national average for a position.  We're a little bit higher.  Dave, not to say anything about you, you're a great guy.  You're the township manager.  An average township manager makes $76,000 a year.  A city manager, national average, is $106,000 a year.  These figures are as of October 30th this year.  Does anybody want to guess how much Dave made last year?  Not to say anything personally, but it's public knowledge, so I'm not picking on anybody.  We know what Mr.  Crane is.  He made $181,000 last year.  Hey, if I could add something.

It's just a very, I'll get to it real quick.  I'll get real to it real quick.  So, you know, Ed O'Brien, you know, that position as a public works director, his average is 82,000.  He got 141.  You know, that's 60,000 over national average.  So what I'm seeing is I'm seeing that we're not just a little bit over the national average, we're a skyrocketing mile high above the national average.  And I'm kind of wondering why, but I got one more point to make before you answer that.  Police officers, national average in PA make $52,500.  Doylestown average is $59,000.  Harrisburg's $50,000.  West Cheshire's $55,000.  Philadelphia, they only average $56,000 a year.  Pittsburgh, $51,000 a year.  We have an officer... No, these are parole officers.  These are just officers, okay?  So we have a police officer last year that made... $170,000 last year.  We had another one that made $136,000 last year.  We had another one that made $143,000 last year.  And these are just foot patrol people.  They're not sergeants or lieutenants or captains.  They're just regular everyday police.  And that's unbelievable compared to the national average.  I understand that we're above the national average.  I understand that we want to pay a good person for a good pay.  But to be that much higher, to me, is interesting.  So, you know, police chief Tom Nolan, average is 102 for a police chief in Pennsylvania.  He made $184,000.  He's $82,000 over national average.  So we've got so many positions that are so high above the national average, which is just concerning to me, and I'm not quite sure why you guys need to do that, is my real question.  So my final point is... You get your money from taxes, and we just went through that.  And we all know that taxation is pure theft, because they never ratified the 16th Amendment by two-thirds of the states.  But that's neither here nor there.  So I think you guys, you do a good job budgeting.  Our taxes haven't gone up, like you said.  But you must be rolling in some money.  To not raise our taxes, to not raise our taxes and to pay these people these exorbitant amount of money is telling me one thing.  Your job is to save taxpayer money.  Your job is to not waste money.  Your job is to budget money.  And I don't really think that you guys, you guys are not bad, but I don't think you're doing the service that you can be doing.  So I think you need to buddy your stolen taxes a little bit better.  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a public service.  A lot of people pay for efficient experts.  A lot of money to pay for an efficiency expert.  A lot of money.  I'm going to do it for free.  I'm going to sit down with the heads of the departments, I'm going to follow them around for a day.  I'm going to film them.  I'm going to post it.  And I'm going to have the citizens decide if what they see in a day constitutes the money that we're paying them.  I think that's a great idea.

I would suggest to you that if you did real research, you looked at the fact that, yes, a Philadelphia police officer might make $56,000 as a starting salary.  However, then you have to add in the overtime.  You have to add in the court time.  You have to add in all the other reimbursable overtime that they make.  I'll guarantee you that there's not one Philadelphia police officer that's making $56,000 a year.  And if they are, they're making $56,000 because that's all that they want to make.  My point is that your numbers are based upon Data that probably came, and I can almost guess the website that you got them from, they are based upon fundamental research and data that's gained from those communities.  It does not take into account operational impacts that those communities have on a day-to-day basis.  Point number one.  Point number two.  We operate and have operated for the law enforcement agency under contract here for many, many years.  Whatever the police officer gets is governed by whatever that collective bargaining agreement that started, I don't even know when it started, but it has to have been in place for about 40 years. ",

That doesn't count the court time that they spend either.  So that's that one area.  Now we look at what we've done with members of our staff in public works.  Now, they have been working a lot of overtime recently.  We're in leave pick-up time.  So rather than hire additional people, it is sometimes more cost-effective to pay overtime.  And then those individuals are going to have a little higher salary than maybe others do.  They're also working a little bit more hours, working a little bit harder for it.  I would suggest that if you compare like apples, instead of just comparing what is done in all communities across the Commonwealth.  I came from another one of those communities.  I know what the police chief was making in that community.  It was $35,000.  Smaller community, less service that they have to provide.  Similar service, but still less service.  But there's just no equity between the size of the community that demanded the job and what is commanded by the neighboring communities.

Yeah, really.  I don't go in anybody's faces.  I stand on public property and hold public officials.  Really?  Show me that.  I have a channel there.  Anybody here can go to your YouTube channel and see it. ",

You don't have videos on there where you're walking away from the police officers and calling their names?  Oh, oh.  Not local, not local.  Only the people that have broken the law and have detained me illegally.  And once they realize they detained me illegally and let me go, I will call them exactly what they are.  Yes, sir.  Okay, name the example where I did that.  Right, with me.  All right, so we're getting off path here.  You're making apples and oranges again here.  You're deflecting the truth.  Again, I'm just asking the point.  My point is why you guys are that high above national average.  That's my only point.  And number two is when can I start doing a daily or sit down with Dave and Dan and people and actually videotape their process for the day?  No problem.  No problem.  I think it would be a great community service. ",
