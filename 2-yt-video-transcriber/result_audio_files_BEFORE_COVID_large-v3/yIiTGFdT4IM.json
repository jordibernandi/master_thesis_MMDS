            "text": "This is the true story behind Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that effectively legalized abortion through all nine months in the United States.  The real name of Jane Roe was Norma McCorvey.  In 1969, Norma was a 21-year-old single woman in Dallas, Texas, who was struggling financially and regularly abusing drugs and alcohol.  She was also pregnant with her third child.  She had surrendered custody of her first child to her mother and placed her second child for adoption.  With her third child, she sought an abortion, but abortion was illegal in Texas.  At the time, abortion was only legal in a handful of states, like California and New York, and Norma didn't have the means to travel to one of those states.  Based on advice from others, Norma even began to lie that she'd become pregnant from a gang rape in hopes that it would make it easier to obtain an abortion.  It was one of many lies that Roe v. Wade would be based on.  Norma became the target of two young and ambitious lawyers recently out of school who wanted to change the abortion laws in America, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffey.  They took Norma out to lunch when she was five months pregnant, drank beers with her and got her kinda smashed, and convinced her to agree to file suit to challenge the abortion laws in Texas.  Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade would represent the state as defendant.  Weddington would later admit to using Norma for her own ambitions to challenge abortion laws.  She said that Norma was just a vehicle for presenting larger issues and that all Jane Roe did was sign a one-page affidavit.  She was pregnant and didn't want to be.  That was her total involvement in the case.  In fact, Weddington said that if she had to do it over again, she wouldn't even use McCorvey as the plaintiff.  Weddington and Coffey kept Norma completely out of the loop when planning their case, and Norma didn't even attend a single trial hearing.  If Weddington really wanted to get Norma an abortion, she could have, as she was heavily involved in an abortion referral network in Texas.  Weddington had the resources, but she never mentioned this to Norma, because apparently that would mean losing the only plaintiff that she had with the necessary legal standing to challenge the law.  How ironic that Weddington championed abortion access for all women by secretly withholding an abortion from her own client.  So during the child proceedings, Norma gave birth to a baby girl and placed her for adoption.  That's right, Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade never even had an abortion.  Norma became a poster child for the abortion movement while never having an abortion herself.  A three-judge panel in Texas ruled in Weddington and Coffey's favor, but the state immediately appealed and Roe v. Wade made its way up to the Supreme Court.  In 1973, the Supreme Court handed down their ruling, along with another abortion case, Doe v. Bolton.  The real name of Mary Doe in Doe v. Bolton was Sandra Cano.  She was a poor 22-year-old mother of three in Georgia.  After she became pregnant with her fourth child, Sandra met with a lawyer named Margie Pitts Hames, seeking legal help to get custody of her children in foster care and then to divorce her husband.  Despite the fact that Hames filed suit on Sandra's behalf to obtain an abortion, Sandra maintained that she in fact never wanted an abortion at all.  She said it was not my signature on any documents agreeing to one.  She says that Hames forged her signature on the abortion documents or that Hames slipped it into the papers she thought she was signing regarding the divorce and sole custody.  Like Norma, Sandra also never appeared in court after her initial court hearing.  When she found out that Hames was seeking an abortion for her, she fled to Oklahoma to save her baby.  The lawsuit filed against Georgia Attorney General Arthur Bolton challenged Georgia's law permitting abortion only in cases of rape, severe fetal deformity, or threat to the mother.  A three-judge panel district court declared portions of the Georgia law unconstitutional, and the case made its way to the Supreme Court to be decided along with Roe v. Wade.  Good evening.  In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court today legalized abortions.  The decision in Roe v. Wade was a 7-2 ruling by nine men.  Writing the majority decision, Justice Harry Blackmun invented a legal framework based on an arbitrary three-trimester measurement of pregnancy.  This was not based on a medical understanding of pregnancy or of fetal development, but it was simply a tool to justify abortion during different times of pregnancy.  According to Roe, during the first trimester, abortion could not be restricted.  During the second trimester, restrictions could be made for so-called health reasons.  And during the third trimester, abortions could be restricted entirely, so long as the laws contained exceptions for cases when they claimed it was necessary to save the life or health of the mother.  But Doe v. Bolton defined health so broadly as to include physical, emotional, psychological, familial health and the woman's age.  Basically, any justification for a third trimester abortion could fall under such a health exception.  Today, America is one of only seven nations worldwide that allows abortion for any reason through all nine months of pregnancy.  The legal foundation for abortion is total nonsense.  Just as Harry Blackmun's argument in Roe v. Wade ultimately concluded that a woman's choice to have an abortion was covered under this supposed right to privacy.  That's right.  In order to make abortion on demand the law of the land, Blackmun effectively ruled that killing a child in the womb is justified because it is private.  Furthermore, the right of privacy as defined by Blackmun has a very weak foundation legally.  The right of privacy originated in the 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut, in which the Supreme Court decided that certain state restrictions on contraception were unconstitutional.  because there is a right of privacy for married couples that protects their ability to obtain contraception.  This right to privacy for married couples has a famously vague foundation.  Justice William Douglas wrote that penumbras, formed by emanations from various parts of the Constitution, gave married couples this right to privacy.  What is a penumbra?  According to the dictionary, the partially shaded outer region of the shadow cast by an opaque object, or the shadow cast by the Earth or the Moon over an area experiencing a partial eclipse.  or the less dark outer part of a sunspot surrounding the dark core.  So here's how it all breaks down.  Within the Constitution, there are penumbras formed by emanations that recognize the right of privacy of married couples to obtain contraception.  The Supreme Court case Eisenstadt v. Baird said that the right of privacy for married couples also extends to unmarried individuals.  And then Roe v. Wade said that right of privacy of individuals to obtain contraception includes the right to kill a child in the womb.  That is the ridiculous legal foundation for abortion in America.  And it's exactly what happens when the Supreme Court twists the words of the Constitution to fit an ideology.  One of the most sensible parts of the Roe v. Wade opinion is when Justice Blackmun made this startling admission.  If prenatal personhood is established, the case for abortion collapses, for the fetus's right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the 14th Amendment.  Keep that in mind.  According to Roe v. Wade itself, the entire case for abortion depends on dehumanizing and depersonalizing an entire group of human beings just because they're young and in the womb.  Think of all the other human rights injustices that have been based on human beings not being recognized as persons.  Abortion is no different.  Science, reason, and legal precedent all definitively show the personhood of children in the womb, and so the Roe v. Wade opinion openly reveals where it self-destructs.  The true stories of Norma McCorvey and Sandra Kano show that abortion has never been about truth, it's never been about justice, and it's never been about women.  Abortion has always been about using women and killing their children for selfish ambition and profit.  As feminist leader Alice Paul said, abortion is the greatest in the exploitation of women.  And since 1973, over 60 million children have been killed by legal abortion.  The stories of the two women have startling similarities.  Both were poor and struggling.  Both were lied to and preyed upon by self-interested parties in the abortion movement.  Neither of them had an abortion.  Both Norma and Sandra would become passionate pro-life activists.  And though they have both passed on, it is up to you and to me to take up their mission.  In the words of Sandra Kano, I pledge that as long as I have breath, I will strive to see abortion ended in America.  And as Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe herself said, I am dedicated to spending the rest of my life undoing the law that bears my name. ",
