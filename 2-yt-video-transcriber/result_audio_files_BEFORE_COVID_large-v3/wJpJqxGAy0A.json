            "text": "Hi, I'm Marianne Williamson, and I'm running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency of the United States.  In 1776, our forefathers brought forth on this continent a radical new possibility for humanity.  It was the very idea that there should be a society in which all people created equal by God should simply have the opportunity to be.  It was a radical idea in 1776, and it's a radical idea today.  The idea, according to our founders, was that governments would be instituted to secure that right.  Now, the United States has never fully actualized that ideal, but at our best, we've tried.  And when forces have risen up to oppose it, generations have risen up to push them back.  That's why with abolition, we pushed back against slavery.  With women's suffrage, we pushed back against the suppression of women.  with the civil rights movement.  We pushed back against institutionalized white supremacy and segregation.  Now, in none of those cases did the government just wake up one day and decide to change itself.  In all of those cases, it was the people stepping in that made the difference.  I'm running for president because we're living at a time once again where we need the people to rise up and step in.  For this time, we are not being opposed to our equality and our freedom by an evil institution, but rather by an amoral economic system that posits short-term profits for corporate entities as more important than the well-being of our people, the people of the world, and the planet on which we live.  This economic system has corrupted our government and it has hijacked America's moral value system.  Conventional politics will not fix this.  Our government seeks to perpetuate itself.  Simply a better version of the old will not bring forth the new.  Instead, we need a revolution of the heart, a revolution of spirit, in which we see that all public policy should align itself with that which makes people thrive, which releases our spirits and helps us be everything that we can be.  When that happens, what you get from it is peace.  When that happens, what you get from it is possibility.  What you get from it is prosperity, economic and every other kind.  This is not the kind of principle that conventional politics is going to bring forth.  This is the kind of principle that is brought forth when our eyes are open to see something that has not been, but which still can be.  I'm happy, I'm proud that I'm not of that old system because the old system is not what we need now.  Franklin Roosevelt said that the primary responsibility of the presidency is not its administrative aspect.  That, he said, is secondary.  Primary role, he said, is moral leadership.  As someone who's been a moral leader, as someone who has sought to help people transform crisis and find that place within themselves where they do thrive and where therefore situations do transform, I feel I can help this country do the same.  If you align with these ideas and you hear me and something in you says, I think that's true, then I hope that you will vote for me And we will transform America. ",
