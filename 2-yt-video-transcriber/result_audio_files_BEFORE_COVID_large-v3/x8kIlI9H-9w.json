She's actually come out twice now in a short period of time, a few weeks, and seemingly made veiled, not so veiled, accusations about cannibalism and pedophilia in the entertainment world.  So as many of you know, this last year or two it's come out that in the entertainment world, washington and above they're rampant with pedophilia and cannibalism all this sick stuff coming out from a lot of different places.  but now it seems like some actors are actually trying to get ahead of this.  you tell me here's the first clip from last night.

Kelly and Michael Jackson made great music, you know?  If I found out Macklemore did some weird stuff, I'd be happy to free up the space on my iPhone, you know?  It just, like, depends who did it, you know?  And I understand people who say, like, how could you listen to that music after what he did?  Headphones?  I don't know.  Believe me, look, once we start doing our research, we're not going to have much left.  Because it seems like all really talented people are sick.  At least own it.  I don't need to ever see a Kevin Spacey movie again.  But if the CEO of Swisher Sweets turns out to be a cannibal, I can't just change my whole life. ",
