You say that as you have a firearm on your hip.  If the Rebel's known for anything, it is our editorial billboard trucks.  I'm a huge fan of them.  This is my second one.  My first one was a huge success, and now today I'm in Washington,  D.C.,  sharing my interviews with the squad.  that happened earlier this week, where the squad, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, they all refused to condemn terrorism.  It's a rare thing for a politician not to leap at the opportunity to condemn violence, but for some reason, these three just didn't do it.  Further to that, Ilhan Omar refused to condemn al-Qaeda later in the day.  It's crazy what the squad is doing, and it reflects probably in their polling numbers.  They're polling it Huge lows.  I think one member of the squad is actually polling at a 7% approval rating.  I can understand why not.  condemning terrorism on American soil is a big no-no.  So we're going to take this billboard truck for a spin around Washington, D.C.  Let's go for a ride.  What a day here in Washington, DC.  I have fun with these trucks every single time.  It's always a blast.  We're at the Washington Monument.  We're at Congress.  We're at the White House.  We were at the Trump International Hotel, and then we went to DNCHQ over the lunch hour to show them the billboard truck to remind them exactly who they have in their caucus.  They weren't very happy.  They sent a security guard out to kind of threaten me.  Take a look at this.  Sorry, we're not trying to harass anyone.  We're just, you know, exercising our First Amendment rights, and we want to know if the DNC will condemn terrorism.  No, I'm the reporter here.  I'm asking questions, and I just want to know if the DNC will condemn terrorism.  Do you work for the DNC, or are you law enforcement?  No.  So you're going to continue just the... Probably.  Okay, we'll call the DNC.  Sorry?  Okay.  You'll call what?  Am I allowed to be on a public sidewalk?  We're going to find out.  We're going to find out.  We're going to find out if I'm allowed to be on a public sidewalk.  You say that as you have a firearm on your hip.  Is this America, or am I allowed to be on a sidewalk?  Can I answer that?  I'm allowed to be here.  I take it.  What's your name?  Sorry?  What is your name?  My name is Kian Bexie.  I'm with RNN from Canada.  From where?  I'm with RNN.  Okay.  so we'll see what we can do.  are you trying to get i'm allowed to what?  sorry can you not put that in my face?  yeah i mean i'm.  i'm just interviewing folks on the sidewalk.  we'll just.  we'll just interview folks with the dnc.  okay have a good day.  hey there how are you?  we're doing a story on whether or not the dnc will condemn terrorism.  would you do that?  Now, I'm not going to let that get me down.  I think the message was heard loud and clear from both the DNC and from Americans here in Washington, D.C.  It was a great day here.  Thank you so much for everyone who supported the truck.  And if you haven't yet and would like to help us recoup our costs on it, it cost us about $2,000 to put this billboard up and drive it throughout Washington, D.C.  for eight hours today.  It was a blast, and I think we got our message across.  Please help us out by going to nohate.com to pitch in a few bucks.  And also sign our petition calling on all politicians of all stripes, regardless of party, to condemn terrorism and condemn Antifa for who and what they are.  For the Rebel.media, I'm Kian Bexte.
