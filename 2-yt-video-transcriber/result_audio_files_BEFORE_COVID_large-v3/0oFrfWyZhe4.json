            "text": "Okay.  Resisting?  I had my gun.  I had my gun.  I'm protecting my gun.  Who are you?  I'm a CPD.  Okay.  We're out of... That's what I was holding.  Okay.  Out of where?  What office?  Mr.  House.  Okay.  Okay.  I went out there to use the phone.  312, can I get a sergeant to my location?  Okay.  Where's my purse?  Look, all my cash is in there.  Right there.  Okay.  So let's go to the office and deal with it in there, okay?  312?  312, just let him know we're going to be in the loss prevention office and we're just going to be waiting in there for the time being.  And can I get him on Delta?  Or who is it that's coming?  so I can call him?  10-4, just let me know who I'm going to be calling in at.  One step at a time, okay?  If there's nothing, then it's nothing.  But you know as well as I do how we have to deal with it, right?  Yeah, I know.  I wasn't resisting, I was holding my gun.  And that may be, but we still got to take it a step at a time.  Come on, just try and relax and let me take care of the rest of this, okay?  So what happened?  She picked her up on camera.  Yeah, on the CCTV, selecting this one.  She already had this one.  We got a call from the associate that she was walking away with it, which is standard.  We start watching them once they walk away from the area.  She goes downstairs, and she goes to the home department.  At this point, he starts floor surveillance, and we got her concealing this one and this one into the bag.  In the home department, she exits the home department and then goes towards the men's fragrance, and then she selects this one.  and walk straight out with it.  and then at that point we approached her and identified ourselves and she started resisting.  okay resisting how i gotta ask.  oh she resisted like she was like following commands back in the store.  she didn't want to move.  i'm like ma'am i don't want to have to put you in cuffs let's come back.  She just kept tensing up, tensing up, and she goes, I have a gun, I'm gonna go, blah, blah, I'm messing with you.  So I put her hands behind her back for safety reasons.  She started resisting right away, saying, no, I'm not coming back, blah, blah, blah.  And we just kept on, you know, telling her, man, it's not a big deal.  Just put your hands behind your back.  We don't want to do this.  And finally, bystanders helped out, detained her.  Her gun actually fell out of her side waist with a gun and holster on the ground.  At that point, I don't know, you know, what's going to happen because her arm is still loose now.  put her foot on it, she was stepping on it to the associate when you grabbed it.  Okay.  You know, secure it and everything.  That's fine.  Get her detained, put her hands behind her back.  At this point, I'm asking her, what's your badge number if you're an officer?  And she's like, no, I'm not giving it to you.  And she hides her badge.  At that point, I'm on dispatch already with 911.  And I give them the badge number once I finally see it.  Okay.  And I asked her if she had any other weapons on her.  She kept reaching different ways.  And that's when she took out the knife from her waistband.  Okay.  Or pump it up.  um i kept asking her you know why is she studying blah blah.  she goes.  she's saying that she didn't wasn't walking out.  she didn't know she was walking out.  she kept saying that she didn't know if she was walking out like man you.  finally she goes.  where's the place to pay?  i said wait over here and she goes.  i'm like you walked out way over there already trying about to turn the corner going towards the starbucks.  i mean okay what's the total right now?  so i gotta get you the total.  Let's start all that then, and we can figure it out from there.  All right.  Sergeant Hubbard's on the way.  All right.  Hello.  All right.  Can you just tell us what happened?  Yeah.  Basically, me and my partners, Erica Castillo, we picked her up on camera.  She selected a... She selects a fragrance set, pulls it off the shelf.  She has another one in her hand, smaller one.  She has it underneath the fragrance set.  She goes downstairs.  She conceals one of the small fragrances into the Macy's bag she already has when we picked her up.  She walks into the home department.  At this time, I'm already on floor surveillance.  Erica's on camera watching her.  She goes to the home department, goes all the way in the back.  I'm seeing her on floor.  She conceals the fragrances from upstairs into the bag, into the Macy's bag.  Comes out of the home department.  walks into the men's fragrance department.  So it's another fragrance that walks around, walks right out into the lower level, into the mall, starts making their way into the corner.  So she's clearly in a mall.  Well, we'll pass her.  I push her slowly.  You know, I identify myself as Macy's Acid Protection.  She goes, what fragrance?  I'm like, man, the fragrance underneath it, and I told her, just go back in the, you know, we'll talk about this.  She goes, no, I'm not going to come back.  And I was like, ma'am, just go back with us, you know, call me.  She goes, no, no.  And, you know, this time she's kind of resisting, and this time, you know, we don't know what she's going to do next.  So we tried to put her in handcuffs.  I'm like, ma'am, is our procedure to put you in handcuffs?  You know, just relax.  And she goes, no, no.  And she starts resisting, moving her arms.  At this point, you know, she, I was like, she goes, have a gun on me.  I'm like, are you armed?  And she goes, yes, I have a gun on me.  She makes cute speaking gestures like that.  So at this time, we're fighting with her.  I'm like, ma'am, just put your hands behind your back.  We're trying to, you know, put your hands behind your back, put your hands behind your back, ma'am.  Just cooperate with us.  She doesn't want to put her arms behind her back.  We're trying to get her in control.  Erica takes her to the ground.  We take her to the ground.  this one that I put her hands behind her back.  Her gun falls out, and she puts her foot on the gun, trying to hold it with her foot, trying to hold it down.  I'm like, ma'am, we're securing the gun.  Just walk her with this.  And this time, she's just struggling, struggling.  And we finally get her in handcuffs.  Bystander helped us and put her in handcuffs.  And we sit her down.  At this time, I'm on the phone with 911, let her know what's going on.  And I tell them, she's saying she's a police officer.  I see a badge on her.  She covers it.  She goes, no, I'm not going to let you see it.  I'm like, ma'am, what's your name then?  She's like, I'm not telling you nothing.  And she's trying to cover it.  And, you know, finally, Erica, you know, pulls the badge, decides to read it.  And I let the dispatcher know what her badge number was.  And at this time, SAPD arrived.  Okay.  Okay.  What's the value of the item?  $438, all together.  Wow.  And the Macy's bag she had, was that from a prior purchase?  or did she pick that up from a... from Iraq.  Okay, so it's not, it's not like she had bought something else and just happened to drop that bag in there.  It's a bag she picked up specifically.  Specifically, yes.  Because I asked her, because there was another fragrance that was in there, and I asked her, would you get this one?  She goes, for men's fragrance.  I said, is it purchases?  She goes, no, I got it for men's fragrance.  And she just kept saying that.  That was a total.  I have, we have a video that's showing out in the mall.  So you'll be able to see, you'll be able to see her and I'll pace around with the frame and set and then walk out and you'll be able to see like a corner of it and part of it.  Actually, you know what, you'll be able to see most of it.  How about you guys struggling?  Struggling, yes, you'll be able to see part of it.  Can you, how do we get that?  or how do we do that?  Can we view that or?  We all meet, yeah.  Can we do it here or do we have to be out here?  Or can we pull her somewhere else?  Yeah.  Anything else?  Okay.  Okay.  Can you see it?  Yeah.  If you need magnetic, it's moving right now.  Yeah, we'll see.  Oops.  Charlie, listen.  I'm gonna talk to you over the years.  It'll be the follow-up.  All right.  You stop it one more time.  Okay.  Thank you, Raquel.  Thank you.  I'm going to come around this because it's in the ocean.  Maybe on the tunnel you'll see it better.  Once we get in the storm.  A little bit.  Another one.  What you'll see is coming back, and that's when it really started.  That's right, that's right.  You need to stop looking.  You want to go for the siskin?  You have to go for the siskin.  This is when you got her back in the store, right?  Yeah.  Because we'd already seen her walk out.  Okay, so she walked out, and y'all escorted her back in, and now she's struggling.  Yeah, she didn't want to put her hands behind her back.  I'm like, ma'am, I got a chance behind your back.  I wish we had audio.  That would be sweet.  I wish we had body cams.  It makes it a lot easier to figure out all that.  Matter of time.  I'm sure it's the way the security industry goes.  It won't be long before y'all... Major company like Macy's will start doing that stuff.  Did she hear any of this conversation and can we talk to her?  Yeah, you can talk to her.  Yeah, can you get her up here so we can talk to her?  Because we may need to list her as a witness.  Because she's listening, overhearing us.  She can tell us what she heard.  It's important.  So how far out was she?  She was out down the corner?  Right over there, almost where those chairs are.  So that's the main mall, right?  The little painted line there is the threshold?  Yeah.  Or the tile line there, I guess?  Yep.  Gotcha.  And the fact that where'd the bag come from?  You know, you don't pick up a bag for no reason.  Yeah.  You don't go back and search that.  I mean, I'm paranoid when I go into the mall.  I don't pick... When I go to buy my... It's good to have something in your hand and be on the phone.  I've done that.  I'm like, oh, crap.  You know, but not like that.  And four different items.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, one item.  Yeah, four items.  It's like you're sticking it under your arm while you're lifting something.  Oh, shoot, I can see someone wanting it.  Yeah, yeah.  You say, oh, I'm sorry.  Here's the... money, but when you got four and they're in a bag.  I just don't want to go through, even if I made a fire perfume and just put it, oh, shoot.  You know, I was talking, I don't want to go through the hassle. ",
