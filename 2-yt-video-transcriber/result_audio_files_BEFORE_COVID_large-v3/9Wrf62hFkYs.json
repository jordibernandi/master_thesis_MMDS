            "text": "YouTube has gone through a series of controversies over the past several years, resulting in many different adpocalypses, a word that describes when advertisers pull off the YouTube platform and every creator gets hurt.  It doesn't matter what kind of content you make.  If Pepsi, for instance, says they don't want to advertise on YouTube, then people who make video game content will see less ads from Pepsi and they will lose money.  For the past week or so, or several days, Carlos Maza of Vox has been targeting Steven Crowder because Steven Crowder has said mean things about him.  Now, the left will call this harassment, but I don't think that's apt in that harassment requires certain, well, look, it's semantics, right?  They're going to say harassment because it benefits their argument that Carlos is somehow a victim instead of saying mean things, which is basically what Steven Crowder did.  Steven Crowder was mocking Carlos Maza as a comedian while he rebutted many of the ideas that Carlos Maza has put forth on his massive platform.  But something interesting has happened.  And the reason why I bring up the adpocalypse is that, interestingly, there's been a kind of shift in the rhetoric pushed by Carlos Maza as he appeared on BuzzFeed News, I believe this morning, just this morning.  And now he's talking about advertisers.  He's not, he said, Steven Crowder isn't necessarily the problem.  It's that, you know, YouTube is going to be distracting advertisers by claiming to be for pride so the advertisers don't realize their content appears on homophobic content,  etc.,  There's a big concern, a fear now that Carlos Maza, for some reason, isn't worried about the harassment he's receiving.  He's worried about advertisers putting their sponsorship on certain content.  That could potentially trigger an apocalypse and negatively impact all creators.  Now.  I don't want to play into any conspiracy theories that Carlos is doing this on purpose to benefit the corporation he works for, which is, you know, I believe it received $200 million from NBC.  But it is kind of odd that in the dire straits faced by Vox, you know, they're switching to part-time workers.  Their evaluation is down by their own reporting.  Digital media as a whole has been hurting all of a sudden.  They're targeting independent creators, but it's not so much about Crowder.  It's they're now switching to the advertisers.  I don't think it's fair to say definitively they're doing this, but I do have a lot of articles to show you where it seems like they, at the very least, Vox knows they can cause massive economic damage to all YouTube creators.  Because they can survive through other monetary means, especially when they have massive venture, you know, massive investment from NBC.  So maybe this is Carlos Maza, who's angry with Steven Crowder, deciding that he wants to damage all YouTubers because who cares about other people?  It's about him getting what he wants.  So he's shifting from Crowder to targeting advertisers.  Very interesting.  Before we continue, go to timcast.com slash donate if you want to support my work.

Of course, you can just comment on the video, like, because the engagement really helps, subscribe, and share if you haven't already.  So let's go through a little bit of what Carlos Maza says, and it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment, but I'll start it with about 27 seconds left, and then we'll address his comments on BuzzFeed.  Well, do I stop here?  That's not true.  The shirt that Steven Crowder sells says socialism is for figs.  There is literally a fig and a leaf here.  Now, People on the left are going to point out there's a joke being made, right?  The joke is quite literally that they're not saying what he said.  I can't say it on YouTube.  They're saying figs.  That's the point.  It's meant to make you angry without actually crossing the line.  Comedians often do offensive things.  George Carlin has a segment where he uses many racial slurs.  This is Steven Crowder making a joke, and they quite literally have a fig.  By all means, you could argue that Steven Crowder's shirt is dancing dangerously close to saying a certain word, but it quite literally does not say what he's saying it says.  Let's carry on. ",

            "text": "So quite literally, for some reason, Carlos Maza is now going after advertisers.  He's trying to make the play not about Crowder.  He's trying to make it about YouTube not being able to handle their advertisers properly.  Well, naturally, this has made many, many people angry.  In this tweet from Keemstar, who is a big YouTuber who has a show called Drama Alert, talking about YouTube drama and things of the sort.  This man at Gaywonk is trying to start another adpocalypse on YouTube again because another YouTuber hurt his feelings.  Great job.  You are now the enemy of all YouTubers.  Here's the thing.  Carlos Maza presumably gets a paycheck through Vox, which has massive investment from NBC.  You can argue that Steven Crowder is wrong.  Crowder says this is about a big corporation targeting independent creator.  I don't think there's a conspiracy here.  I think it's an issue of risk.  I think Carlos Maza knows full well that he can target all YouTube creators as a sort of just scorched earth tactic.  Hurt everyone because who cares?  He gets his paycheck through other means.  He can cause harm to me.  He can cause harm to the Minecraft committee, whoever else, because he'll get what he wants.  This shows you another instance of Carlos Maza as an individual.  He is very, I don't necessarily want to say he's evil, but man, does he not care about other people?  And he's extremely narcissistic and authoritarian.  And don't take my word for it.  Well, actually take my word for it.  I have a post from him.  Carlos Maza Vox has called for the physical assault of people in order to humiliate them.  He then is outraged that someone makes fun of him online, resulting in his humiliation.  Mazza insinuates then that an authority or principle like figure needs to enforce the rule.  So let's, we can take a look at this.  He said, milkshake them all.  Humiliate them at every turn.  He goes on to say it's YouTube's fault because they won't step in and he has to show his humiliation.  You can't simultaneously call for physical assault against someone and then complain about you being humiliated.  But it shows the nature of who this man is, right?  Not only has he called for physical violence against other people, albeit some of the lowest possible level of violence.  you can get throwing food at somebody.  But now he's escalating and trying to hurt everyone on YouTube.  Here's the thing.  He is not a small, poor individual being targeted by the big creator.  In fact, Vox has over 6 million subscribers, which is many more subscribers than Steven Crowder, who has 3.8 million.  In fact, Carlos Maza hosts one of the highest viewed shows, segments, on the Vox channel.  We can look at the past week.  The video before his only got 375,000.  His got over a million.  Before that half a million, he got a million.  We do see, you know, periodically other videos breaking or getting higher than his, but he does have one of the more popular segments called Strike Through.  His video before this, another million views.  This is a creator for an NBC-funded platform that has no fear of risk, destroying the livelihood of every YouTuber because he's mad.  one guy has criticized him and said mean things about him.  That's where we're at.  It's really interesting though, right?  So again, I want to stress, I'm not going to push any kind of conspiracy theory or anything, but let's do this.  This is a story I've highlighted before from Vox.  Disney put more than $400 million into Vice Media.  Now it says the investment is worthless.  We don't care about Vice right now.  What we care about is the fact that Vice reported itself.  They believe, at least this reporter, that Comcast, which put in a collective $600 million into Vox and BuzzFeed over the past few years, now thinks those two publishers are worth.  The value is down, they're saying.  Now things have published, we don't know yet, but it is a reasonable bet that Comcast thinks they are worth less than it thought in 2015.  Someone writing for Vox, published on their platform through their editors, recognizes their evaluation is likely down.  I believe they had layoffs last year, but here's where we're at today.  Vox media hiring data reveal massive shift away from W4 workers post-unionization.  So this person wrote a post, and we can see that Vox for full-time, non-contract, non-part-time workers has actually ebbed and flowed, but is in a downward trend.  We can see it's a slight downward trend.  But their contract and part-time and freelance have skyrocketed.  There's two things we can get from this.  They've got money.  They've got big investment.  They may be hurting to a certain degree.  This could be the result of them not wanting to empower the union any further.  By hiring contract part-time and freelance workers, they can essentially skirt any unionization problems.  It also could be, like CNN, they're strapped for cash and have to make sure they can stay in the black and not go into debt.  So they're tasked now with how can we get more people to work for less?  It is inherently, it is absolutely cheaper to hire part-time and freelance workers as it is to hire a full-time worker, especially when you bring on someone full-time and there's no guarantee they can produce something every single day.  They're going to be sitting around some days doing research, but a freelancer, you can pay per job.  So it's much, much cheaper now.  Vox disputes the analysis, except this person who wrote this didn't essentially claim anything about what Vox was doing.  He didn't say Vox is doing it for any reason.  He said, this is what's happening.  Well, Vox was upset because they said, we're still hiring full-time workers.  Sure.  In a downward trend since 2017.  It's interesting then, I guess, in my view that That with all of the problems being faced by digital media, we now see Carlos Maza targeting Steven Crowder, but escalating to going after all of YouTube to hurt everyone's income.  It's not the first time this has happened.  There was a guy, I believe, like several months ago.  who made a video calling out YouTube, but specifically targeting advertisers.  So listen, it's one thing if he came out and said, I do not like what Steven Crowder says.  It's another thing when he comes out and says advertisers, this is the real problem.  Advertisers are advertising on bad content because he doesn't care that he's going to actually cause massive damage to everyone so long as he gets his way.  Here's what happens when you follow the rhetoric of people like Carlos Maza, who claims to be the victim.  This is a video that's going around today of a single old man by himself while people scream at him.  And guess what happens?  Someone throws a milkshake at him.  This old man gets hit in the face with a milkshake.  What do you think happens next?  Do you think it just ends with someone getting hit with a milkshake?  No.  These people are nuts, by the way.  He gets hit and then it actually escalates.  The guy throws it back.  Somebody shoves, he shoves back.  And then all of a sudden the police have to intervene.  And then he gets shoved down by somebody.  One guy by himself being shoved around by left-wing unhinged individuals who hit him with a milkshake.  Carlos Maza, who tweeted out that this is what you should do, is now claiming to be the victim.  In fact, we can look at exactly what he's doing.  He's going to hurt all YouTubers.  He is encouraging physical assault against other people.  I've actually seen people say, oh, it's just humiliation to throw a milkshake at them.  Why aren't conservatives calling for throwing milkshakes back?  It's really interesting, isn't it?  We can also see many people have been arrested for doing this.  So whether or not this results in anything massive, YouTube hasn't done anything yet, so I don't know exactly what will happen.  But it's funny to me to see kind of the double standard, right?  In this tweet from yesterday, someone posts a photo of a seven-year-old selling hot chocolate, and the next photo is them running him over.  It's interesting how this works, isn't it?  And we can see that what's happening with Carlos Maza is just the same old tired activist tactic.  Now they're going after Tucker Carlson again.  So this is just what they do.  Instead of Carlos Maza standing up and pushing back on Stephen Crowder, he does what you'd expect.  He decides to not only target Crowder based on being mean, using his identity as a cudgel, protecting himself.  He actually wants to target everyone on YouTube.  The interesting thing here is digital ads are going to take over the mainstream ads.  But these big digital companies aren't doing too well.  I'd imagine, I don't know if Vox is profitable.  They're generating revenue, I would assume so, especially based on their YouTube.  But with every other company shrinking and laying people off, I can't imagine Vox is doing too well, especially with their hiring patterns.  So it's really interesting then that they're targeting their competition.  Here's the thing that's really important to know about YouTube ads.  Sneeze coming.  Sorry.  The thing about YouTube ads is that there is a nearly infinite supply of advertising space with so many videos being uploaded every day.  It drives the cost of ads down to a ridiculously low number.  Advertisers say, I don't care who I advertise to just put my ad somewhere.  Well, guess what?  It costs you about one cent per view.  lowest possible denomination.  If there were only 10 channels, they would all be fighting over access to that space.  So whether or not Carlos is doing that on purpose, I'm not going to imply that.  It's very, very convenient for NBC and for Vox that he is targeting a big creator who probably is a massive space for ads and trying to damage the ad revenue of YouTube as a whole, Vox can survive.  They have corporate money.  They have a massive infusion of cash.  Small creators who are making only a few thousand dollars a month or even a year can't.  They can't survive if they get hit.  They could be made homeless.  But this is somebody who doesn't care about the community.  He doesn't care about the lives of other people.  He just wants to win.  He wants to burn it all down.  Of course, I wouldn't be surprised if Vox is completely okay with it because it benefits Vox in the long run.  it benefits an NBC-backed company to make sure independent creators can't speak up.  So as it pertains to, you know, Steven Crowder and his edgy humor and his jokes, by all means, you can criticize Crowder for mocking people.  The thing is, we've seen comedians make fun of people.  Jon Stewart, I mean, he makes fun of people.  You see Trevor Noah on The Daily Show makes fun of people.  You've got, I'm forgetting the guy's name on HBO, John Oliver, he makes fun of people.  And the thing is, they're not making fun of little regular people like we saw with the Daily Beast targeting some Bronx forklift operator.  They're targeting people at or around their level or in politics or who are public figures.  Carlos Maza is certainly one of those things, and he's being made fun of by an individual.  The only thing that Carlos Maza has is that his identity is considered protected, and he's using that against Steven Crowder.  I do not believe for a second.  Carlos Maza cares at all about the names Crowder is calling him for a few reasons.  One, Steven Crowder is calling him names that he himself refers to himself as.  Like Carlos Maza called himself many of these things.  Not 100%, but very, very much so.  Some people argue, well, he's taken it back.  He can do that.  You can't.  Sure.  Except then he goes to target advertisers.  If that's the case, I really do not believe this is about someone harassing him or pride.  It's about him saying, if you criticize me, I will take you down and I will burn everything down around you and everyone else.  So you want to know why I'm mad?  Because I'm sitting here working every day and I get demonetized every single day.  This guy shows up employed by a massive corporation where his income is safe.  And for sure, I can be like, dude, you know, I was critical of Steven Crowder's mockery of him, recognizing Crowder's a comedian.  That's why I probably disagree.  I get it.  You can do comedy.  People make fun of each other.  But ultimately, what ends up happening is this guy turns to target our revenue, our income, because he is mad at somebody for criticizing him.  We'll see what happens.  You know, Joey Salads responded to Keemstar saying, bury this guy.  I mean, that's probably dangerous language.  Be careful because Twitter is not going to care about context or what you mean.  But the issue may escalate if YouTubers stand up and target, you know, and call him out.  Carlos Maza is claiming he doesn't want to be harassed, but he's doing everything in his power to make sure everyone hates him.  So I'll leave it there.  Thanks for hanging out.  This is a very YouTube centric video, but I thought it was important.  And yeah, leave a comment on what you think.  You can follow me on Mines at Timcast.  I'll have more videos coming up at 6 p.m And for those on the podcast, I will see you shortly. ",
