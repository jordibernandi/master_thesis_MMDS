            "text": "We've got to clean up an injustice, a legal rule that allows claims made by anonymous people to destroy the lives of innocent men and no consequences.  Actor John Jarrett is just the latest example.  Two weeks ago, a jury found that Jarrett, the star of Wolf Creek, found him not guilty of raping a woman at his home more than 40 years ago.  Now, that woman, whose name is still suppressed, had been living at the time with Jarrett and his wife.  And Jarrett admits, yes, they had sex, but it was consensual, and some years later he confessed that to his wife.  As for the alleged victim, she did not go to the police.  She said nothing at the time because she didn't want to damage Jarrett's marriage.  But the jury, it found the woman's allegations were not established.  Not beyond reasonable doubt.  So Jarrett is an innocent man.  Except, of course, Jarrett is also a much poorer one.  He had to pay a lot to defend himself.  And he says, and in the meantime acting jobs straight up, certainly after those allegations against him became public, and is also an angry man.  Angry that he was publicly shamed, despite being innocent, while his accuser, even today, cannot be named. ",

And, you know, I think it's an extraordinary distortion of what most people would regard as normal justice.  Look at the consequence for Jarrod in terms of his career.  He was really doing well in his career after years of effort, and that's been totally derailed.  He faces enormous costs.  She had the public prosecutors acting for her, taxpayers' expense, and her anonymity is preserved.  I just think this is a real distortion of what most of us feel would be appropriate in this case.

But it's also true of ordinary blokes, of course.  I could give you half a dozen cases of people who are talking to me right now, including a mum I was talking to.  I'm going to actually be interviewing her next week, whose 18-year-old son was accused, and then The case fell apart.  The police decided it didn't stand up.  And that boy suffered enormous damage as a result of the impact of that, you know, the rumour around that particular case.  And there's been no consequences for the woman concerned.  I mean, it's really problematic what's happening here.  You might remember, Andrew, we talked before about Sarah Jane Parkinson, a woman who was sent to jail in Canberra earlier this year.  as a result of making false rape accusations.  And that case got enormous publicity because it's so rare that women actually get publicly named and suffer any consequence.  In her case, she went to jail for three years.  She's now applying for early parole, which will astonish some people.  But she, you know, it cost that family trying to protect their son that she'd accused.  It cost them well over $300,000.  The boy, the young man went to jail for four months.  Enormously damaging case for the family that she'd accused. ",

You cannot take anyone's word at face value without a proper process.  But listen, the MeToo movement, you had Tracey Spicer getting involved and telling Jarrett's accusers to go to the police.  Now, in my view, totally appropriate.  She also called the woman brave, and that to me implied that the woman's story at least in her mind, was true and that was put out there.  But to your mind, was there anything that Spicer did that was wrong? ",

I mean, as you say, there are some cases where you might want to encourage other people to come forward when there's a lot of evidence already, particularly like the Weinstein case or a number of other prominent examples like that.  But it's also very easy for this sort of thing to turn into a witch hunt.  I recently made a YouTube video with a A guy who is a musician who teaches music in schools, and he had an accusation from a student, and it was investigated by police.  But in the meantime, there was this social media campaign against him, naming him as a preterist.  More accusation.  You know, they elicited more accusation to come forward.  It was all investigated.  Docs... Department of Community Services and the police found that the accusations didn't stand up.  But he's still not allowed to teach in New South Wales schools.  I mean, the damage to someone's reputation of this sort of witch hunt is just enormous.  And it's happening all the time. ",
