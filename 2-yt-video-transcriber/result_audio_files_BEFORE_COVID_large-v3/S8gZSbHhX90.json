For everyone who's been following this channel, obviously on a daily basis we are giving you updates on what's happening in the UK and with the whole Brexit scenario.  So yesterday and today what we've had is opposition parties who have been asking for a long time to have a general election, they got together and said basically they have confidence in Boris Johnson and the government by rejecting the call to have a snap election.  And this morning we had the court case that Juno Miller and John Major had to stop Boris from proroguing Parliament.  That failed as well.  So Boris Johnson now has the power to prorogue Parliament as planned and the only way for the Remainers to stop Brexit is to keep pushing for their bill to force Boris Johnson to go to the European Council and ask for an extension.  But again, they don't see the flaw in that.  But today we're going to talk about last night and BBC Question Time panel because the people of this country are finally fed up with politicians, especially from the Remain side, who are wasting their time and instead of actually respecting democracy and delivering what they promised to do.  First, let's start with the SNP. ",

That's the problem we have with our democracy because we don't have, in the words of Theresa May, strong and stable politicians.  And the only people we now see right now in the country who are strong and stable are the Boris Johnson's government, the Brexit party, because you know they have conviction, whether you disagree or agree with their policies, you know what they want to do.  But the problem of Western's the bubble and politicians being out of touch is going even further and deeper because they are spending all their time in the House of Commons and in Parliament, not really debating, but just shouting over each other and interrupting each other.  And we had a perfect evidence and example of that last night. ",

And it's about time, to be fair, politicians were to be held to account properly.  So if they don't sort out their problems in Parliament... I would not be surprised if people become completely fed up and do something about it.  And if we don't get our election, it's going to be even worse.  Let's see how this weekend goes and how the next week where we're going to come back and do more videos and see where we are with these people.  but as I said last night don't panic just yet if you're a Brexiteer because there's still a chance and for example even if they force Boris Johnson with this bill to force him to go to the EU to ask for an extension he could basically just ignore it and by the time they try to object to it and legally challenge it we have left the EU.  so Even if they don't give us our general election just yet, we should be able to still leave the EU.  But obviously, don't take anything for granted because they could come back with something new that we don't know.  But in the meantime, try to have a great weekend.  Don't watch any news during this weekend because there's going to be a lot more next week.
