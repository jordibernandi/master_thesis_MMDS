You see, the Bible tells us that God's glory can be found in creation.  Okay, so what does that mean?  Do you believe that this car or phone made itself?  Of course not.  That would be ridiculous.  You see, just like this phone and this car had to be created by someone, the universe with the nature, the mountains, the oceans, everything, even humans had to be created.  Yeah, but there is a big difference between a car and a phone and the universe and humans.  You're absolutely right.  There is a big difference between this phone and this car and the universe and our bodies.  Our bodies and the universe are so much more complex than these items.  And that's why it needed a much more intelligent designer.  And my friend, that designer is God.  Well, I can now officially say I don't have enough faith to be an atheist. ",

It is dishonest to assert baseless speculation as though it were a matter of actual fact, the way you just did.  That is tantamount to a lie.  Remember, if you have to lie to defend your truth, then it was never truth to begin with.  The truth is what the facts are, what we can show to be true, not whatever we'd rather pretend instead.  It's not just that there's no evidence in support of your position, although that should be enough that you really don't have any.  It's also because there is so much evidence against it.  That, and all the evidence there really is, supports actual scientific theories, tried and tested fields of study that are logically and evidentially valid, as well as practically applicable, where your belief in an alternative fantasy is neither, being unsupported by anything, and thus indefensible.  For example, complexity is an inevitable property of emergence of incidental designs emerging from the molecular scale on up, where intricacy will invariably be vastly beyond the skill set of any administrator trying to work in reverse from the top down.  So the unnecessarily convoluted patterns we see throughout living systems indicate a natural evolution, not intentional creation, which would actually be much simpler and more efficient.  If a scientist made the sort of empty claims that religious people always do, that scientist would immediately lose all credibility just for making unsupported assertions, to say nothing of all the biased sensationalism that is typically associated with that.  That's why science works, because it is completely opposite of faith and works against faith. ",
