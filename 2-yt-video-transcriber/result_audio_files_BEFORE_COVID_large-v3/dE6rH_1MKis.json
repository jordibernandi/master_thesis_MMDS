His opinions have always been consistent and definitely do not suspiciously change every couple of months specifically to antagonize his audience and cause controversy.  that helps to keep the money flowing in.

Stephen Kenneth Bonnell II is making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a political commentator because he's just that much more knowledgeable, qualified, and just plain better at it than everyone else who isn't.  That's just how the world works, buddy.  Capitalist realism.  Look it up.  Hey folks, so just a bit of a disclaimer here, I would normally not make a video like this.  that just kind of insults an individual so much, but Destiny has not only styled himself as some sort of expert on politics despite being wholly politically illiterate, but he's also so egotistical, so arrogant, and has been such a huge dick to so many people that I think he's pretty much just fair game at this point.  So don't expect more of this type of content from me.  It's pretty much just gonna be a one-off.  Great news if you're new here, though.
