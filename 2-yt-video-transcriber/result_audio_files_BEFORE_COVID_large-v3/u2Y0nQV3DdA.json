            "text": "Bible Answers with Dr.  Al Garza.  All right, welcome back to Bible Answers.  Today I'm going to be dealing with the question that I get quite frequently in my emails as well as in specific comments is regarding basically the question, why do we have so many different interpretations of the Bible?  How do we read and approach the Bible?  Which way or which method do we use?  And this question comes because there are a lot of different denominations out there.  There are a lot of different groups that interpret the scripture a specific way regarding specific beliefs.  now if you want to have a good understanding of the bible as a whole you understand that there's two parts to this.  there's the hebrew scriptures what is called the old testament and of course you have the new covenant or the new testament uh writings as well.  and so we got to make this distinction because during the first century uh when yeshua jesus was you know here as the messiah son of god and picked his disciples The New Testament or the New Covenant writings were not done.  They were not completed until after, you know, well, they were completed within the first century, but they weren't put together until a few hundred years later.  But they did exist for the first three to four hundred years.  But again... We need to come to the scriptures first and understand how do we read a Bible.  If you're a Reformed theologian or you're a Calvinist or you're a fundamentalist or you're a Baptist, you're going to come to the scriptures already with an already tradition being taught in your church that you have accepted because your pastor told you or your seminary told you.  And so what I like to tell people is, look, If you want to know how to understand the Bible better, start with the Hebrew Scriptures, start with the Old Testament.  Get a firm understanding and a good grasp on this, on what the Torah, the first five books mean and understand to Jews at that time, what God commanded Moses to do, and look at the prophets, look at the writings, And then comes the New Testament after you've laid a foundation of the Hebrew Scriptures.  Because the foundation for the New Testament is the Hebrew Scriptures.  Remember, there was no New Testament in the first century.  Jesus, the Apostles, Paul, they all quote and read from the Hebrew Bible.  Not the Septuagint.  Not the Greek Old Testament, but the Hebrew Scriptures.  We know this for a fact.  We've already established this in some other videos that they did not read and quote from the Septuagint.  They read at the local synagogues in Israel and at the temple, the Hebrew Bible.  It's called the Proto-Mesoretic Text.  So, if you don't know that, I encourage you to do more study on that topic.  Look at the work of Manuel Tov and others.  But again, if you want a firm foundation to understand the New Testament, you need to know and build foundation from the Hebrew Old Testament, the Old Testament Bible.  If you don't, you will come out with different beliefs, different doctrines of theology from different walks of life.  And this is why we have different interpretations.  There is no foundation of the Hebrew Scriptures.  There isn't.  Many people that I've come across and talked to, they do not know the Old Testament that well.  They do not know the Hebrew Scriptures that well at all.  They might know the New Testament pretty well, but then they have so many different interpretations from different groups that I ran into.  But when I quote the Hebrew Scriptures, they don't understand.  It's like, well, how does that connect?  I don't understand.  there is no foundation for them.  When you don't have a foundation, it's easy for you to slip away to other doctrines and theology and areas that aren't scripture in itself.  So I always tell people to do that.  Start with the Old Testament.  Even if you want to start there and then compare the New Testament in between, that's fine.  Another thing I encourage you to do is whenever Jesus or the Apostles or Paul quotes the Old Testament, anywhere in the New Testament, go back to what they're quoting and look at the context, look at it as a whole.  What are they quoting?  What's being said there in the Old Testament?  And see how it's being applied and used.  Most people fail to do that.  Most people will look at a quote of the Old Testament in the New Testament and then build their own interpretation, and they do not go back to see what Jeremiah was saying, or what Isaiah was saying, or what the Psalms were saying.  Remember, when Jesus, after his resurrection, he came to his disciples, he opened up the Scriptures, the Hebrew Bible, and from Moses, starting with Moses and the prophets and the Psalms, he showed them everything concerning himself from the Hebrew Scriptures.  Why are we not doing the same?  The New Testament is the witness of the gospel message, of course, and of the life of Jesus and what happened afterward.  But their foundation of the first century of Jesus the Apostle and then Paul was the Hebrew Scriptures.  That's why in the book of Acts, all they quote is the book of Psalms and Moses and the Old Testament, the Hebrew Scriptures.  We need to be well grounded there too.  Let me quote Paul to you regarding what the scriptures meant to them, the Hebrew scriptures.  Here's what Paul says in 2 Timothy 3.16.  And most of you know this, but I don't think you really understand it if you haven't really, you know, really looked at this in detail.  In verse 16, all scripture is inspired or breathed by God.  Now, all scripture, this is not talking about the New Testament.  The New Testament was not completed then.  It wasn't formed then.  He's talking about the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible.  We shouldn't be calling it the Old Testament.  It should be called more the Old Covenant or the Original Covenant because that was the original covenant given by God to his people, the Jews, in which he established it through Moses and the prophets.  But he says all scripture, the Hebrew Bible, is God-breathed and profitable for teaching.  Okay, profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction.  So we've got for reproof and correction.  We've got teaching, reproofing, and correcting.  For training in righteousness.  Okay, good.  Training in righteousness.  So it can be used to train ourselves to walk in a righteous way.  So that the man of God may be adequate.  equipped for every good work.  So you want to be equipped for every good work.  You want to be adequate.  You want to teach.  You want to reproof and correct.  That's what the scriptures, the Hebrew Bible is for.  It's for those things that Paul laid out here.  So if we're not using those same scriptures for reproofing, correcting, and teaching, and bringing men up in righteousness to help train in righteousness, so maybe we may be adequate and brought up as a man of God, then there's a problem.  The New Testament is a different witness that we use, demonstrating that the Messiah came, the gospel message, death, burial, resurrection, under the new covenant, the New Testament, versus the original covenant that God gave.  But if you're not grounded there in the Hebrew scriptures, as Paul makes clear about what the scriptures were for, they are God-breathed.  We don't throw it out.  I've had people tell me, oh, well, why do we need the Old Testament for?  You know, it's done away with.  Well, then you need to throw out the New Testament because all the New Testament does by Jesus, the apostles, and Paul is quote the Hebrew Bible.  That's all they do is quote it.  So maybe throw the New Testament out because that's all it contains a lot of is proof who Jesus is through the Hebrew scriptures.  The witness of the New Testament is the new covenant that we can Now take from and read and see what Yeshua Jesus taught as the Messiah, what the apostles, how the early believers grew, and of course the letters that Paul is giving to us about the Hebrew.  Because all Paul talks about is the Hebrew scriptures and his letters.  He quotes them.  And so does the epistles and revelations.  So we need to be grounded in the same foundation.  I tell people, learn the Hebrew scriptures, learn the Old Testament, read it, get grounded in it, and then come to the New Testament and you'll understand it better that way first and foremost.  If you're going backwards, if you're looking at the New Testament and then interpreting the Old into the New or interpreting the Old under the New, then you're a backward reader.  And that's not how they did in the first century.  Remember, this is a first century writings that we get in the New Covenant, the New Testament scriptures, but they quote in reference to Hebrew scriptures for correctionary proof and training and for teaching.  So we can't throw it out.  We need to know it, learn it, and then use it to see how the New Testament is to be understood.  And until we do that, we're going to have different interpretations all over the place.  This is why we have Calvinism.  This is why we have fundamental Baptist churches and organizations and non-denominationals and We have all these different views of interpretation about different things.  Because most of the time, not all the time, but most of the time, they're not grounded in the original covenant of God, the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible.  They're not.  And they're not familiar with the Torah, the first five books, and familiar with the language of the Hebrew and how they understood certain things.  They're not.  So a lot of times they fail with that foundation and then they get caught up in different winds of teaching and doctrine because they're not grounded by the Hebrew scriptures.  And this is why we have different, we have the charismatic movements looking for tongues for salvation, baptism for salvation, all those things which are foreign to the Hebrew scriptures, Calvinism, Reformed theology, foreign to the Old Testament, foreign to the Old Covenant of God.  And even more so in the New Testament, the new covenant of God.  And I say that because, you know, I studied this tremendously and did a lot of research and looked at how they understood the Hebrew scriptures as the Jews into the new covenant.  Paul being a Pharisee, all of those things are foreign when it comes to reformed theology, baptism for salvation, the gift of tongues for salvation.  They're completely misunderstood because they don't know where it originates from.  It originates from the Hebrew Bible, from the Jewish people, from the Israelites, those who preserved the scriptures in the language, in the Hebrew language of God.  Not the Greek, not the Latin, not the German, not the English.  But this was the language spoken by not only Moses and the prophets, but also of Yeshua, Jesus himself, and the apostles, and Paul, Hebrew.  So we need to get back to the foundation so we can have a better understanding of what the New Testament is trying to tell us.  So I hope this helps.  I know it might stir a little bit of controversy or confusion, but listen, if you have a question, I don't mind dialoguing with you, having a discussion with you.  Leave the comment here.  You can email me.  I have no problem.  Please like and share this.  We need to get some more people grounded in the Hebrew Scriptures as a foundation so we can build the New Testament and the teachings there right above it.  So again, I hope you enjoyed this.
