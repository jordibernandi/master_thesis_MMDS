For a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap mischiefs upon them.  I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction.  To me belongeth vengeance and recompense.  Their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste.  See now that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me.  I kill and I make alive.  I wound and I heal.  Neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.  For I lift up my hand to heaven and say, I live forever.  I am that I am.  Thank you. ",
