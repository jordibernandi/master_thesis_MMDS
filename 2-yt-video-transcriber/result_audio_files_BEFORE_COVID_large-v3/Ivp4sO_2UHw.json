            "text": "All right.  Here I am.  Michael Pearl at the door.  I'm still here sitting in my rocking chair.  You get to do that when you get to be 73 years old.  I'm using hold usually holding grandkids, but, uh, I don't need cracker crumbs in my, on my pants right now.  So I'm not holding any grandkids.  This is question number 37 that you've written in and ask.  And, uh, the answer will be short.  question short.  What does the Bible say about cremation?  It is common in my culture to cremate and in my husband's culture to bury.  I know bear is biblical, but it's cremation of sin.  I looked up, uh, you know, I'd never really thought about that question.  So I looked up the question, uh, and, uh, in the Bible first Samuel 31, 12, I was, I'd missed this.  All the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the body of his sons from the wall of Beth Shane and came to Jabesh and burnt them there.  I never noticed that.  So he was cremated, he and all of his sons.  And so that was the one time it happened in the Bible.  Now, the reason a lot of people ask this question, they're afraid if they get burnt up, how are they going to get resurrected?  Because the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first.  So if your body's in the grave and all your little atoms are down there in the grave, you know, unless a worm crawls out with some of them, but otherwise they're all right there in the grave.  And so God will be able to find them and put them all back together like Ezekiel's valley of dry bones when everything came together.  But if you got cremated, And they go and they dump it in the ocean.  I mean, where would you go to put them all back together again?  God's pretty big, you know, and he's not that limited, I don't think.  They say, well, in the Bible, they always buried, with one exception anyhow.  The reason they did it, that was the custom.  It was a lot easier.  You probably don't realize how much firewood it would take to burn up a human body.  I mean, how much charcoal does it take to burn one stake?  Think about burning up 150, 200 pound body.  You got to keep a hot fire going all night.  It takes a dump truck load of firewood.  And so it was just very impractical, especially in land that had very little wood.  So the easy thing to do, a lot of sand, dig a hole and bury them.  So there are other places where they had a lot of firewood up in the timber lands of the north, Germany and up in that area.  They would burn the bodies there.  Around be frozen lot in the wintertime.  They couldn't bear him in the winter.  So somebody died.  they'd pile love that scrap firewood on a burnt about it.  There was no sacred reason why either Form of burial took place.  It was strictly the practicality of the area in which they lived.  now Here's here's how how serious Jesus is about the form of burial you use.  in Luke 9 59 He said unto another follow me, but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father.  and So his father died, and they were going to have the funeral, and it kind of stretched out in those days.  Jesus said unto him, let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.  Well, that was insensitive, wasn't it?  The guy said, I want to follow you, but I got this funeral.  My dad just died, and I got to go.  Families all gathered together.  He said, let the dead bury him.  You go preach.  Wow, that was sort of insensitive.  Because the guy's already dead.  It's just for you that you go and you grieve.  Except in my case, y'all can put off whatever you're doing.  Come to my funeral, okay?  Promise not to stretch it out too long.  Now, here's another one, Mark 13, 27.  This is pretty good.  This guy gets cremated, see?  And so his kids take the ashes up on top of a tall building, winds blowing 25 miles an hour, and they sprinkle them slowly, and they all float out to sea.  there in New York, Long Island, all float out to sea.  And then shall he send his angels, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds.  Ha, ha, ha.  From the uttermost part of the earth unto the uttermost part of heaven.  So God is capable of going out to where the four winds blow and bringing everything back and reconstituting it.  If a hair on your head is numbered, not one of them falls, but your heavenly father knoweth.  He knows where every cell in grandpa's body is located on this planet.  And all he has to do is speak.  and there's grandpa once again.  So don't worry about nothing.  Don't worry about getting halfway to heaven.  Hey, what happened here, you know?  Couldn't find that arm.  All right, let's quit before I get goofy, all right? ",
