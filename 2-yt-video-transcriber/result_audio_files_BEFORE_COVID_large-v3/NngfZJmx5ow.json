The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus.  Einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat.  Henry Ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry.  that way.  In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you're talking about, the only cases in recorded history where they have had capitalism and largely free trade, if you want to know where the masses are worse off, it's exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that.  So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear.  That there is no alternative way, so far discovered, of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system. ",

He got a Nobel Prize for telling us that greed is the engine of human behavior, that human beings pursue their own self-interest.  This is a man who presumably has a modicum of education.  If he did, and I really, I must wonder listening to this kind of drivel, what in the world, did he never understand psychology?  For a hundred years, psychologists have explained to us with empirical studies and theoretical work, that human beings are bundles of contradictions, that what is my self-interest is something I only dimly perceive, and moreover, many of the things I'm interested in contradict one another.  I both like and don't like people.  I both am drawn to and repulsed by this thing.  I want that, but I don't really.  I went and I got that, and now I wonder, having consumed it, why did I ever do that?  Because I didn't like it at all.  We are not some kind of calculus machine. ",

These are not complex ideas, but they're way beyond anything, Mr... Friedman can manage and that's not by the way because he's illiterate or uneducated.  It's because he has a job to do and that job is to sell private enterprise.  Capitalist private enterprise is the best thing, the only thing, the right thing, just beat it over and over.  Let me tell you a personal story.  I was a graduate student at Stanford University many years ago.  And one of my good friends who shared my distaste for capitalism, which was already developed then.

He said, well, I got an offer I can't refuse.  I said, what are you talking about?  He said, I'm going to the University of Chicago.  I said, why?  He said, because Milton Friedman offered me a quantity of money I never thought I'd see to come there and finish my dissertation, working with him.  And that man went on to be a professor, which I think he just retired from MIT, which is a very high-level economics department.  his radicalism became quiet, something he didn't give up, but he kept very quiet, so a few of us knew about it, because we were his friends when he was younger, but officially he was... Chicago boy as they said.  and I remember thinking oh that's where all that money that he gets from corporations then begins to develop a school so they can go out and say what the corporate very smart of the corporations to find a Milton Friedman who will then develop this ideological kind of cohort that will go out and beat the drum.  you know There's a simple story to tell too.  He liked to go around and when I was a graduate student I heard him a couple times as he came through and he would tell this story about how every time private enterprise takes something over it's done very well and every time the government takes it over it's done very poorly and I won't repeat what we've already talked about that.  the evidence he used was the low profit rate say of airlines or of trains.  And so I had to explain to my students that that was the whole point.  It's a subsidy of private.  So that to say the private is high and the public is low, as if it were an outcome, misunderstands that it was the goal and the point in the first place.  But then I would begin to explain to my students that, for example, in the last 30 years, many of the municipalities in Europe that privatized water, electricity, transport, gas, and so forth, have re-municipalized because the rates are too high because of what the private sector did.  And so the whole empirical basis was just created by him to support this.  But it also shows you that if the wind is blowing in that direction, which in the period of Mr.  Friedman's ascendancy it was, corporations were becoming major players in shaping what was going on, economics was becoming cheerleading for capitalism, the man who led that charge and who could make that the wind of the time was able to get the Nobel Prize and have many of his students also get the Nobel Prize because they were on the Nobel Committee that awarded the prizes to what they did.  And it really shows you, as Marx once said, that the leading idea of any age are the ideas in the leaders of that age.  And, you know, that's what you have at that time.  All that leadership is now dissolving.  the crash in 2008 and 2009, Coming at the end of the neoliberal explosion was a sign that this is not the solution to everything.  This is a disaster.  And so it's become harder and harder.  And the people holding on in the economics profession in the United States, the leftovers, if you like, come from Milton Friedman.  And they don't want to give up their positions.  You have them all over the United States holding on to the economics departments, but literally dying out now to be replaced by a new generation much more ambivalent about capitalism than these cheerleaders ever were.
