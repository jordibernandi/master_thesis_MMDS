This is apparently going to be a dating advice video, because I guess that's a thing?  But before we get into that, as per usual, let's go ahead and get through the fan art for today.  First, we have this one from KK, which I'll go ahead and assume is me after hearing every other apologetic argument for the thousandth time.  Then we have another submission from SpookyBoyRay, and And this one is me and the godless Iowan apparently driving a van into your... I can't get away from this song, can I?  And finally, we have... Oh my.  Well, if there's one thing Aura Echoes has now solidified, it's that I need to apparently pen an anime or a manga or something.  That said, I do have to wonder why you guys keep making me look like I'm badass in some of these pictures, because I'm really not in real life.  But I do thank you all all the same.  That said, let's go ahead and get right into the intro.  All right, so we're on the third episode that I'm doing dealing with Vivi, and I haven't actually felt the need to make numbered episodes for her.  I don't think I ever will.  That's reserved for our favorite Discount Hoven.  That said, apparently she's got some dating advice for all of her subscribers, and by extension, us.  So, let's see what she's got to say. ",

I'm 21, work full time, and last week I started a relationship with a girl from work.  This is my first girlfriend, so I'm still getting used to it all.  Thing is, I sometimes feel guilty because she isn't a Christian.  I am going to make sure that we read the Bible together regularly, and hopefully she will come to church with me.  I made sure she understood that I am a committed Christian and I want to put God first in my life, and she accepted that.  I really want her to know Jesus, but maybe I should have appointed her to Christ just as a friend.  Do you think I should just be friends with her?  Or is it okay to continue the relationship and see what happens?  Keep making awesome videos.  Thanks, Andrew.  So this is actually a really good question. ",

But, like I said before, as long as you don't spend your entire time trying to convert the other person to your way of thinking, which would be considered toxic in almost every other scenario, then you should be fine.  That does give us a little bit of a footnote to work off of.  Isn't it weird how it's somehow accepted by society for you to try to convert somebody else to your religion if you're in a relationship with them?  but if you try to bend them to your will or change their thinking in any other way, we generally consider that to be a bit of toxic behavior.  Like, just with anybody, if they're wrong about something and you guys have a conversation about that, they might change your mind, but it's not your job to change their mind.  Hell, there's probably at least a hundred things that me and Raziel disagree on, and we've pretty much just sat on agreeing to disagree on most of those things, because both of us are way too obstinate to try to convert each other to our way of thinking.  Point is, there are going to be things that you guys disagree on, theology being the least of them.  It should be expected that you and your partner are going to come in with different experiences and therefore different opinions.  What matters is how you two handle that.  after the fact. ",

But that's the thing, though.  When you have a relationship with somebody, sometimes the paths that you walk may end up being very different.  You may have to coalesce on a middle point.  As long as that middle point is something that you two agree on, and neither of you are sacrificing anything so significant so as to possibly lose a part of yourself, then that's not a problem.

If their relationship with a Christian God was the first thing they had in mind and everything else came second, then I could completely understand why some of this might get excused.  But that's why I don't care about your theological beliefs.  I care about whether or not you purposefully cause harm to the human beings around you.  If you do, then I ought not associate myself with you if I can help it.  There's a word for caring about what group someone associates themselves with more than the actual actions of the individual.

The reason that a relationship between two Christians might flourish is because they both have the same goal they're working to achieve, if both Christians are trying to become better Christians.  That did not necessarily make their relationship better or worse, it just meant that they had one goal that they share.  But this isn't something special to Christianity or even religion.  If you and your partner happen to share a goal, then you two are going to be able to work towards that goal together very easily.  At least, much easier than if you two were working at crossed purposes.  This doesn't somehow make Christian relationships more special, and it doesn't make them any more valid.  And it most certainly doesn't mean that if somebody puts Christ first, their relationship will de facto flourish.  It also doesn't mean that if somebody puts themselves first or their partner first, that that relationship will dwindle and die just because they didn't have your favorite god in place. ",

You have to also consider children in the future, if you're planning to have any.

Moreover, the parents can actually reach a comfortable middle ground with their theistic beliefs and not be constantly warring with one another.  The only reason this warring even happens in the first place, at least with Christianity and by extension Islam, is that you have such passages like that unequally yoked one that you mentioned earlier.  that leads to an exclusivity tradition.  This exclusivity tradition that allows only the cool kids in your club to associate with you on any meaningful level.  That is, as I stated earlier, a very quick way to get yourself locked into an echo chamber where differing opinions will never actually be able to sway you.  You either won't be able to hear any dissenting opinions, or their voices will be drowned out by the screams and shouts of your own side. ",

Should we all find only people who happen to share our theistic belief system and that's it?  Or should we just find somebody who's compatible with us?  Let me know in the comments section below.  I'm pretty sure this could be a very interesting topic.  My take, as I said earlier, is that I personally don't care.  As long as somebody doesn't do harm and they're a good person, then they're okay in my book.  Hopefully, I've made my position abundantly clear in the video.
