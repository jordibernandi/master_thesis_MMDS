This is Ukradowski of wearechanged.org here outside the headquarters of Mines and as you've been probably watching our videos and understanding that social media is creating a conundrum for humanity that humanity has never faced or ever dealt with.  And to talk about that plus a lot more we have Tim Poole of Tincast, an independent journalist.  You of course saw him on the Joe Rogan experiment talking to Jack Dorsey himself, bringing up very important issues and uh... Do you think anything happened because of that?  Do you think there was any ramifications?  I think it was good.  I still have to give props to Jack Dorsey.  He's one of the few CEOs to actually face the music.  The music's disgusting, by the way.  The music's dirty.  The music's not only making your ears bleed, it's making people go crazy, literally.  But at least he's listening to the music somehow.  It's pointless.  It's pointless, yeah.  Tim? ",

Then they replaced him with Dick Costolo, who I guess he got fired or resigned.  Jack came back.  I think Jack's a figurehead.  You know, I can sit down in front of the guy and explain to him the problems, and the Only a few of the real problems.  And nothing gets done.  They were banning people for saying to learn to code.  They still ban people for saying learn to code.  If you can't tell the CEO to his face, stop doing this and have him... And then even when he not acknowledges it, they don't fix it.  But you know what, man?  It's not so much just about censorship.  That's a big problem too.  It's about the fact that Twitter's known for a long time.  that the way retweets work, the way your follower count works, it's gamifying the social experience.  And people then try to get their hot take.  They want to tag Luke and say, you conspiracy wingnut, blah, blah, blah.  They want to be as mean as possible to get as many shares and likes.  So they get those numbers and that makes them feel good like they're playing a video game.  We know this is the problem.  Instagram has the same problem.  Facebook has the problem.  And what does anyone do about it?  Two things happen.  Big business forms around it, exploiting it and making money off of it.  And the other thing that happens is it generates an ideology, a weird net of extremes that are pointed at each other, saying the craziest things, getting crazier and crazier.  And now what world do we live in?  Science is being completely denied.  And we're looking at \u2013 for those of you who are ever left-leaning, the Democratic Party is \u2013 I've posted chart after chart showing how insane they've gone because of social \u2013 it's partly because of social media.

            "text": "So most people, when they look at my YouTube, they're like, oh, wow.  The only real criticism I get is that it's conservative.  Not that it's extreme or anything.  It's not.  The headlines are actually kind of tepid.  And if you watch the videos, my opinions are always rather tepid.  And that's kind of the point.  I'm a rather moderate individual.  I lean left.  But the left has gone off the deep end.  So typically the people who say that I'm catering to an audience or trying to produce content, it's because they're usually on the left.  Moderates are like, Tim, you do really great work.  I appreciate it.  And a lot of people who used to align with being liberal.  But I will also say anybody who thinks they're immune to social pressures and these formulas is lying to you.  So I think if you were to look through my content, you'd probably see the content slowly being more and more focused.  And I see that.  I look at my content and I'm like, I feel like I'm covering these important things and trying to pull people back from insanity.  And there are a lot of people who do that.  But I think what's happening is, as the social media companies censor the right, they end up leaving nothing but the mainstream, like, straight-laced, you know, suit-wearing right.  But the left has free reign, for the most part.  The anti-war left gets the boot a lot, too.  And what ends up happening is, like Zuby said, If you want to make someone conservative, have them follow the left.  Because Sarah Jung, right?  Do you know what happened?  Do you know who she was?  She was the racist woman for three years, posted racist things on Twitter.  She gets a job at the New York Times.  They run wild with it.  So I'll say this.  It's harder to radicalize or to drift into that problem of producing more and more extreme content on YouTube because I don't know what YouTube will promote.  I don't.  Like over time, you're kind of like, hey, that video did well.  Maybe I should do something like that.  But with Facebook, you get shares.  With Twitter, you get retweets immediately.  You can see the immediate results and you can see it rapidly expanding fast and people chase after that.  But more importantly, I'm an individual.  I talk about what I think is important.  So a lot of the videos I make are just based around what I'm focused on.  And it's usually because Antifa has attacked me in the past, sent me death threats.  And then it creates kind of a cascade where the more I make that kind of content, the more they point at me, the more they threaten me.  And so then my focus is drawn to them.  With these companies like Mike.com, we saw that story from the outline where they actually give their employees a formula and say, here's how you make rage bait.  Here's how you manipulate people into clicking.  That's not something I'm aware of because I just make things I want to talk about.  And again, my opinions are actually kind of tad, but anybody who knows me, they call me a milk toast fence sitter.  So to accuse me of that, it's kind of like, dude, watch my video.  But those companies have formulized how to manipulate with rage. ",

But look... This is an addiction.  There was a study from the University of Missouri showing that Twitter amplifies extremism.  It's making people go crazy.  It really, really is.  They're lying on purpose to get those clicks, to get those likes and shares.  All these big companies are making money off it.  Is it the fault of the social media company that knows this?  Twitter knows this and they won't do anything about it?  It's their fault too.  We're all sitting here.  We know what's happening, but everyone's addicted to it.
