            "text": "Welcome to Voxiversity.  I'm VoxDay.  Today we're going to delve deeper into the socio-sexual hierarchy.  Last time we talked about alphas.  Now we're going to talk about the lower end of the hierarchy, specifically the rank known as the gamma.  Just a quick refresher, the socio-sexual hierarchy has five primary ranks.  Alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and omega.  The gamma is possibly the most interesting social sexual rank and behavioral pattern in the entire hierarchy.  This is because gammas are among the people with the most undeveloped potential in the social sexual hierarchy.  Let's talk about what the characteristics of a gamma are.  We know that they tend to be low status, but they're not complete social outcasts.  They tend to be unattractive to women.  They tend to be more intelligent than the norm.  They tend to be overweight.  They also tend to be subject matter experts.  If you think about the average individual who is overly obsessive with regards to a particular hobby, that is almost certainly going to be a gamma.  You may recall the movie from the 1980s called The Revenge of the Nerds.  That movie is a gamma wish fulfillment movie that describes what life looks like from the gamma perspective.  In fact, you see a lot of this in Hollywood, you see a lot of this in science fiction.  These are some of the best places to get a unrestrained glimpse into the gamma psychology because it's where people who are gammas are communicating their view of the world without trying to conceal it from you.  Because one of the biggest characteristics of the gamma and probably the most important one the most definitive one is their habitual dishonesty.  Gammas tend to be very very dishonest both with themselves and others.  Remember, this isn't primarily about rank.  This isn't primarily about status, even though that is what people tend to focus on.  What it's primarily about is the behavioral pattern, and there's no group that it is more important to be able to understand, identify, and anticipate than the gamma.  If you've ever been on a internet site where there are comments, whether it's YouTube, a blog, whatever, you can almost identify the gammas simply by the number of words they use in a post.  Because if you see a long post, you're going to see a lot of the very behavior that I'm describing.  You see the posturing.  You see the assumptions of superiority.  You will see the assumption of an ability to not only judge the other person, but even discern their motivations, and if necessary, read their minds.  And the one thing that you will always see is the need to declare victory no matter what happens.  It's very, very difficult and very painful, I think, for the gamma.  If I had one thing, just one thing that I could convince every gamma in the world, it's this.  You're not fooling anyone.  Even when you think you're fooling yourself, even when you are fooling yourself, you're not actually fooling us.  What I'm talking about here is the protective bubble of delusion that gammas erect over time around themselves to protect their feelings.  Because what you're dealing with here is people who have had to deal with a long and painful process of one rejection, after another, after another.  If there's one thing that summarizes the gamma attitude more than any other, it's that I could have been successful had I wanted to.  Because the gamma is always conflict avoidant and is also failure avoidant.  The problem, of course, is you cannot live and avoid failure.  Everybody fails sooner or later.  Most of us fail on a regular basis.  Doesn't matter whether it's an online argument or asking a girl out for a date or applying to a university, going to a job interview.  You can't live without doing those things.  But the pain of dealing with repeated failure is one reason why Gammas so often retreat to their delusion bubble where they can declare themselves victors all the time.  Gammas also tend to be highly, highly romantic.  They're really into the big gesture.  They're convinced that how much you like a woman matters with regards to whether she should be attracted to you or not.  And that's why you'll often hear Gammas talk about girls that they like who are interested in other guys as if the other guys are somehow ensorceling her.  They're somehow tricking her, misleading her, deceiving her.  And if only she knew how much he liked her.  then she'd be interested.  But it's not how a man treats a woman that determines how attractive he is to her.  And that's one thing that the gammas tend to struggle with tremendously.  Whenever you have very attractive woman who for no apparent reason and without any warning and without any indication of interest in the male protagonist inexplicably begins a sexual relationship with him which of course takes him completely by surprise and from that moment on the couple is Together forever.  That is the gamma ideal.  Because gammas are fundamentally passive.  They're passive-aggressive.  They're conflict-avoidant.  and they don't believe in pursuing women.  In fact, they have an almost complete lack of understanding of women, which is kind of surprising because a lot of their behavioral patterns and thought patterns tend to be somewhat feminine in nature.  In fact, there are some who actually describe the gamma as a female mind in a male body.  So it's a little bit strange that they seem to be so inept when it comes to understanding and anticipating women.  But women tend to be a vast mystery to the gamma.  They don't know how to behave around women, especially not women that they're attracted to.  And when they do finally summon up the courage to pursue them, they usually do so in such an over-the-top, inept way that it doesn't work very well.  I should probably mention that women have gamma radar like you would not believe.  If you're not sure about whether someone's a gamma or not, just ask a moderately attractive girl who knows them because women react negatively to gammas as if they're radioactive.  A number of women have told me that they actually feel the urge to physically punch gammas in the face, just instinctively.  So what are the practical aspects?  From a male point of view, the first thing that you need to understand about the gammas is that they are almost always disruptive to your organization.  And we have a lot of projects that we do, whether it's Vox Diversity stuff, whether it's Castalia House stuff, whether it's Archaven stuff.  We probably have 30 to 35 volunteers in various capacities with various responsibilities.  One thing that I had to learn to do is to stop accepting people who were volunteering to help.  And the reason was the more enthusiastic someone was about contacting me and wanting to help, I eventually discovered the more likely it was that they were a Gamma.  What would happen is that they would usually want more authority and responsibility than was at all reasonable for a volunteer.  They wanted to be able to tell other people what to do, even though there was no rational reason for it.  They would tell me what to do.  Now, why would you ever want to permit someone like that to get any foothold in your organization?  No matter what the organization is, they're going to disrupt it.  And if they're given a free hand, they're very likely going to destroy it.  Now the problem is, is that gammas are genuinely smarter than the norm.  They may not be quite as intelligent as they think they are, but they do tend to be smart and they do tend to be subject matter experts.  When you're looking for a subject matter expert and you find somebody who has the information you need, don't be shocked when it turns out that the individual is a gamma.  That's what they do.  And so that's why it's so important to understand these tendencies, because that way you're much less likely to give into the temptation to actually bring the person on the team.  You're usually going to be best able to operate with a gamma if they're in the position of like a contract employee or something.  And so that they're more likely to be comfortable with that.  Now, I understand that if you're somebody who feels that some of this applies to you, that you might be angry.  It might upset you to hear this, but I don't know what else to tell you.  This is true.  This is reality.  If you don't understand that this is why people don't like you, this is why people don't believe you, and that people really do see through your pretensions and your posturings, then you're just going to be stuck in that reality for the rest of your life.  Now, it doesn't have to be that way.  There was a guy who used to be a pretty strong gamma and he managed to work his way out of that and transform himself and become a legitimate bona fide delta.  He's much happier now.  And he's even written a four-part series on how to do it.  The key thing, the first advice he had for the gamma is stop lying.  Stop lying to yourself.  Stop lying to others.  Be brutally and relentlessly honest.  The gamma mentality is fundamentally based on deception and on delusion.  And so the more that you tell yourself the truth, The more that you force yourself to confront the truth and the more that you admit the truth to others, the easier it is going to be to pull yourself out of that armor of delusion that you've assembled around yourself.
