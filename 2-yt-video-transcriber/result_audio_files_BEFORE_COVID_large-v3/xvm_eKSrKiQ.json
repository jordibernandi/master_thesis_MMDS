We believe she has the choice to choose what health care provider she goes to, what college degree she gets, what college she goes to if she wants to go to college, what spouse, what anything she wants, right?  But your autonomy, your ability to do whatever you want with your body, stops when it harms someone else's body.  This is why in hospitals, you can't smoke within so many feet of the entrance.  Why can't someone go into the pulmonary ward and start smoking up?  Because their right to ingest harmful substances chemicals that are going to probably give them lung cancer, their right to do whatever the hell they want with their body, stops when it hurts my child, because it hurts someone else's body.  And that's the entire premise of the pro-life movement, that we can say this is all about bodily autonomy, but the question is what body we're talking about, because abortion deals with two bodies.  Does that make sense? ",
