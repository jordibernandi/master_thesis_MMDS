            "text": "Okay guys, so we're at the Michigan Reformatory prison complex here in Ionia, Michigan.  We're going to see if they respect our First Amendment rights.  No trespassing, prison property.  So here at the Michigan Reformatory was built in 1877.  They've been locking up prisoners here for a long time, incarcerating human beings for over a century.  Only in the good old USA, land of the free, where we have higher prison populations than anywhere else in the world, Don't let the USA government and the fake news corporate media tell you any different.  This is nothing more than a modern day concentration camp right here in Michigan, right here in the USA.  In 1981 there was a large prison riot here, 500 prisoners.  The Michigan State Police was called in to help contain the riot.  Michigan Reformatory has 350 level 2 beds and nearly 800 level 4 beds.  okay here comes our contact or maybe not?  he's gonna go get back up.  he's probably too much of a coward to confront someone without five of his prison guard buddies behind those walls.  Prisoners or human beings are subjected to cruel and unusual punishment nearly every day right here in the USA, right here in Ionia, Michigan, Michigan Department of Corrections.  Looks like we have some more parking up here on top of the hill.  These people really speed up through here.  I need to be careful here on the sidewalk I don't get run over by one of these prison guards.  So we got their attention pretty quick.  How we doing? ",

            "text": "Okay.  Hey, uh... Hey guys, we got contact.  Looks like they're getting on the phone.  Probably calling in some of their comrades, the Ionia County Sheriff.  Maybe they'll come and educate him.  About the First Amendment and public photography.  These guys clearly have something to hide here.  These guys don't want people, they don't want the public to see how they treat these prisoners, how they subject them to cruel and unusual punishment nearly every day.  It's way back there on a hill.  Can't get a real good view of it.  They like keeping it hidden from the public.  They like keeping it hidden so they can beat their inmates without people seeing it.  These guys clearly have something to hide here.  So this guard here just drove in in this Jeep with a Punisher emblem with a blue line through it.  What's that tell you?  Is that symbolizing?  they punish and beat their inmates?  And they support the blue line?  That's pretty disturbing.  So we're going to stay here a little longer.  see if the sheriff shows up.  if not we're gonna go gather more content for our story.  got some more pictures I want to gather for you guys.  Sir, I'm notifying you now that this is prison property to start right here at the drive and that you need to be off of it, okay?  Do you understand?  There go the cowards, backing out again.  They don't have other prison guard buddies to gang up on one person.  Got these prison guard thugs trying to lie to me, trying to bluff me out of here.  They're used to lying to their prisoners.
