You could have just made videos and said, hey, I'm feeling bad because of this, I'm doing this, blah, blah.  No, nothing.  And then you don't tell that you've been eating animal foods for such a long time and you still promote plants because you still had recent videos of eating plants and yeah, yeah, yeah, grapefruit juice, even though none of that was actually helping you in any way and you know that it's harmful.  So it's just bullshit.  This is a bullshit channel.  It's making people unhealthy.  There's over 15 nutrients you can't get from plants.  I've said this a million times.  This is why vegans get sick.  The problems she had were also caused by the toxins and anti-nutrients that are supposed to destroy your gut.  You're not supposed to eat vegetables, especially plants don't want to be eaten.  They're measure that they actually feel the pain.  they react to it.  there are living things like animals.  nothing that is alive wants to be eaten.  okay nothing.  life doesn't work that way.  you can't just eat plants just like that especially seeds.  those are the worst there.  you are all right.  thanks for watching.
