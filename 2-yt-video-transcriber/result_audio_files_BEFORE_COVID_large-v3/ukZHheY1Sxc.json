The right-wing sites often use Malm\u00f6 and Sweden as examples.  It's really interesting that he puts the focus on Sweden because his would-be competitor in the presidential race, Bernie Sanders, talked a lot about Sweden and the social programs and the taxes.  The vast majority of his series on shithole cities had been demonstrated to be a combination of xenophobia, beer-mongering, and outright lies and manipulation.  Speaking of outright lies and manipulation, in a White House press briefing in 2018, the questioning of President Donald Trump by CNN's Jim Acosta led to his press credentials being revoked.  This was justified by claiming that Acosta had accosted an intern by placing his hands on her while she attempted to rip the microphone from him amid questioning.  Watson uploaded a version of the incident in which the zoom and frame rate were doctored to support the claims made by the administration.  Then White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders used Watson's video as evidence spreading the misrepresentation that Jim Acosta had acted inappropriately despite original footage of the incident being widely available everywhere.  This became a widely publicized incident in which the White House deliberately spread fake news to justify their own narrative. ",

As Tim Pool tweeted, all of the outlets claiming the video was doctored or sped up didn't even bother fact checking. ",

A subsequent court ruling found that the actions against Acosta were unconstitutional on due process grounds.  Now when Paul Joseph Wasson wants to talk about the moral bankruptcy of today's youth by showing footage of women working out, or women working in a bar, we can take a step back and laugh at how ludicrous it is that someone in this day and age is still trying to shame them into the 1950s where most of Paul's beliefs reside.

And that's where he's no longer a laughingstock, because in order to be one, everyone has to be laughing at him.  But if people as powerful as the United States administration not only believe the gospel he preaches, but even worse, publishes it, then he's no longer just a middle-aged man yelling at clouds, he's no longer a living joke, he's a source.  The number 30 bus was the only bus that was directed to a different area of the city.  For what reason?  Nobody knows.  And if he's going to be a source, then where he gets his information becomes increasingly important.  And beyond the reality that Prison Paul is only ironically funny, and even then, only seldomly, there's the added fact that he's also not very original, especially when it comes to his bigotry.  You see, Paul Joseph Watson is also a plagiarist, and what he plagiarizes from is nothing short of alarming.  As Jose points out in his fantastic documentary, Paul Joseph Watson Has a Nazi Problem, It seems that when Paul isn't using far-right French blogs as his sources, and by sources we mean Google translating the articles as original work, he's stealing a lot of his writing from Diversity Macht Freie, otherwise known in German as Diversity Power Free, a blog that pushes extreme anti-Semitic propaganda.

While Watson is happy to cover the same stories as the blog.  when it applies to conservatives supposedly being under attack in Europe, he doesn't really touch the other stories the blog pushes out on a regular basis.  Articles with titles such as A Very Jewish Coup, The Plot to Stop Brexit, rich moslem states are hiring jews to sell islam to christians via interfaith institutes.  as christians celebrate christmas with their families jews fantasize about their saviour crawling through excrement.  So, uh, yeah, this blog is probably run by a Nazi.  And if you need a little more evidence than that, one of the few places that loves to repost this blog's content happens to be the home for neo-Nazi scum on the internet, The Daily Stormer.  This is definitely a Nazi's blog.  And the Daily Stormer has had an interesting relationship with Paul Joseph Watson over the years.  In short, they don't like him.  At all.  Not because they disagree with the vast majority of his talking points, though.  As one 2015 article describes it, Watson is known for ripping off the Daily Stormer and other pro-white sites and removing Jews from the discussion. ",

So again, this point shouldn't be lost on anyone or viewed to be an exaggeration.  Paul Joseph Watson plagiarizes articles from a German far-right extremist blog, which is also a frequent source for a neo-Nazi website.  So when the press secretary of the United States uses him as a source for an administrative decision, it has very serious implications, especially when the source, like most of his canon, turns out to be completely full of shit.
