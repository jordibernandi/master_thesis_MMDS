            "text": "The current state of women in 2020.  You see this right here, guys?  You see this on my window?  You see this outside?  That's rain.  Now, you're probably wondering what does rain have to do with this video, and what does rain have to do with women in 2020?  It has a lot to do with women in 2020.  In fact, this is how a lot of women feel And this is what women do in order to express themselves.  They cry.  They complain.  And they're frustrated.  After all the years that they turned down good men.  Men that were good for them.  Men like you and me once were.  Men that actually gave a shit about them.  But they just tossed us to the side.  And they went after the Chads, the Tyrones, anyone else who wanted to smash them, treat them dirty, treat them like shit.  They went after them, not us.  And now, they're crying, they're hurt, they're sad, they're wandering the earth with all these spirits inside them.  All these men, all these men's seeds that have been inside them, that have actually infiltrated their DNA.  And this has been proven by science, guys.  The DNA of men have been found inside of women.  Men that they have had sex with has actually been found inside of women.  And we wonder why they act up and why they act so crazy.  And why they have these mood swings.  Why they're so emotionally and spiritually just in turmoil.  You know?  And as a 22 year old.  I have removed myself from women.  Entirely.  I still have sex with women.  Okay?  But.  I've actually been at the point now, I've come to the realization that I don't even want to have sex with a lot of these women.  I really don't.  I don't want to.  A lot of these women are bad.  They have bad energy, bad spirits inside them.  Spirits that will taint my good energy and my spirit.  And I don't want to mix... Salt with pepper.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't want to mix my good energy with their bad energy and mix my spiritual levels with theirs.  Because right now, life is going well and I've been on my grind every single day, guys.  Every single day.  I haven't felt healthier.  And more free in my life than right now.  And ever since I took the red pill and have started going my own way.  Or going MGTOW, whatever you want to call it.  But I still do deal with women when I would like to have sex.  Use protection, alright?  But this is the current state of women right now, guys.  Right here.  This is the current state of women in 2020.  They're emotionally destroyed.  And similarly to Reign, they will cry and complain about the bad boys, the Chads and Tyrones that did them wrong.  But they will still continue to go back to these guys.  And they will still continue to deal with these guys no matter how good you treat them.  No matter if you bought her that car, you bought her that purse.  You always took her out to dinner.  You bought her flowers every single Valentine's Day.  You brought her a promise ring.  She met your parents.  You met her parents.  She said she loves you.  All that shit was a lie.  All that shit's beta.  All that shit was put into your head from society.  It was society's way of keeping you invested into the economy, literally.  The economy wouldn't work, in fact, without women.  Without simps, actually, buying women these things.  These materialistic, this materialistic bullshit that isn't needed, all right?  None of this shit would be even... The economy would work totally differently without women and simps that spend money on these women that don't need another purse, another necklace, another bracelet, another wedding band or another promise ring.  They don't need that shit.  And in the end, she's just going to leave you.  So why do you give a fuck?  Why do you give a fuck what she does?  The current state of women is just like this rain, guys.  It's not going to change.  It's not going to get better.  It's going to get worse.  More social media apps are created every single day to validate these women.  To pander to them and to put them above men.  Make them feel as though they can talk shit on men.  Make them feel as though a man deciding to go his own way is wrong.  A man who values his own spirit and his own well-being and the man that he is and the man he wants to become and his spiritual growth makes him a bad guy.  And she doesn't respect it.  She doesn't respect it.  She doesn't understand where you're coming from.  She doesn't get it.  The current state of women is going down, guys.  Keep taking the red pill.  Keep going your own way.  Keep being MGTOW.  Fuck the haters.  Fuck what they have to say. ",
