            "text": "hey guys welcome back for today's video where i'm going to be filling out a hypothetical 2020 electoral college map matchup between democratic hopeful mayor pete buttigieg taking on current republican president donald trump.  now before going through and filling out the rest of this electoral college map and how i would have it playing out between these two candidates I just want to talk about Mayor Pete for a little bit and what are his chances to win that Democratic nomination.  A very crowded field on the Democrat side, so it's not going to be easy for any of them to claim this nomination, even the well-established candidates that are the frontrunners.  It's a long way to go from now before we finally figure out who's going to be.  the candidate that goes on to win.  So it's not going to be easy for any of them, especially somebody like a Pete Buttigieg, who coming into this thing just did not have a whole lot of name recognition.  There's probably about 10 to 15 or so candidates right now that are consistently polling between about zero to two percentage points on the Democrat side.  And Mayor Pete was consistently in this group.  But the fact that he's been able to build some momentum, get his name out there more, he's had a lot of very strong appearances.  He's a great talker and can articulate his point very well.  And because of this, he's built that momentum of support and he's now pulling between about five to 10 percentage point consistently.  And that's an extremely impressive feat in and of itself that he's been able to kind of separate himself from the rest of the pack and become more relevant, pushing his way into the top five or so even candidates in a lot of these polls.  So really positive signs from his candidacy and for his campaign.  Again, at this very early point on in the process, but it's still going to be very difficult for him to continue to build off of this momentum and try to peel votes away from other candidates.  Perhaps if we get some of these other candidates that drop out, maybe he can coalesce some of that support behind him.  But also he's very young.  That makes it difficult to kind of get your foot in the door, get a lot of the establishment members of the party to come out and support you and try to bring their support.  to your cause.  But again, there's some very positive early signs for Mayor Pete and his supporters should be very happy with how things have gone up to this point.  It's an uphill climb for him, but he's taken one giant step forward.  We'll see if he's continuing to able to do that in the coming weeks and months.  And I'm going to be continuing to cover all of the relevant polls and data.  So be sure to click that subscribe button to get all of that content in the coming months and over the next year.  So to run through this electoral college map, I'm going to start here out in the West, move my way into the Southeast, Northeast, and then finish in the all-important Midwest where this 2020 election is very likely to be decided.  So starting off, the Democrats, they have been gaining a lot of ground in the Southwest, particularly Nevada, Colorado, and Arizona.  Nevada and Colorado more so are becoming very consistently Democratic in statewide elections.  I think Pete Buttigieg continues this trend where he's able to keep those states that Hillary Clinton was able to win back in 2016.  Now, Arizona is.  It's a tough one.  It's very purple at this point in time.  The Democrats flipped it, gained that Senate seat in 2018.  And again, the demographics continuing to get better for the Democratic Party in the state of Arizona.  And the gains that they've been able to make across areas over the past decade plus, like New Mexico, Colorado, and Nevada are starting to show and gain ground in Arizona.  And it just seems like a matter of time before the Democrats start more consistently winning statewide elections.  It kind of depends, I think, in 2020.  Who would the Democrats nominate?  It's not going to be easy.  Perhaps there are a handful or a small number of candidates that could seriously push for the win, such as Joe Biden, maybe a Bernie Sanders, maybe a Beto O'Rourke or Kamala Harris.  Pete Buttigieg is not really known in this section of the country.  Very young candidate.  We'll see once the polls start coming out later on in the process how things are going for the Democrats in Arizona.  But in a head-to-head between Trump and Pete Buttigieg, I think I would give the slight lean right now to Donald Trump.  He barely got past Hillary Clinton in 2016.  This is four years better for the Democrats in terms of demographic shifting.  that should help them in 2020.  So it's likely to be a very close election, one that the Democrats could pick up if everything goes right for them.  Now moving over to Texas, another state here in the Southwest where demographics are playing a big role in the Democrats gaining here, but also just the fact that the Democratic Party finally got a glimmer of hope in 2018 with what Beto O'Rourke was able to do.  in his head-to-head Senate matchup against Ted Cruz, where they came up just short by about two or so percentage points.  And when you're voting in a state that's so consistently one-way, which Texas has been for decades now, going Republican strongly, when you finally see that, oh, maybe a Democrat actually does have a chance to win an election, that just... Builds the party out even more, more infrastructure, more funds going in, and we'll see if the Democrats are able to claim this state sooner or later, given the fact that, again, those demographics shifting in this state are having a big positive impact for the Democratic Party.  It seems like sometime over the next decade, this is going to be becoming more of a consistent purple battleground state.  At this point in time in 2020, you still give the lean over to the Republicans.  Now moving into the Southeast, Florida is a state that does seem to be trending a little bit more so back towards the Republicans after Barack Obama had won the state back in 2008 and 2012, Trump winning it.  in 2016.  Also, this was one of the very few exceptions of where the Republicans did a bit better than expected in 2018.  We see that trend continuing here in a hypothetical matchup between Pete Buttigieg and Donald Trump, where we'd give the state of Florida over to Trump in Georgia.  Very competitive result in 2018 in that governor's statewide race.  There's going to be likely a fairly interesting Senate matchup here in the state of Georgia in 2020 and more so than some of these other southeastern states like South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi.  Georgia has the demographics as well as the strong metropolitan area in and around the Atlanta area that are becoming more democratic where this is a state that's becoming more of a battleground.  Trump, beat Hillary Clinton, I believe it was around five or so percentage points back in 2016.  And I wouldn't be surprised to see the Democrats maybe even do a little bit better than that.  And maybe with a candidate like Joe Biden would be able to win it possibly.  But again, a little bit more of a long shot there.  especially for a candidate like Pete Buttigieg.  So I would give the lean over to Donald Trump in that scenario.  Now moving up into North Carolina, which kind of almost feels like a similar scenario to Georgia, except even a little bit more so to the Democrats trying to come in and make this from a consistent red to now more of a purple state.  And we saw The Democrats win the governor's race there not all that long ago.  Hillary Clinton came up short to Donald Trump by about three or so percentage points back in 2016.  Very large African-American population here in the state of North Carolina, which also helps the Democratic cause.  But again, in a hypothetical here between Trump and Pete Buttigieg, I would just give the very slight lean over to Donald Trump in what would likely be a very competitive matchup.  And again, it's another situation where I do think there are candidates out there for the Democrats where they could possibly pick up North Carolina a bit more strongly than if they go with an unknown, very young candidate such as a Pete Buttigieg.  Now moving up one state to Virginia, this has been a state that's been trending towards the Democrats over the past decade or so.  The Democrats did very well in Virginia in the 2018 midterms.  And Hillary Clinton also winning Virginia back in 2016, but that was to be expected with her running mate, the senator, Tim Kaine, being the senator from Virginia.  But I expect the Democrats to continue to go on and win Virginia in 2020.  There's just not a whole lot of overwhelming love for Trump in the state.  of Virginia.  So I see this one as being a lean over to Pete Buttigieg.  Now moving up into the Northeast, New Hampshire was extremely close between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.  It's kind of dependent on the situation in terms of these Northeastern states.  Again, depending on the matchup, it can actually be pretty close or the Republicans even can come through and win every now and again.  But it almost kind of feels like the Democratic version of, I'd probably say such as a Georgia, for instance, where you generally get these single-digit races and they can be very competitive.  but in georgia it tends to go to the republicans while in new hampshire it kind of tends to go over to the democrats and i think somebody like a pete budaj could do quite well in a state like new hampshire but going to be giving it as a slight lean over to the democrats and mayor pete now moving over to maine the statewide i have as safe for the democrats as well as the first congressional district.  now the second congressional district actually went to the democrats in 2018 Largely in part because of ranked choice voting.  Perhaps that's a factor here in 2020 with the Democrats maybe being able to pick that up.  But Trump did very well here back in 2016 and still going to give him a slight lean in this particular matchup against Pete Buttigieg.  Now moving into the Midwest, I'll start with Nebraska's second congressional district.  So somewhat surprisingly in that 2018 race, Kara Eastman, a very progressive Democrat, came up just short by just a couple percentage points of flipping that congressional district.  That would have been a really big surprise if the Democrats were able to win that one, especially with the Democratic Party, by and large, kind of passing on the whole situation.  They didn't do a whole lot to support a number of progressives back in 2018.  Perhaps if they would have helped out a little bit more, the Democrats could have picked that one up, but again, this is the one district within the state of Nebraska that can be very competitive, and I wouldn't be surprised to see this district go to the Democrats in 2020.  Maybe somebody like a Mayor Pete who has roots in the Midwest can really speak to a lot of these voters.  I actually wouldn't be surprised if he was able to pick this one up, but at the end of the day, still going to be giving a slight lean to Donald Trump.  He was able to pick this one up back in 2016.  So now we're moving into the real heart of it here.  Minnesota, pretty consistently for the Democrats, they absolutely dominated in the state back in 2018.  It was a close one between Clinton and Trump, but Clinton is just not the kind of Democrat that can do well in a state like Minnesota.  And we saw this with Clinton where she had trouble coming through in a lot of these Democratic strongholds in the Midwest, where I think if the Democrats nominate a different kind of candidate, maybe one that doesn't come off as being part of the global elite or being for free trade deals or things such as that.  If you have a candidate that doesn't have those types of qualities and can be hammered on here in the Midwest, I think that the Democrats should be able to Flip and retain a lot of these states, and definitely Minnesota.  I would almost put all the way blue, just given how dominant the Democratic Party did back there in 2018, but just going to do one step below that, giving it to Mayor Pete.  Now, Iowa, Obama was able to win it back in 2008 as well as 2012.  2016, Hillary Clinton actually came up well short, losing by around 10 percentage points.  There's a lot of love in the state for Donald Trump in Iowa.  We'll see if that carries over in 2020.  I expect it to be a lot closer, but still going to give Trump the slight lean there in the state until we get some more polling that indicates otherwise.  And also Ohio, Obama proved that he could win there, but then Trump coming in in 2016 and doing quite well against Hillary Clinton.  Now in 2018, the governorship went to the Republicans in Ohio.  Sherrod Brown won the Senate race as a Democrat.  So it's still a state that can elect Democrats statewide, but it does feel like one of these Midwestern states that's trending more so to the Republicans.  And I would give that as a slight lean over to Donald Trump.  And now we get to Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all states that were decided by less than one percentage point.  back in 2016.  And again, it's going to be hard, in my opinion, for the Democrats to not get a candidate that's more likable or favorable in these types of areas than what they had with Clinton, who just had really bad numbers in these states back in 2016.  If you look back, for instance, in 2016 at Clinton's polling to Trump in these three states in particular, in comparison to how Bernie Sanders was polling against Donald Trump in these three states, Sanders was consistently doing around 10 percentage points better than Hillary Clinton, and having that kind of cushion on Election Day, I think would have spelled a much different situation for the Democrats, and Sanders would have likely gone on to defeat Donald Trump, and perhaps the Democrats can learn from what happened back in 2016, not taking these states for granted and having a candidate that plays a little bit better in the Midwest, for instance.  And I think somebody like a Mayor Pete, who obviously has his ties in the state of Indiana, being the mayor there, I think that his type of candidacy can play well in the Midwest.  And I think that he would be able to reclaim, all importantly, the states of Wisconsin and Michigan as well as Pennsylvania now in 2020. for the Democrats I think Michigan and Pennsylvania are a little bit more obtainable.  I think Wisconsin might be a little bit tougher than those two other states based on the trends that we've seen from these three states in particular.  but also another very positive sign for the Democrats here is in 2018 they won the governorship as well as the statewide senate races in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania so they're going to try to carry that 2018 momentum over into 2020.  Now, Indiana still giving it as a pretty safe Republican state.  It has been trending towards the Republicans very positively in recent election cycles, even though this is where Mayor Pete has his roots.  On the Republican side, you have Vice President Mike Pence, who is the governor of the state.  And I still think that that is a big Trump card for them.  No pun intended there in the state of Indiana.  So that's how I have it matching up between Mayor Pete and Donald Trump here.  278.  So just pushing him over the line in comparison to Donald Trump at 260.  Now, if we go back into the Midwest and say the Republicans were able to claim Wisconsin, then you get a situation where Donald Trump and the Republicans are just able to get over the line with 270 compared to the Democrats who would be at 268.  But then you could also say, well, it's possible that maybe Maine's first congressional district goes over to the Democrats like they were able to pick it up in 2018.  Then you have an absolute tie there.  Another situation you could have is that second congressional district in Nebraska.  going over to the Democrats.  And again, that would be another scenario where you could have a 269 to 269 tie.  Hopefully we don't get a tie in 2020.  We don't need that drama.  At least I don't think we need that drama.  I'd like whoever goes on to win to do so, at least by a margin where it feels like they earned it and it was comfortable and perhaps maybe even winning the popular vote as well as the electoral college.
