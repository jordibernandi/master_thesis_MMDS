            "text": "Hi, my name is Aaron and this is my show, Re-Education.  And today I'm going to talk about a topic that is, for some reason, very controversial.  I mean, people on the left understand what it means, and actually people on the right understand what it means too, but it's something that we have a difficult time... explaining and that of course is the word microaggressions.  of course here i'm talking about the word.  the definition of the word is fairly uncontroversial.  the definition is kind of in an underhanded way in a discreet way.  being a bigot being a jerk being a dick making fun or discriminating against somebody because of their race, creed, color, religion, what have you.  A more subtle example would be referring to women who are in positions of power as being bossy when they ask you to do your job.  That's very subtle, but given the context of the whole situation... it ends up being somewhat offensive.  It's not something that most people think is necessarily bad, at least on the right.  They think that it's, you know, just general ribbing, being human, being normal.  You know, when guys are at work, they'll rib on one another, they'll bug one another, sometimes they'll even get into fights with one another, verbal or physical, and it doesn't seem to really amount to anything.  Of course, whenever a woman tends to show any kind of authority or power in the workplace, now all of a sudden we have problems.  Now all of a sudden, men, with their sensitive little egos, can't fucking handle that.  So they resort to name-calling.  Calling them bossy.  Ouch.  Now of course, these microaggressions, after a long period of time building up, tend to turn into a toxic environment.  But we all know that that exists.  Even you on the right understand that that does exist.  And if you don't, if you're saying that you don't at least, you're probably full of shit.  You probably understand to a certain extent that people that you know have been discriminated against in that way.  You just don't think that it's really that big of a deal.  I know when I was on the right, I didn't think that it was that big of a deal.  grow up, that's life.  Sometimes things are difficult, sometimes things are hard.  Of course, when you have a systemic problem, when you have a system that preys upon the people that are marginalized, of course you end up in a situation where those people are having things like microaggressions happen to them.  But my video today isn't about microaggressions.  It's about leftist language and how that is portrayed to people on the right.  Now when people on the right hear, or people in the center for that matter, hear someone use the term microaggression, They don't think of the definition.  They don't think of somebody saying something that is discriminatory under their breath or in a casual way that makes it seem nonchalant.  They think you're calling them a racist for saying something that they see as being normal.  They just simply think that you're being a triggered cuck.  That's it.  They think that you're getting butthurt about something that barely even exists.  And if it does exist, it's so far down on the ladder of importance that it's not even worth mentioning.  That's what they think about those sorts of arguments.  And that's not just when they're talking about the word microaggression.  That's when they're talking about things as broad as even feminism specifically.  We on the left have this interesting fascination with coming up with new words to describe phenomena is a little bit academic and comes across as being pretentious as fuck.  Now, I don't have a problem with any of these words.  I think that they're fine.  Toxic masculinity is another example of this, and I use the word toxic masculinity quite often.  When I'm talking about toxic masculinity, I'm not saying that all masculinity is toxic.  That's fucking stupid.  What I'm saying is there are certain aspects of masculinity that are toxic and that we should try to get rid of them.  But that's not what the people on the right hear.  Just like when they hear the word microaggressions they think you're calling them a racist, when they hear toxic masculinity they think that you're calling them a fucking sexist.  And it's not very difficult to see why.  I mean a lot of people on the right don't understand the framework in which we on the left are talking about.  They don't understand that we are coming at this from an understanding, from a viewpoint, from a lens that is completely different from the lens that they are viewing things from.  A lot of the time, we're talking about the same thing.  A lot of the time, we have the same arguments, the same problems, the exact same accusations.  We're just doing it in different ways.  We're just using different words.  We're just making it more difficult for us to actually communicate with one another.  We're creating our own separate little language, and the right does this too, so we can't actually even communicate with each other.  We can't actually even get around the words in the first place to be able to say the things that we want to say.  And I think that that's a huge problem and a huge reason why we're having such a divide amongst people right now.  We just simply do not have the means of communication to express what we are feeling.  A lot of people that are in the anti-SJW community, if that even still exists, or the alt-right or the alt-light or whatever... actually have a lot of the very same criticisms of capitalism, of hierarchy, of the structure that we do.  They just simply look at it and come to a different conclusion.  Innuendo Studios, of course, did a great video on this called White Fascism, and I suggest that everybody take a look at it.  But again, that is looking at things through a leftist lens, even though it's a critique on... conservative ideas and fascist beliefs, it's still looking at it through the view of a left-winger.  And unless you've been on the other side, unless you really actually have been there and you know what these people are talking about, then you're still just kind of LARPing.  You don't know what the fuck you're saying.  You can do all the research in the world on how to be a trans person, but until you are a trans person, you're really not going to know what the fuck they're talking about.  You can try, but you're never going to know 100%.  This kind of division is inherent to the system.  It's a part of the system.  It is not a bug.  It is a fucking feature.  They make sure that we are constantly at each other's throats.  If there is a divide between the left and the right, then that means that we will be fighting one another and not fighting the fucking system that is killing us all, that is keeping that boot on our necks.  We have this innate fucking problem where we decide that we want to abuse and criticize and demonize everybody that's not like us, everybody that's somewhat different, instead of actually giving them a chance, giving them a second and listening to their actual problems.  Leftist language is one of the biggest barriers that we have to face right now.  In the Bible, and I'm saying this as an atheist, there was a story called the Tower of Babel.  It talked about how all of the people in the community got together so they could build a tower to heaven.  They did so because they were able to communicate with one another.  They all got together, got all the stuff they needed to build that tower, and they went to work building it.  And they got pretty high, too, until God realized what they were doing, and he was like, you know what?  Ah!  I really don't want you motherfuckers walking on my lawn.  So he decided to cast a spell and make sure that all of the people in that community were unable to talk to one another.  It's kind of an allegory on how everybody in the world has different languages.  But it's kind of the same thing here.  We on the left and people on the right are unintentionally or possibly intentionally creating languages, creating lingo that we on the other side don't understand.  It's a way of keeping us divided.  It's a way of making us not be able to talk to one another.  And in this world, the world that we live in right now, the most important thing that we could possibly have is unity among all working people.  Not just the right, not just the left, all people.  If we don't have that, then we're not going to have the strength in numbers, the power, the ability to be able to actually feasibly take the system and replace it with something better.  we're just going to be always playing second fiddle to the ones that are in control.  We will never be able to create that dual power structure if we don't have 50% of the population on our side.  Now, I realize that a lot of people out there don't want to spend their time trying to learn the right's language, or if you are a right-winger, you don't want to spend the time learning the left's language, and I get that.  And if you're in a marginalized group or a group that's being discriminated against, the last possible fucking thing that you would even think about doing would be to talk about these issues and have to bring all of this shit up again.  It's obvious that sometimes you've just made those arguments so many times or you've had that bullshit fucking thing said to you so many fucking times that you just don't want to put up with it anymore.  And I get that.  But to the people out there who can handle making those arguments and can handle actually talking to people that are saying rude, nasty shit, I implore you to do so.  When a troll or somebody is saying things that are racist or bigoted or mean-spirited, And they're saying them to you.  They're saying them to make you mad.  They're saying them to piss you off.  They're doing it to get a fucking rise out of you.  And when you respond to their racist bullshit, then that is exactly what they've gotten out of you.  Ignore that shit.  Ignore the racism.  Ignore the sexism.  And ignore all of the craziness.  Because you have to understand the majority, the population, the vast amount of people, the masses... They don't think in leftist language.  They don't think in leftist terms.  They think in some sort of nebulous gray area where they don't really know what the fuck is going on.  The propaganda is so thick that they hear things, they say things, and they don't think about things.  The majority of people, the masses, the proletariat, are not thinking about things in leftist language.  They're not thinking about things the way that you or I think about them.  They're thinking about getting up, going to work, getting off of work, and going to the fucking bar and getting drunk and forgetting about how the boss just fucked them for eight hours that day.  They're not thinking about microaggressions.  They're not thinking about toxic masculinity because they don't have the time.  The propaganda, like I said, is thick.  Sometimes it's hard, if not impossible, to see through it.  And when we don't understand that, when we're looking at all of these topics through the lens of leftism, through our specific rose-colored glasses, we have a hard time understanding these people because we don't realize that they are not us.  They came to a completely different conclusion.  And it's not like you can't get through to these people.  If you can, try to just ignore the racism, ignore the sexism, and look at their stupid little argument and talk about that.  Be nice.  Be cordial.  Be a civilized person and actually give them a minute.  to explain themselves and maybe if you ask enough questions and you try not to force your opinion on them you might be able to plant some seeds.  you might be able to i don't know lead them by their silly little ears to a body of water and they might be able to actually take a drink.  That's the idea here.  You're never going to be able to convince anybody of your point.  You're never going to be able to say to somebody, hey, you're being a fucking racist, and that's going to immediately convince them to stop saying racist things.  That's just going to embolden them and make them think that you're an idiot.  So instead of doing that, try to discuss these topics with them.  And if you're not comfortable with it, then don't.  Just ignore them.  But you have to realize that when you're using leftist language, like microaggressions, like toxic masculinity, you're immediately creating a barrier that stops you from being able to discuss any of this stuff on a rational level.  You're immediately making people not want to engage with you.  And at this point in history, we just do not have the luxury of having that be an issue.  We cannot have half of the population supporting the state.  That will not help the revolution.  At least that's the way I look at it.  My name is Aaron.  This is my show Re-Education.
