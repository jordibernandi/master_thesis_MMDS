After police say he was caught on camera stealing UPS boxes containing electronic devices to include Kindles, a Surface Pro tablet, and iPad 7.  It all went down here, a company located at 512 NE 190th Street.  Regin was working with UPS as a seasonal employee.  And police say while he was helping the full-time driver unload more than 5,000 packages, he snuck three packages under and in nearby dumpsters.  Police say surveillance video caught him returning hours later to sneak the stolen goods into a car.  The very next day, at the very same place, police say he does it again.  This time, a manager had already reviewed the surveillance video and saw what went down the day before.  And a police detective is waiting for him when he returns to pick up three more squirreled away packages.  He's arrested on a grand theft charge and then today in Judge Glazer's courtroom. ",

            "text": "So after seeing this, you can see that you got a young boy, young black man that was given a second chance, even though he had a record.  They said, you know what?  You can come work at UPS, make some chips, maybe rehabilitate yourself.  Who knows?  Might get picked up later on full time.  But that wasn't enough for this brother.  This brother had to go and get the sticky fingers as if nobody would notice items starting to just turn up missing.  So he starts sneaking these packages off, setting them to a side.  You know, just drip, drip.  Don't want to take too much and make it obvious.  Like, oh, man, we just realized 25 packages are gone.  One or two.  Now, what was he going to do with those?  I mean, this is one of those situations where if you get five, six years in prison and you're thinking, I got six years in prison for a PlayStation and for just a couple items that either I was going to take home and play with myself or sell them to a couple of my friends.  And now what you've done is ruined your whole life.  This man is an example to all the young men in his position of what not to do.  When you get a second chance, you would think he would be there on time, leave early, all of those things.  But no, no.  He decides to go ahead and start sneaking some items.  And of course, you saw the video.  Eventually he gets caught because cameras are everywhere nowadays.  I mean, nowadays cops don't even have to earn their catch.  Back in the day, the cops used to have to catch the robber.  Now the cameras catch the robber.  So this man gets caught on camera and then he went back to the crime like most people do to get caught.  Had a young cousin.  Well, he's older.  When he was growing up from the time he was five, this man knew he wanted to be a bank robber.  My father would come in and he'd be sitting there watching Saturday morning cartoons with a big bowl of Cheerios.  And my father would say, hey, Robert.  Huh?  What do you want to be when you grow up?  Bank robber.  Wouldn't even hesitate if bank robber.  And guess what?  Grew up to be a bank robber.  Now, the reason he got caught is because guess what?  Went right back to the same bank that he robbed.  They were waiting on him.  Took him away, boys.  So this dude goes back.  He gets caught.  And now he's in court getting lectured by the judge.  Now, you know, that's not even the worst part of this whole story.  The worst part of this whole story is this man's hair.  Now, I'm going to be honest with you.  When I saw the picture, I said, ay, ay, ay.  Ay, caramba.  This man just gave Sideshow Bob a bad name.  Y'all remember Sideshow Bob off of The Simpsons with the big hair?  This man got a big... package of cotton candy sitting on top of his head.  what is he thinking?  if you're gonna get caught doing a crime shave it up look decent okay this man looks stupid on multiple levels.  stupid because he committed the crime and it's stupid because he looks like a bunny in a bush.  you can't even distinguish his face from his hair is all over the place.  he looks like one of those characters off of uh you know the the the little oompa-loompas that would come out or something with the big hair on the top.  What is he thinking?  He embarrasses his father, his mother, all of us.  All the Jamaicans that grow dreads are going, what the boy like him bad?  He's not growing any dreads, man.  Don't even try to compare me to him, man.  That man's hair looks a mess.  Where is he going with it?  Right now, the hair is just going in all different directions.  The hair looks a complete mess.  I'm surprised he didn't hide a couple packages in his hair.  He could have.  He could have easily slid a whole PlayStation in his hair.  That's how big it is.  And now he's in court.  Now, this is a lesson for all young men.  You know, you're less suspicious.  You're less to be judged if you clean up a little bit, if you groom yourself, if you look like you got some sense.  Because this man can't be wrapped too tight with that hairstyle looking like that.  It looks like a cloud came down and just settled right on his head.  That's what it looks like.  He's walking around like, what?  I don't see the problem.  Dude, you don't see that cloud sitting on top of your head?  No, I don't see anything.  It's unbelievable.  He has at least 15 pounds of hair on his head.  I'm surprised.  when he was talking to the judge, he wasn't like, yeah, so I mean, you know, I promise if you let me go.  Trying to balance all of that hair on top of his head.  He looks nuts.  The first thing they need to do when that guy goes to prison is cut it off and sell it.  To somebody, because I'm sure somebody out there is like, well, that much hair, I'll give you top dollar.  Unbelievable.  He looks ridiculous.  So the big takeaway from the whole story is don't look like a fool if you get arrested doing something foolish.  Now, you've been listening to Kevin and Kevin's Corner.
