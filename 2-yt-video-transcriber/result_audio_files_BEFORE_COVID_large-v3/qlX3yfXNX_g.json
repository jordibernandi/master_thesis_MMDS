And you can see behind me is toothpaste, which CNN has said does not exist in Venezuela. ",

            "text": "So, I mean, here you have all the basic foodstuffs, pasta, flour.  They're focusing on protein here.  So you have a fish stand and it's being sold well below market rate, as you can see from the prices.  This is salted fish.  It's pretty good.  It's really good.  And here we have ground up chicken.  Made in Venezuela, which is being sold for about $1.25, or 3,800 bolivares.  And then over there, there are large packages of meat And back here you can see all the vegetables.  And also what you can see are train tracks because there's an actual metro system in Caracas that services this community.  The infrastructure is actually pretty decent.  There goes a train.  Caracas is a massive city with a massive metro system.  And you can see that train is full of people.  And it's basically free.  So sardines and vegetable oil here, more protein.  This is the bread stand.  It's really cheap.  So it's being sold.  The large breads are being sold for 2,000 bolivares, which is less than $1 for all that bread.  You can get two of these for $0.50.  And bread with coconut is being sold for less than $1, about $0.75.  And so for me, it's basically free.  And here, it's still well below market value.  .  saying we're at peace here in this area and we don't want war.  They don't need the humanitarian aid from the U.S.  They have everything they need.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Take that news there, that we don't need anything.  She's saying tell the news the truth.  Okay, so this is handmade soap and they go through a lot to produce this and you were in contact with the producer and brought it to the market.  And this is really nice soap.  It's all women produced soap.  She's taking away a fat bag of food.  Por la semana.  We're at an open-air market in El Valle in Caracas, very similar to Parroquia Macarao.  These people behind me are volunteers who are distributing food provided by the government to be sold at well below market value.  And so, again, you have bread over there for less than a dollar right behind me.  It's just a whole lot of meat, bags and bags of meat.  And people here seem to have as much food as they can purchase.  There are hundreds of people waiting outside to come in, and you can see someone picking up their food right here, getting pasta. ",
