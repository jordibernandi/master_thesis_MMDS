            "text": "Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and its new president, Juan Guaido.  We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom And we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.  Here in the United States, We are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.  America was founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion, domination and control.  We are born free and we will stay free.  Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. ",
