The other is a very effective political movement.  For instance, if you are organizing a political movement because you don't want action on climate change, the Tea Party was an effective movement.  They literally primaried you and got you out, and they delayed action on climate change.  So at some level, it's like, I wonder this all the time with progressive activists.  When you think, Heather, of Tea Party the left, do you think about that as a good or bad thing? ",

Just the Green New Deal, this idea, even when pressure tested and talking about higher taxes and saying, oh my gosh, Democrats are proposing it, it's more popular than the Republican tax cuts, the $1.5 trillion we just found to give away to corporations and the wealthy.  It's more popular than the wall.  So I think when... We have this idea that left ideas are moving and shaking inside the political atmosphere right now.  It's true, but they're left in terms of the inside of Washington.  In terms of the American people, they're the centrist ideas because they're about taking back our democracy and our economy. ",

Could we come back to healthcare?  Because, you know, I was in two Congresses that were totally consumed by healthcare.  You can't do it in a single Congress, the entire Green New Deal.  It is literally impossible.  with the number of committee references that you would have in the course of that.  So is it possible that we say, listen, climate change is the thing that we're seeing, the whites of its eyes, we've got to act now.  Can we come back maybe to universal basic income a little bit later? ",

She was speaking about the Green New Deal at a town hall hosted by MSNBC's Chris Hayes, along with former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis, whose support for climate action actually led to his own defeat in a primary challenge in 2010.  In stark contrast to AOC's calls for sweeping changes championed by this new Congress, Inglis suggested focusing on one thing, the Green New Deal, for example, and saving other agenda items for later.  to use what he claims might be limited political capital on climate change and put everything else on the back burner.  The remark drew boos from the crowd, with one heckler calling him a moron, at which point Ocasio-Cortez shut him down immediately and, without skipping a beat, called Trump out for being absolutely incapable of doing the same.  And she's spot on.  Not only would Trump never call out one of his rally attendees for being awful, he feeds off it.  Forget shutting it down, he's the one instigating it. ",
