            "text": "A while back, I did a video about joining a Jehovah's Witness dating website.  Now, the website wasn't designed or endorsed by the Jehovah's Witnesses religion, but it did give a good glimpse into the religious culture, which is something that's really hard to get on its own.  So as pointless and click-baity as it seems, I see deep value in it, if for no other reason than to get that glimpse into the culture.  So as you can tell from the title of the video, my girlfriend and I joined a Mormon dating website, and we used her personality to attract hot Mormon men.  Let's see what hot guys are interested in us.  Let's get into it.  Before we actually take a look at the dating website, I just wanted to mention a couple of things.  Last month, everything on YouTube dropped through the floor.  Demonetization and view drops and everything got to me.  As a result, I saw a swell of support from Patreon and PayPal donations and even Teespring sales.  I couldn't possibly express how much I appreciate all the help you guys have offered to make it possible for me to continue doing the work I do.  I'm closer to my goal of making enough from Patreon that I can pay rent without having to worry about how YouTube is performing, or if I get a video demonetized.  But Patreon pays out too late for this month, and I'm short.  So if you want to help counteract the demonetization and view drop from last month in a more immediate way, then you can support me through a GoFundMe, which can be accessed through a card in the corner or a link in the description.  One more thing.  If you want to come hang out with me for a few hours at a park, I'm doing a meetup in Lincoln, Nebraska on June 29th, 2019.  Just going to be grilling and talking for a few hours.  It isn't going to be like a conference where I have obligations and I'm trying to arrange things.  This will be a lot more personal where I can just sit around and talk.  So if you want to come chill with me for a bit, then meet me in Lincoln.  And FYI, if you can't make this one, I'm holding others in other locations across the country, so don't stress.  Okay, with that being said, let's take a look at this Mormon website.  When I joined the Jehovah's Witnesses dating website, it gave me a lot more options than I expected.  For example, it let me choose to be a man looking for a man, woman looking for a woman, and a lot more.  In this case, it gives me two options, a man seeking a woman or a woman seeking a man.  Come to find out, the reason why the Jehovah's Witness dating website gave me so much freedom and the reason why it had Muslim as an option for religion and lots of other unexpected options like that is because it was created from a template.  The creators basically copied some code over and changed most of the options to be geared more toward Jehovah's Witnesses directly.  Of course, when you get there, you discover that the user base is mostly made up of disfellowshipped Jehovah's Witnesses who still believe it but can't date within the religion because they're being shunned.  Any actual active Jehovah's Witness would probably get in a lot of trouble for using it.  But this Mormon dating website seems a lot more structured and geared toward the church.  It's well done, too.  The other one was kind of sloppy.  I'm sorry, I'm looking at this through the lens of an ex-software engineer, so naturally I'm more concerned with the quality of the code and the user interface.  Anyways, as I was saying, the options it gives me right out of the gate are man-seeking woman or woman-seeking man.  I figured we'd get a better glimpse into the culture if we were a woman seeking a man, so I went undercover as my girlfriend.  I picked woman-seeking man.  I live in West Virginia, so I picked the state capital, Charleston, as my location, since it's pretty populated and it's reasonably arbitrary.  I was going to go with my own birthday, July 20th, 1989, but I decided to go 10 years younger.  I figured that would be the best way to rope me a man.  So in this exercise, I'm 19, almost 20, though my girlfriend is actually 24.  Now to add a photo, and then on to describe myself.  The example description is already eerily accurate, so I decided to copy and paste it in to modify from there.  We ended up with this as the description.  I've been known to be quite the social butterfly, but it's only because I like meeting new people.  I want the guy who loves Jesus, wants to go to BYU, and is great with animals.  I find the way they worded the description pretty interesting.  I'm the social butterfly, but it's only because I like meeting new people.  Why make up an excuse for being a social butterfly?  Are they worried?  it'll, like, I don't know, appear that you're a social butterfly for nefarious reasons or something?  The only nefarious reason I can think of, considering the fact that we're on an extremist cult dating website, is if you're trying to seduce and tempt men away from God with your looks.  I don't know.  It's just a weird thing to say.  Anyways, my girlfriend is a social butterfly and it isn't for that reason.  It just seemed to me that their prudish and repressive attitude is slipping through already.  Let's continue.  Next, they tried to get me to pay for it.  Not really interested in paying for a service I'm not planning on using again, so I did my best to get around it.  But that means some of the features are lost to me, like reading messages people send me.  And believe me, I got a whole heck of a heap of messages from people.  Too bad I'll never be able to respond.  I can at least look at profiles and fill out some personal questions, so let's do that.  The first question they ask pertains to relationship status.  What kind of relationship am I looking for?  Marriage, serious relationship, travel partner, casual relationship, friendship, or pen pal.  I found it interesting that they include pen pal in there in the first place.  I guess that's one of those glimpses into Mormon culture that you don't really get otherwise.  I talked to Mr.  Atheist about it, and he said that pen pals are common among missionaries.  We'll get to missionaries in a little bit.  Naturally, I picked marriage and pen pals.  As far as church activity goes, I'm definitely looking for somebody who attends church activities regularly.  Now, the next question gives insight into what Mormons value and how it's valued.  Do you want the person you're looking for to have been on a mission?  I picked yes here.  Missions are basically long-distance and long-term trips that are organized by the LDS Church.  They send young people to other areas of the world for organized long-term preaching trips.  I could be wrong here, so if I am, people can correct me in the comments.  I think boys are expected to go for two years.  Girls have the option of going for 18 months if they choose.  But for boys, it's their calling.  They're heavily pressured into it.  If they don't, then they're looked down upon.  People start asking questions about what's wrong with you and why you didn't go.  Same as if you leave a mission trip early.  If you come home before the two years is up, people presume you did something bad.  though sometimes there are legitimate reasons for people's early return.  I mean, they're sending you overseas a lot of the time, into a foreign land around foreign people, a foreign culture, and foreign plant life and food.  People discover allergies they didn't know they had sometimes.  But that's kind of the goal of missions, to isolate you from everybody you ever knew or loved.  throw you into an odd environment where you don't even know the local language, and force you to rely on the church for everything.  Your schedule is heavily regimented.  Everything is planned out, down to how often you do your laundry.  On the bite model, it would absolutely max out the scale.  It is an extreme control environment.  The goal behind missions is to break you down and build you back up in the church's image.  Families are expected to pay for the mission trips.  I think they pay the Mormon church around $10,000, and the church organizes the whole thing.  The pressure to go on a mission isn't as strong for women, as I said.  They can go on mission trips if they so choose, but it isn't really a requirement in the same way as it is for men.  The next part is more cultural than doctrinal, but it's usually what most people end up doing in the Mormon church.  This is considered, quote-unquote, the right thing in the church.  You're living up to God's standards if you follow this routine.  People are usually expected to go on mission trips pretty much as soon as they finish high school.  So you spend two of your most formative years being conditioned by the Mormon church.  That's how they keep you forever.  The mind control and even the physical control is extreme for the duration of the mission.  So you're expected to skip college for that time.  Then when you get back, if you so choose, you can go to college.  BYU, the Mormon college, is heavily encouraged.  After you get back from your mission trip, they send you to a church with a bunch of young single Mormons to encourage you to marry within the church.  That's another marker on the bite model, by the way.  All of this stuff should be setting off red flags.  It screams cult from the hilltops.  The high control environment, encouraging people to go to the church-sponsored school, marrying within the religion, all of it.  So anyways, that makes this website that much weirder.  That there are single people looking for girlfriends on a dating website, when they could be going to their local youth church instead.  It's possible.  they went to the youth church for singles and it just didn't pan out, or maybe they aged out, who knows?  Anyways, for the sake of the dating website, we'll say we want to find somebody who's been on a mission trip.  The next question kind of confused me.  It asks about temple status.  For those of you who might not know, Mormons have a chapel where regular church services are held, and they also have a temple.  Not everybody is allowed into the temple.  The temple is where baptisms for the dead and a bunch of other really weird rituals take place.  It's a super secret place.  No cameras allowed or anything.  There are a bunch of different criteria you have to meet to make it into the temple.  But this question kind of confused me, so I asked Mr.  Atheist about it, since he's ex-Mormon.  They're asking what kind of temple status I'm looking for.  The options are temple worthy, temple recommend, and prefer not to say.  I've always known temple recommend as basically being the permission slip that you need to get into the temple.  Mr.  Atheist said the only difference between temple recommend and temple worthy is with one, you have the permission slip.  With the other, you qualify to enter, but you haven't gotten the permission slip.  yet.  And I guess the prefer not to say option means I'm not even temple worthy.  I figured this would be a good opportunity to take a gander at the requirements for becoming temple worthy.  It's a pretty long list.  First and foremost, you have to be all paid up on your tithings.  You have to give 10% of your yearly income to the church.  So if you make $50,000 per year, you have to pay $5,000 per year to the LDS church.  Usually Mormons will hold on to their tithings until tax time rolls around, at which point they'll pay their tithings in a lump sum out of their tax refund.  For those who get tax refunds, Mormons are pretty big on having lots of kids, so a lot of the time they'll get decently big refunds in the U.S.  because of the child tax credit.  Of course, the child tax credit is designed to be an income boost for the parents or guardians of children.  In many cases, it's how parents manage to buy new clothes and school supplies for their children every year.  But the Mormon church thinks they're more important, so... Anyways... Some people choose to pay every month, but you can't really be a full member of the church without paying your tithings.  That's the most important criteria to be temple worthy.  And it's a red flag for cults too.  Financial exploitation of the members.  Anyways, there's a huge list of questions you have to answer to become temple worthy.  And since you have to be caught up on your tithings to enter, you can have your temple recommend revoked.  I'm not going to list all the questions here, but this is a small sampling of them.  Do you have faith in and a testimony of God the Eternal Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost?  Do you have a testimony of the restoration of the Gospel in these latter days?  Do you live the law of chastity?  Are you a full tithe payer?  Do you keep the Word of Wisdom?  And by the way, we'll get to what the Word of Wisdom is in a minute.  Do you have financial or other obligations to a former spouse or children?  If yes, are you current in meeting those obligations?  That last one is particularly interesting to me.  Some of you may not know this, but Mormons are expected to wear special underwear under their normal clothes.  You buy it from the church.  It isn't terribly expensive.  And I've actually talked about it in a video before, but that's where they get all of their underwear.  In fact, if you look closely at some of the pictures of Mitt Romney when he was on the campaign trail for the presidency, you can see his Mormon undergarments under his suit.  I understand they're pretty uncomfortable.  So those are some of the examples.  I think there are a total of 15 Temple Recommend questions and another nine baptismal interview questions, which include things like, what are your reasons for knowing or believing that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God?  Are you now living each of the Ten Commandments?  What's your understanding of the law of tithing?  Will you live this law?  What's your understanding of the word of wisdom?  Will you live this law by abstaining from tea, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, or other harmful drugs?  And have you repented of all past transgressions?  Jesus, they are serious about taking your money, aren't they?  Seriously, huge red flag.  I also find it interesting that they want people to live by the first ten commandments, but they don't care about the other 603 that came immediately after the first ten.  What's so special about the first ten?  Why aren't they putting people to death for working on the Sabbath, putting two seeds in the same hole, and wearing certain linen blends, and lots of others?  Because their ideology is inconsistent and they don't care.  That's why.  Okay, moving on.  For college education, I put still studying, since I'm supposed to be 19.  It only makes sense.  I'm still in school.  $25,000 to $35,000 for my income, and for political affiliation, I decided to put conservative.  I leaned toward ultra-conservative because I think conservatism is favored in Mormonism, but I went with conservative to keep an open field.  Never married, no children, and I put 5'3\", which is how tall my girlfriend actually is.  About average body type, blonde hair, green eyes, and I have a cat.  Now this next bit was particularly interesting to me.  It asked me to talk about how I feel about the church.  I found the responses some people gave to this question on their profiles interesting too.  I tried to use as much loaded language as I could, but I'm honestly a little out of practice with my Mormon loaded language.  We'll give it a shot anyways, and in a minute, we'll get to see what other people had to say.  So we'll get a good glimpse into the loaded language anyways.  My final statement for how I feel about the church was, I believe that the church guides my life and I strive to live as the Bible instructs.  I believe the church should act in a biblical way in all regards and not bend to social pressures such as LGBT issues.  I figured that was a good dog whistle to all the hot Mormon men around who might be interested in me.  Well, I guess it's a little more than a dog whistle.  Anyways, I went on to fill out the rest of the form, and when I was done, I added some extra pictures.  Men love extra pictures.  Here's what our first prospective suitor had to say about how they feel about the church.  I am looking for a girl who is strong in the church and will help me become closer to the Lord.  I have a strong testimony of the church and will accept no less than marriage in the temple.  I hope my future wife feels the same  way.\".  That doesn't really have anything to do with the church exactly.  It's more about how you feel about the spirituality of your potential future mate, but whatever.  Obviously, for privacy reasons, I cut out names and pictures.  Here's what the next prospective suitor had to say about how they feel about the church.  I love the church and learning more about the plans and promises set by our Heavenly Father.  I currently serve as a scoutmaster for our troop.  I know this church is true and that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that a prophet still leads the church today.  Make note that acknowledging that the church is true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet was also on the list of things you have to affirm to become temple worthy.  That's loaded language.  The use of the term Heavenly Father is also loaded language.  It's the kind of thing you probably wouldn't know to say unless you were on the inside.  The next one says, Again, more loaded language here.  The fact that they spelled out Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints instead of saying Mormon or LDS is significant.  The Mormon Church just recently announced that they want people to say the entire name, not just a shorthand like LDS.  So that's supposed to act as something of a signal to other Mormons that they're honest actors.  Okay, here's what the next person had to say about how they feel about the church.  Funny, smart, outgoing, adventurous, down to earth.  Uh, that's weird.  They put it under the wrong section.  I guess they aren't as smart as they claim.  Okay, next one.  Aw, they don't have anything under the.  how do I feel about the church section.  Wait a minute, what's this?  I thought I was a woman seeking a big spiritually strong man.  Why is there a female making an appearance in my timeline?  Are they trans by chance?  Oh, I guess they just took a picture with somebody and it centered on the other person's face.  Why would they do that?  They even hit the volume button before they took the screenshot.  If you're not going to put effort in, then why even bother joining?  Now, this next one on the list is extremely interesting to me.  It's very telling, and it has loaded language from beginning to end.  Let's give it a read.  It says, I know that this is true, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ exist.  I know that the Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ.  I love our Father in Heaven and our Savior Jesus Christ, who is atoned for us all, knowing that through His atonement, God will compensate for all the unfairness of life for all.  first he misspelled savior.  i know that's kind of a petty thing to point out but it's honestly extremely important to me.  i will not date a man i am straight but if i weren't i most definitely wouldn't date a man who misspelled savior or showed signs of poor grammar.  that rule applies to my current girlfriend.  If you're listening to this, just know that I will leave you if you ever misspell savior.  Jesus, these grammar faux pas are seriously hard to get through.  At this rate, I'll never find a good Mormon man.  Okay, let's continue reading.  It says, I've gone through many afflictions and trials in my life through mental disabilities, etc.  But I'm so glad that it draws me closer to my personal savior, your savior, our savior.  jesus christ i love life and life is great if we see the positiveness note he said positiveness not positivity and the goodness of life through personal prayers in our lives and in your personal life.  there is so much loaded language through all of this.  it sounds like he's reading from a script for how you should answer baptism or temple recommend questions.  He continues on, One day, if we help others to come unto Christ through missionary work continuously and endure to the end, we will be saved and have everything that your Father in heaven has, and more to come in the celestial life.  Again, life is great with the Lord's help 24-7.  I know that the church is true, knowing that this, again, is the full, breathing gospel of Jesus Christ.  This is, I would love to bear my testimony that church is extremely true, knowing that God loves us all and he loves you.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.  Now that is a real Mormon answer.  They are fully immersed in the culture.  They are completely programmed to serve the Mormon church to the death.  Seeing that kind of mindset is honestly scary.  Knowing that a human being can be so completely indoctrinated and mind-controlled is a scary thought.  And it really makes me wonder how I ever escaped, because in a past life, I was just as indoctrinated in Jehovah's Witnesses as this guy is in Mormonism.  Honestly, dude seems like a real catch if you're a Mormon girl looking for a spiritually strong husband.  Only thing is that every dude suggested to me was in their early to mid-30s, which is strange because I listed my age as 19.  That age gap is entirely too big.  I wonder why it kept suggesting 30-year-olds to me.  I feel like there's something to that I just can't put my finger on.  Anyways, that's all I've got for you.  If you like what I do, you want to make sure I can continue doing it, then consider supporting me on Patreon and Teespring.  And as I mentioned, for the next six days, you can also support me on GoFundMe to help make up for YouTube's demonetization and view draw.  Also check out my podcast where I talk about news articles pertaining to anything from LGBT issues to politics to religion.  So check me out there.  All links are in the description as always.  Okay, thanks for watching guys.  Thank you. ",
