            "text": "China continues to ratchet up the pressure against Canada, but this time we're not just talking about trade issues, things have now moved on to foreign affairs and military matters.  The latest on the Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou detention issue is that her lawyers are stepping forward saying, let her go, it's not in Canada's national interests.  And funny, China's foreign spokesperson pretty much saying the same thing, all at the same time that China has banned all Canadian meat imports, a disproportionate reaction to concerns about health certificates.  But that's not all.  The other week, one Canadian warship, HMCS Regina, made a transit through the Taiwan Strait.  Now this is international waters between mainland China and Taiwan, but China, they pretty much consider it their waters.  They don't want anybody going through there.  US does freedom of navigation exercises to make a point to say, hey, we can go where we want.  Canada has done it before, but not typically.  And this was sure to frustrate them to see us do this now when we did it.  Well, as a bit of a response, various Chinese vessels and jets have been trailing Canadian vessels, the Canadian warship.  And Chinese jets even buzzed HMCS Regina, coming within just a couple hundred meters to say, we're watching you, we're trailing you, we're keeping tabs on you.  All of this happening as Justin Trudeau goes to the G20, where he will meet with some world leaders, but he won't have a bilateral sit-down one-on-one with President Xi Jinping.  Even though he's meeting to discuss foreign affairs, this is our major foreign affairs issue.  Instead, Justin Trudeau's leaving the heavy lifting to Donald Trump, hoping he can broker the release of the two Michaels, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.  Here's the question, though.  Is that going to be Donald Trump's first priority?  He's got his own trade issues to deal with.  Sure, Trudeau doesn't have an official meeting book with Xi Jinping, but they're in a room doing the cocktail circuit.  They're all hanging out together.  Can't he just go up to him?  and lobby his cause?  Andrew Scheer putting out a release saying they would be much tougher.  They want to file World Trade Organization complaints against China because of the meat issue.  They want to withdraw from the Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank.  Either way, it seems like the Prime Minister is not sure what to do right now, not wanting to step forward in all of this, even though China is making it clear they're going to continue to take shots against us until we do what they want.  The answer is clear.  Caving to China is not the path forward, but will Trudeau do it? ",
