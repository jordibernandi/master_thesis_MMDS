            "text": "Good morning, brethren.  This is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, give all praise to the Most High, Yahuwah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yahuwah Shai, pray at the Most High, blesses this lesson today and gives us more understanding of the events of the past in order to understand how he's working today in order to restore us in the near future.  I received this book that I had ordered about a week ago, yesterday, and I was reading it and there was just so much information that I wanted to bring out some of the information.  that is absolutely amazing.  And it would be from this book right here, Christ in America.  I think that Elder Al Ewell has an older version, but a lot of the same information.  Christ in Ancient America, Milton R. Hunter, said this is going to be some mind-blowing information because so much of the history of our people and what the Spaniards found when they came here has been hidden so that they could pretty much invent their own narrative this entire time.  And they've been able to live, you know, life luxuriously.  off of changing the entire narrative of what they found when they got here.  What you're going to see is that some of some really important information that has been hidden from the world about the practices of the Native Americans.  All right?  And that's what we're going to read real quick.  It's going to be a quick one.  Okay, just to kind of, you know, get our feet wet a little bit before we get into more of this information.  And let me see here.  Hold on.  It says similarities between Indian traditions and Christianity.  The Spanish Catholic missionaries who gathered traditions of Quetzalcoatl from the Indians... as well as practically every student who has made a study of the traditions, have commented on the numerous similarities between the Indian traditions and the teachings of Christianity.  Miles Poindexter compares the Spanish priests' interpretation of Jehovah with a belief held by the Indians of Peru at the time of the Spanish conquest, to quote, No longer fast.  Sorry, I finally left the book in the other room.  All right.  To quote, all right, here we go.  The Incas' idea of God as the creator was almost identical with that of the Spanish invaders, except that Vida Cocha of the Incas, as their ancestors and the beneficent creator and preserver of all things, was a nobler conception.  In some respects, then, the Jehovah of the Spanish priests and the Amatois conception, both of the age and of the method of creation of the world, was more enlightened than that of the Europeans.  Both conceptions were evidently from the same source.  So it seems like when the Spanish got here, they found a people that was actually practicing a lot of the same Christian values that they were practicing, except at a much deeper level.  So when they got here, they realized that these guys were actually following Christian doctrine, which would then mean when your massacre of these people is like massacring other Christians.  But they didn't want to let the world know that they were massacring people who had the same belief system.  That's why they had to destroy all the records.  Now it's starting to make more sense as to why all these records have been destroyed or hidden in order to hide the fact that they were massacring other practicing Christians in order to steal their land.  Let's continue.  Dr.  P. DeRue gives considerable evidence to sustain his hypothesis that Christianity was taught in ancient America.  and thoroughly instilled into the hearts of the American Indians.  The Christian missionaries were surprised to find that the natives were familiar with numerous Christian doctrines when they were first contacted by the whites from the old world.  He states that most ancient and modern authors agree in saying that the Christian religion had been taught to the Indians in pre-Columbian days.  So they already had Christianity before them.  the Spanish got here.  So that whole notion of they were bringing Christianity to these savages was already out the window as soon as they started to speak with these natives.  These natives knew Christianity better than they did.  They already knew the beliefs of Amashiak already before they got here, even at a much deeper level.  That's a huge point right there.  He states that most ancient and modern authors agree in saying that the Christian religion had been taught to the Indians in pre-Columbian days.  Okay.  To continue the quotation, though, this is before, you know, the, um, I have a couple other books where people were making notes saying that, you know, the natives were so lucky that they, um, that the Spanish brought Christianity to them.  And if they hadn't brought Christianity to them, that they would still be practicing all of their, um, pagan religions.  Well, this is already showing you that when they got here, they'd already known about all this stuff.  Again, taking credit for things that they had nothing to do with.  Talking about how they Christianized these savages.  Bastian establishes this opinion by the numerous analogies he points out between the religious belief and practices of the Christians and those of American aborigines.  Von Humboldt admits the parody to be so striking as to have given the Spanish missionaries a fine opportunity to deceive the natives by making them believe that their own was none other than the Christian religion.  Quite a number of ancient writers such as Garcilaso de la Vega Solorzano Acosta and others are equally explicit in asserting that several Christian tenets and practices were found among our aborigines.  So how would that be possible if they've never had any contact with anyone from the other side of the world?  Well, we know that Quetzalcoatl came over here and that Quetzalcoatl was what you would call, ignorantly called Jesus Christ.  And he came over here and he was teaching the people.  And that confirmation showed up or was made apparent when the Spanish finally got over here and they realized that they were already taught the Christian tenets before, okay?  They even got here.  William H. Prescott discussed a number of Christian doctrines and rituals of the Aztec Indians at the time of the Spanish conquest, such as repentance, confession, and  baptism.\".  And then he wrote.  So even when the Spanish were now destroying the Aztecs, they realized that these guys were actually practicing Christian principles, Christian tenets, and they destroyed them anyways, because they weren't here to spread Christianity.  They were here.  to rape, rob, murder, and destroy and look for any justification to do it.  I'm going to continue now.  And then he wrote, we are reminded of Christian morals and more than one of their prayers in which they use regular forms.  Wilt thou blot us out, O Lord, forever?  Is this punishment intended not for our reformation, but for our destruction?  Again, impart to us out of thy great mercy thy gifts, which we are not worthy to receive through our own merits.  Keep peace with all, says another petition.  Bear injuries with humility.  God who sees will avenge you.  But the most striking parallel with scripture is in the remarkable declaration that he who looks too curiously on a woman commits adultery with his eyes.  These were the kinds of things that they were discussing and talking about.  Some of this actually sounds like Baruch.  Some of it sounds like New Testament.  These Aztecs were already familiar with all these tenets already.  So it says, These pure and elevated maxims, it is true, are mixed up with others of a puerile and even brutal character, arguing that confusion of the moral perceptions... which is natural in the twilight of civilization.  One would not expect, however, to meet in such a state of society with doctrines as sublime as any inculcated by the enlightened codes of ancient philosophy.  Picture up there at the top is the decorations of quetzal feathers and serpents on the temple of Eagle Chichen Itza.  says the facts of which Prescott and practically all other writers on ancient American cultures are not aware are that the true Christian religion was taught on the Western hemisphere approximately 2,000 years ago.  Let's read that one more time.  The facts of which Prescott and practically all other writers on ancient American cultures are not aware are that the true Christian religion was taught on the Western hemisphere approximately 2000 years ago.  So this was already taught.  This was already given to the people over 2000 years ago.  That's why they already knew all this information.  Because the person known, ignorantly known as Jesus Christ or Quetzalcoatl, he was used, actually known by many different names.  So it was the one who came and taught these principles to the people over here.  And then it was evidenced by when the Spanish got here, the things that they saw when the other Europeans got here, the things that they were already doing.  Let's continue.  All right.  Um, I'm gonna start, I'm gonna read this whole paragraph one more time.  The facts of which Prescott and practically all other writers on ancient American cultures are not aware are that the true Christian religion was taught on the Western hemisphere approximately 2,000 years ago, that the people regulated their lives by its doctrines and ordinances, and that such pure and elevated maxims as those mentioned by Prescott survived from that day.  Completely in harmony with these facts, Dr.  de Mier, in his discussion of the writings of Father Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, the eminent and scholarly missionary who labored among the Indians of Mexico, From 1529 to 1590 concluded, not a single American missionary who has until this day left any writing has forgotten to notice the evident vestiges of Christianity, which had in former times penetrated even among the most savage tribes.  Listen to that one more time.  Not a single American missionary who has until this day left any writing has forgotten to notice the evident vestiges of Christianity, which had in former times penetrated even among the most savage tribes.  So any of these priests, all of these people who have been gone around and spent any time with these natives knew that they were practicing Christianity.  If they left any writings, they were I'm sure making a point to let them people know that these natives were already practicing Christianity.  So now you're starting to see why all this information was suppressed because they didn't want the world to know that these were the most highest chosen people and that they were already over here.  And that Jesus Christ or Mashiach, Yehoshua, Yehoshua was already over here.  He already been here a thousand years before teaching them or over a thousand years teaching them.  So then when these Spaniards got over here, that they were destroying the Most High's chosen people.  This is all part of biblical prophecy, that it was going to be hidden who they were destroying.  But at the end, the Most High was going to reveal the fact that the Europeans came over here and destroyed the Most High's chosen people.  I'm going to read a little bit more going on to the next page, okay?  As a result of coming in contact with numerous teachings so similar to those of Christianity, some of the early Catholic missionaries maintained that some of Jesus' apostles, perhaps Bartholomew or Thomas, had brought Christianity to the Indians.  However, although the majority of the early Catholic fathers, such as Garcilaso de la Vega, Solorzano, Las Casas, and others, definitely recognize the similarity between the Christian tenets and practices of those found among the American aborigines, they deny their introduction by Christian teachers, giving, strange to say, to the devil the honor of spreading the light of Christianity in spite of his hatred for it.  So because they didn't do it, they said the devil came over here and spread Christianity.  Because these Europeans had nothing to do with what was happening over here, instead of giving honor to the Most High for sending his son to teach these people, they gave honor to the devil and said the devil came over here.  We already know that the devil, it's not possible for him to teach the truth because the truth is not in him.  So the only person that could have been sent over here to teach these people the truth would have been Yehoshua, someone who was spirit-filled and who knew the truth and could impart this information to his people.  Again, let me read that last part there.  They deny their introduction by Christianity, Christian teachers, giving, strange to say, to the devil the honor of spreading the light of Christianity in spite of his hatred for it.  Yeah, the devil hates the truth.  So why would he come over here and spread the truth?  But because they wanted to destroy these people and take their lands.  They looked away and they looked away from the evidence of the fact that they were already practicing Christianity and made a whole new dogma, a whole new story, a whole new background in order for them to justify the death and destruction that they brought to the people here.  This is just a taste of what is in this book.  Just as, I mean, I was just taking picture after picture after picture.  I can just go into so much information.  But I wanted to definitely just share these couple pages.  You know, I said they were practicing already Christian tenets because these people were the 12 tribes, the 10 tribes.  And they were practicing, you know, just like the Most High gave the Southern Kingdom their books, he came over here and spread his information here so that the Ten Tribes could form their own writings.  So that here at the end, you know, over the expanses of these great oceans and great waters, we would get these books back and be able to put the information back together in order to get the truth from the beginning to the end.  All praises to the Most High, Yahuwah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yahushua.  Shalom. ",
