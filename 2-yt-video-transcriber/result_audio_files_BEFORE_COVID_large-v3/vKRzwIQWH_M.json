            "text": "Zimbabwe, a place that has been in a dilemma for too long.  Please hear.  But soon to be uncovered.  For in a moment a heart shall stop beating.  And a man who has brought misery and death to a nation and to the families of that nation shall be gone.  Enough!  Enough Mugabe!  Enough!  Enough!  Let Africa have the revival that you prophesied and let Zimbabwe be free.  for Zimbabwe was called to raise up the apostles and God said now one has terrorized shall no longer be.  I will raise up a righteous man who will do double the righteousness of the evil that he did says the Lord.  God said let me speak to Zimbabwe now.  you know what God said to me just the other day.  he said I want to bring judgment Upon rulers of nations that have suppressed, caused genocides, I want to bring judgments.  Now you say, oh God doesn't do that.  If He must, He will.  And what I'm hearing is, upon the ruler of that nation, dementia.  Dementia.  complete and utter madness to a removal suddenly.  So doesn't God want to save him?  Absolutely.  God said, I'm taking the families there.  I'm protecting them and I'll give them property.  I'll give them freedom because of your prayers.  This that has happened in this nation and this that is happening throughout the East, Middle East, This that is happening in Africa is my doing.  I have poured out the wine and intoxicated the people.  For this is the changing of the God.  This is a time in your history where you will look back and you will say, what man meant for evil, God turn it around for good.  Come on.  They are barbarians who want what they call democracy.  They want freedom.  The changing of the God means reformation.  This is the decade of reformation.  will change the god in this nation.  i will change the god in africa.  i will change the god in the far east and the middle east and the near east.  god says i will remove and i will topple the princes who have taken advantage and drunk themselves into a stupor.  It was outstanding.  And as things develop, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Get my band, please.  Get the musicians.  I sense something about Nigeria right now.  Nigeria, you need to pray.  Nigeria, pray.  Pray, pray.  There is deep darkness that is wanting to emerge.  A deep darkness that wants to come and control.  the children of light.  There is a fear for corruption.  Nigeria, pray!  For the enemy is looking at you right now saying what they decide will either allow me to do this great wickedness or stop me.  I command your power to be broken right now.  The power of what?  The powers of darkness that would try and put fear into the masses.  Nigeria, God has great plans for you.  Great plans for you But it is still in your hands to decide For the light of christ wants to shine And bring destruction.  Yes destruction to the opposing forces Of hell.  They will try and say We will outlaw certain Christian values.  Pray that what may emerge may be a prince of light, a prince of righteousness.  All of my warriors pray with me now.  This will affect things that will happen in Africa, in Northern Africa, in the Middle East.  Father, we pray that you would have your way.  I PRAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR WAY AND LET THE PRINCE OF LIGHT ARISE.  WE IN AMERICA, WE WARRIORS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD STAND TOGETHER AND PRAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR WAY IN AFRICA.  WE GIVE YOU PRAISE AND THANKS FOR IT, LORD.  AMEN.  It just came to me.  South Africa!  South Africa!  You!  Once corrupted.  Once evil.  But yet, a remnant of people.  who love me.  Have I forgotten you?  Have I forgotten you, South Africa?  Has the flame gone out?  No!  The flame is in the hearts of the people of all races.  And yet there is corruption from the top.  that I will wipe out the corrupt one and the corrupt ones who are allowing the evil and iniquity and the greed.  it is as bad as yesterday and a stench that has come before me says the Lord.  but I can change that stench into a fragrance for there are people that have cried out to me that have remained strong from each tribe, Zulu, Xhosa, from every tribe.  And then the mixed races, you will amalgamate into one sound and one fragrance.  For if you think I've forgotten you, I have not forgotten the prayers of those in the early centuries.  I have not turned away from those prayers.  Therefore, there shall be a shaking and I will replace, replace, replace, and then I will fill your streets with the name of Yeshua, says the Lord.  First of all, let me go back a little bit.  When I met with... General Colin Powell, in a private dinner in Dallas, Texas.  And I had already in my heart, being from South Africa and prophesying in the 80s, the early 80s, that South Africa would be free from the oppression.  And I set myself up to be qualified as a voice because I did it on a great attack And we came out of the 70s with Pastor Fred Roberts, who started the first charismatic non-racial church in 1978.  And I joined him.  And I don't want to go into my history, but it's fascinating as well because... I was friends with a movement called Black Consciousness Movement, Steve Biko, who was killed also.  And so my brother and I, in our early years, we weren't allowed in the locations.  The location was an area where there were only black people or coloreds.  There were two different races.  The blacks were the true African tribes.  Ours happened to be Xhosa.  which is down the Cape, and then you had the Zulus and many other factions.  So my brother and I were in the Cape, and we were musicians.  And so we would creep out at night and go into the location where we were not allowed, and if they caught a young white boy, the police would thrash them with a whip, which I had one thrashing of, very bad.  Because I was in that area.  so just to give you a little history when we were kids that we were so opposed living in South Africa of the apartheid which oppressed black blacks terribly and When I eventually got into ministry and I was converted and so on, I still went on that mission.  And I said to the Lord, show me what's going to happen to this nation.  If you remember, go back to 79, 80.  There wasn't even a glimmer of hope.  Nelson Mandela wasn't freed.  His wife was crazy, running around, doing all kinds of things.  And it didn't look like there was any hope, but I knew that it was going to come to an end.  So I began prophesying what I saw would happen to South Africa with a an African president.  We all know that happened.  But I went, I came at a tremendous attack.  But I do need to tell you this because as a South African, what right do I have to come to America being raised a white boy in an apartheid system?  That may be true.  But remember, I then did what I felt the Spirit told me to do and would prophesy and sing about a free South Africa.  A South Africa where we Blacks and whites would be free together, and there would be an African president.  The thing is, people would say, well, you know, South Africa is in a mess.  Actually, it's not.  It's been through it.  Can you imagine a nation that had been in depression for so long coming out of it?  It takes time.  It takes time to heal.  It takes time to sort things out.  We're so quick to judge. ",
