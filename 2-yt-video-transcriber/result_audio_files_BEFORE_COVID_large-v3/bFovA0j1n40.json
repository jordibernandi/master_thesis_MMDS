            "text": "What's up, everybody?  It's your girl back for another video.  So, I want to comment real quick on the abortion laws and the bills that are, you know, in the process of being passed or trying to get passed.  We have a lot of, you know, controversy going on right now with these third trimester abortions.  The governor of Virginia and his comments about late-term abortions and, ugh, you know, we have all these feminist, liberals, reproductive rights advocates out there fighting, kicking, screaming, cursing, running around naked, painting their bodies, acting a fool for women to have the right to kill their most precious, their unborn children.  Us women, we're hardwired and biologically made to protect our babies at all costs.  Years and years and years ago when women would give birth and die during birth, bleed to death, there would be no question, save the baby, don't save me.  if only one of us can live.  Nowadays, it's save me, don't save the baby.  Nowadays, we call a baby in the womb a fetus.  You know, they created that medical term fetus so women won't associate that with a baby.  They don't want us to think of that as a baby.  They want us to think of that as just some, you know, some blob of cells.  that doesn't feel anything, that's not human, it's not, you know, it doesn't have a heart, it doesn't feel, and it's okay to kill it.  You know, you're a woman's health and a woman's mental health.  more important than that little blob of cells growing inside your body you know these the things these feminists and liberals say about these unborn children.  it's it's it's evil.  that's the only word I can come up with.  it's absolutely evil it's sick.  you know.  now Virginia tried to pass a bill that it's just like the bill that New York passed.  New York passed the Reproductive Health Act.  What that allows is, it allows a woman to have an abortion all the way up until the day she goes into labor, in the third trimester.  Now, it was passed in New York, so now these other states are following in suit.  So New York passed it, Virginia tries to pass theirs.  They had a hearing where the Virginia delegate, Kathy Tran, answered some questions.  There was a lot of controversy about it.  She basically said that if a woman is in active labor and she decides at that moment that she wants to abort, yes, my bill will allow that.  And then Governor Northam, you know, the one that dressed up as blackface or the KKK hood, we don't know which one he was, but he goes on some radio show in Virginia and answers some questions about the bill.  And he said that You know, the bill will allow a woman giving birth in active labor to kill the baby and we will abort the baby.  Doctors will go into abort and if the abortion is unsuccessful and the baby comes out hanging on the dear life, we will resuscitate the baby, keep the baby comfortable.  Then a conversation will ensue with the mother and doctors if they want to go ahead and continue on with that abortion.  And if she does, they will go back and murder the baby.  It's sick, y'all.  It's absolutely sick.  So, of course, all the liberal media, you know, because liberals own all the media, all the big media, the platforms, the social media platforms.  They own Hollywood.  They own Silicon Valley.  So, of course, they're all defending this crap, defending what the governor said, defending this bill.  And I even saw some feminists, some, they call them reproductive rights advocates.  They're just a bunch of loony tune feminists that are trying to say these bills are necessary.  It's necessary that a woman be able to kill the baby up until the day she's in active labor because we have too many sick women on cancer treatments and have these diseases that they're being treated for that the baby would come out with all kinds of problems.  So they're having to spend thousands of dollars and travel outside their states far away to get these procedures done.  They should be able to get it done right at home because it jeopardizes their health.  They're putting their health at risk.  traveling while they're sick.  Let me say this, y'all.  Under no circumstance is abortion necessary.  It is murder.  It is a life.  It's, you know, women are supposed to protect their young at all costs.  You're not supposed to murder your baby.  It is a baby.  It has a heartbeat.  It's a life.  And don't give me the rape argument because if a woman is truly raped and not lying about it, she would go her ass down to the police station and the hospital and have the rape kit thing done and report it and at that point they can give her plan B. it's a pill that they can take you know up to like I think 72 hours after intercourse or maybe only have 72 hours after the rape happened the supposed rape.  so she has three days to report it and take that plan B pill.  the plan B pill will make her uterus an environment where the fertilized egg will not be able to implant.  So there will be no baby.  There will be no heartbeat.  There will be no, you know, pregnancy at all.  It will actually stop a pregnancy from taking place.  Now the other argument, women on cancer treatments and women like that are getting pregnant.  First of all, why are they waiting until they're nine months pregnant to decide that they need to do something about the pregnancy and get rid of the baby?  Why do you wait that long?  If a woman is on cancer treatments or has a disease that would affect a pregnancy, she should be on birth control, having sex with condoms, and doing everything she can to avoid a pregnancy in the first place.  And if it was to happen anyway, She should go right to her doctor and get the plan B. Or right to the store, because I think you can get it over the counter now, and take the plan B. And stop the pregnancy from even taking place.  Why the hell would you wait that long?  Oh, I'm eight months pregnant today.  I think I need to go have an abortion now because I'm on cancer treatments.  It's how time I deal with the situation.  Fucking retarded.  Go and take the plan B. There's no reason in the world... for a woman to be that pregnant and decide she needs to get an abortion, there's no excuse.  It's sick, it's wrong, and it's evil.  And if you look at the history of Planned Parenthood, who created it, why it was created, you know, I don't see how anybody could be on board with that.  With Margaret Sanger, a known racist, a Democrat who was you know, getting with the KKK and the churches to convince immigrant women to abort their babies long ago when it was first created.  It's sick.  The whole history of that place is sick.  You know, their end goal is to, you know, to murder minority babies.  And 2,000 black babies every day die in Planned Parenthood.  It was designed to exterminate them.  It's crazy.  Now it's designed to eliminate poor people.  Poor people are not supposed to be having babies.  to liberals.  They'll try to say things like, if you don't have enough money, you shouldn't be having a baby.  And they're trying to get teenage girls to go abort their baby without telling their parents.  Oh God, I could go on and on.  So Like the video if you did.  Subscribe if you want to hear more.  And I'll see y'all back on my next video.  Bye. ",
