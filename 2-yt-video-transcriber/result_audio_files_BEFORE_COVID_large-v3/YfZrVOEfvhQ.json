            "text": "the ninth chapter of romans is probably the most contended chapter in all of scripture with regard to the doctrine of our salvation especially the portion that reads for this was how the promise was stated at the appointed time i will return and sarah will have a son.  not only that but rebecca's children were conceived at the same time by our father isaac.  Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose and election might stand, not by works but by him who calls, she was told, the older will serve the younger.  Just as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.  For the purpose of this presentation, we will focus solely upon God's expression of love for Jacob and hatred for Esau.  We will be looking at four specific points of contention with regard to God's expressed love and hatred.  One, is it literal or idiomatic?  Two, is it about salvation or service?  Three, is it individualistic or national?  And four, is it unconditional or conditional?  First, let's consider God's hatred for Esau.  Is it literal or is it idiomatic?  Did, in other words, God literally hate, as in to despise or reject, Esau before he was even born and done anything good or bad?  If so, we must consider the implications of this interpretation.  Esau, under the Calvinistic interpretation, would represent all non-elect people.  Therefore, anyone and everyone who does not eventually come to faith in Christ are considered the non-elect or the reprobates under the Calvinistic worldview.  That would suggest that God hates and or rejects most of the unborn.  Is that really what Paul means to say here?  John Calvin, the namesake for the Calvinistic systematic, seems to think so.  He says, \"...individuals are born who are doomed from the womb to certain death, and are to glorify Him by their  destruction.\".  Calvin also wrote, \"...therefore, those whom God passes over, He condemns, and this He does for no other reason than that He wills to exclude them from the inheritance which He predestines for His own  children.\".  Now, please understand, many modern-day Calvinists have softened this language to make it more palatable, some even going so far as to deny the doctrine of reprobation, the idea that God has elected some people for damnation.  John Calvin actually addressed this inconsistency with some who hold to his doctrine of predestination and election by saying, \"...many professing a desire to defend the deity from an individual charge admit the doctrine of election, but deny that anyone is reprobated.  This they do ignorantly and childishly, since there could be no election without its opposite,  reprobation.\".  It does seem logically and hermeneutically inconsistent to claim, as Calvinists do, that Jacob was elected for salvation unconditionally before he did anything good or bad, but Esau was not elected for reprobation unconditionally before he did anything good or bad.  God told the Edomites in Deuteronomy 23, 7, You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother.  And God is not a hypocrite.  Could it be that this biblical use of the word hatred should not be taken literally, but idiomatically?  Idioms exist in every language.  They are words or phrases that aren't meant to be taken literally.  For example, if you say someone has cold feet, it doesn't mean their toes are actually cold.  Rather, it means they're nervous about something.  In the same way, the concepts of loving and hating others was understood differently due to the idioms of the first century Greek language.  For example, consider Jesus' teaching in Luke 14, 26, which says, If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, even their own life, such a person cannot be my disciple.  is Jesus telling us to literally hate as in to reject and despise ourselves and all of our loved ones in order to follow him?  clearly?  that is not what Jesus meant when he uses the term hatred in the first century.  otherwise it would fly in the face of other passages where he teaches us to honor our mother and father and to love each other.  so too we must understand the hatred being expressed for Esau in its context, and with its appropriate meaning.  Otherwise, it will contradict other passages that are very clear about the character and goodness of our God.  For instance, 1 John 4.8 says, God is love.  And Psalm 145.9, The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and great in loving kindness.  The Lord is good to all, and His mercies are over all His works.  This biblical truth of God's love is simply undeniable. ",

            "text": "So the biblical use of hatred can simply refer to the choice of one over another for an honorable purpose.  So, for instance, one may choose to follow God and His purpose over that of their parents, and idiomatically, in the first century, that could be described as hating one's parents and following God.  Hatred can also be used in reference to wrath.  For example, in Ephesians 2, when Paul says we were all by nature children of wrath, This could be understood as hatred.  This does not mean, however, that God does not have a desire for all to come out from under his wrath and into his love and provision of grace.  At this point, we should be reminded that Paul in Romans 9 actually references two sets of brothers.  First, Ishmael and Isaac, and then Esau and Jacob.  But this is not the only time the Apostle Paul refers to Ishmael and Isaac with regard to the covenant.  and his promises.  In Galatians 4, beginning in verse 22, Paul says, For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.  His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as a result of divine promise.  These things are being taken figuratively.  The women represent two covenants.  One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves.  This is Hagar.  now hagar stands for mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present city of jerusalem because she is in slavery with her children but the jerusalem that is above is free and she is our mother.  galatians four twenty two to twenty six.

            "text": "Now what is Paul's figurative meaning here in Galatians 4?  It appears that Paul is relating Hagar to slavery, which represents law and works, because Abraham did not wait in faith on the promise of God, but instead strived through the flesh to fulfill the promise through works.  Sarah, on the other hand, represents grace that comes by faith and waiting on the promise of God.  this demonstrates that paul's purpose in romans nine is to set up the dichotomy between faith versus works not monergism versus synergism as the calvinistic reading would entail.  paul himself draws this conclusion in his final words in romans chapter nine.  what shall we say?  the gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have obtained it a righteousness that is by faith.  but the people of israel who pursued the law as a way of righteousness have not attained their goal.

            "text": "because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works.  they stumbled over the stumbling stone.  in other words The people of Israel are doing like Abraham did when he pursued Hagar, through the flesh, rather than having faith and waiting on the promise.  Paul's point is to demonstrate that it is God's sovereign right to establish his covenant with whomever he pleases.  And if he, as our sovereign ruler, decides to establish covenant with people by faith versus works, that is his right to do so, even if it's with barbarian Gentiles rather than Israelites who are direct descendants of Abraham himself.  The second point we would like to establish in this video is whether the expressed love and hatred of God for Jacob and Esau is about salvation or service. ",

            "text": "Most Calvinists believe this passage is primarily about salvation which would mean that Jacob is chosen for salvation reflected by the word love and Esau is chosen for damnation which is represented by the word hate.  Non-Calvinists, on the other hand, typically believe that this is primarily about service, though of course salvation is involved.  After all, no one would be saved if not for what God does through the nation of Israel.  This would mean that Jacob, who represents Israel, is chosen for an honorable use, the purpose of bringing the Messiah and his message to the world.  whereas Esau, the older brother, who represents the Edomites, was chosen for a common purpose.  Paul is actually quoting from Genesis 25 when God tells Rebekah that two nations are in her womb and that the older will serve the younger, which means that Esau and the Edomites will serve the purpose of Jacob and the Israelites because God had elected Jacob and the Israelites to fulfill the promise to bring the Messiah through their seed.  The reference to the two nations being in Rebekah's womb brings us to the next point of contention.  When referencing Jacob and Esau, does Paul have in mind individuals being saved?  Or could he be talking about God's choice of the nation of Israel and the purpose for which he's chosen them?  It might help to know that nations were commonly referred to by their patriarchal head in this day.  We see this in Genesis 36, 43, for example, when it says these were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlement in the land they occupied.  This is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites.  It also must be noted that in Romans 9, verse 12, Paul is quoting from Genesis, the first book of your Old Testament.  And in the very next verse, verse 13, he's quoting from Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament.  There represents 1,500 years between these two verses, which gives us an indication that Paul is probably giving us a before and after picture, not a new doctrine of election.  So, God's expressed hatred for Esau is actually 1,500 years after Esau had already died, and it was in reference to his descendants, the Edomites.  not to Esau individually.  This brings us to the fourth and final point of contention.  Is this hatred for Esau unconditional or conditional?  In other words, is there a good reason for why God has expressed this hatred towards Esau and the Edomites, or is it just mysterious and without known reasons, as would the term unconditional connote?  Let's look at the actual text that Paul quotes from in Malachi chapter 1.  I have loved you, says the Lord, but you ask, how have you loved us?  Was not Esau Jacob's brother, declares the Lord?  Yet, I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into wasteland and left its inheritance to the desert jackals.  Edom may say, Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.  But this is what the Lord Almighty says, They may build, but I will demolish.  They will be called the wicked land, a people always under the wrath of the  Lord.\".  This passage out of Malachi was recorded right after the Edomites had attacked the nation of Israel, God's chosen people.  The prophet Obadiah reflects on this, saying, \"...everyone in Esau's mountain will be cut down in the slaughter because of the violence against your brother Jacob.  You will be covered with shame.  You will be destroyed  forever.\".  Clearly, there's a good reason established for why God expresses His wrath and hatred for the Edomites of this time.  In God's original promise to Abraham, he said, I will make you into a great nation.  I will bless you.  I will make your name great and you will be a blessing.  I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you, I will curse.  And all the peoples on the earth will be blessed through you.  Clearly, God makes a promise that whoever stands against his people will come under his wrath and his curse.  In this context, it seems that hatred is the expression of divine wrath for the Edomites because they cursed Israel by attacking them.  So it's not unconditional.  It is very much conditioned upon the fact that they cursed the people of God.  So why would Paul even bring that up in Romans 9?  Why mention the Edomites at all?  in order to demonstrate what would happen to descendants of abraham who stand against the chosen messengers of god.  the edomites were direct descendants not just of abraham but the oldest son of isaac himself.  yet look what happened to them when they stood in opposition to the people of god.  In Paul's day, it's the Israelites themselves who are standing against the people of God.  And thus, they would too come under the curse or the wrath of God despite who their grandfather is. ",

            "text": "So which of the available interpretations is most likely?  Calvinism, which says that God literally hates most people before they're born for reasons we just don't know?  Or could it be that God has chosen Israel, who has become rebellious, but he is going to accomplish his purpose of redemption despite and sometimes even through their rebellion?  when deciding err on the side of caution which side is that?  the side that defends the character of god his goodness his love his grace his desire to see all saved?  As Dr.  Jerry Walls argues, quote, God cannot fail to be perfectly loving, any more so than he can lie.  You don't have to have children, but if you do, you take on an obligation to love them.  God's freedom was in the freedom to create, or not.  He didn't have to create, but once having created, as a necessarily good and loving being, he cannot but love what he has created.  Love is not an option with God.  And this is not a weakness of God, Walls insists, but his greatest and most self-glorifying strength.  Would you consider it a strength or a weakness that my character would not allow me to punch one of my kids?  That's obviously a strength.  So it is with God.  God's inability to be unloving is not a shortcoming of God's strength and power, but the greatest, most glorifying characteristic of His eternal nature.  To declare God's universal, self-sacrificial love to the entire world reveals God for what makes Him so abundantly glorious, His love.  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.  John 3, 16.
