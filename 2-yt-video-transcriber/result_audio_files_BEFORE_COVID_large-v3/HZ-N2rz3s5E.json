            "text": "Okay, send their arrest for the firearm.  And hopefully you can get the perc walk.  TSA spotted a gun in someone's bag.  It's a female.  It's not registered.  So hopefully we can get the perc walk.  Okay, perc walk.  Here we come.  Here we come with the perk walk.  Getting perk walk folks.  Police.  And I guess the firearms in the bag there.  LHFO, police on the scene.  We got some federal agents over here.  And they're picking her downstairs.  So let me get my ass downstairs.  All right, we're going downstairs.  We'll try to get it.  It's true, and then women try to get the GSA with a fire alarm.  But they're not tricking me.  I don't see the police car around here, but this must be the police car here.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  Okay.  There you go.  I think this is it here.  All right.  We might try to sneak her out.  You know I got the shot already.  I don't see any police cars.  All right.  I believe if we get it on this way, hopefully we can get it.  Let's see.  Let's see.  I don't see them at all.  I believe it's this guy here.  This is the cave vehicle.  I don't see the other ones.  All right.  Let's see.  All right, folks.  I'm not sure which way they're taking her out.  Oh, no, it's not this car.  Stop, you guys fucked up.  These are memories.  Not that car.  Not that car, people.  Here we go.  Third block.  Return time is for immediate loading and unloading only.  There's no parking, waiting, or stopping until your passenger is on the first side and ready to load.  Violators may be sighted and loaded.  Consider using these options.  Locking any of our instructions is free.  There's a firearm in the bag.  Or use the cell phone waiting block on the northwest corner of 97 for your cooperation.  We at IAS hope you have an acceptable experience.  Put it in the cage vehicle.  Put the firearms in that bag.  To the other side.  Can you go to the other side?  All right.  Can you go?  There's Barham.  Yeah, but I've noticed, though, when they closed down a spot, like the other day we had a bomb threat here, and I wasn't allowed in the terminal, so every opportunity the cops get here, they'll let me know, well, you don't belong here.  In public, they can't do anything.  I am shooting from a distance.  And he's tuned in.  The woman tried to bring a firearm in the TSA.  And they have all this equipment now.  They can spot guns quick.  They ran the serial numbers.  And they came back to nobody.  So that's... This is going to be a wrap.  LXF police on the scene.  So yeah.  We got the first walk.  And... She might get out the same day, though, but depending upon the gun.  The gun is unregistered.  These cops are pretty cool, though.  They tried to hide the woman from the camera.  If they get a celebrity, these cops, they will definitely try to sneak the celebrity out through another door.  Yeah, one female in custody.  Put the fire on.  Here's the sergeant who should approve the arrest.  Please.  All right, so that's a wrap.  And if you do have a firearm, folks, and it's legal, always check it in with your airlines.  Because if you don't and you just try to forget the TSA, they're going to pinch you for it.  All right, this is LAX Airport Police on the scene.  And Tony Vera signing off.  Talk to you guys later.
