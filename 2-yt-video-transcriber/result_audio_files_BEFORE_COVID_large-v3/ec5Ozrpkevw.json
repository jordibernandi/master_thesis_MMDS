            "text": "I come in love.  I have been sent by our Father.  Why are you awed by my presence?  Our Father speaks with you and you are not awed.  Perhaps it would be better if you called me grandfather.  But I am not grandfather.  I am simply your brother.  And I see the confusion.  I see the frustrations as you try to consciously sort out the direction.  And my dear brother and sister, it is not for you to try to calculate and navigate my shift.  I am the captain, and it is my ship.  You must only keep your feet planted solidly, grounded in that which is Mother Earth, And I will see to the course.  You little ones trouble your minds with trivia things.  You are beloved of me.  And you are beloved of our father.  And it is all right that you question.  For my heart knows how you feel.  But remember that I hold your hand.  And I am come to bring you that peace for which you long.

That is not to make you humble and become useless.  That knowledge is to make you strong and to be useful.  I hold your hands tightly, for you are my earthly hands.  And I use them carefully and wisely.  But you have control over your earthly mind.  And it is for that I would give you peace.  Do not be so concerned with those of the daily occurrences, for those tribulations shall pass.  I am not of a mind to allow my ones to fail.  Nor will you fall as you stand upon the rock which I am.  And I do not take my leave of you For I am always of you.  I simply am your brother.  I am... Sananda. ",
