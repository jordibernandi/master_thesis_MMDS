So the song is about the Bible.  We are the children of God.  We are the people of God.  And the greatest curse we have is not realizing it.  You will never get out of your condition without first having knowledge of self.  And understanding how we got in this condition concerning our God.  Only the most high God can allow these nations to do what they've done to us.  Who took our courage?  Who took our power?  Who allowed these nations to enslave us?  Yeah, I know they're game and they get so suspicious.  And if you're not trained, you won't know the difference.

It'll never seem right.  Cause we was never home.  It's when everything's right.  Yeah.  I know that game and it gets so suspicious.  Yeah.  And if you're not trained, you won't know the difference.  Yeah.  Acting in secret on a global mission and all this against the children who don't know they in it.  It'll never seem right.  Cause we was never home.  It's when everything's right.  Ain't gonna tell us wrong.  We in need of a spiritual intervention.  You know a man can't get us in this condition.  Being honest with you.  The logic hits you, then you find an issue.  The only one with the law.  deal with this kind of issue.  Madness ain't it, but it ain't fabricated.  My people are glad he gave it.  My people are gladiators.  Your people don't have to say it.  My people are woke.  And we have to make it.  My people are close.  You know how it is.  Too much illusion.  A whole school of confusion.  They got my people in shackles with all the glue that they losing.  They got them moving and fusing what they call beautiful music.  And at the end of the day, we only see who that they choose.
