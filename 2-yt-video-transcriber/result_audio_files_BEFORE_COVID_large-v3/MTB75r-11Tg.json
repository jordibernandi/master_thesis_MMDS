            "text": "Hello, and welcome to my channel!  Viced Rhino here.  Today in my third installment of the Rhino Rant series, I will be talking about religious persecution, or rather the lack thereof.  So let's go!  For the record, when I speak about Christians in this video, I am referring to Christians in North America, with the United States in particular.  And even then, I know you can't just lump everybody into one group.  There are Christians as conservative as hardcore fundamentalist young earth creationist Christians, and as liberal as Unitarian Universalist Christians, and everything in between.  And even within these groups, I would go so far as to say that there are some Christians who would identify with the hardcore fundamentalist Young Earth Creationists who might be liberal, politically speaking, and some Unitarian Universalist ones who are conservative.  Though if I were a betting man, my money would be on conservative UU membership being higher than that of liberal YEC.  But I know some exist for the simple reason that I was one for a bit.  Now, disclaimers about arbitrary groupings aside, the type of Christian I am talking about here is the one who thinks that the world is out to get them.  The one who takes the Bible verse about it being the church versus the world extremely seriously.  The one who knows that most Christians are lukewarm Christians who are on the side of the world.  The one who sits in the pews agreeing with the vehement servant about lukewarm Christians looking around at the other members of the congregation also agreeing, and knowing that most of them are faking it.  Because the world is out to get the Christians, and you can't even trust the other Christians to be, True Christians.  This is how you end up with a religious group that feels persecuted, even though 75% of the population of the United States identify as members of that group, and are represented by a House of Congress that is typically around 90% Christian, and this time around the number fell drastically to 88%.  Okay, I guess that's not really that drastic.  But 75% of the population have 88% of the representation by religious affiliation.  The vice president is an evangelical Christian, and the president at least pays lip service to being Christian himself.  Though I can understand perfectly well why Christians would think Trump is one of those lukewarm Christians or of-the-world kind of Christians.  But still, he has an evangelical advisory board, a group of people whose job it is to advise him on how to appeal to evangelical Christians.  And in my experience, it's the evangelicals who are the loudest about being persecuted.  The people who have an advisory board for the president of the United States and who claim the vice president as a member are persecuted.  I thought persecution was when a group of people were treated poorly based on religious views, not given special privilege.  Can you imagine the outcry if any president had set up a Muslim advisory board?  We, and by we here I do not mean atheists, I mean anyone who is in favor of the separation of church and state, constantly have to fight with Christians when it comes to them trying to impose their views on others.  The classic case is when a town's courthouse decides to erect a Ten Commandments monument and they usually have to be sued in order to take it down.  Though personally I do always enjoy it when the response to the lawsuit is that they aren't sponsoring a specific religion.  Any religion is welcome to erect a monument.  Which then leads to the Satanic Temple erecting a Baphomet statue.  My point is that in the United States in particular, Christianity has a very privileged position where anyone who isn't Christian has to be constantly on the lookout for encroachments on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Businesses run by Christians take it for granted that they can refuse service to homosexuals because their holy book says it's yucky.  In fact, businesses can just slap some basic Christian symbolism into their logo, and thereby set a good chunk of the population's minds at ease that they must be dealing with an honest businessman because they're Christian.  Christians would never use dishonest business tactics.  Yet somehow, these same people that enjoy this privileged and protected status cry persecution anytime.  anyone from another group so much as suggests that maybe having a Christian monument on government property could suggest to people who aren't Christian that the government is favoring Christianity over their religion or lack of religion.  How dare a baker who is in business for the sole purpose of baking things be forced to bake something for a homosexual customer?  And if you don't see a problem with that statement, then replace the word homosexual with black.  If you still don't see a problem with that statement, then that's something I could make a whole rant video on just by itself.  Suffice it to say that while business owners do have the right to refuse service under certain circumstances, sexual orientation or race is not and never should be one of those circumstances.  Now, of course, I have been speaking up to this point to the persecution, or lack thereof, of American Christians.  But Rhino, you say, aren't you Canadian?  Yes.  Yes, I am.  So let me talk about the Canadian situation.  First, a brief history lesson.  The US was founded largely on the idea of freedom from religious persecution, with the Puritans fleeing persecution in England in the early 1600s, and then immediately setting up their own persecution of non-Puritans, as is wont to happen with religions.  But the American Founding Fathers were able to learn from this history lesson that when you let a religious group have political power, it almost automatically results in the persecution of people that don't belong to that group.  Hence, separation of church and state.  Now, in Canada's early history, it was separated into two regions, Upper Canada and Lower Canada, with Upper Canada being at the bottom of the map and Lower Canada being at the top, because that's intuitive.  The French controlled Lower Canada and the English controlled Upper Canada.  Upper Canada was under the dominion of the Church of England, and Lower Canada was controlled by the Catholic Church.  When England took control of Lower Canada from the French, they were quite generous.  They enacted into law the allowance for Catholics to practice Catholicism, and I quote, \"...as far as the laws of Great Britain permit,\" which is to say, as controlled by the Church of England.  Canada itself, to this day, has the Queen or King of England as its official monarch, and has a national anthem which contains a prayer to the Christian God.  Actually, fun fact, I was once told proudly at the Christian high school I attended that Canada was the only country in the world with a prayer as its national anthem.  Which is laughably wrong if you do enough basic research to find out that the national anthem of the UK is literally nothing but a prayer for the current reigning monarch's health and success.  But I digress.  All this to say that in Canada, there is actually no guaranteed separation of church and state.  Yet somehow, through all these official government churches and whatnot?  being involved in our early history, we still ended up with a rather secular culture.  And I do want to make it clear that freedom of religion is explicitly protected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but there is nothing in Canadian law guaranteeing that the government will not endorse any particular religion.  In fact, the Catholic school system in Canada is funded by tax dollars.  You get to choose which school board your taxes go to, public or Catholic, but the fact remains that explicitly religious schools are funded by the government here in Canada.  Now that I've laid the groundwork, I will tell you what originally made me think to make this rant.  I recently applied for a loan.  So recently, in fact, that as of this recording, I still haven't signed the final paperwork.  But of course, as with any loan, they need to know where my money comes from.  Since YouTube is a decent part of my income, it gets listed.  And as any of my fellow YouTube creators can attest to, as soon as you tell someone that you have a channel, they immediately want to know what's on your channel, which is normally a nice little opportunity for self-promotion.  But there's one problem here.  My channel deals with topics that some Christians will definitely not be happy about, and the person we were applying for the loan with had some very overly Christian books on his desk.  I am in no way suggesting that this person would have done anything differently had he known the details of my channel, but the fact remains, I don't know what kind of Christian this person is.  Finding out that I'm an atheist activist could possibly have caused him to even subconsciously just not work as hard on our behalf as he otherwise would have.  Worst case scenario, it could be that he might just tell us we were denied without even sending the paperwork through.  And to be clear, I don't think he actually would have done anything like this, but the thought crossed my mind because I have heard stories of this kind of discrimination against atheists quite frequently.  Now, even more recently than my meeting with him, I met with my life insurance agent.  She had a decorative picture thing on her wall that was quoting one of the Psalms.  Again, she needed to know my income sources.  And again, I didn't feel comfortable discussing the contents of my channel when she inevitably asked.  And again, I will point out that I don't think she would have done anything differently had she known.  But this speaks to the problem with the Christian persecution narrative.  These two professionals didn't see any problem with displaying overtly Christian items in their offices where they meet with their clients.  They probably didn't even think anything of it.  Or if they did, then it would have been along the lines of if a fellow Christian would notice, it would increase their chances of doing business with them.  And since even in Canada, where the word atheist doesn't have quite the same stigma as in the States, the majority of the population are Christian, they were probably right in those thoughts.  And since neither of them work for the government, then even in the states, where separation of church and state is backed up by the law, they would still be permitted their religious-themed decorations.  But now picture the opposite scenario.  Picture a nice Christian couple going in to apply for a loan, and on the loan officer's desk sits a copy of God Is Not Great, How Religion Poisons Everything by Christopher Hitchens.  If they were polite, they might sit through the meeting and then just not follow through with applying for the loan.  But if they were impolite, then there's a good chance there would be a few.  How Dare Yous thrown around at the sight of a book with such an obviously anti-religious title.  So now I ask you, who is the persecuted group?  The ones who don't need to give it a second thought when decorating their office with religious iconography?  Or the ones who have to be careful to avoid letting anyone that they are attempting to do business with know what their religious beliefs really are?  Now please note, I am in no way suggesting that anyone should be punished for having religious themed books or decorations in their office.  That's their right and I respect that.  I'm simply pointing out that the group that is most vocal about being persecuted happens to be the group that doesn't need to worry about any backlash whatsoever should they decorate their place of business with stuff that reflects their supposedly persecuted religion.  Now, I have been on both sides of this.  I used to be a rather vocal creationist.  I would talk to people at work about it all the time.  Now that I'm on the other side, I recognize that I was not so much talking to them as annoying them while they politely listened.  I fully bought into the persecution narrative that the world would be against me anyway, so if anyone wasn't entirely happy with me expressing my views, that was simply vindication that I was doing the right thing.  But in retrospect, I realized that most of the people I was talking to were at least culturally Christian, so while they didn't necessarily agree with my creationist views, they were at least not judging me based on the fact that I was a Christian.  So I could go around preaching at people willy-nilly without fear of any repercussions, all while believing that I was a member of a persecuted group.  Meanwhile, as an atheist, I can't just go around advertising the fact that I'm an atheist to just anyone.  While there won't be any legal or job-related repercussions, there are definite social consequences, even here in secular Canada.  But I'm actually not terribly bothered by what I have to deal with here in Canada, because I get messages all the time from people in the US, usually in the South, who watch YouTube atheism videos specifically because they feel like they are alone in their atheism.  Everywhere they go, they are bombarded with Christian symbolism, Christian language, Christian expectations.  And should anyone find out that they were an atheist, they will lose social status, friends, sometimes even jobs or homes.  Wondering if the lone guy will treat me a little bit differently if he knows doesn't even qualify as an annoyance when compared to potentially being kicked out of your own home.  And the Christians who are most likely to react negatively to finding out that someone is an atheist are also the ones who are most likely to believe wholeheartedly that they are the group that is being persecuted because those damned atheists won't let them force a religion on everyone else.  Well, let me first just point out that it's not just those damned atheists.  There are Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and others who all agree that religion has no place in governance because they recognize that as soon as you allow religion into the government, that's when the real persecution will begin.  Secular is not a synonym for atheists.  The ACLU is not an atheist organization.  But even so, atheists are not something that religious people need to fear.  We just want to be left alone to not worship any god and to not have other people's gods shoved in our face by the government at every turn.  We don't want to make atheism the official government position.  We just want to hold the government to its promise not to make any law respecting an establishment of religion.  So please, before you shout persecution, put yourself in the other person's shoes and ask yourself who is really being mistreated because of their beliefs or lack thereof. ",
