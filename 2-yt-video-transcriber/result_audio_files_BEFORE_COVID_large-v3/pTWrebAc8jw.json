            "text": "If you are thin, you have a certain privilege.  Interesting statement.  Could I respond to you, lady, saying that you have overweight privilege because you are able to eat anything you want at any time?  Could I say that you have a foot privilege because your feet fit into shoes or do not fit into shoes that are the normal size?  Or my feet are smaller than yours, therefore you have foot privilege?  To make my case even further, look.  Look at my hair right now, look.  this is a receding hairline right here.  okay it runs genetically in my family.  uh you can see this hair.  look at look at look at that.  look at how far look how big my forehead is.  guys Do I have hair privilege because I'm not fully bald yet?  Does that exist, receding hair privilege over other people who have not had their hair completely fade out?  A real example of privilege would be, for example, the fact that we in the USA are able to consume and have an abundance amount of resources and food, whereas in other countries around the world, such as South Africa, the middle of Africa, the continent of Africa, People don't.  They don't have clean water.  They don't have food.  In that regard, yes, we do have privilege, and the word privilege can be applied in ways that are actually accurate and contextually make sense.  This idea that everybody has privilege in their own way because of their shoes that they wear, the size of their overweightness, or the thinness of how they are is just preposterous.  You can't take this word that actually means something that does exist and then equally apply it to small little intricate things that at the end of the day really shouldn't matter, like my receding hairline.  I guess I have privilege over the fact that there are a lot of other people who are bald, right?  The reason I'm using these examples is just to point out how ridiculous this has become.  It's not to deny that privilege does not exist, because in certain instances it does, but it needs to be applied where it exists.  not where it does not.  Do you not realize that whether you're thin or overweight, there are a lot of mean people who make you feel like you don't deserve to be on this earth?  It has nothing to do with whether you're being overweight or you're being thin.  If you go to a public school or you're a little bit socially awkward, You could be treated really poorly by your fellow students to the point of where you don't feel like you belong on this earth.  Yeah, maybe some people will go after somebody's weight.  People will also go after people being too thin.  There's this crazy stigma about body image and how you should be, how you should look all the time, whether you're thin or overweight.  But the fact of the matter is that I make you... Upset.  I'd make you feel like a burden.  I give you anxiety.  I make you Lady, I make you feel uncomfortable simply by me being me by me being thin.  What me just being me makes you feel uncomfortable?  There's nothing I can do about that and I'm not gonna acknowledge this non-existent idea that you want to place all personal responsibility that you put yourself into to you to get to a certain lifestyle and body weight and you try to project your issues onto other people around you.  That's not cool.  I don't like that.  I don't want to be told by you that I'm making you feel uncomfortable just by being me because you choose a lifestyle choice of consuming certain things and foods that contribute to you being a heavier set person.  And if you are heavier set, there's nothing wrong with inherently you being heavier set, except the medical disadvantages that are going to become an issue with your weight.  And here's the thing, you have somebody who is 5'1\", there is a designated weight for somebody with that height.  you can have somebody who is seven foot in a woman who's seven feet in height and there is a a body weight that fits that height based upon your height.  there are disadvantages disadvantages to you based upon your weight and your height and If you choose to go above what your recommended body metabolism for your height should be, and there's medical disadvantages, if you go below what your body should be, how many calories and your normal body weight, overweight, underweight, they're going to both cause problems to you physically down the line.

A personal life example of myself is when I was on an airplane.  And look, I am really not that judgmental when it comes to people's weight, but I am a bit judgmental when people violate my personal space.  And by personal space, I don't mean just sitting next to me.  I'm talking about I was on a flight and I was in the middle seat and I had a person on my left and I had a person on my right and the person on my right next to the window was somebody who was overweight.  And at the end of the day, when it comes down to it, I don't care if somebody's overweight.  But if they're overweight to the point where I literally, as a thin person who's 155 pounds and sitting in between, and I have no armrest, the armrest is literally consumed by this person because they're so wide and they're extremely overweight that their arm is literally popping over the armrest and touching me.  So literally, I have no room.  I'm literally sitting like this, you know, in between a person and another person on my right, and I'm having to lean to my left and violate this other person's space because, you know, the seat, there's not enough room because the person sitting on my right is significantly overweight, and they're touching me, and I don't want to be touched.  I don't want to be touched by somebody.  It's a seat for a reason.  There's an arm rest for a reason to separate, you know, the normal most people's weight and people who fall into the seat size.  Typically, it's for certain heights and certain weights up to a certain point.  But there's a point where it's too much.  I'm not going to apologize for trying to get comfortable in a seat in which somebody who should be reserving two seats on the airplane is touching me and violating my personal space.  That's what it boils down to.  I don't care if somebody's overweight just sitting next to me.  But if they're overweight to the point where they're touching me and violating my personal space, yeah, I'm going to try to squirm and not feel violated by somebody touching me that I don't want touching me.  And if it's really that big a deal, don't use public transport.  If it makes you that uncomfortable and that upset traveling because of your size on public transport, don't go and find a car.  Get a car for yourself.  But then I guess if somebody has a car and you don't, they have car privilege now, don't they? ",

That's fine.  I'm not judging you for the size that you want to be.  But you not feeling comfortable in clothes and Trying to project us being comfortable in our clothes because we fit in our clothes and there are sizes for our clothes.  And you choose not to be a weight that your body for your height is determined to be.  You choose to go above your body weight of 170 pounds based upon you being, you know, a 5 foot 12 girl, and you wanna be 300 pounds?  It's not my fault that you don't fit into things.  And I'm not gonna judge you for that, but you're the one who's now judging me for being able to shop in a way that you want to be able to shop, but you can't.  Like, what?  That doesn't even make sense to me.  Whatever happened to personal accountability and responsibility to your own health.  What you do to your own health, whether it be bad or healthy or not healthy, that doesn't reflect upon me who makes healthy choices.  It's like you put yourself in this position where you got to this certain weight, you seem to be unhappy with yourself, but you're pointing your finger around at everybody else saying that you're the problem.  You're the problem.  This is why I'm this way.  You're the problem.  And that doesn't work, okay?  Stop trying to... put everybody else as a problem, and focus on yourself, lady. ",

I have scars on my arms.  And I used to be really, you know, self-conscious about going in public when some people would stare at my arm because it would be very noticeable back when I was younger.  And there were people who used to make comments on them, but now it's gotten to the point where it doesn't bother me anymore.  I grew really, really thick skin, and if people want to stare at my arm, they're more than welcome to.  But that's not going to stop me from going outside and going to a restaurant and getting a burger because I have scars on my arms because I'm worried somebody's going to stare at me.  People are going to stare no matter what you are, what you wear, what you do, what you say.  It's like... You expect to go out in public and never have somebody look at you, never have somebody stare with you, never have somebody judge you.  That's just not reality.  And there's really no way to not, to stop that from not happening.  If you were super, super thin and you were like this, a beautiful model or something, you'd get stares too.  It's just how it is.
