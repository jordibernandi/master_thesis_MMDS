            "text": "There are two profound scriptures that use the Greek word ekbalo.  The word ekbalo is really an intensive word for sin.  It is more of a thrusting forth, a violent kind of word.  It says in the book of Mark that Jesus was ekbaloed into the desert to fast.  The Spirit drove him into the wilderness.  People think about Jesus fasting in the wilderness like, oh, I hope.  in his weakness he doesn't sin, he doesn't fall under the temptation of the devil.  Well, in fact, it was the fast that gave him strength in his weakness.  God gave power to overcome Satan.  So the spirit was driving Jesus into the wilderness to overcome Satan.  He was Iqbaloed.  But there's another place that talks about the word Iqbaloed.  It is a Greek word that Jesus uses.  It's the one dynamic commanding prayer that Jesus gives to his disciples.  Let me comment on help us like sheep without a shepherd.  His heart was shattered to pieces.  I wonder if he saw the millions of Buddhists, the millions of Hindus and Muslims in the age to come, shattered to pieces looking at the limitation of his own carnation.  I think he came out of that vision broken to pieces, burning with fire.  He gathered his disciples and he says to them, the harvest truly is plentiful, but the labors are few.  Therefore, pray the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest field.  Listen, we almost use that scripture like a suggestion.  Who really prays it?  But it's not the Greek words that Jesus uses.  The word for pray is actually didomai.  It is an intensive command.  It is more like this.  It is not the word for pray.  It is the word for beg.  It is more like this.  I command you to beg me.  if the church simply got a hold of Jesus' passion in that scripture, they would be praying day and night, commanding God to follow laborers into the harvest field.  It's the Greek word.  from this point on.  For these 40 days, we are praying, Lord of the harvest, we beg you, hurl forth laborers into the inner cities, into the high schools, colleges, into the universities, into the unreached people groups.  I command you to beg me.  It's a command.  Secondly, he didn't use the word send.  He used the word ekbalo.  It's the same word Jesus uses when he says, if I, by the finger of God, drive out demons or ekbalo demons.  When Jesus drives out ekbalo's demons, demons got to go.  When Jesus ekbalo's laborers, laborers have got to go.  Jesus is saying, this is my command.  And I believe over these 40 days praying this prayer, we will shift history because the Lord will send hurl forth laborers into the harvest field.  Let's pray the Lord of the harvest to follow laborers. ",
