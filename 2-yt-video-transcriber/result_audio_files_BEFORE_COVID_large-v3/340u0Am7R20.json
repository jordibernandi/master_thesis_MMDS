            "text": "I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message.  And when someone like myself has gone through domestic violence, been physically and mentally broken down, and then one day you read in the newspaper that a senator that you don't even know is fighting for a bill to be passed to help women like myself.  to keep us safe and to provide transitional housing because I was homeless due to domestic violence.  Joe Biden became my hero that day because he didn't even know me and he was fighting for me and my son, my daughter, even though he didn't know it.  He means so much to me because of that.  I really believe in Joe Biden and I hope he makes it to the White House.  I don't hope because I know he's going to make it to the White House because he's an amazing person. ",
