That's what the First Amendment is about.  And you see on the show that we got a batting average with Andrew Yang, and he's not batting 1,000 with us, all right?  We agree with some things, disagree with others, but we love covering all of his policy proposals.  But at the end of the day, we will fight to the death for his free speech and his ability to debate in a liberal and open forum.  And the DNC and NBC appear to be compromising this.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, okay?  But after seeing what happened to Bernie Sanders, you need to be running such a tight ship that you look unimpeachable.  unimpeachable or else people are going to think, oh, they're doing to Andrew Yang exactly what they did to Bernie Sanders.  Here's the populist figure instead of the mainstream crony figure in the party.  And they're going to railroad the populist so that Hillary Clinton can be the nominee.  They're going to railroad Andrew Yang, the populist, so that Joe Biden can be the nominee.

They're giving her more time than all the other candidates combined, and they aren't giving any time to Tulsi at all.  Her sister said that.
