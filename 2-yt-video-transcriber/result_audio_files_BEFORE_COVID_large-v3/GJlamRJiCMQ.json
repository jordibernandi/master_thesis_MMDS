            "text": "It is a biblical mandate to speak the truth, for a preacher to preach the word in season, out of season, which means all the time.  The word sometimes comforts, the word instructs, but the word also confronts and convicts and exposes.  So while you're speaking those things that are gonna encourage people to make them feel good, you're at the same time going to be speaking to people things that are very offensive.  In fact, I've said this before, my job is at some point to offend everyone because when you confront people with God's standard and the reality that they fall short of that standard, There's a fence in that.  That is the nature of proclaiming the truth of God.  And that is why in the New Testament, Paul in 1 Corinthians 16 says, act like men.  What does he mean?  Be strong men.  and courageous.  If you are going to speak the truth that you know is going to offend, it takes a measure of courage.  Now, that courage is not some kind of psychological, emotional courage.  It really comes from something else, and it's this.  It comes from absolute confidence in two things.  One, the authority of the Word of God.  The only way you can speak courageously is when you know you are speaking divine truth.  So that courage really is drawn from one's view of scripture.  Secondly, It is based on the sovereign purpose of God.  When you realize that it's not your job to change men's views, it's not your job to change men's hearts, that's the work of God.  Your job is to proclaim the truth.  That produces courage.  So again, just summarizing, When you believe that every word of Scripture comes from God and is authoritative and true, and you believe that God is the one, sovereignly, powerfully, who uses that truth to change people's lives, that produces courage.  The courage of confidence in Scripture and the courage that God will work through that.  You speak that truth with courage and with love and leave the results to the Lord. ",
