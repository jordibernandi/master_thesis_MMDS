It's against the law.  It's against the law.  What's your name and badge number?  You don't have a name and badge number?  And you're jaywalking.  Do you know that?  Do you not care about the law, ma'am?  Don't cross the road right there.  He just told me, don't cross the road right there.  Sorry?  I need you to come over here and identify yourself with your ID, please.  Am I being detained?  You are going to be detained, yes.  Okay.  What law have I broken?  You crossed a roadway where it's not a crosswalk.  Then you can arrest me and take me downtown.  It's a traffic citation.  I need to see your driver's license.  I'm not giving you an ID.  I'm not going to give you an ID, and you can take me downtown.  I need you to place your hands behind your back for me.  All right.  You're violating the parking laws and you're jaywalking.  What's your name and badge number?  You're required under your general manual to give me your name and badge number when requested.  I will follow you everywhere you go in this courthouse until I get your name and badge number.  Name and badge number, then I leave you alone.  You need to follow the laws, you need to follow the rules.  Why can't you follow the laws, man?  Why can't you follow your own rules?  Do you guys know who she is?  She's jaywalking.  She's ignoring the traffic laws.  And now she's running.  Why don't you wait for me to go through security and I will.  I don't think you're going to wait for me to go through security, are you, coward?  So anyway, yeah, so she shows me that sign.  And then she jaywalks.  She walks across the street instead of using the crosswalk that's over here.  She jaywalks across the street.  Then she refuses to give her name and badge number.  And in San Antonio, Texas, their general manual requires them to give their, and I quote, name and badge number in a professional or courteous manner.  And, you know, she didn't do that.  And then she waddled away from me.  I would say run, but no, she's a little heavyset.  She waddles away from me.  Hey, there you are.  Do you give me your name and badge number?  Yes, Garcia, 2305.  2305?  Yes.  Okay, thank you.  Do you know that it's illegal to park here?  She doesn't want to talk, guys.  She doesn't want to talk.  Here she goes. ",
