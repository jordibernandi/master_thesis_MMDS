            "text": "more and more information keeps coming to light.  that exposes what an absolute fraud these german and french ngo rescue ships are.  last june the already notorious sea watch three purposefully rammed an italian coast guard ship after a seventeen day stand-off.  The ship is currently impounded.  The captain, Carola Ricetta, faces serious criminal charges.  However, a left-wing activist Italian judge almost immediately released her from a type of house arrest.  Ricetta was illegally ferrying dozens of economic migrants from the coast of Libya to Europe.  All of the passengers were from East African nations and they most likely paid large sums of money to be smuggled into a war zone around Tripoli.  Rocchetta says she had no choice but to violently defy the Italian Coast Guard because the health of the migrants was deteriorating and many had become suicidal.  In fact, she claims the migrants had been held in a concentration camp in Libya and were already in poor health when she took custody of them.  In reality, the passengers had been evaluated multiple times by third parties, and any small children or allegedly sick people had already been removed from the ship.  It turns out we have extensive video filmed during the 17-day standoff.  One of the crew members of the Sea Watch 3 is a rapper and breakdancer who goes by the pseudonym Too Nasty.  Too Nasty uses the economic migrants as props for his rap videos.  Here he is bragging about being in the New York Times.  He says he is about to drop a new single featuring video from the standoff.  He already posted some rough video clips of the June standoff on his Instagram account.  Do these look like emaciated, suicidal war refugees?  It looks like a bunch of strong, healthy, well-fed athletes to me.  His own videos expose what a hoax the German-based NGO Sea-Watch really is.  Where are the starving children?  Where are all the women?  Why don't any of the Libyan war refugees look like Libyans?  As best as I can tell, too nasty is an American citizen named Chad.  Major German politicians are defending Sea Watch and endorsing the disproved narrative that war refugees are being rescued at sea.  At the same time, these politicians are hyping Russian collusion conspiracy theories against Salvini and his Italian Lego party.  Meanwhile, it has been revealed that two people from the German taxpayer-funded show Panorama were on board the Sea-Watch 3 during the standoff.  This is direct collusion between the German government and an NGO to commit international crimes and agitate against the Italian government.  Now, it even seems that German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has fully turned on Matteo Salvini.  He is demanding that Salvini reopen Italian ports to economic migrants.  In previous videos, I have said favorable things about Seehofer.  At one time, he was trying to rein in Merkel.  As recently as a few months ago, German left-wing think tanks were still calling him a right-wing extremist and claiming the entire Bavarian Christian Social Union was a borderline right-wing extremist party.  However, Seehofer seems to be getting worse and worse by the day.  The agitation against Italy is intense.  Even now, there are at least two ships circling Italian territorial waters trying to traffic more East Africans.  There is a ship owned by the German-based CI carrying economic migrants from Cameroon and Ivory Coast.  Another ship owned by the Spanish NGO Proactive Open Arms is also carrying an assortment of people of various African origin.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.
