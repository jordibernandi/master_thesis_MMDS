            "text": "A shark investigator attended the Beyond Barriers Benefit Rodeo in Taylorsville, North Carolina on April 19-20, 2019.  The Beyond Barriers Benefit Rodeo is sanctioned by the International Pro-Rodeo Association.  The IPRA claims to have humane rules, but rodeos like Beyond Barriers prove they are little more than propaganda.  Our investigator documented a number of instances of animal cruelty during the rodeo.  The most heinous example occurred during an event known as Wild Cow Milking.  The event is exactly what it sounds like, except the cows aren't wild, just terrified.  In the chaos, cows can easily be injured, which is exactly what happened at the Beyond Barriers Rodeo.  One cow is taken down but can't seem to get up.  She has to be helped up and walked out of the arena by rodeo workers.  Another cow goes down, but doesn't get back up.  She remains on the ground while an announcer is brought in to auction off a rifle, a tactic meant to distract rodeo attendees from the cruelty right in front of their faces.  Finally, the injured cow is rolled over onto a piece of fence and is dragged away.  At one point, she slips off the fence and has to be rolled onto it again before finally being removed from the arena.  Shark also witnessed at least one horse being shocked at the rodeo.  Rodeo thugs use the pain of the prod to force animals to perform, to run or buck against their nature and beyond their natural abilities.  This can result in injury and even death for the victims.  The use of electric prods during rodeos goes against the wishes of the manufacturer.  Spokespeople for prod producer Miller Manufacturing Company Inc.  have openly stated, we don't condone the use of this on horses, and not in rodeos.  Please do not attend rodeos, especially ones like the Beyond Barriers Benefit Rodeo.  that helps people only at the expense of the animals forced to participate.  Thank you for watching.
