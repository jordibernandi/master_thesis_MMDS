Hey, so that thing you just said, is it an admission on your part that the British Empire and its former colonies are not a historical litany of white supremacy?

So anyone who goes around saying all white nations are racist or all white people are racist, then they're not acknowledging the important difference between Nazis and, for instance, the British.  And they will have you to answer to.  Is that right?  Extra credit.  Are you going to have a back and forth about this with the charming folks at BLM?  I'd love to see that little tete-a-tete.

Only one side was blatantly racist, but every side in just about every war has been blatantly sexist.  Yeah, in that particular direction.

Although, I suppose there is a moral lesson to be learned here, and it's that old saying that goes, walk a mile in someone else's shoes.  Be it your friend or your enemy, you would do well to know them.  And whether your intentions are compassionate or murderous, it is a helpful exercise in moral orientation to try and see the world through someone else's eyes.  I'm screaming into the well again, aren't I?  What am I talking about?  We don't need to understand people.  We just need to erase them from history along with everything else vaguely controversial.  Don't make fun of anything.  That way nothing will be normalized.  You, sir, are a jelly baby.  One of the crappy yellow ones that no one likes. ",
