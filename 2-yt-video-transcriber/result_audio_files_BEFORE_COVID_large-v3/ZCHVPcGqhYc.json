            "text": "What is the rapture?  Why is there a rapture?  And when is the rapture?  Again what exactly is the rapture?  Why is there a rapture?  And when is the rapture?  You might be surprised to know that more than half of Americans out there believe there will be a rapture of the church.  Newsweek did a poll that revealed 55 percent of Americans believe the faithful will be taken up to heaven in the rapture.  So what exactly is this event?  Mark Hitchcock in his book Could the Rapture Happen?  Today gave I think an excellent definition of the event.  Let me read his definition.  Quote, The rapture of the church is that future event when Jesus Christ will descend from heaven to resurrect the bodies of departed believers and to transform and translate the bodies of living believers immediately into His glorious presence in a moment of time and then escort them to live in heaven with Him forever.  It is a good definition.  Let me summarize that and simplify it.  The rapture is when Christ descends from heaven, calls all of those who have already died in the Lord to heaven with Him in new resurrected bodies and then we join them in the air for this great time of reunion.  Now the critics of the rapture would say, you will not find the teaching of the rapture in the Bible.  You won't even find the word rapture in the Bible.  Well I want to refute that right now because I think that is completely wrong.  As to the use of the word rapture in the Bible well I could also add that you don't find the word Trinity in the Bible.  Nor do you find the word Bible in the Bible.  Now that doesn't make them any less true.  These are just words that we use to describe something that is true.  The triune nature of God.  The Scripture that we call the Bible.  The fact of the matter is is the word that is used for rapture is the Greek word harpazo.  Harpazo.  And the Latin translation of harpazo is rapturus which is the English word rapture.  So it is the popular word for the event used in the Bible known as the harpazo.  What is the harpazo?  A literal definition means to take forcibly, to snatch, or to be caught up.  This is the word that is used by Paul in 1 Thessalonians 4.16-18.  He says, The Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trumpet of God.  The dead in Christ will rise first.  Those who are alive and remaining will be caught up.  Greek word harpazo.  Together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.  And thus we will always be with the Lord.  So that is what the rapture is.  It is being caught up.  Snatched away.  Taken by force. ",
