            "text": "Being a victim and you're trying to do something constructive.  in a world that's non-constructive, loneliness goes with the territory.  in answer to your question.  And what you do?  to keep from being lonely as much as you possibly can, you interact with other people, but you interact with other people based on just simply being there or observing.  And that's it.  See, what do you mean by interacting with other people?  What's the antidote for the poison of loneliness?  The antidote is you do something interesting.  And you do something that is constructive.  And always think about doing as many things as you possibly can that you can do alone.  But If you're doing something constructive, say, anything constructive, just try to find something constructive to do.  That's the formula.  That's the code.  Stay in a constructive mode, and you will find that you will attract people.  It might take a little time.  You might have to be lonely for a while.  There's a scene in another movie that's supposed to be on my movie list that I keep saying that I'm going to get it out, and nobody's The people that I'm trying to get it out, I haven't gotten around to doing it yet, but I'll put it on my website, a list of movies, and one of the movies is From Here to Eternity that they keep showing every now and then.  It's about characters in World War II, and there's a lady who's telling this soldier in it, she said, you know, I, uh, I like you, but you're a soldier and I don't want to be married to a soldier.  And so he said, well, that's just about the best I'll ever do for you.  I mean, you know, it'd be a soldier cause I'm committed to being in the army forever.  All right.  Cause I liked the army and, uh, I know I can't help give you much being a soldier and being away all the time and all that type of thing.  She said, I understand that.  She said, cause I understand loneliness.  She said, and that's one reason.  I like having you around even though I don't want to marry you.  I don't want to be attached to you on a permanent basis because I'm lonely.  And then he looked at her and then she says, you think I'm lying, don't you?  And then he made a classic statement, in my opinion.  He said, no, nobody ever lies about being lonely.  And I think that's classic.  Because what you're talking about, that is a real demon being lonely.  And black females are lonely and getting to be more so.  And why is that?  Because black males are getting to be as men are non-existent.  They are males, but as men, We're not qualified.  That includes myself, according to logic, and every other black male on the planet.  Because you can't be a victim of white supremacy, a prisoner of an illegitimate system, and be a man.  And so that leaves black females in a real quandary.  That's something you have to put up with in war.  And I have a list of a number of movies and I'm going to go when if I get that on my website, I'm going to mention the movies that talk about loneliness and whatnot.  Because during a war, females are usually in a position where they are away from whom they want to be with and soldiers themselves.  And we're all supposed to be soldiers, both male and female.  We are distant from each other.  We are not where we want to be, in a situation where we want to be.  So that gives you incentive to do what?  To be more energetic about getting this war over, this race war that we have, because that is what causes the loneliness.  The reason black males are the way that they are, ineligible to be men, brings on a lot of loneliness for every black female.  Black females, I mean, sit in front of the mirror and get themselves all dusted up and putting on this and putting on that and going to the nail salon and all like that and then looking around and saying, where is my, you know, where is he?  Where is he?  I'm lonely.  I'm doing all this.  I'm working.  I'm Getting my education, I'm getting all my ducks in a row, my finances in order and all like that.  But where is he?  And where he is, he's still a boy.  That's where he is.  You're looking right at him.  But you don't want a boy, you want a man.  But we are all boys.  You become a boy when you become a prisoner of war.  I don't care how old you get or what you know or who you think you know.  If you are subject to the system of white supremacy, and you are a black male on this planet anywhere, you are in the boy category.  Like it or not, because you were born in the boy category.  Men are not subject to racism.  Period.  They don't put up with it.  They are simply not subject with it.  Not one minute.  All right?  But we all or in the prison called racism.  And so the bottom line is, loneliness goes with your plight.  All the more reason why you should be working to get rid of what is causing the loneliness, and that is what?  The system of white supremacy. ",
