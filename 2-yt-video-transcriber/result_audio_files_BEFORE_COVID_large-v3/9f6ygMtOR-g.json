            "text": "You're a damn liar, man.  That's not true.  Hi.  My name's Hillary.  Hillary Gump.  Hi.  Hi.  Would you like a chocolate?  Oh, yeah, I would.  Thanks.  There you go.  Hey, you got any french fries to go with these chocolates?  Yeah.  Here you go.  Oh, thanks.  Cupid is as Cupid does.  You're getting nervous, man.  Calm down.  It's okay.  How was your day?  We are all going to die.  All going to die?  Wow, that is scary.  I've never been so frightened in all my life.  Me neither.  Wow.  We are all going to die.  That's terrible.  We are all going to die.  Wow.  We are all going to die.  Wow, I've never been so frightened in all my life.  Wow.  Wow.  That is... We're going to support you if you win the nomination, because we've got to get rid of Trump.  But what are we going to do about climate change?  Now, you say you're against pipelines, but then you want to replace these gas lines.  That's not going to work.  We've got to stop building and replacing pipelines.  All right, thanks so much, sir.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  We're happy to get a number.  Just because we're trying to get... I'm actually supporting Trump's tire.  I got hairy legs.  You'll see.  My money's on Smash Mouth.  You're a damn liar, man.  That's not true.  You see it on the TV.  No, I know you do.  And by the way, that's why I'm not sedentary.  I get up and you want to check my shape on, let's do push-ups together, man.  Let's run.  Let's do whatever you want to do.  Put your work straight, Jack.  Look, Fat, look, here's the deal.  Look, Fat, here's the deal.  Why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?  Nobody should be fooled.  I will fight back against Trump.  Hillary first and foremost was a mother.  The truth is we rarely disagreed on parenting, although she did believe that I had gone a little over the top when I took a couple of days off with Chelsea to watch all six Police Academy movies back to back.  It was the greatest moment of my life.  Police Academy movies are fun.  What's the difference in what I told you and what you heard at the Republican convention?  One is real.  The other is made up.  All six Police Academy movies are fun.  When I was president, I worked hard to give you more Police Academy movies.  If you love all six, and you should elect Hillary.  Hillary is uniquely qualified to give you more Police Academy movies.  What the fuck?  Hey, where'd the movie go?  Hey, man, oh, man.  Oh, put the movie back on, man.  Hey, where'd the movie go?  I may become the first woman president.  I may become the first woman.  All six Police Academy movies are fun.  In the coming months, I'm going to have to be talking to you about a whole lot of issues, and I'll always be direct with you.  But today, I want to talk about gestures of support and encouragement that I've made to women and some men that have made them uncomfortable.  And I always try to be, in my career, I've always tried to make a human connection.  That's my responsibility, I think.  I shake hands.  I hug people.  I grabbed men and women by the shoulders and said, you can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this.  Our former vice president, he's... And whether they're women, men, young, old, it's the way I've always been.  It's the way I've tried to show I care about them and I'm listening.  And over the years, knowing what I've been through, the things that I've faced, I've found that scores, if not hundreds of people have come up to me and reached out for solace and comfort, something, something, anything that may help them get through the tragedy they're going through.  Joe, you having a good time, Joe?  And so it's just who I am.  Are you having a good time?  And I've never thought of politics as cold and antiseptic.  I've always thought about connecting with people.  Like I said, shaking hands, hands on the shoulder, a hug, encouragement.  Now it's all about taking selfies together.  You know, social norms have begun to change.  They've shifted.  And the boundaries of protecting personal space.  I get it.  I get it.  I hear what they're saying.  I understand.  And I'll be much more mindful.  That's my responsibility.  I will.  I will.  Give me a kiss.  Grab him by the pussy.  I felt like Joe Biden.  I tell you what, if you look at my record and you still doubt about my commitment, then you should vote for somebody else.  And by the way, you know, I sit on the stand and it get hot.  I got a lot of.  I got hairy legs that turn that that that that that turn blonde in the sun.  And the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down.  So it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again.  They'd look at it.  So I learned about roaches.  I learned about kids jumping on my lap.  And I've loved kids jumping on my lap. ",
