            "text": "Hey, what's going on, guys?  James Madison's here.  We're in Daytona Beach.  We're going to be keeping an eye on these guys right here to see what Daytona Beach Police Department is going to do.  We've got a man in a wheelchair here.  So instead of getting to the real root of the problem, what these guys do is they want to get their name, check for warrants, and make sure you got a couple cars behind you there.  Check for warrants and then ultimately just see if they can take them to jail.  That's what the goal of this is.  No other goal than that.  I don't think so, officer.  I don't have it now.  I don't have one, officer.  I don't know.  It's a 1961 or 1984.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I don't know, officer.  So this guy was ultimately not bothering anybody.  I didn't have one.  I don't think so, sir.  So someone called.  So what they're doing, they're asking them questions here to find out, see if they can get by.  This guy doesn't want to be bothered.  I think this guy over here vaping is the one that called.  You have it, sir.  You have it.  You already have it, sir.  We're going to blank that out.  That's a obscure number, so we'll erase that.  Ten years I've lived on the sidewalk.  In Daytona, Florida, officer.  Officer.  I don't do anything to anybody.  I don't want you to have my social security number.  I don't want you to have it.  So these guys are trying to ID him, probably not even suspected of a crime.  Florida Statute 901-151 says they can ID if they suspect him of a crime, but what's he doing, sitting here?  That's it.  This is how Daytona Beach Police Department does.  Trying to identify you.  Like, that's going to make a big difference.  And these guys are over here parked in a handicapped spot.  I mean, a fire lane.  Yes, we are.  I wasn't talking to you, sir.  I was talking to my camera here.  So don't try to deflect and just do your job.  Do what you're doing.  And that's it.  So they're parked up there.  And that's how it is.  Okay, tough guy.  Keep doing your job.  I'm doing my job.  Thank you.  I didn't talk to you.  So, again, 901-151 requires that.  Any place I want you, officer, is that all right with you?  Any place I want you, officer, is that all right with you?  I don't know if I have made that decision yet.  I want you to go to Sablon.  I don't think so, sir.  You made a mistake.  I think so.  You got to be careful when you're talking to these guys here, especially with me here.  Apparently, this guy's amped up because I've talked to him.  He's parked in a fire lane.  When these guys reach into their pockets here, you know how police are.  They're going to protect and serve.  Under my armpits, put me in my chair.  I am a large guy.  My leg is injured, or I do it myself.  Because I've been in and out of the hospital, I've lost all the strength in my right leg.  Well, the doctors are great.  They fill me full of antibiotics.  And then they hand me a prescription.  Well, the prescription.  A hotel room.  I could use a clean pair of pants and shirt, you know.  A Sparborough spaghetti meatball dinner, you know.  over on B Street.  But I don't have that much cash money for the prescription.  And, well, the doctors, you know, I've been backing in out of the emergency room.  And then they want to charge me for MRIs and x-rays.  They have my blood history, lab tests, you know.  And when I... That's funny that the fire lane got him triggered.  I just don't want to pay for those three things.  Over and over and over.  All my hospital bills statement.  But I am an adult.  It's what I take care of.  I'll take care of it, officer.  It doesn't feel good.  It doesn't feel good, officer, is my answer.  Now, Dr.  Officer over here wants to ask him if the antibiotics help them or not.  I have been most recently to the hospital.  No, sir.  This guy's back.  He went down there to the back.  I'm not sure.  Probably just looking for something.  So, again, what they're doing, they're looking for warrants.  Just checking to see if there's any warrants, and that's about it.  They're going to see if they can take him to jail.  And homelessness is a big problem in the cities.  A lot of the cities, you guys know that.  There's a lot of people.  This guy said that he lives on the street for seven years, I think he said.  That's your RP, the reporting person.  They're thinking he's trespassed from here, so that's what they're going to check.  I don't think that was intentional.  She might not be.  So basically what he's doing, this guy wants to have either arrested or trespassed again.  So this is common.  This is pretty much what happens on any given time.  this guy's got scissors.  Hopefully these guys aren't snipping enough to... This officer says he's dealt with him before.  That's such a negative word if you guys know or not.  Such a negative word.  This guy's coherent.  Seems pretty good.  I bought a pad to sit on.  Pretty calm when I deal with him.  I love this guy's demeanor.  Deal.  And just let you guys know where I'm standing.  I am standing at a public sidewalk.  This is the right-of-way and the easement right here at the bus stop.  So if anything comes up... Such a reporting person right there.  He's thinking him.  So Officer Doctor Fire Lane Parker here deals with citizens.  Deals with him.  Deals with the citizen.  That's what he does.  Deals.  So, a lot of... Sorry, I'm childless.  I just want to make sure I don't roll one.  So a lot of terminology used by the officers like dealt with, dealing with, deal.  You can tell their mindset by when they come out here that they don't want to help the public.  They don't want to help anybody.  It's dealing with people, delting.  And that's what these guys do.  I remember I used that word once or twice, and I changed my vocabulary after I remembered some incidents that came about, like with one of the gentlemen in South Eton.  So we'll move over just a little bit, make sure we can see.  I don't know, I think they're just trespassing them, but they're just, they're.  Their demeanor is always kind of weird.  I do it.  I do it for that man sitting on the ground over there because you know how it is.  Matter of fact, you know, I used to do law enforcement and I turned watching now because I've seen how bad it can be.  But unfortunately, that's what happens.  This is a lot of the time is taken up for this year and I don't know.  Okay.  I would too.  Anybody, right?  Officer, can I go on my bike, please?  That's what he wants to hear.  Okay, officer.  And if you need to get by me, just let me know.  I'm just standing over here.  It's in the wrong spot, I think.  You know, even if it's a homeless shelter out there, we're people, we're humans.  We still want to go walk around and do something and maybe see some sights.  It's out in the middle of the woods.  Yes.  I mean, that's to keep people away from it, but... Oh, God, look at him lower.  Yeah, he's got... I think one leg is amputated.  I know, but I'm telling you.  I can't answer.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  The same answer coming up me all the time.  The same answer.  So these guys are going to help him up, which is nice of them.  Yeah, it looks like he's got a hospital gown on.  All the way up and put me in the chair, please.  Oh, God, he ain't got no clothes.  No, that's so sad.  I'll turn it away.  He's got his legs up here, so I don't want to.  There we go.  Probably had some infection and then got mercy, you know, mercy there or whatever it's called.  So this guy's, you know, pretty bad off.  He's got no mobility except for a wheelchair, so if he falls out, he's at the mercy of anybody that's around him.  Somebody help me get over to the steak and shake sidewalk.  All right.  Can I go over to the Steak and Shake restaurant?  You need some help.  Can I go over there then?  I can't make it, officer.  I can't go around a long way.  They said they can't move no more.  Can somebody help me go over to the Steak and Shake restaurant, please?  Yes, sir!  I think you arrested me, officer!  I'm in again!  Now he's free to go.  53-24, and then that's there.  I'll get you there.  Got it?  Where's this at?  Back here?  Yeah, yeah.  I won't.  I'm gonna slow.  There we go.  Well, I spent my money at the plaza.  There we go.  They got my money.  Why don't they give it back to me?  Had to give him a hand there, so.  And this officer here.  Officer, deal with.  What was your name and badge number since you made contact with me?  Huh?  Your name and badge number since you made contact with me?  Officer Cyrus.  Cyrus, all right.  And badge number, you got that ID number then?  08653.  08653.  That's officer medical, officer dealt with.  Back keeper's undone there.  Okay.  Don't look sloppy.  Don't forget, like I said, your back keeper.  It's undone.  Alright, we're going to get out of here and head on out.  Hope you guys appreciate this video here.  Thanks for watching.  You too.  Have a good day.  Alright guys, we're going to be heading out of here.  Hope you guys appreciate this video.  Thanks for liking, subscribing, hitting that bell button.  And what we'll do... See you guys again soon.  Yeah. ",
