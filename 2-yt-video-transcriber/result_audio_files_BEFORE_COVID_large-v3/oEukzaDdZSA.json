            "text": "Hello everyone, my name is Jennifer Maleski, and this is my YouTube channel.  So I'm working on a bigger video, but I've been hearing some complaints about women lately, from men.  Go figure.  Men bitch about women, women bitch about men.  I just saw a YouTube comment.  Not on my channel.  You should be commenting on my channel.  But it wasn't on my channel.  But a guy was talking about.  he wanted his wife to, on her way to run an errand, to stop at an auto parts store to pick up a part.  And he had already called the auto parts store and had it all set up.  All she had to do was stop and grab it.  If he were to do it, it'd take an hour to get there and an hour to come back.  He was already saving the family $400 by doing this... See?  I'm a girl.  I don't even know what it's called.  An auto part transfer repair.  He was already going to save the family money by doing this, and his wife... kvetched that she, why should she have to stop and get this auto part?  Okay.  So she was a big poopy, stinky fart.  Okay, fine.  And he said he was just really getting sick of her treating him like that.  right?  Like, okay, you've been married for a long time.  He's trying to do a nice thing and she's being a poopy, stinky fart.  Yes, that's exactly right.  So I said, what are you doing telling me, not even on my channel, but why aren't you telling her?  Okay.  So let's put this on the shelf.  Okay.  It's in the shelf.  Now I have something to say, and I don't think a lot of people are going to like it.  I think my YouTube channel is going to be a lot of things that people don't like, but I say it in real life, so why not say it here in the goddamn digital world?  Women like and respect boundaries.  I think when women hear me say that, they're going to hate me.  Unless they've done some really deep evaluation about the relationships that they've had historically that have been.  the brightest shining stars are usually with the men and who say, don't pull that shit on me.  Okay.  So there's also someone, one of my subscribers was saying, Women can ruin everything.  They can take everything with alimony and they can screw you over in 15 years.  And what's the guarantee, Jennifer, that even if you find a good woman, that she's not going to hurt you?  There's no guarantees.  That's the beauty and the horrificness of relationships.  The best you can do is filter through the... And find a good partner.  And then you've got to hope.  But not just hope through the relationship.  You have to set up boundaries.  You've got to do it fast.  And you have to do it succinctly.  And you have to agree to it.  And you have to sign.  I expect you not to cheat on me.  Sign that.  I expect you to treat me nice.  I will treat you nice when you're nice to me.  I'll apologize when I'm wrong.  I want you to apologize when you're wrong.  Apologize when you're wrong.  And all these things.  If you cheat on me, we're done.  Well, like, what do you mean cheat?  Cheat!  Okay, fine, I know what cheating is.  Okay, so you have all these things signed.  Boom, okay?  And then you start to live your life together.  But you have to remember the contract is there.  You, as the one who said, hey, here's my stipulations.  Don't fuck me over.  Don't cheat on me.  Don't treat me like shit.  You have to remember those.  And if you do those things, if you cheat on me or treat me like blah, blah, blah, then I'll leave you.  So you have to be ready to fulfill your end of the bargain.  A lot of people don't want to do that.  They just want to be like, hey, don't hurt me.  And then they get hurt and they're like, well... I have a story.  It's about parenting, but it's also about everything in life.  Bear with me.  Hey, come on, hold on and bear with me.  Okay.  So I was at a restaurant once and I was talking to my friend.  I'm looking at my friend, like I'm looking at you.  And right behind you, there's a kid, three, four, and hits the mom in the face.  And the mom says, ow.  Ow.  Stop it.  And the kid says, and slaps her again.  And the mom says, don't do that.  That hurts.  Slaps again.  Stop it.  I mean it.  No more hitting.  Okay.  Guess what happens?  You know, the kid smacks the mom in the face.  So what does the mom do?  The mom smacks the kid in the face and the kid is shocked and starts crying.  You can't believe what happened.  I said to my friend, that's bad parenting.  And my friend thought it was because of the smack.  No, listen to Stefan Molyneux if you want no hitting.  I had no problem with that necessarily.  What my qualm was, was there was no cycle.  It was stop.  What?  Stop?  Why?  What is the... Why would I stop?  What's the incentive to stop?  Incentive can be good and it can be bad.  But that mom didn't say, hey, ow, that hurts.  That's not how you treat me.  I don't like it.  It makes me feel sad.  If you do it again, I do not want to hit you, but I'm going to so you can understand that it hurts and it's not fun.  And then the kid can at least process that and make the decision.  Okay, so let's all grow up.  Woo!  That three-year-old is going to be 40 at some point.  And that kid is going to be in a relationship.  That mom is teaching him... that once I say something, the consequence of not fulfilling the obligation or the request, there's no conclusion.  So when a man says to a woman, hey, don't cheat on me.  And the woman's like, okay.  And then she cheats and the guy's like, oh God, I don't know what to do.  Yeah, you don't know what to do because everything was great and muddled in your head.  What are your conditions?  Okay.  I don't like.  the whole love is unconditional between a man and a woman.  Bullshit.  There should be conditions.  And that's when the conditions are met every day through a lifetime, that relationship can prosper and grow.  Without conditions, you can do whatever you want.  And who wants to be with someone that is a petulant, spoiled child?  So women and men, I believe, but let's talk about this.  Women want boundaries.  I am really strong, okay, especially for a woman and compared to some dudes.  So I need someone who is stronger.  I have to have it because if I let this power, it's not good.  This fist is can hurt, okay?  The man has to prevent the fist from being able to hurt them, and it has to prevent the hand from opening to bitch slap them, okay?  So women need men that have this kind of attitude.  Ready?  Ready?  Women need to know that they have chosen a man that doesn't need them, but wants them.  Very powerful.  Women don't want to be with a guy who's needy.  They don't want to be needed.  They want to be wanted.  But when you let your wife or your girlfriend run amok with how she speaks to you, Really, I mean, it's actions and words, right?  How she looks at you, if she's going to give you a condescending look, not good.  Nip that in the bud.  And you don't have to be like, bitch, you don't look at me like that.  No, that's not a man.  But a man would say, listen, I don't know what's going on in your head, but I saw that look of contempt and I don't like it.  I don't like to look at the woman that I love and have her be looking at me like, with contempt or disrespect or disgust, I can't be with that.  I don't want to be with that.  If you're going to look at me like that, I can't be with you.  Now, I'm here if you want to talk.  Instead of being a shit, if you wanna actually talk about it and say, hey, whatever the situation is, you have to speak to me and then we can work through it.  But if you're just gonna look at me, rude, no.  If you're gonna speak to me, rude, no.  So the importance in a relationship is setting up the criteria.  Now, a lot of us find ourselves in relationships that it's like a runaway horse and you got on the saddle and you're like, this is going to be an awesome ride.  And then that horse is out of control, galloping.  There's been nothing taught to it.  So you have to get the reins.  You have to, and it's not going to be easy after 17 years of marriage or five years of marriage or whatever, but you have to get the reins and say, okay, look, I know that we've been galloping along, but it's not working for me.  So I need to reset the boundaries.  And this is going to help you too.  Look, I will do this.  You do this.  I expect this.  What do you expect?  Okay.  And then we communicate.  That's it.  That's my video today.  You didn't like it, did you?  No.  So let's just remind everyone, I am very much about self-responsibility.  I don't like blame and I don't like victimhood.  I don't like women complaining about men, and I don't like men complaining about women.  If you're going to be a wise and responsible person, you're responsible for your relationship, and you have to communicate.  That's it.  And if it's not working, I don't want to be the condoner of leaving a relationship.  Not easily.  But if the contract can't be signed, remember the one I threw?  This one?  If you can't... If you're with someone who can't go... This is all bullshit.  If you're with someone who can't agree to not cheat on you or look at you rude or hit you, you know, because this goes both ways, then... It might be okay to leave.  Who's that blonde woman who had that call in radio show and she got fired and taken off the air for saying the N-word?  Help me.  I can't remember.  She said there's three reasons to leave.  a marriage, abuse, addiction, affairs.  So abuse, you get to define the terms of what that means, but you have to say it out loud and you have to get the signature because abuse could be like, don't look at, I don't want to look over and want to see a loving wife or a loving husband and have them like staring at me like, Oh, what have I done?  Oh God, who have I chosen?  You don't want that.  Okay.  Or maybe, or maybe that's fine with you, but you don't want to be like punched in the face or in the kidney.  Okay.  So you come to those terms.  What does an affair mean?  Listen, I don't even want you talking to guys.  You don't even talk to men.  Like I wouldn't sign that contract.  I have a lot of male friends, but someone might.  Okay.  So, so it's, it's coming to terms with, I'm just saying the same thing over and over and over and over.  over.  Here's something I've said before.  You should subscribe.  Why, Jennifer?  You're not that great.  Hey, you know what?  Screw you.  You don't have to subscribe.  Get out of here.  No, I'm just kidding.  I think everyone should subscribe.  Do you agree so far with what I've said?  If you do or if you don't, you should put it in the comment section.  Jennifer, you're so stupid.  Jennifer, you're the best.  Or somewhere in between there.  So that's it.  That's my video today.  Figure out your contract and then talk to your partner.  Listen, I've dealt with this for a long time.  I mean, you change your cell phone provider, you change your cable provider, you change your jobs, you move houses, and you renegotiate terms.  Why can't we do this in a relationship?  Even to have a weekly audit meeting in a relationship.  People don't like to communicate.  I know.  I wish things were easier.  They're not.  That's it.  I want you to have a good day.  Figure out what you want.  Communicate it with your partner.  And hopefully it works really well.  All right.  Until then, don't have an affair.  Don't have an affair.
