Now I feel pressure to make this video good, though.  Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of Flat Art Friday.  I'm the Creaky Blinder.  And if it's your first time here, don't forget to click the subscribe button and turn on bell notifications for more content like this.  Now then.  Tuesday's video was loosely based around Chris Fritz.  And as I promised in that video, I am now going to talk about Chris Fritz.  Strangely enough.  I'll just sort of give you a bit of an idea of what this guy is like.  Because, yeah.  So his channel is, it's not a very big channel.  But there's nothing wrong with that because neither is mine.  But it just seems filled with anti-vax videos.  Another anti-vax video.  Obviously, Flat Earth.  That we're all paid shells.  TV propaganda.  NASA covering lies with propaganda.  So, let's have a proper gander at his video.  That was good, that was.  Propaganda.  That's not going to mean anything to Americans.  Sorry.  Right, let's just get on with it. ",

What the hell are you talking about?  And you said earlier on you didn't want to have a crybaby fight about it.  Why have you made a video then claiming that people like me are paid shells?
