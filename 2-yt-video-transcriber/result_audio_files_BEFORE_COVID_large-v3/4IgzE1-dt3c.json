            "text": "I'm not in favor of government banning people who are adults.  Children.  I'm in favor of banning because now you're talking about somebody who's not capable of consent.  All of our laws are based on the ability of people to consent.  If you're a child, you can't consent.  So I'm very much in favor of banning gender transition for kids.  I think that it's frankly evil.  I think you're making decisions for children who are not capable of making decisions for themselves that are permanent and have long-lasting significant and severe impact.  As far as adults, if you're 25 and you want to get a sex change surgery and you feel like it's going to make you feel better, you have the right to do it.  You do.  Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.  I mean, the research on this stuff tends to be somewhat conflicting, but if it works for you, it works for you.  It's a free country.  Now, that's really not the question that's being asked in our society today, because I don't think there are that many people who are like, we want to ban gender surgery for a 30-year-old.  I'm not seeing the campaign for that.  What I am seeing is a campaign on the left that says that my child is going to be removed from my home 10 years from now if I don't agree with the left's view of how I should treat my child's gender confusion at age four.  I see the left suggesting that they want to fine me if I refuse to say that a man is a woman as a general proposition.  If I say that men and women are separate, then the left says this is discrimination.  Or the left is going to suggest that it has no impact on my business if I employ a woman at Hooters and she shows up the next day as a man.  That does have an impact on my business, but the left would suggest, well, you should sort of deal with it.  Well, it turns out that gender does mean something, and it does have an actual meaning to people outside of you.  I'm not going to go along with the general societal willingness to rewrite basic facets of human nature and human biology, and frankly, mammalian biology, in order to suggest that a delusion is true.  Now, if the best thing for the person is for the person to, they can't change what they're thinking, there's no way for them to get out of it, they want to change their body so they feel that it is more in line with what they're thinking, more power to them, that's their problem.  And as I've said before, by the way, I've said this a thousand times and everybody on the left automatically ignores it, of course, I've said that if I were in a room with a transgender person having dinner with that person, I wouldn't go out of my way to call them by their biological sex.  Because rude, right?  I wouldn't do that if I were sitting right across from them.  But if you're asking me in a public forum whether a man is a man and a woman is a woman, or asking me to call a man a woman in a public forum, the answer is no. ",
