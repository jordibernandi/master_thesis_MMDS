            "text": "Well, it begins with their own personal heart and their walk with the Lord.  And Really, you've got to be a godly man.  And there are a lot of young men who want to go into the ministry who are trying to be as much like the world as they can be, and they need to be as much like heaven as they can be.  And so it really begins with their own personal character and the integrity of their life.  And it begins with the Word of God in their life.  Psalm 119, verse 9 says, \"'How shall a young man keep his way  pure?'  by keeping it according to your word.  Then verse 11, your word I've hidden in my heart that I might not sin against you.  So for men going into the ministry, That involves, you must master the Word of God, but more than that, the Word of God must master you.  And you must be sanctified by the Word of God.  God will only use one kind of a vessel, and that is a pure and holy vessel.  And the Holy Spirit will only fill a holy life.  And the Holy Scriptures will only go forth with power.  from a holy life.

            "text": "I do.  I do.  I think a lot of young men fight pornography.  And they excuse it.  And Jesus said, if your right eye causes you to stumble, meaning to look on another woman with lust, Jesus was so radical.  He said, rip it out and throw your right eye away.  It would be better for you to pluck out your right eye than for you to go to the fiery hell.  In other words, you're going to hell if you don't repent.  You are showing me you're not even a true believer.  And then he says, and if your right hand makes you stumble, that goes even further.  Now you're not just looking, now you're fondling.  Now your hand is where it does not belong.  And Jesus called for radical repentance.  And he said, chop it off.  It would be better for you to chop off your right hand than for your whole body to go to hell.  So we need to hear that again today.  And there are young men who are trying to get as close to the edge and as close to the fire and are abusing their liberties in Christ and their freedom in Christ And they're becoming singed with the fires of lust, and they will not be used by God.  Now, they may have good looks, and they may be able to maybe blend in with the culture and connect and be a cool communicator, but the power of the Spirit of God will not rest upon that life.  Mm-hmm.  nor that ministry.  So that is why purity is absolutely essential.  And that goes back to the Old Testament, Leviticus 11, 44, Leviticus 19, 2, all the way into the New Testament.  Jesus said, \"'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see  God.'\".  1 Peter 1, verse 15 and 16, \"'You shall be holy, for I am  holy.'\".  So Hebrews 12, verse 14, pursue holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.  So if you're not pursuing holiness, it's obvious you're not on the path to heaven.  You are self-deceived.  And so it's absolutely critical.  So my advice to young men going into the ministry would be so many different things, I would say.  But this is like the tip of the spear.  that you need to be as godly and as holy and as much like Christ as a saved sinner can be here upon this earth.  And it's out of that context that God calls men into the ministry.  So that would be what I would say, Joe, as well as they need to sit under strong expository preaching.  And you need to know what it looks like sounds like, tastes like, to be in the building under expository preaching, not just listening to podcasts, and that's fine, but you need to be where it's happening.  And so if you have to move to another city and you're thinking about going into the ministry, then that's what I would do so that you can experience the impact of the Word of God being preached with deep conviction and power.  So, Joe? ",

By the end of this video, you need to make a decision.  You need to decide what you are going to do.  In 1 Kings, chapter 18, verse 21, the prophet Elijah asks a very, very pressing question, which you need to think about this very day.  He says... How long will you waver between two opinions?  If the Lord is God, we'll serve him.  But if Baal is God, we'll serve him.  When Alexander the Great was asked, how did you manage to conquer the whole world?  His answer was, by not wavering.  And the Hebrew word for wavering means to limp.  So in other words, you've got one foot in the kingdom of God and you've got one foot in the world and it's literally crippling you, this indecision.  You've listened to the oldest lie which the devil told Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.  He convinced them that they were missing out.  You feel as though God is holding back some superior pleasure from you.  You feel as though there's a box that this Christianity is keeping you in and you just want to get out of the box and you want to escape.  You feel as though there's advantages to sin, but there's also advantages to the Christian life.  But today, this very day, you need to make a decision.  You can't keep going to church on Sunday and saying amen to the message, nodding your head, praying like a saint, You lift your hands up in praise and everyone looks at you and thinks you are a devout Christian.  But on Monday you live like the world.  On Monday you are just like the devils of this world.  You smoke pot.  You cuss.  You swear.  You watch filth on the internet.  You have sex outside of marriage.  You go to parties.  You live like the world and no one can tell who your spiritual father is.  Whether it's God the Father or whether the father of lies is your dad.  No one can tell the difference.  But know this.  God will not be mocked.  your sins will find you out and you need to make a decision whom you will serve this day whether it be God or whether it be the devil.  I'm talking now to you brothers and sisters in Christ.  I had no idea this was the video I was going to make today but I feel as though this is the video the Lord wants you to hear this very day and I'm telling you today enough is enough.  how much longer will you carry on sinning?  you know I'm a married man And there is nothing which breaks my heart, there is nothing which produces more wrath, more anger than when I see another man try and flirt with my wife.  That makes me so angry.  But did you know this brothers and sisters in Christ?  You are married to God.  And the Bible says, the Lord thy God is a jealous God.  So whenever you go off cheating on him, it produces anger, it produces jealousy in him because you belong to him.  He bought you with his son's blood and you better be obedient to him.  You better be faithful to the God who sent his son, Jesus Christ, to bleed and die on a cross so that he might redeem you and have you all to himself.  Oh, precious friends, I plead with you today.  how many more sermons will you hear how many more prayers will go up how many more weeks of rebellion how many more wars will pass how many more days months years will go on until you finally make a decision?  you know what you need to do as i've been preaching this message.  you know in your heart what you need to do what you need to give up on.  but whatever you do you need to make a decision today.  either you say the devil yes he is going to be my spiritual father and i'll go into the world and i'll end up in hell for eternity.  Or you say, no, today, this very day, I'm going to give all to the Lord God.  He is going to be my father.  I'm going to follow after him.  But whatever you do, stop wavering.  God deserves your all.  You either give him 100% or you give him nothing at all.  So you need to make a decision right now.  It's decision time.  You decide today, whom will you serve?  God or the devil? ",
