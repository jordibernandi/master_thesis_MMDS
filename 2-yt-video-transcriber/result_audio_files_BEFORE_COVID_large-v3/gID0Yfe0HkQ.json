The basic position society has always pretty much held is they have discouraged people from having children.  Always.  And the reason why, because you're able to be involved in more of moving their products, basically.  I mean, that's really the bottom line.  As I'm sitting here right now, I can think of literally hundreds of couples, especially couples I've known, men that I know personally, who have not had children.  I know people who have had children and they've decided not to have any more children.  So, you know, I think about myself, my own family.  During the early 70s leading up into 75 when the world was supposed to end, you would have speakers at assemblies, conventions, local speakers come and give talks at the hall.  And it was always invoked the scripture, woe to the pregnant woman, woe to the pregnant woman, because you have to run in the wintertime and all this kind of stuff.  And so it would discourage me from having more kids.  It was really bad for my mom because at the time she was pregnant with my brother.  And I remember she would go home and I was in the back seat and I would look in the rear view mirror and she would have tears coming down many times because she was afraid, you know, suppose the system comes to an end and I'm still carrying, you know, the baby and everything.  And so this constant, you know, just beat people down with ridiculous stuff.  And so over the years there have been many couples who have delayed or actually just simply postponed.  We'll have children in the new system. ",

It's kind of interesting, especially if you're in full-time, what they call full-time service.  When I was at Bethel, if a couple got pregnant, it wasn't really viewed as a joy.  It's like, oh, man.  They pregnant now.  And so you see this cultural thing.  Or if you're a circuit overseer, him and his wife, she got pregnant.  Oh, man, that baby's a circuit breaker, as we used to call it.  I mean, so it was always in a negative connotation.  And the issue that you raised about the price that you have to pay.  See, witnesses were banking on the system coming to an end.  Right.  The generation of 1914 wasn't supposed to die.  And so all of these people, especially people of my parents' age and now my generation coming along, we were under the understanding that God was going to bring this world to an end before we got old.  So now you have all of these people who don't have children.  Right.  Getting up into age.  And unfortunately, one of the things about the organization, which is really a very negative, the organization doesn't take care of its old people.  Right.  Now you and I were talking offline, there are many churches, they have facilities for their senior citizens.  Priests and nuns, say what you think about them, but at the end of the day, the Catholic Church has set aside facilities Because they have said that these people, they sacrifice for the church.  So we're going to make sure they're taken care of as they get older.  Well, just recently, we just saw what happened with the society.  They let a thousand Bethelites go home.  They told an entire level in the organization, those who serve in the district work, go home.  Which is interesting because typically district overseers are older than circuit overseers.  Because they hit the circuit before they were young, now they're in the district work, now they were told to go home.  No kids. ",

Unfortunately, you know, when we reach our parents' age, we won't have children to do the little running around, go to the county office and the state office, and we won't have that.  And so the cost is very, very high.  And I cannot imagine what it's going to be for witnesses who live in countries where the economic situation is not like here in the States.

They can't talk to their parents 10, 20, 30 years.  Now they're up in age.  They need help.  Congregation says, go call your kids.  Well, I haven't talked to them in 30 years.

But in the Jehovah's Witness faith, The only time you really are looked at is when you're out in field service.  So when you get older and you can no longer come out and do things like you used to, no one goes to visit you.  I remember when JT and I were courting, and he would come to my congregation to visit, the first thing he would say is, let's go visit the old friends.  This is not something that they do across the board at all.  And I think a lot of it has to do with JT's personality.  That's just who he is as a person.  So when he came to visit me, we would go visit the old friends.  Do you know they would tell us that no one had been by to see them from the congregation?  We were the first people that even stopped by. ",

No, no, no, not just that person's life, but generational lives.  Because when you don't have kids, that means you don't have grandkids or great grandkids.
