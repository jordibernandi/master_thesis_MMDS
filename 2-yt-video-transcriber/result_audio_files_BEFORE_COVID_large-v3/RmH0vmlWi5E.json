No, I'm going to take a break from talking about internet trolls to talk about Logan Paul.  Now, this is going to be a short one, I think.  I just downloaded the trailer to Logan Paul's Flat Earth documentary.  I haven't watched it.  I figured I could do the thing right here.  Now, some of you may remember that Logan Paul came out as a Flat Earther back in November, I think it was, at the Flat Earth conference.  And he upstaged a lot of the major Globe deniers to their chagrin.  That moment is probably part of this documentary.  Now, we're going to watch it, and I'll give my thoughts as I go.  It's called Flat Earth to the Edge and Back.  So let's go here. ",

Let me go back to this here.  Was so staged.  This is what staged looks like.  You guys thought that the... Beyond the curve, I mean, behind the curve was staged and everybody in it was shills.  This is what stage looks like, people.  So Logan Paul is not a flat earther, and that's probably the best compliment I can give him.  He's an opportunist.  He's going to get a bunch of views of this thing, and that's what he's all about.  And it's coming March 20th.  Now, I would not be surprised that after this video has been out for a week or so and gotten 30, 40 million views, that after making a surge of cash, he comes out with another video, say on April 1st, a supplementary video saying, ha ha, April fools, look at all these losers.  Here's a bunch of B-roll footage of me making faces at them and laughing at their absurdity behind their backs when they walked away.  Come on.  You know it's coming.  So, those of you who are at the convention, think back.  If any of you got on camera with or near Logan Paul, it's coming.  You probably weren't paying that much attention to what you were doing because you thought you were in a safe place, but there's going to be some embarrassing shit coming out of you.  That's what's going to happen next.  But, in the meantime... Flat Earth is going to get searched more, and since the rising tide raises all boats, real globe deniers will get a bit of a boost from this before the hammer comes down.  And this might be a welcome distraction from the behind-the-curve documentary and the culling that that caused.  So, Globe Deniers, you shouldn't have anything to do with documentaries.  Don't get on camera.  Don't promote them.  They never work out for you.  Remember Beeloo the E.T.  and Convex Earth last year?  Come on, learn from your mistakes.  Anyway, that's my take on this trailer.  Regrettably, this thing comes out the day I'm heading to DC as a chaperone for my son's 8th grade class, so I probably won't get a chance to review it in a timely manner, but I'm sure someone will pick up the slack.  I think this was just a setup for a later joke.  Or, maybe, toward the end of the documentary, there'll be a swerve, and he'll start roasting Globe Deniers in this actual film.  possible that's possible.  anyway.  this is bound to churn up more division in the ranks of that already unstable bunch and I'm just going to sit back and watch this train wreck happen.  this should be fun.  take care.  that's my job that's what I do.  I don't lose I win I win.  is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  Maybe you came by congratulating last night's victory. ",
