Apparently they're doing a movie about some of this critical theory, cultural Marxism, social justice, all of this stuff.  And they're doing it with some people that I like very much.  And it looks like it's going to be good.  So let's watch the trailer here.  And I was going to start and stop and comment on it, but it just didn't really work out because the trailer kind of moves very quick.  So let's watch the whole thing.  And then whatever comments I can remember to make, I'm going to make them.  But again, these are some of my best friends.  They're Baptists, and as you can see, they're fighting the good fight.  And this is good stuff.  So let's watch it together, and we will comment on it at the end. ",

We need to turn the women loose with the gifts that God have ordained them to even preach to men and women.  And that's exactly what Paul instructed Phoebe to do.  And then we talk ourselves into outsmarting the Bible.  And it's almost like, yeah, let's try a little bit.  Well, no, that wouldn't matter either.

You see, it's precisely at this point that I think we're being played.  We recognize the obligation, and we can be played into their agenda as to what to do in order to pursue justice.  That has been their core tactic for a century and a half.  It's not new.  It's not even new to Southern Baptists because Satan does this.  He is constantly telling you you should be guilty and you're forgiven.  He is constantly asking you to live with regret when the Father has taken all the sins of the world. ",

            "text": "That's right.  Amen.  Wow.  There's some nifty editing going on in there.  I'll tell you right now, that looks very well done.  That trailer is very well done.  I've got to be honest.  I'm looking forward to this movie coming out.  Wow.  You know, when I heard about this, I had the opportunity to watch this trailer last week.  And when I had heard about the project, I was excited about it, for sure.  But I knew it wouldn't pull punches.  I knew it wouldn't be, you know, milk toast.  I knew it wouldn't be like that.  But I was not prepared for the kind of essentially... let's just put it, edgy type stuff like that editing.  It talks about some of the shadowy figures in there.  You can kind of tell some of the people that they're talking about are Russell Moore and some of these other people.  It kind of ties together some of the egalitarian movements in the SBC with that Jezebel lady.  That's what Doug Wilson called her.  Anyway, a little edgier than I thought it would be, and I'm very grateful for that.  I'm very grateful for that, because at the end of the day, this is serious business.  I am a post-millennial guy.  I'm very optimistic when it comes to the Church of Jesus Christ in the long term.  But we're in serious times right now.  Serious issues are being put on the table.  Serious battles and wars are being fought right now.  And so we need to act like it's serious.  It is serious.  And so we need to call out who the enemies of truth are.  And I think that this trailer does a pretty good job sort of framing that.  We'll see what the movie does.  But based on the trailer, I think that we've got We've got some good things to look forward to here.  Now, look, at the end of the day, I'm not the kind of guy that requires purity, right?  So there are some people that I saw that were interviewed here, and we'll see if they're portrayed favorably or not.  I don't know.  I mean, some people here that I think are on the right side of these issues, but they're not as, quote, unquote, pure when it comes to the issues that I would be.  I mean, I don't require purity to be on the same team as you.  I don't require you to do things the same way.  I would do them.  in order to be on the same team.  And so I'm looking forward to seeing what these people have to say about this.  That beginning part with Matt Chandler, that other dude.  Who was that other guy, that other white guy?  I don't know.  I don't recognize him.  Maybe they're just not my circles.  But I find it so interesting.  It's just like Matt Chandler basically is talking about, and that other guy, they're talking about deplatforming yourself if you're white.  You're not an expert.  You've never been black before.  And so... Maybe you should just ask blacks and browns to teach you and you can sit at their feet and just teach us about racism and teach us about what the Bible says to do about racism.  That's so stupid.  That's so stupid because the Bible doesn't give skin color any kind of extra qualifications when it comes to talking about what the Bible says about partiality and oppression and things like that.  You can be white and have a really clear idea about what the Bible says to do about partiality and oppression.  It doesn't require you to be black or brown or whatever.  But notice that these people aren't taking their own advice.  You see, this is the thing.  I find this so annoying, right?  Chandler will tell you to de-platform yourself if you're white.  The other guy will tell you, you know, sit at the feet of black people.  But yet they're talking.  You know, if you really wanted to affect change in the world and, you know, maybe you should take some advice from that inspirational meme.  Be the change you want to see in the world.  Why not, instead of telling everyone else to deplatform themselves, why don't you deplatform yourself?  Stop telling us what to do.  You're white.  You've never been black.  You don't know anything about this racism.  Why don't you platform me?  I know more about racism than you, Matt Chandler, right?  Why not?  Why not?  Oh, because it's really not about that.  It's about looking good.  It's about doing things that appear good, but not actually doing them yourself, actually just telling everyone else to do them.  I find that so annoying.  Look, practice what you preach.  You want all the white pastors out there to de-platform themselves?  De-platform yourself first.  Why don't you lead by example?  I find that so annoying.  Anyway, so there's that.  And then, hey, this is going to be interesting.  Now, what I wanted to talk about too before I finish is how people are going to respond to this video.  I think I was watching a podcast.  I think this was \u2013 is it a podcast?  Or is it a YouTube channel?  It's probably both.  I was watching this.  It was Jordan Hall on Pulpit and Pen.  He was talking about something specific.  I don't watch Pulpit and Pen religiously or anything like that, but whenever there's a topic that I find interesting, I'll put it on while I'm working just to hear what he has to say.  And oftentimes he has some really interesting things to say.  And one of his analyses of the whole situation here is that Right now, we're kind of like people that are on our side of this issue are kind of in between two responses, right?  Normally, they just ignore you.  They just ignore you.  They pretend like you don't even exist.  They follow you, of course.  They watch your videos.  They watch your podcast.  They read your articles, but they don't acknowledge it.  They pretend like it doesn't exist.  And I know this is true.  This happens to me.  I know there's one guy out there, and you know who you are.  You know who you are, who's disavowed me publicly.  He's distanced himself from me publicly.  He's slandered me publicly.  But he watches all my videos.  You know who you are.  He pretends like I don't exist, like my content, all while he's talking about me.  You know, sometimes he'll subtweet me.  Sometimes he'll do these.  Anyway, so you... We're being ignored, but also, and then we're trying to be discredited.  So we're in between two responses.  You're either ignored or you're discredited.  Right now, we're mostly still ignored, but also kind of being discredited.  So I think that the Founders Ministry is going to encounter two responses.  Number one, they'll be mostly ignored.  Number two, they'll attempt to be discredited.  Oh, they were being mean.  They said mean words, and they talked about someone a little bit too aggressively, and that wasn't very winsome of them.  Jesus spoke kindly to people.  He would never have said the things that you said.  Oh, but you might counter, well, Jesus turned over tables, but you're not Jesus.  You're not Jesus, so you can't do it.  That's the kind of responses they're going to get.  They're going to get discredited for being not winsome enough, using mean words, maybe being too aggressive, maybe talking too much like a man, you know, that kind of thing.  So that's what I think is going to happen.  This movie is going to be either ignored or they're going to try to get discredited for being too mean, essentially.  But the reality is that that's what's going to happen with the intelligentsia, the people that are like the thought leaders of Big Eva.  But I think the regular Joes, they like this kind of stuff.  And not only do they like it, but they want to know what's going on.  I think that the social justice warriors in Christianity, the Russell Moores of the world, the Thabiti Yanyabwili's of the world, the Eric Mason's of the world, they have awoken a sleeping giant.  Because at the end of the day, most everyday people in the pews They really hadn't heard about this stuff, critical theory, cultural market.  And if they had, only in secular context, you know what I mean?  I'm not saying that they're ignorant.  It's just not on their radar.  I mean, they're busy doing other stuff, you know what I mean, for the kingdom of God.  But the Thabites of the world, the Russell Moores of the world, they've overplayed their hands so much that people are starting to be like, okay, what's the deal with this?  And so they're looking for information.  They're looking for my YouTube channel.  They're looking for people that are going to produce movies about this.  They're looking for blog posts about this.  They're looking.  And you know what they're going to find?  They're going to find Pulpit and Penn because Pulpit and Penn was talking about this stuff a long time ago.  And they're going to find that some people are telling the truth and others are obfuscating.  And the biggest thing they can say against some of us is, oh, they're too mean.  They're just too mean.  Now, look, at the end of the day, Do I agree with everything that Founders Ministry says or Pulpit and Pen says or Pastor Robert Truelove says or all these guys?  No, absolutely not.  But the point is, people are going to be looking for this information.  And guess what?  Once they find it, they're going to realize, you know what?  The Gospel Coalition hasn't really been telling me the truth all the time.  You know, the ERLC hasn't really been straightforward with me all the time.  And so you guys overplayed your hand and this movie is the result.  And I got to be honest with you, there's other movies like this coming out.  There's one called Enemies Within the Church.  There's some other things that are in the works and stuff like that.  And I'm looking forward to all of them because the more... available this information is for the common everyday folk.  who's not going to sit the sit back and read.  you know 100 articles a day from the gospel coalition but they will watch a movie like this.  so i'm glad i'm grateful for this kind of stuff.  i'm grateful for this because we need to clear up some of these issues.  we need to provide resources for people that they can easily consume while they're going about their everyday business while they're producing uh for the kingdom of god while they're working for their family while they're raising their kids and stuff like that.  this kind of stuff is going to be important.  and your little criticisms of oh they're too mean They're too mean and they're too aggressive.  It's not going to fly with everyday folks because everyday folks, they're not like you.  They're not like you.  They don't have these ivory towers where if anyone says a harsh word against a liberal, well, they're the devil.  That's just a fundamentalist.  They're not like you.  They like this stuff.  They eat it up.  And guess what?  They know that some of this stuff, this harsh language, it's not necessarily unbiblical, guys.  It just isn't.  You could write all the articles you want about how talking in aggressive ways is evil and wrong, and they know that they read the Bible.  They read the Bible.  Every day, Joe's in the pew.  Every day, Joe six-packs.  They read the Bible, and they see how people talk.  Godly men.  Godly men of valor, how they talk.  And they know.  What you're saying is not true.  So I'm looking forward to this movie.  I'm looking forward to all the other stuff coming out.  If you find my YouTube content helpful, go ahead and share it.  Leave a comment below.

Anyway, it's kind of a ramble, unfortunately, but I hope this is helpful.  God bless. ",
