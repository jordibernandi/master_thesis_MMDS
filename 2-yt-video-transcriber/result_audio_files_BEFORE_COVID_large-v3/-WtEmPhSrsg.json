            "text": "18.32 upload.  Now enjoy the rest of this video.  That's an order son.  So what we're going to do is we're going to open this up and we got to cut it.  It's got tape.  These are great to have.  I mean if you get a new firearm or you just change your sights or something and you don't want to have to go out to your gun range in order to sight them in and you want to make sure it's close.  I mean these things can be perfectly accurate.  But sometimes they're close to perfectly accurate.  So we're going to find out today if this is actually accurate or not.  I've never used this type of laser bore sider before.  I've used the ones that you put into where the bullet goes in.  in the chamber.  And I haven't had an issue with those.  Those actually, as far as accuracy, work great.  As far as how well they work, that's a whole other thing.  But these ones here, this should be very interesting.  So I'm going to try this out in a rifle and a revolver here just to test this and see if this is indeed accurate.  Okay.  So... It's got this tiny end that can fit in very small calibers, like .22, whatever.  And this goes all the way up to .50 caliber, so this will not work, as far as I know, in a shotgun.  This is too long to fit in the back of a shotgun, so I don't think you could chamber this and try to put this end in there with a laser or anything.  If you were going to do this on a shotgun, you would have to try to either make an adapter or find an adapter that's bigger.  Now, this comes with screws.  The screws are important.  It comes with three screws.  Basically, you've got to find the adapter that's right for your caliber.  And so what I'm going to do to get started, we're going to go ahead and install this battery.  Now, I believe this might be rechargeable.  Oh, it says do not recharge on the battery.  So it's not supposed to be rechargeable.  However, let's look at the voltage here.  Three volts.  Okay, so you unscrew the back here.  And then I'm not sure which way we put the battery in.  So I'm gonna go ahead and look at the manual real quick.  Manual doesn't tell me which way to put the battery as far as I can tell, but it does tell me not to point this at myself.  So let's go ahead and try putting it in this way since the spring is in this end that should be the ground.  Makes the most sense.  So we'll go ahead and try putting it together this way.  Ah, success.  See how close I can get this to my camera.  I just wanna go around the outside of it so you guys can see what this might look like.  This is a very bright green sight, green dot sight laser.  Look at that.  It's very bright.  So now what we're going to do is I'm going to go ahead and try to find an adapter for this that's going to fit something.  And so far, the easiest thing for me to do probably is just start with my revolver.  So I'm going to go ahead and do that.  There we go.  So this is 357 38 Special.  And one of these fits.  They're not labeled, so I don't know what size this one is.  But it looks like it's going to fit.  It comes with a screwdriver and a screw.  And the demonstration videos I found, basically, they're doing the same thing I'm doing.  They're just guessing which one is gonna fit.  Okay, so we're going to check and clear the revolver one more time.  A lot of people like to leave the cylinder open to prove that it's clear.  I'm not going to worry about that today.  Okay, so now what we're supposed to do is try to shove this into the end of the barrel.  I don't know if I need to screw it in at all, but it's in there.  You know, I don't like this.  It's flopping.  So I'm guessing that this plug is not big enough.  Either that or I just need to scoot this all the way back in here.  Yeah, it's flopping down.  So that's not going to work for the revolver.  Let me see if I can maybe get it cleared back into the cylinder.  I don't know if that's going to be accurate, but... Well, there we go.  So the front part is tight against the barrel and it's clear back, I think, into the cylinder.  So by that definition, I'm not sure how far it's actually in there, but the front should be straight.  And I'm just going to try this and see if this is going to work.  We might need to use a slightly larger adapter for the barrel, but I'm going to go ahead and just try this and see how accurate we are.  Okay, so the problem with doing it this way is that it's actually, the laser is about, it's a lot lower than where the actual sights are.  So I'm gonna go ahead and pull this out and try a different adapter.  All right, so this adapter is slightly larger than the barrel, I believe, and so hopefully this one will work a lot better.  I'm gonna really force this one in there.  if it will go okay.  so I am unable to get this to work with 357 Magnum 38 Special but I think it's designed more to work with rifles anyway.  so let's go ahead and give that a try.  alright.  so make sure this is clear one more time before I try this.  so just checked it to make sure it's clear now.  All right, so I've got this in the rifle.  I'm not sure if I have the right size adapter or not.  We're gonna see if this matches up.  Okay, so with this bore sider that I have here that you stick in the end of the barrel, this is kind of interesting.  So I tried using this on both my revolver and the rifle, and I have similar results.  And here's what I think is going on.  I think I figured this out.  For whatever reason, this thing, I think it's the rubber where it interfaces with the gun.  It gets around accurate.  It gets close to accurate.  But only sometimes in certain positions is it actually 100% accurate.  So I think that this tool is going to help you to get near perfect accuracy.  And then before you start sighting in your... your gun later on at the range.  So it's not perfect, but it definitely will help you to get somewhere around where it's supposed to be.  So that's what I think of this.  I think I still prefer the ones that you chamber, the boresiders that you actually chamber in the rifle or the handgun.  But it definitely does get you close.  It gets you close.  and sometimes that's all people are looking for with the boresighter.  They just want to be close, and then they fine-tune it later, because I don't think any boresighter is going to be perfect.  I have one that actually is perfect, and it doesn't function as good as this one does, but as far as accuracy, it's perfect and it's one that you put in the chamber.  The nice thing about this one is it's universal, so it will work in lots of different calibers, lots of different sizes, but I think you really need to play around with this one and try to make sure that it is in fact accurate before you use it.  The other thing you'll notice with this one is if I push on it at all, it moves.  I don't know if you can see that, but it moves really easily.  And that's part of the problem with this style is this just moves around in the end of the barrel.  And so it doesn't... it doesn't always point to center.  it doesn't always point to center and so it takes a little bit of fiddling around with it and seeing as how this one is perfectly sighted in this rifle as far as i can tell is perfectly sighted in because i've used it a couple times i i can't say that this is is pointing correctly.  i'll try.  i'm gonna try one more time.  uh it's so close.  It is really close.  So when I'm using this, it's either low or it's to the right just a little bit of where the actual sites are lined up where the actual center is. ",
