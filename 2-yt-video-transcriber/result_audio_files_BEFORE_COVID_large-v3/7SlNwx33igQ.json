So essentially what you're doing is you're treating another human being like your property.  Is that right?  No.  Because you're treating this as your property.  Well, if I can do whatever I want, this baby's inside of me, it's inconvenient to me, I can dispose of it, I can kill it.  Right?  I can use this, twist off a limb, pull it out, and that's okay.  That act of violence is okay because it's my property. ",

He operates two late-term abortion facilities and he says you can abort for whatever reason because it's your right up until the moment of birth and he commits late-term abortions every single week.  The two abortionists Albuquerque New Mexico the abortionists in the Denver Planned Parenthood they all commit late-term abortions.  women do choose late-term abortion and it's not for reason of there's a mental there's a physical risk to the mother because if that's the case you don't go to a dirty abortion facility you go to the hospital and you have your OBGYN treat you as two patients.  When women who are visibly nine months pregnant, visibly eight months pregnant, go to an abortion facility, they're choosing abortion because they feel like they have to, because it's environment, they're living in poverty, they have something, you know, the child has some fetal abnormality.  That's the reason they choose to abort their child.  You don't end suffering though, a potential suffering, by eliminating the sufferer.  That's not how it works, right?  Does that make sense? ",
