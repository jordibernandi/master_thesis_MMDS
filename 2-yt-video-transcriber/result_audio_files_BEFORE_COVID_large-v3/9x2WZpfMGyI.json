            "text": "Chick-fil-A.  I don't understand it.  I don't get it.  I've never understood it.  I don't understand the obsession with it.  I don't understand why Americans find it so necessary to talk about it all the time.  And I suppose that's kind of ironic because I'm talking about it now.  I've become my own worst nightmare.  I am everything I've ever hated.  But it's always just seemed like another fast food place.  It's like when people talk about the McRib and it's like, oh, the McRib is back.  Wow.  Have you heard?  Have you heard there was a McRib?  It was gone, but now it's back.  It's a pressed piece of cat mutton, but now we have it back.  It exists.  It's a thing, and it's here, so we should spend money on it because it's real food, and it's good for nothing.  I feel the exact same way about Chick-fil-A.  It seems like something that because you can't have it, because liberals and leftists haven't been able to eat it ever since they became part of the whole fiasco.  For those of you who don't know, by the way, quick background.  Chick-fil-A apparently was endorsing a handful of organizations that are anti-LGBTQIA+.  So, yeah, it turns out the owners of Chick-fil-A are kind of bigots.  And because of that, it became a politicized LA, whatever you want to call it.  On the right, people started suddenly taking great pride in eating Chick-fil-A publicly, making displays of it, buying Chick-fil-A, posting it on their Twitter.  This was a long time ago, by the way.  This was pre-woke advertising.  This is kind of like around the Keurig.  Sorry, it's even pre-Keurig era.  This was around the time of Sarah Palin.  Remember Sarah Palin?  Yeah, she used to be a real human that existed and did things.  So around that time, Chick-fil-A all of a sudden was all the rage.  If you were a liberal or anywhere further to the left of liberal, you would not ever eat there because it was sin.  After all, it was very anti-LGBTQIA+.  And then if you were right-winger, you would take pride in eating your Chick-fil-A because it would be like, yeah, I'm for free speech and I don't care about nothing.  I love my chicken.  And then recently, and I mean very, very recently, this happened as of, I believe, a day or two ago, Chick-fil-A decided to recant.  Inside the Chick-fil-A LGBTQ decision, the restaurant chain will stop donating to two organizations criticized by LGBTQ advocates, but is it enough to undo all the horrors that Chick-fil-A has wrought upon the world?  Chick-fil-A has announced that it will not review its controversial multi-year commitments to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of the Ring, protests over the fast food chain's anti-LGBTQ Image have led to closings and cancellations of new restaurant locations.  LGBTQ advocate organizations.  GLAAD says it regards that decision with cautious optimism.  Republican commentator and Christian minister Mike Huckabee tweets that he felt betrayed.  And he's not the only one.  In fact, a lot of people feel betrayed by this.  They feel that Chick-fil-A has caved to the woke culture, if you will.  The woke scolding of... fast foodery, which every major decision done by a board of CEOs, because at the end of the day, they do have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to keep bringing them Chick-fil-A delicious meals, keep bringing them more money.  That's basically the end.  all be all of all these kinds of decisions.  They want more people to eat Chick-fil-A chicken.  So because of that, they probably decided, hey, at this point, if we simply don't donate to these two charities, we'll get more customers because we'll bring all the people who didn't eat Chick-fil-A out of heat.  back into the fold.  That's what basically happened.  Sorry, that's what basically happened.  The fried chicken fast food chain has long faced scrutiny because of its ties to anti-LGBTQ organizations.  In 2012, the chain's CEO, Dan T. Cathy, spoke against marriage equality, according to New York Times.  In a non-profit started by Cathy's father, Winshape was donating to anti-LGBTQ organizations before the restaurant opened its own charitable arm, the Chick-fil-A Foundation.  Although the foundation indicates in 2012 that it would stop donating to groups that discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community, The donations continued.  So they basically lied about it.  All in all, it's just a shitty fast food chain doing what shitty fast food chains do, which is basically poisoning humanity and doing so at the cost of Earth.  Because it's McDonald's that's clear-cutting a lot of rainforests to make room for more cattle.  And their products, they're not good for you.  They're really not.  They contain the things that are very rare in nature, which is what?  Sugar, fat, and salt.  And because of that, it's delicious.  And I am a victim of all three of those things.  Once I get them in my body, I want more of them in my body.  So that's that.  Why is all this pertinent?  Well, two reasons.  One... I saw the other day that Ahsan Piker has announced that he is now able to eat Chick-fil-A and he's super excited.  Again, I don't get it.  You live in LA.  There's so much good food in LA.  There's so many amazing chicken places.  And I'm not talking like chicken chains.  I'm like, you can go to, I'm sure, 1,000 fried chicken places and get your chicken fix, whatever that be.  But the reason this is all... Relatively pertinent to us.  Well, A, this is obviously upset Tim Pool to no end.  Let's very, very briefly give ourselves two seconds of Tim Poolery here.  Let's do a 1.5 Tim Pool and see how long we can last. ",

The Daily Wire reports, the Salvation Army responded on Monday to reports that Chick-fil-A was cutting ties with a Christian organization over its support for traditional marriage by noting that it's the largest social services provider in the world and that it serves millions of members of the LGBT community.  Quote, We're saddened to learn that a corporate partner has felt it necessary to divert funding to other hunger, education, and homelessness organizations, areas in which the Salvation Army, as the largest social services provider in the world, is already fully committed.  The Salvation Army said in a statement, we serve more than 23 million individuals a year, including those in the LGBTQ plus community.  In fact, we believe we are the largest provider of poverty relief to the LGBTQ population.  I don't know if that matters at all, but all of my friends, we go to the Salvation Army all the time and go thrift shopping.  So let's just see what the conclusion is.  I bow out.

Because there's nothing more high-leveled ideas... Then Dave Rubin, especially when it comes to Chick-fil-A, especially when it comes to his history of talking about Chick-fil-A.  Now, Dave Rubin, probably, I'd say, easily the king of the griff, right?  I mean, probably a toss-up between him and Candace Owens.  They go neck and neck for who has the title of the king of the griff.  But I'd say, bar none, Dave Rubin.  Dave Rubin would sell out every single value if it got him a penny.  Not even a penny.  I'm sure if it got him just like an ounce of lint, he would sell out that value on that given day.  And so when it comes to Dave Rubin and his history with Chick-fil-A, it's changed over time, as you might imagine, right?  So like most people, he learns, he grows, he evolves, he becomes a proto-Rubin, if you will.  He tries to achieve his ultimate form, his super saiyan levels of Dave Rubinry.  And Jose did a really, really good cover of this.  So, did you guys know that Chick-fil-A has defective chicken?  They only have a right wing.  At LOLGOP.  At indecision.  Oh, oh, Dave.  Oh, Dave, that's rich.  That's rich.  What else do you got for us?  Well, I mean, you know, times do change, as do opinions.  Hi, I'm Dave.  I'm married to Duve, and I eat chicken sandwiches whenever I want.  It's time to choose where your loyalties lie, with the queer community or with your stomach.  See that Chick-fil-A?  And see that Libs?  You see that?  Dave Rubin, an openly gay man, an openly gay married man will still eat Chick-fil-A because he eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants.  That's just how Dave Rubin roll.  That's just how Dave Rubin party.  Now check this out.  Today.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  The decision makes absolutely no sense.  Chick-fil-A was actually cool because it stood up to progressive mind virus, which is a cancel culture.  The mind virus.  I'm not going back to that sad, dry, pathetic Burger King chicken sandwich.  No way, no how.  Back to the home-cooked frying pan.  And of course, you know, he's retweeting Ben Shapiro.  Makes no sense.  No surprise there that Ben Shapiro is immensely upset about this.  Chick-fil-A has survived and thrived because they served everyone and refused to cater to cancel culture.  Now they've caved at the behest of the censorist left.  It wasn't like.  all of a sudden the vitriol against Chick-fil-A was turned up to 11.  The dial of ideas wasn't turned up to 11 in this case.  And all of a sudden, everyone was talking about how much they hated Chick-fil-A.  Oh, no, no.  All that really happened in this case was that they decided of their own free will that they're not going to continue to donate to two specific charities.  That was it.  Oh, Dave Rubin.  And so, you know, props to Jose for this.  Dave Rubin, 2012.  I refuse to eat at the homophobic restaurant.  Dave Rubin, 2018.
