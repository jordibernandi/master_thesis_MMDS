            "text": "So Nancy said the AG lied and that's a crime.  They call for him to resign and all this kind of stuff.  Some of them.  Nancy kind of gets on my nerves right about now.  She says everything about everybody else except Trump.  I need you to talk to him, please.  But I get it.  She's playing her strategy, but good Lord.  Right, put this in fast forward please.  Like enough is enough.  So, bar.  Will you resign?  No.  Will they make you resign?  Because you just lied.  Worry and stress.  Worry and stress.  Ace of coins.  Um, that's not money.  What is that?  Opportunity.  Yeah, there's an offer.  The Four of Cups.  Five of Cups is disappointment and regret.  Seven of Wands.  Defending.  Ten of Wands, Burden, after the Regret.  Ten of Swords is a Loss.  Five of Wands is Fighting.  Nine of Cups.  Desire and Wishful Thinking.  And the Magician is the Liar, the Deceiver.  persons with the skills to do so.  now over the phone.  William Barr and his spirits are very good at deceiving.  it took me a while to even understand who he was.  So right now, it says William Barr, Fred Flintstone himself, is worried and stressed out.  The opportunity is here to resign.  There is an offer to do so.  He is regretful.  He is defending on that offer.  He is burdened and worn out.  The fighting and the loss and the wishful thinking and like it's all just so much.  Oh, I'm so burdened.  Woe is me.  Oh my God.  That's him now.  That's what it says.  William Barr's readings are done.  He comes out with sort of the halo, like he's regretful.  I don't believe for a second he is regretful at all.  So let's do some different cards and see if we get the same thing.  Queen of Wands.  Nancy Pelosi, she did say that you lied to Congress and that is a crime, she said.  Lovers her and her constituents not constituent colleagues.  Page of Pentacles starting new Celebration.  three of cups.  two of Pentacles balance the fool Devil.  King of cups that is you Emperor and the Sun.  This was about Pelosi.  I don't want to know about Pelosi.  I don't really care about Pelosi right now.  William Barr.  Is he regretful?  Just give me three.  There's that Five of Wands again.  Knight of Swords rushing ahead.  Five of Wands is fighting.  Six of Wands, celebrated person.  The victory.  You know, it feels as though... The only thing that he's really regretful for is that the plan... The plan did not have the desired... Can't get that out.  The desired effect.  Like, it didn't go according to plan.  So... Let's start over.  William Barr.  You lied.  That's a crime.  Will you resign?  So let's go present, past, we'll do a past.  Emotional investments.  Presence.  King of Swords and the Emperor.  You interrupt side by side.  Let's go.  influences.  Strategy.  What's your negative?  Plans, you're positive.  Your relationships, your outcomes.  Defending.  You're not going to resign.  You're going to fight this.  Where they impeach you is a whole different thing.  What are your regrets?  Any?  Yeah, the desired effect of your plan was to have infighting.  Was to have the Democrats sort of implode.  That's not happening yet, anyway.  So, will he resign?  No.  Will they impeach him?  That's a different thing.  I don't know.  We shall see.  But he is not regretful at all.  Whatsoever. ",
