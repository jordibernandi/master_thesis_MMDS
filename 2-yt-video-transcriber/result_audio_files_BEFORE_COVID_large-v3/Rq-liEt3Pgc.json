            "text": "When they're not researching people on the internet to perform a hot read on someone, those claiming to be psychics love to edit out or gloss over all of their failed predictions and pass their lucky guesses off as paranormal powers.  They usually get away with it too, managing to fool 41% of Americans into believing that psychic powers exist.  They know that most people won't take the time to go and fact check them.  And that's where I come in.  I'm here to show you the bigger picture.  The psychic cringe fails.  Enjoy.  She is a nationally known Chicago psychic who has a unique way of seeing the future through coffee.  I pour regular coffee into a cup, and then I'm able to see, when I pour cream into it, I'm able to see letters, numbers, body parts, faces.  That's called your reflection.  Everything in the coffee.  Bullshit.  You're talking bullshit.  I used to drink 30 to 40 cups of coffee a day.  Prince William?  Prince William.  And Kate?  I've been saying this for a while, but I really see twins.  Didn't you say that last year or the year before?  When they got married, the year they got married, you said that.  She did say twins.  We have it on tape.  The year that they got married.  So that would be really strange if that did happen.  Well, they're saying that's the reason why she has such bad morning sickness right now.  So, how'd she do?  The royal couple had announced their pregnancy almost a month before this prediction and gave birth to... not twins.  but they got pregnant again and two years later gave birth to not twins.  but they got pregnant again and gave birth to not twins.  we decided to put the celebrity medium to the test.  we asked her to meet us at the most haunted spot in new york city.  oh who wants to find an old haunted village?  I'll tell you what I heard.  It could be your mother saying this.  I have to wait a minute or two.  You have Uncle Jimmy?  Uncle James?  No.  Why say yes?  She got many things wrong, like what my children look like.  I just see one thinner and one is regular or a little maybe heftier.  I'm looking at body type.  No, both are pretty sick.  Personal details.  You didn't lose a baby?  No.  Like a miscarriage or something?  No, no, no.  All right.  But sometimes she got close.  You have one sister?  Is her name like Sheila or Shasha?  I keep hearing Shasha.  Her name is Sandra.  Meh.  M-E-H.  Meh.  Your mother, is it true that she helped raise somebody else's daughter?  Okay, sure.  Yes, it's true.  She has another sister.  What's the other sister's name?  Give me a minute, okay?  Diane.  Is it?  It is.  I was surprised that she got the names wrong.  That's what she said.  But on a hunch, I decided to Google myself, and there it was.  My mom's obituary.  In it, Aunt Diane's name, among other details.  Are you wondering what your favorite celebrity will be up to in 2016?  Well, we've enlisted the help of psychic medium Cindy Tryon to share what's in store for the stars this year.  Let's start with Lady Gaga.  They show me that there's a marriage coming up for her, but there's somebody trying to put a roadblock or there's some interference coming is what they're telling me.  But I see hands that are going to be very strong, united, and they're showing me that the marriage is going to go through.  Whatever the issues.  According to TMZ and People, Gaga and Taylor have officially ended their engagement after months of speculation that they were on the outs.  Edward Arthur Dames perfected remote viewing methods and techniques, employing his technical remote viewing training, which guarantees commercial clients an unprecedented 100% data accuracy rate.  We have an economic collapse a little over a year from now.  Very quickly, we have deforestation, and we're looking at a barren earth.  People are going to start moving underground and into habitats or strong structures, but food is going to be an extreme problem.  Do you know, offhand, how many of us get plowed under?  Looks like around 80%, possibly 85% nominally.  Grim.  This is totally bleak.  How much confidence do you have in this?  And economic collapse and the pathogen 100%, or I wouldn't be talking about it on the show.  Is this irreversible?  It's out of our hands right now.  This will begin about a year, a little more than a year from now.  We'll see this.  Boy, I didn't have a hint.  this one was coming, folks.  Believe it or not, despite having an abysmal prediction record, allegedly worse than chance, Ed Dames is still predicting the end of the world any day now.  It's going to be a Mad Max scenario.  That's what you're going to be confronted with.  It is absolutely critical or you're going to die.  Fear-mongering to sell his remote viewing course.  Put your life back in your hands and obtain the information that may be the deciding factor for your survival.  Wait a minute, did that just say zombie apocalypse?  It totally did.  To find out what my future holds, I'm booking appointments wired up with hidden cameras.  What is it saying about my relationships?  Marriage, kids?  No, not marriage right now.  What I do see is that you haven't met your soulmate yet, but you will.  But it does show a relationship for you happening next year.  A relationship next year, but no marriage.  No marriage, not for right now.  Tell that to my wife.  Sorry, honey.  It also shows me she has an accent.  She's not American.  Remember, I'm already married.  She's an American, and no, she doesn't have an accent.  If you make a fit, I'll tell you how many kids you're going to have.  Two.  I'm going to have two kids?  Yep.  What are the sexes?  Well, it seems like you're having boys.  All boys.  That's it.  Nope.  I have two daughters and one son.  Do you see kids for me?  I'm going to have them, but not right now.  Whoops, wrong again.  After we're done, I go back to properly introduce myself.  Hi again.  I'm actually from NBC News, and we're doing a story about psychic readings.  Oh, my God.  I didn't see that one coming.  I didn't even see it coming.  I didn't see that one coming.  You didn't see it coming.  I didn't see that coming.  I didn't see that coming.  I didn't see that coming.  Are these readings not accurate?  No, they aren't.  But I am married and I have kids.  I understand that.  And sometimes within a reading, it'll pick up a past life.  That's not what you told me, though.  Yes.  Listen, if you want your money back, I will give it back to you.  If you don't, then you need to get out of my store.  Hi.  The woman who just gave me the reading.  No, she stepped out.  Is she coming back?  Not working.  So we come back later.  They've now put this metal gate in front of the door.  It's the lock.  and even try a third time.  Everybody's talking about three weeks away from new president, the year of Trump.  There's a lot of opposition around him this year and possibly impeachment within this year.  Well, next year, money.  Oh, really?  In 2017?  That soon?  Yeah.  Interesting.  If I give you guys like a name of a YouTuber, do you feel anything?  And then if it's too far, we'll cut it out.  Let's start with PewDiePie.  Yeah, I feel like he's, um, I also see him moving a little bit away from it too.  I do too.  Within a couple of years, he's wanting to transition out of it eventually.  Cause I feel like he's kind of hit, not hit a wall, but he's kind of hit the ceiling with what he can accomplish with it.  And I feel like he's kind of wanting to do something different.  So I think in a couple of years he could transition into something else.  Whoa, holy moly!  Oh wait, that's from an article before this reading.  Here's what actually happened.  It's been four years and PewDiePie is still putting out content at an insane rate.  He went toe-to-toe with the entire nation of India, fighting a massive media conglomerate for his throne as the most subscribed to channel, quadrupling in size, and as I record this, he literally just broke 100 million subscribers.  He's kind of hit the ceiling with what he can accomplish with it.  Here, let me serve your bitch lasagna.  The person that passed with the overdose, what's the relationship specifically to you?  My father.  Your dad.  Okay.  Does he have a brother who's also passed?  No.  Yes, he does.  He only has a sister.  There's another male that's with your dad on the same level.  There's a J or G connection to that family.  His... His wife.  Would be the J or G?  Yes.  Does she have the brother figure who's passed?  Yes.  No.  There is a male contemporary to your dad on the same level.  So if this is your father, you either have a father-in-law, an uncle, there's another male that's on that same level.  that's there.  I can't think of any.  Sure you do.  I got all night.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  He has a sister.  Okay.  Unless she has a penis, it's not her.  And she only, and she only has, his wife only has sisters.  There's a male contemporary and there's a J or G connection that comes up.  So if your dad's acknowledging the alcohol and or drugs or the consumption of how he got there, I'm telling you there's another male contemporary that he's got.  Husband, brother, cousin, friend.  It's on the same level that he would be on.  There's a J or G connection that comes up with this.  No, nothing I can think of.  Yeah.  I just want to make sure that it's me that you're talking about.  That's my job, not yours.  Oh, okay.  You're fired.  Our horses are horses, of course, of course.  And no one can talk to our horses, of course, of course.  Can I talk to your horses?  Oh, honey.  When you tighten his girth at first, you're doing it too fast.  He doesn't mind it tight because it's too fast.  Do you ever notice that with him?  No.  Oh, honey.  he says his hoof inside the front right is silver.  his sword yeah does he feel lame to you at all?  oh honey what did you think about it?  did you believe it?  did you believe it?  i would say that i'm skeptical.  how about you?  Ah, fake laugh.  Hiding real pain.  There's still no sign this morning of a Malaysian Airlines jet that disappeared nearly 72 hours ago.  Sea or land?  I don't see it in the sea.  Okay.  I don't see it in the sea.  I don't believe that it is in the water.  I don't.  Malaysia's Prime Minister says investigators have a positive ID on a piece of plane wreckage that washed up on a tropical island off the coast of Africa.  This broken bit of airplane wreckage washed up on the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean.  When someone dies unexpectedly, they kind of remain earthbound, so they relive what happens to them.  So they stay attached to that area or they kind of stay attached to where they last were.  because they're thinking, am I dead?  I don't know.  Because time and space collapses.  This guy is so full of crap that if he was Pinocchio, NASA would have commissioned his nose as scaffolding for a space elevator.  So whether it's a hundred years or it's ten years or five years or five days, time is an illusion for spirits.  So it's all as one.  I saw a similar sort of theory written out on a wall, but it was written in shit.  It was the roundings of someone you'd find by themselves in a hospital eating flies.  I really feel that that plane is intact and I, honest to God, feel that not everyone is dead.  Were you very young when your dad passed?  No.  There's a young, well, what do you consider very young?  My dad just passed two years ago.  Okay.  I'd like to think I was very young.  We've got my psychic bananas ready to predict your futures.  We're going to go to our first call.  Will Wales win the football on Friday, says Erin.  And the answer is... That's the perfect yes.  Can you see the why?  Yeah, that is a big, big yes.  Well, I sure could be wrong here, but I get such a great sense for the White Sox this year.  The White Sox.  I really do.  I really do.  The White Sox were the second worst team in their entire league that year.  You are literally a worse psychic than a banana.

There's a western pull, so I don't know if somebody's out there now, or if somebody was out there when this happened, if somebody had just gotten back from the west. ",
