            "text": "Hey, this is the Giggling Conservative, and it's time for the Giggling Report.  All right, welcome to Wednesday's episode.  We'll get right into it, okay?  An SUV plowed into a barrier toward President Trump's motorcade in Alabama.  Details regarding the incidents are sparse.  It's standard for the Secret Service and local law enforcement to clear the route traveled by the presidential motorcade.  In this instance, traffic on the other side of the interstate was left alone.  The driver of the SUV reportedly claimed he swerved to avoid a vehicle you can't even see in the footage.  that stopped ahead of him to watch the motorcade pass by.  Seems entirely likely that the incident was the result of nothing more than the motorist rubbernecking as the presidential limo and its associated convoy rolled by at full steam in the other direction.  But the lack of malice doesn't undermine the potential threat posed by an out-of-control SUV.  A head-on collision at highway speeds could potentially be lethal for any occupants in an armored limousine, just as it would be for someone traveling in a non-armored car.  As many have said before, it's not the speed that kills, it's the sudden stop.  Now, all that said, given the hatred for our president by the deep state in Washington, Could this have been a sly, veiled assassination attempt by the deep state?  Would it surprise you if it was?  It wouldn't surprise me at all.  A president who has done nothing but good things for the American people and tries every day to keep us safe and secure.  America is prospering and the Democrats are angry about that.  They're angry about it because it gives them no platform to run on in 2020.  Democrats have not been this mad at Republicans since we took away their slaves from them in the 1860s.  I believe Democrats will stop at nothing to get rid of our president.  President Trump, I support you and I'm always praying for your safety and your success.  A successful president, whether he be Republican or Democrat, means success for all the American people.  Democrats want him to fail the Democrat party of today.  What does that tell you about how Democrats feel about the citizens that they're supposed to represent?  And that's my report for today.  You guys have a good one.  Think about it.  What was this all about?  What's going on? ",
