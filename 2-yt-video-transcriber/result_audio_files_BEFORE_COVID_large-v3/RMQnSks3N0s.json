            "text": "The Federal Reserve has cut rates a second time this year, but I guarantee you it will not be the last.  So this week, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, or a nominal 0.25%, in an effort to, in their own words, keep this economy strong.  So did it?  Did it work?  Did it have the desired effect?  Well, the stock market did end down this week, but let's take a look at what happened on Friday.  So on Friday, we had a 140-point drop in the Dow Jones index in a five-minute period.  So I'd say it's anything but a safe stock market, even with the Federal Reserve overly eager to pump money into it through all of their various tools, as they call them.  So here's really an interesting story.  A billionaire, former CEO of Overstock, sold his entire $90 million stake in the company so he could convert it into gold, silver, and cryptocurrency investments.  So here we have Patrick Byrne selling off all his holdings and then saying that he wanted to invest in some counter cyclical assets.  So clearly, He sees the cycle of the current equities and stocks bubble, if you want to call it that.  I call it a bubble, being near its end.  So now is a great time to get into gold and silver.  If you are a wise billionaire with your ear to the ground, listening to what's going on on Wall Street.  So here we have an article that says, the Fed loses control of its own interest rate just as it cut rates, and it doesn't look good.  So it says, it's been a turbulent week in the overnight funding markets where short-term rates spiked to levels as high as 10% Monday and Tuesday before the Fed calmed it down.  So the Fed was forced to do two open market operations.  And basically what they did was they pumped $75 billion into the system overnight, two nights in a row.  And then they had to do it a third night.  So what they actually ended up deciding was that they're going to keep pumping money into the system for the next 14 days, anywhere from $30 billion to $75 billion a shot.  And so the conservative estimate then is half a trillion dollars.  But the most liberal estimate, and probably the realistic one, is over $1 trillion to be pumped into the financial system over the next 14 days.  So let me ask you, is the economy really that strong when the central bank has to print money and pump it into the system by the trillions?  So here we have across the pond, the European Central Bank doing more quantitative easing.  Again, just more central banks printing money.  And you have some concerns growing.  Of course, you have a small number of people, which it points out in this article, being extremely pleased.  But then you have most people saying, okay, printing money is not actually going to create prosperity.  Here we have a quote, you're sucking future demand into the present.  And let's just go ahead and highlight the word sucking because that's exactly what they're doing.  So yeah, not looking good around the globe for fiat currencies and this current globalism economic model.  here we have from kitco.com gold and silver setting up for a big move.  we have an analyst at kitco talking about how gold is forming a solid bottom support level here around 1500. you know gold's been around 1500 for the last couple of months.  it's broken out of some key levels and it really has nowhere to go but up considering all of the um frantic movements by central banks to try to keep the economy strong.  so everybody out there who wants to be like these wise billionaires who are converting their money to gold and silver I want to encourage you to take a look at the link below.  I'm putting in this video and I have three free money-making gifts for your retirement.  um gift number one is a gold ira kit.  so if you have a 401k which is coming due and you can roll it over or transfer it this is going to be for you if you have an existing ira or a roth ira or if you just have a bunch of money saved up.  a gold ira is a great way to get in on gold and silver physical gold and silver while at the same time retaining all the tax benefits of a traditional ira.  so it is free.  go ahead and check out that link below and you get a couple of extra gifts.  You get the top seven ways to make money as a retiree, which is a small little book, a guide that I just wrote and uploaded to Amazon Kindle, as well as a specific income blueprint here, Move Over Rover, also for sale on the web and on Amazon Kindle.  I'm giving you both of these for free today because I want you to have some information moving forward to give you the confidence that you're always gonna have money when you're retired.  So moving on, we've been told we live in a consumer-based economy.  So don't worry about the fact that the United States has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years.  Don't worry that we're moving all the corporations to Asia where They don't have to pay taxes, but they do have to give away all their trade secrets to super corrupt, tyrannical, authoritarian governments.  Don't worry about it, okay?  We're going to spend our way out of this mess.  Well, this article says we're not.  New recession warning, the rich aren't spending.  It says luxury retailers are struggling while discounters like Walmart and Target thrive.  High-end real estate is having its worst year since the financial crisis.  And in the first half of 2019, art auction sales are down for the first time in years as the most expensive cars at Pebble Beach Car Auctions didn't even get off the auction block.  So... All of those poor, poor, super wealthy people, you know, when you can't afford your million dollar Lamborghinis, what's the world coming to?  So speaking of super rich people not spending money, here we have Warren Buffett with $122 billion in cash sitting on the sidelines.  And this article from Markets Insider says it could be a worrying sign for stock markets.  Yeah, you see the thing is Warren Buffett is the third richest guy in America and he has a history of conservative investing.  So when he pulls over half of his money out of the market, What that tells me is that he doesn't see much upside left for the stock market and he is positioning himself to come in maybe in the near term or medium term and buy up assets once they correct in value.  I really think that's what's going on here and this should be sort of a warning to people out there who have money in stocks.  Here we have an article from CNBC.  A sell-off worse than December can arrive in a week.  says analyst who is predicting a Lehman-like drop.  Says the U.S.  stock market is facing its greatest test of the year thus far.  He is pointing to movements in the market which show an uncanny resemblance between now and 2008.  And he is extremely bearish on the stock market.  And so he's saying something worse than the Great Depression could happen.  What it all boils down to is a black swan event.  It could be political, financial.  I mean, it just gets worse by the day.  When the Federal Reserve comes out and says, we're willing to print a trillion dollars in money just to keep the system moving so that these companies can take out these short-term loans, which are sort of a necessary fact of life, for these large companies and corporations having to take extremely short-term loans, sometimes anywhere from hours to a day.  These aren't long-term loans, and now big banks are refusing to give those loans out.  And the government's having to step in.  Here we have Netflix dropping.  We have the first drop in subscribers in its core market since 2011, wiping out $17 billion in Netflix stock value recently.  We have inventories rising around the world.  We have record negative yielding debt.  It says here that the market value of global negative yielding debt has surpassed $16 trillion for the first time in history.  So if you think you're going to hide your money in bonds, you simply are not going to be able to anymore.  We have negative rates, which are becoming more and more common, and it's at historical highs.  It says 30% of investment-grade bonds now globally yield below zero.  So why would you buy them?  We have unsold inventory for top real estate developers scaling new high in fiscal year 2019.  This is coming out of India.  At the same time, we have semiconductor chip inventories at problematic levels, according to investment bank Morgan Stanley.  So we just have a slowdown in the entire economy.  We have residential rents rising at the fastest pace in years in New York.  This is happening in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.  Even as home prices are dropping, we still have the rent market filling up.  And now it's getting hard just to rent an apartment.  This never used to be like this in America.  And there's a lot of reasons for this.  But even people who are able to buy homes, we have... Dual income families, people earning a combined 100K a year or more, being at risk when they buy a new home these days, when you factor in all the other extra fees they're having to pay, homeowner association, taxes, all kinds of stuff like that.  And it's just setting up for something like 2007 to happen again.  So we have U.S.  companies still trying to get rid of their inventories.  We have durable goods inventory sales ratio hitting the highest point since 2016.  And the slower accumulation dragged down the latest GDP growth figure.  We have orders for heavy trucks plunging 80% in August.  This is something I've been keeping an eye on.  And we have a transportation recession, which has basically begun in October of 2018.  So we're coming up on a one-year anniversary of heavy truck orders being in the red.  And there's some significant drops, even much lower than just three years ago when we had a bump in the road, if you will.  Now, how are things doing in the world's second largest economy?  Well, you have China auto sales tumbling 6.9% in August.  You have India essentially crashing.  Their passenger vehicle sales are down for a 30% plunge in August.  And at the same time, it makes sure to point out in this article that sales in China fell for a 13th straight month in July.  Continuing an 11% slide for the year to date.  So all of this hype about the trade wars, you know, Trump and China, look, has nothing to do with India and China, you know, the fifth and the second largest world economy, you know, not being able to buy cars for their middle class equivalent there or not being able to sell, you know, high-end real estate in India and the United States.  This is global.  Here we have Germany, which is the world's fourth largest economy.  German institutes see recession and cut growth forecast for 2019 and 2020.  So again, it takes two quarters of negative growth before they officially announce a recession.  But with all the manipulated data, I think it is safe to assume at this point that we are on the front door of the recession, the next one anyway.  And some people are predicting it's going to be much, much worse than a recession.  It's going to be another depression.  Now, the reason for that is because of the bubbles in all of the sectors.  You have bubbles in student loans.  You have bubbles in the stock market.  You have a bubble in bonds, which is why the yield curve is inverting because more and more people are buying bonds.  And they're also speculating in bonds, like the price of a bond is going way up because the too-big-to-fill banks are in on the game once again.  You have a subprime mortgage loan bubble again brewing because people, again, housing prices are dropping, but not so much that it's meeting the consumer and the regular wage earner halfway.  Again, they're still underwater, even making 100K a year.  You have an auto loan bubble.  You have auto loan defaults at record highs.  You have negative yielding debt at record highs.  Corporate debt, record highs.  Personal debt, record highs.  The only thing that's left is gold and silver.  That has any upward trajectory.  That may be if you get in on the ground floor of some great companies that only you know about.  So again, check out that link below because I am giving you a free gold IRA kit, which is going to be very helpful for you if you have money in a traditional IRA, you have money saved up, you're trying to retire, and you don't want to be drugged down in the next market downturn, which is about due.  Remember, you get those extra free gifts, which are very helpful.  They will give you more confidence going into retirement, seeing that, well, there's still ways to make money without cutting off your SSI and your Social Security benefits.  But most importantly is just prepare, you know.  This is the perfect opportunity because it's like where if you've ever, you know, have you ever rode a roller coaster?  and you know that the roller coaster goes tick, tick, tick and it ticks all the way up to the top very slow and then it dives off and I feel like we're getting to the very top of that.  before something is going to cause things to crash.  It's already happening around the globe in various sectors and markets.  So there are a lot of warning signs out there.  So you really have a choice.  Are you going to believe the Federal Reserve, which is pumping money into the economy and printing money like they're running out of paper?  Or are you going to believe your own eyes and your own mind and your own brain reading? ",
