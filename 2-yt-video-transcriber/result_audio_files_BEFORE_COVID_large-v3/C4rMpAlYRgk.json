So, long story short, and this is going to be long here, but the short version is a guy petitions the court to have his son removed, his two-year-old son, from his mother because she's keeping the kids in danger and he thinks the kid's going to die.  The court doesn't do it.  The kid ends up dead.  Dad's pissed.  And he's mad at the judge who let the mom keep it.  And the judge is some liberal female is what I'll call her.  But anyway, she gets her panties in a knot because he starts talking about her and she wants him arrested.  Has the agency arrest him on a trumped up charge because he's post and post about her, even though when the agency did the investigation, they said he made no threats.  So he didn't make any threats.  They charged him.  They let him out on bail.  He got out on bail, made another post, and part of his bail condition was he couldn't get back on social media, which I'm not sure if they can make that a bail condition.  Evidently they did, and now he's sitting in jail after his kid's dead when he tried to get help from government, and government put him in jail, and this freaking nasty, vindictive witch judge made his bail a half a million or a quarter million dollars, so he can't get out of jail.  Absolutely outrageous abuse of authority from this jail.  I'm going to go through a lot of things.  There's a change.  There's an impeach this judge.  There's some contact information on her.  This is going to be probably a little long video, but man, I'm telling you.  People ought to be outraged when government gets to do what they want unchecked.  And this woman is up here pushing her.  She's probably a single mom.  It says she has two kids.  Probably a single mom, hates men, brags about how she used to work domestic violence cases, which normally mean always men getting charged, no women getting charged.  So she's on some women's rights victory march.  He, I am woman.  Hear me roar.  And now she's going to trash this dude after his son dies.  This is outrageous behavior.  courts for the tragic loss of his little boy is locked up tonight.  But is it justified? ",
