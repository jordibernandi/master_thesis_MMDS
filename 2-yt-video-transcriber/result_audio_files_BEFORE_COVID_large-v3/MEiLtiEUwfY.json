            "text": "The Labour Party conference last month, the Labour Party shadow cabinet last week said that Labour wanted a general election and then negotiate a new Brexit deal and then put it to the people in a referendum.  But John McDonnell, as late as this day, is openly demanding a second referendum now, before a general election, before a renegotiated Labour deal.  And he's supposed to be number two in the Labour Party's hierarchy.  All over the country, candidates supporting Jeremy Corbyn are being kept off short lists, even long lists, in favour of people they scarcely know, if they know at all.  There's one in Nottingham I've just been reading about, where a woman... who is the chair of the constituency Labour Party, has failed to make the long list of candidates.  And the police have just been called this day to the Labour Party's selection meeting.  So, frankly, it's the end for Jeremy Corbyn.  His Brexit policy is not being followed even by his closest colleagues.  His chief of staff has been banished from his office.  retaining the name and the salary, but banished to another building, another part of central London.  His candidates are not even being allowed onto the ballot paper in local selections, such as they are.  And of course, the general election is who knows when. ",
