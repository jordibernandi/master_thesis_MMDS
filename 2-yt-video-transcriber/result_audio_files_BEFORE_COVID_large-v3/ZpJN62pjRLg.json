I'll rectify your oversight in mine.  Anyone who wants to see the Science Daily article Jacob is referencing can go read it.  The first thing you'll notice is the title of the article completely refutes what Jacob is trying to peddle here.  It clearly says that homosexual behaviour is largely shaped by genetics.  Like everything, there is also an environmental aspect.  But let's read a bit of what the article has to say.  Quote.  Dr.  Quasi-Rahman, study co-author and leading scientist on human sexual orientation, explains, This study puts cold water on any concerns that we are looking for a single gay gene or a single environmental variable which could be used to select out homosexuality.  The factors which influence sexual orientation are complex.  We are not simply talking about homosexuality here.  Heterosexual behavior is also influenced by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors.  end quote.  Now this clearly indicates that you can't just isolate one environmental or genetic component and suddenly turn yourself gay or straight.  And we see this later in that same article when it says, quote, the study shows that genetic influences are important but modest, and that non-shared environmental factors, which may include factors operating during fetal development, dominate.  Importantly, heredity had roughly the same influence as shared environmental factors in women and whereas the latter had no impact on sexual behavior in men.  End quote.  Unless you're going to invade the womb and somehow try to untangle the incredibly complex way that humans develop, you're not going to stop the gay, Jacob.  But I do find it tragically comical that the love thy neighbor crowd often seems to only love thy neighbor when it suits them and their twisted ideology. ",

Gendered stereotypes and behaviors do change over time and over cultures.  Actually, if you look at our own culture in the early 1900s, pink was the boy color and blue was the girl color.  I feel like you're so close to grasping that a lot of these gendered expressions are societally imposed, which is weird because later on in this video you swing into biological essentialism.  Like you say here that the idea of girls playing with dolls is a culturally ingrained one, man-made, but then later in this video you claim that women are like inherently more caring and better at that than men are.

Now perhaps not all of the societal roles given to us by our society are the result of our biological functions, but that goes beyond the point.  The point is that there have been established differences between male and female behavior which correlate with their biology.  While homosexuality is said to be the result of environmental and cultural factors, we can see that a woman's behavior is actually the opposite of that and the result of their actual biology.  So based on those biological differences, the role of a male and female are established.  They're established to cater to those differences, generally speaking.  Women, for example, have evolved to be more nurturing and caring because they're the children bearers.  They're the ones who bring babies into the world.  And so according to evolution, they acquired this nurturing and caring behavior.  Many women, unlike men, establish a bond with their child. ",

            "text": "Well, science disagrees with you, Jacob.  Take this article that shows that after a few days, oxytocin levels between a female and male grandparent evened out, which is a hormone associated with maternal bonding.  Female and male brains are also remarkably similar, and many of the stereotypical behaviors we normally associate with men and women are found in both men and women.  That's not to say that there might not be differences in male and female brains, and we're then stuck with trying to figure out how much of those differences are based on environment as opposed to genetics.  But some neuroscientists think that the differences are very small or maybe even non-existent.  For example, Lise Elliott, a professor of neuroscience at the Chicago Medical School, said that, \"...male and female brains are not much more different from each other than male or female hearts or  kidneys.\".  And even studies that show general differences between male and female brains admit that if they were to just look at the brain scan or height of someone plucked at random from the study, researchers would be hard-pressed to say whether it came from a man or a woman.  That suggests both sexes' brains are far more similar than they are different.  But regardless, it's a complex subject, and not one your ancient book of superstition can be relied on to untangle. ",
