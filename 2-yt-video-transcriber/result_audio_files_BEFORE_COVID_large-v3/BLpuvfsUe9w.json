            "text": "So we want to think through, you know, often as a pastor, we'll get a question, you know, when is it right to leave a church?  And Sam, you've written a little book, Why Bother With Church?  And you've been a pastor.  And Ashveen, you're presently a pastor.  You're actually about to send out.  about a 30-year church to plant.  How do you answer that question when a church member or maybe someone at another church where you're speaking at an event says, I think I should leave my church.  When should I leave a church? ",

            "text": "Yeah, I think the way you phrase the question actually reminds us there are positive and negative reasons to leave a church.  If you're leaving as part of a mission initiative and as a plant, that's a wonderful reason to leave a church, provided it's with the right motives and with the blessing of the church.  Sometimes life events mean that we need to if we're having to relocate.  But I guess most often we're asked that question because someone is feeling unhappy with the church.  And the question there is, what are the legitimate biblical reasons for leaving a church community?  And there would be several, I would guess.  An obvious one is if the gospel is not being taught, And not just that you've turned up one Sunday and it didn't quite sound right, but there's no indication that they are wanting to teach the scriptures faithfully, to promote Christ faithfully.  That would be an obvious reason to leave, but there are other areas where it starts to get maybe a bit more nuanced.  You can have churches with gospel doctrine, but which can lack gospel culture.  Yeah.  that may be a reason too as well.  And again, if you feel that something that is persistent, that you've raised it, that nothing's gonna change, sadly, that may be a reason too. ",

            "text": "Now, I know you personally travel to countries that are closed to missionary work.  So there's a big spectrum, isn't there, from the luxury of the West, where we have a consumeristic approach to churches, to places in the Middle East that they don't have a choice.  It's not like you can go to church.  So how do you help people think through that in the different contexts? ",

            "text": "Yeah, and I think with that light, just thinking about maybe also the question would be, when you shouldn't leave a church.  And I would say, you shouldn't leave a church if you just feel like you're not getting something out of it that you thought you were supposed to, like the consumeristic.  And it might be that God has called you to wherever that hole is, to actually be a part of the solution instead of just bolting.  Or I would also say not to leave the church without talking to the elders and expressing whatever the disagreement might be or whatever.  Because a lot of times I've found people were about to leave the church because they were not happy with the decision.  And then when they came and talked to the elders, they realized, oh, we didn't know all this other stuff around the decision.  And so now they stayed.  And so I think that's an important thing.  But When to leave the church, I would agree with Sam.  If the church stops being a true church, what is a true church?  And that is the right preaching of the word of God, of the gospel, and the right administration of the sacraments.  And so I think, are they preaching the gospel?  In Acts chapter 20, when Paul says, I did not shrink back from preaching the whole counsel of God's word.  And then he says, okay, so why would someone shrink back?  He says, the false teachers, they are after drawing away the disciples.  So if the teaching is watered down so as just to get more people to come and not really teaching the whole counsel of God's word.  And I think that would be key for me.  And then when I bring up the sacraments, I would say, you know, the baptism guards, as you know, the front door of the church, making sure that people who are coming and becoming members are truly saved.  have saving knowledge of Christ and are true followers of Christ.  And then the Lord's Supper makes sure that we administer church discipline in the sense of if someone is not living a repentant lifestyle and putting their, evidencing faith in Christ, then you bar them from the table Again, in Matthew 18, as a means of ultimately you treat them as an outsider so that they would turn back to God.  And so I would say with gospel culture on that point, that they are making sure the gospel isn't just you're forgiven of your sins, but that then you're forgiven so that you would pursue righteousness.  And so to uphold holiness, I think, is a key thing. ",

            "text": "Yeah, I would also think that a lot matters is to the church leadership.  If there's a humility, a teachability, a willingness to learn.  Sometimes someone comes from a different context.  They might go to a rural setting, and they can be patient.  They can have conversations.  They can encourage the pastors.  They can pray.  So let's kind of turn this question around a little bit and I'm curious to hear from you guys.  How would you as a pastor encourage someone coming into your church to think about church membership, the necessity for a commitment to a particular local church where you live? ",

            "text": "I think people arriving and people leaving are both teaching opportunities for church leaders.  So someone is coming from a different social background, different demographic background, different denominational background.  I always want to say, listen, you're going to notice things that we don't notice anymore.  So please tell us if there's something you find bizarre or weird.  or uncomfortable, please let us know.  There may be a good reason for it, but it may just be that there isn't and we've not noticed it.  So that can really help you to see your own church with fresh eyes.  So I love it when we get people from other denominational backgrounds coming to our church for that reason. ",

            "text": "Yeah, absolutely.  I think our process is basically, there's a starting point where we just really lay out the gospel, which is the foundation of our church and how the gospel not just is for non-Christians, but for Christians, how it informs the way we live life and do life together.  And then after that, we have a membership class where we walk through our statement of faith.  And I think when you want to become a member of a church, you ought to look at the statement of faith and say, hey, can I sign on to that?  And then we have a time for them to meet with the elders.  And that's a time for them to ask any questions or if there is anything that they're saying, hey, I'm not sure I'm on board with this.  So that I do agree.  You do that on the front end so that there's no ambiguity.  signed on to, yeah. ",

You want to help people understand what expectations you have of each other, the church, what expectations we as pastors have of them, what expectations they should have of us, what we believe.  Those things I think are helpful to make better church members to understand the commitments coming in.  And we find that it makes for better church members.  But then one of the things we actually say up front is when you leave this church, we want you as quickly as possible to join a healthy gospel church.  And we want to be in conversation and communication all the time because the Christian is not meant to live alone.  So thank you for this conversation.  It's been very helpful.  Thank you.  Thanks.
