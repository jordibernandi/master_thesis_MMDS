            "text": "In the film First Reformed, Reverend Ernest Toller befriends an environmental activist.  When the activist commits suicide, Toller begins to learn more and more about global warming, what we now call climate change.  Toller learns of the relationship between the local megachurch and an industrialist who is harming the environment.  Joel Jeffers, the pastor at the megachurch, tries to dismiss these concerns, but Toller is convinced that God wants mankind to protect the environment and that the relationship of money and religion is doing harm to God's creation.  The film has themes of forgiveness, doubt, all manner of things, but it's also a fine narrative representation of how money and religion mix to further our environmental catastrophe.  Denial of anthropogenic climate change, meaning climate change that is man-made, is not a uniquely American problem, but the percent of deniers in America dwarf that of most other regions on Earth.  When polled, 77% of the population of Latin America said they believe and understand that climate change is harming them.  European countries range from 88% to 97% of people feeling that it's happening, and similar ranges are present for agreeing that climate change is caused by human activity.  There is a gap between developing countries and countries that are already considered developed.  For example, in still developing Asian and Pacific countries, only 31% believe climate change to be a threat, but in developed countries in that region, the number is 74%.  In many still developing African countries, that percentage is also low, but America is unique in its denial of climate change because it has fewer excuses.  It is not a developing country.  It is fully developed by international standards.  It has an education system that can inform the public, it has a powerful media that can do that too, and it has the wealth to combat climate change if need be.  It's also the second highest contributor to climate change.  Yet, only 45% of Americans believe climate change is a very serious problem.  Furthermore, America has the third highest percentage of climate change deniers, behind only Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.  But why?  Why America?  What is unique to America as it relates to climate change?  The answers appear to be a perfect storm of a large percentage of socially conservative Christians, the energy industry's relationship with the fiscally conservative Republican Party and the Republican Party's relationship with conservative Christianity, and Ouroboros, a snake that eats itself.  But it wasn't always this way, and it didn't have to be this way.  May I ask a question?  Go ahead.  Will God forgive us?  In the book of Genesis, chapter 1, verse 26, it is written, Then God said, Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.  Upon reading this, one may have the mistaken impression that the Holy Bible commands mankind to have authority over earth and that whatever it chooses to do with the earth is right in the eyes of God.  This, however, ignores the very next chapter.  In chapter 2 verse 15 it is written, And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.  God wants mankind to tend the garden, to look after the earth.  Only God owns and rules the earth.  The planet is never given to mankind in terms of ownership, but instead is given earth as a task to complete for God.  In the book of Job, God said, Who has a claim against me that I must pay?  Everything under heaven belongs to me.  Tending the earth and protecting it is commonly called stewardship, the belief in Christianity that human beings do not own the world but instead are responsible for the world and that they must take care of it while living in it.  This is also referred to as creation care among some Christians.  God wants human beings to be his collaborators in the work of creation, redemption, and sanctification.  God does not do everything for us, and in turn, Christians are commanded to perform acts for God.  Church leaders often call for Christians of various denominations to practice stewardship.  Pope Paul VI, in one of his letters, stressed the importance of preserving the environment.  John Paul II had similar concerns.  Pope Benedict XVI installed solar panels in the Vatican, and Pope Francis has called the exploitation of Earth our sin.  Francis has been explicit that climate change is both real and mostly the result of human activity.  The politics of these varying popes differ greatly.  benedict for example is conservative even by papal standards but stewardship is a command by god himself and is a concept that can transcend politics.  stewardship is also interdenominational.  lutheran synods meaning assemblies of clergymen have declared the need for stewardship.  the same is true of the episcopal church.  In other respects, the Lutherans and Episcopalians are politically opposed, as Lutherans in America are more likely to be conservative Republicans and Episcopalians more likely to be Democrats.  Stewardship is a commonality, but if stewardship is so important to Christianity, how is opposition to stewardship communicated to Christians by American politicians, and why do so many Christians buy into it?  In 2017, the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  President Donald Trump believed this would be better for business and the businessmen who fund him.  But other Republicans couched their opposition to the Paris Agreement in their Christianity and the Christianity of their constituents.  Rep.  Tim Walberg said, As a Christian, I believe that there is a Creator in God who is much bigger than us, and I'm confident that if there's a real problem, He can take care of it.  Rep.  Walberg's statement does not hold up well to scrutiny even among devout Christians.  Dismissing a man-made problem like climate change with a statement such as, God will sort it out, means that all concerns can be dismissed with that.  While Berg does not propose ignoring any other problem, he recently wrote an op-ed about the opioid crisis, introduced a bill to change healthcare options for small businesses, and so forth.  Why is the answer to all other terrestrial matters action on the part of humanity, and the answer to climate change is, God will sort it out?  There is a reason why so many of his constituents accepted this answer, and there is a separate reason why he said it in the first place.  A self-serving political message needs an audience that will accept this message for their own reasons.  Let's focus on the acceptance of this answer among Christians first.  I think this is an issue where the church can lead, but they say nothing.  Anthropocentrism is the philosophical viewpoint that human beings are the most significant entities in the world and that humans are both separate from and superior to nature.  Taken to its extreme, anthropocentrism is a viewpoint that can also contend that anything that is not human in the world does not matter and that all resources are justifiably ours to exploit.  Christian anthropocentrism takes this further by saying that human beings are the most significant entities in the universe and that we are both separate from and superior to nature due to decree from God.  Christian anthropocentrism sometimes comes into conflict with Christian stewardship because even if Christians believe in some level of stewardship, they also believe that whatever they choose for the environment must be for the best.  if our stewardship is God's mandate.  Anyone with even a passing understanding of the Holy Bible might find this ludicrous, considering that shortly after Adam was made steward of the Garden of Eden, he and Eve made their infamous mistake.  Christian anthropocentrists tend to ignore that and instead focus on Psalm 115, verse 6.  The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth he has given to human beings.  again other books chapters and verses clarify that humans do not own the earth but to christian anthropocentrists this is close enough.  bear in mind that anthropocentrism in and of itself is not inherently bad but that it can lead christians down a path that may be dangerous for our planet.  It's possible to value the environment without discarding anthropocentrism.  Sometimes called prudential or enlightened anthropocentrism, this view holds that humans do have ethical obligations toward the environment because they can be justified in terms of obligations toward other humans.  Environmental impact does not only hurt the birds and the trees, it hurts human beings, the people who Christian anthropocentrists believe are the most significant entities.  Political scientists and public policy experts have reported that American Christians as a whole have lower levels of environmental concern than non-Christians.  Jews, people of other faiths, non-believers, etc.  The two groups that are least concerned about climate change are white evangelicals and white Catholics, two groups that heavily vote Republican.  According to a paper by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, this environmental backlash includes conservatives.  suspicious that stewardship improperly understood resembles neo pagan nature worship and might even lead to anti-capitalist sentiments.  the backlash was furthered along by a reinvigorated belief in the end times and that stewardship is pointless.  as we near the end of the world.  Hal Lindsey furthered America's apocalyptic expectations with his 1970 book The Late Great Planet Earth, and Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins exploded this into popular culture twenty-five years later with the Left Behind book series and later the movies.  Within this mindset, catastrophic climate change does not effectively compete for concern with the coming cosmic drama.  A recent study confirms that expectation of an imminent apocalypse among conservative American Christians is directly tied to decreased environmental concern.  In fact, with many End Times believers assuming that they will be among those saved by God, there is not only a lack of concern, but even, for some, an anticipation of the end of the world.  So, we know why Christian Americans are willing to deny climate change.  But why do Republican politicians, whether Christian or not, engage in this denial?  Some may genuinely believe that the end times are coming and that this is all part of God's plan.  But for many politicians, the answer is more terrestrial and less supernatural.  Money.  The oil industry, the coal industry, all energy industries that play some part in climate change have known for a long time that global warming is anthropogenic, man-made.  Major fossil fuel companies have known for decades that their products cause global warming.  Their own scientists told them more than 30 years ago.  In response, they concluded that they must deceive shareholders, politicians, and the public in order to maintain their billion-dollar companies.  This is no longer speculation.  Their tactics were made public through a series of investigations, lawsuits, leaks, and disclosures through Freedom of Information Act requests.  As early as 1977, representatives from fossil fuel companies attended congressional hearings in which carbon emissions were discussed.  By 1988, James Hansen, a leading NASA scientist, testified before Congress that they now had irrefutable data confirming that industrial activities were causing a steady increase in average global temperature.  The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that global warming is at least partially man-made.  Much of the dissent, however small it may be, comes from right-wing think tanks and front groups funded either by fossil fuel industries or groups affiliated with them.  In order to give the false impression of a genuine scientific debate, these think tanks say that the jury is still out on climate change.  This is trumpeted by right-wing media like Fox News and accepted by those Americans who predominantly watch Fox News as their primary information source.  This creates the impression that climate change denial is as legitimate as the climate change reality for the millions of Americans who consume this media.  Fossil fuel industries donate to the campaigns of politicians they believe are friendly to said industries, and then these politicians parrot these talking points.  Some Christian groups and churches, realizing that their flock is among those most likely to get suckered in by climate change denial for all the aforementioned reasons, have tried to mitigate this damage.  Unfortunately, success has been limited.  In a way, this isn't anything new.  Politicians in America have relied on Christianity to push their agendas for a long time, and the clergy have pushed the politics of the right in a kind of unspoken handshake agreement.  During the Cold War, evangelicals who believed in the second coming of Jesus Christ argued that God wouldn't allow mankind to destroy itself in a nuclear war.  The aforementioned Tim LaHaye, co-author of Left Behind, wrote in 1972 that the world might be destroyed in a nuclear war, but if it did happen, God would be behind it, and God is always right.  There is a part in First Reformed in which Reverend Tuller makes a sign that says, \"'Will God forgive  us?'.  The global climate is projected to continue to change over this century.  It's only a matter of how much at this point.  Sea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to the region's economy, environment, and habitability of areas near the coast.  People will lose their homes and some will lose their lives.  Extreme heat will affect health, energy, and will cause a decrease in water availability.  Some of this has already begun, and some of it is yet to come.  Due to our low reaction to this, some of this is inevitable, but not all of it is.  There is still time to mitigate some of the damage and keep the planet mostly habitable.  At the end of First Reformed, Reverend Taller is lost and ready for oblivion, but he is saved at the last moment.  It's not too late. ",
