            "text": "I believe that the bottom is in.  The bottom was back in late 2015 and that we're on the way up.  I don't know if we're going to get this one last pullback.  I have some cash set aside to buy a little bit more precious metals.  Now this is, and I've covered this many, many times, and this price target keeps on changing.  But if history were to repeat, and this is the value of the gold at the Treasury, so it's the number of ounces times the price of gold, and this is the quantity of base currency that exists, the dollar value of all the paper dollars and deposits at the Federal Reserve that exist.  And twice during the last century, the value of the gold at the Treasury has risen to meet or exceed the value of all of the base currency that exists here.  it is the free market and the will of the public doing this and it shot it way overshot back in nineteen eighty.  this is january of nineteen eighty But what I show here, this spread is larger.  The opportunity between this, if history were to repeat, and I believe that that is what's happening.  As history is repeating, this is the bull market of the 70s.  Gold went from 35 to 200 to 100 to 850.  And this mid-cycle correction is what we've been in.  This is just a long, protracted, drawn-out version of what has happened in the 70s.  And you're going to see this go up and meet this because of the enormous amount of panic that is going to happen during this horrific crash that is the result of the Federal Reserve and the world's central banks trying to manipulate everything.  The Keynesians are wrong.  Keynesian economics does not work.  The free market always overwhelms their manipulations and the problem with that is the energy from warping the economy.  When they push one sector or another sector into a bubble, the economy is warped.  The free market tries to straighten all that out and when it does, it punishes anybody for manipulating the economy and I really do think you're going to see something horrific.  One of the other things I measured, this was one of the premises of my book, Guide to Investing in Gold and Silver.  Since credit cards were created, back here, Diners Club was the first one in the late 50s, and then American Express.  Credit currency is very similar to base currency.  It comes into existence, though, when you make a charge on the credit card, but the merchant that you're paying Their bank account can't tell the difference between cash or the credit currency that you created when you made that charge.  that's in circulation, and it stays in circulation until somebody saves it up and pays down credit card debt.  So you have to add that.  to the currency supply.  and if you do if history were to repeat and the value of the gold the treasury rises.  so it's the number of ounces they've got which is now static times the price.  here it's the ounces that are changing and the price is static.  it was 20.67 cents an ounce and then the price went to $35 an ounce.  And this is the number of ounces changing.  Then the number of ounces becomes static, and it's the price of gold changing.  that causes the value of the gold at the Treasury to rise.  And for it to rise to cover the currency supply plus outstanding revolving credit like it did in 1980, that requires $18,000 per ounce gold today.  This is a moving target.  I'm not guaranteeing it.  But what I can tell you is that there's going to come, just like in 1980, When gold hit $400 an ounce in November of 1979, in 1971 it was $35 an ounce.  So just eight years earlier.  And investors thought that $400 was a ridiculous price for gold.  And so when they'd go in to buy gold at some coin shop or something, And, you know, back then, the average person didn't make very much.  So you're making $15,000 a year.  You've got $1,000 in your bank account.  You draw out $500.  And you go into a coin shop and you say, I want to buy gold.  And they drop one coin in your hand.  The reaction was, well, how much is the silver?  Well, you can get 35 of those or 50 of those for the same price.  And that's when the public says, well, I want the silver.  And that's when things turn around for silver and silver takes off like a rocket.  So that is probably going to happen at around $5,000 per ounce gold, I believe.  That's the point where people will say, wow, in the year 2000, gold was only 250 bucks an ounce and now it's 5,000.  So I believe that $5,000 is a stupid cheap price for gold.  that is absolutely going there.  And here's another way of measuring it.  This is the amount of gold that the Treasury divided into the currency supply.  So the amount of gold that the Treasury divided into the currency supply.  When the value of gold that the Treasury exceeds the value of all the base currency, then gold is expensive.  When the value of gold at the treasury is less than base currency, then gold is cheap.  And when it's down here, it's very, very cheap.  And here's the data.  And you see, this was actually unpegging gold for a day and then re-pegging it.  We were on a gold standard.  So they'd unpeg it from the US dollar and then re-peg it.  And over a month and a half, exchange rates changed.  So it's really the free market re-valuing gold.  It went up to $35 an ounce, and it matched the size of the currency supply.  And then it exceeded the currency supply for a while.  And then this is 1980.  And right now, gold is on sale.  It's like almost the cheapest it has ever been.  And John Williams at ShadowStats agrees.  When you use the pre-Ronald Reagan, the pre-1980 Consumer Price Index index, You use that method of calculating inflation and you inflation adjust gold.  It's at a 300 year low right now.  So this is information from John Williams at shadowstats.com, shadow government statistics.  Now, the last chart.  in this whole presentation, I haven't talked about silver much because gold is an economic indicator.  And this whole presentation has been about the economy.  Silver is not an economic indicator.  until people start rushing back into silver.  Gold always has some monetary demand.  Right now, silver has no monetary demand, but it's going to get monetary demand.  The world's central banks hold gold as an asset, and they've been increasing their gold holdings pretty dramatically, especially countries like China and Russia, where they know something is coming and they're getting ready for it.  But silver doesn't have any monetary demand yet except for a few investors that are trying to protect themselves and they believe in silver.  But it's a very small amount.  So this is the sources of mine production and only 30% of all the silver produced comes from silver producers.  The rest is just a byproduct of all these.  Now, in a global financial crisis, you're not going to have much copper dug up because the real estate booms that have been going on all over the planet, they're not going to be needing more copper plumbing and more copper wire.  And so the amount of production of copper is going to drop dramatically, probably by more than half.  lead and zinc.  These are things like car batteries and zinc castings for cars and so on.  That automotive production is going to fall dramatically, and you're going to see this production go down.  So you're left with about 40% of the production, and if this 60% falls by half, there's a whole lot of silver production that is going to vanish just when the public is rushing into silver.  This is the end of my presentation, but I really do think that gold and silver are finally going into this last up leg.  I don't want to see it, but I can't correct this stupidity of politicians.  I can't get them to do what I think is correct, what I know is correct from an Austrian economics point of view.  And I can't control the world's central banks.  I've often said that gold and silver come with a central bank guarantee, and the guarantee is that they will never stop printing the currency that gold and silver are measured in.  So when you're printing currency that measures real money, eventually, that real money has to catch up and probably exceed that currency.  And that is what's going to happen over the next few years.  There's going to be a crisis.  You're going to see gold and silver gain many, many times in absolute purchasing power.  So that's about it for this presentation.  I want to thank everybody for watching.  Hopefully you all protect yourselves.  You've got to make up your own mind.  Nothing in here is financial advice.  I'm just showing you, you know, this is the reason that I have been protecting myself with gold and silver even during the pullback that we've had since 2011.  I've been accumulating during all of that.  I've been accumulating gold and silver since 2002.  I was a precious metals investor before I was a precious metals dealer or before I wrote my book.  I started investing in precious metals in 2002.  2005 is when I incorporated my company that sells precious metals, goldsilver.com.  And it wasn't until my book came out in 2008 that that actually became a viable company.  So I was a precious metals investor from 2002 to 2008 before I was a serious precious metals dealer.  So I'm really, this is what I'm doing for myself.  It's not investment advice.  I'm not telling you to do it.  You need to do your own research.  This is only a tiny, tiny fraction of the information that is available out there about the world economy.  but it shows me things that sometimes scare me and sometimes give me reason to celebrate.  The reason to celebrate is because I know that governments and central banks around the world are going to do the wrong thing because they believe in economic policies that are fallacious, they're wrong, they're false.  It's going to pay off big for, I believe, for me, the precious metals investor.  Thank you very much for listening.  I hope you got a lot from this and we'll see you next time. ",
