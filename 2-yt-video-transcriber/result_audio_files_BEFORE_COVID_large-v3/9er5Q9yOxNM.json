The first thing that I wanted is I got out of bed this morning because I wanted to go to the gym.  I've learned that working out, the older and older that I get, it's less about my physical body and it's more about my mind.  That when I'm working out, it's anchoring my mind to the present, that it's engaging me for the day that is ahead.  I woke up this morning, I got out of bed this morning because I actually wanted to wake up before the wrath and the will of Wyatt Wesley Wilkerson began.  Please, this week, if you have some time, pray for Dontree and I. We are four days away from Dontree giving birth to baby number two. ",

But by the time I was a teenager, of course, I was worshiping with the adults in the regular worship service.  Today, however, there's a growing trend of children's church for adult children.  Consider that only two minutes into this message and you're hearing about the pastor talking about himself... his Sunday morning workout, his wild two-year-old son, and his wife's imminent childbirth.  That was Pastor Rich Wilkerson Jr.  of Voo Church in Miami, Florida, starting a new collection, yeah, collection, not a series, but a collection, called Restless.  Rich's dad is also a pastor and cousin of David Wilkerson, who wrote the book that became a movie called The Cross and the Switchblade back in the 70s.  Oh man, nothing like an old cheesy classic to make one laugh.  Anyways, Rich was the youth leader at his dad's church for a while.  The gathering was called the Rendezvous, which morphed into Vue Church.  But it wasn't until Rich officiated the wedding of Key and Wes... Um, it's Kanye, Bessel.  and Kim Kardashian that Rich Wilkerson got on the ultra-hip young pastor train.  Here he is yucking it up with Justin Bieber and fellow hipster pastors Chad Veach and Carl Lentz at a Hillsong conference. ",

One of the captains I work with was flying the Gulfstream 5 that Justin Bieber chartered when he stuffed his pet monkey into a backpack and tried to smuggle it into Germany.  Once alerted by the flight attendant to the fact that a monkey was running around wild in the cabin, well, he and the other pilots had no choice.  They had to call the authorities in Germany before landing, and the monkey was confiscated.  But you know what?  That's a whole other story.  Now, also of interest is Key and West... Um, it's Kanye, Bessel.  Sunday service.  It's a beach sermon that's called Key and West.  Um, it's Kanye bezel Sunday service for some reason.

And, of course, Jesus doesn't use that in Matthew chapter 11, but it is used in Romans 1.27 where Paul says, \"...men abandoned the natural function for women and burned in their desire towards one  another.\".  You know, Matthew chapter 11 is an amazing portion of Matthew's gospel.  that begins with a troubled and confused John the Baptist who is in prison.  Not yet seeing the liberation of himself or Israel, he sends his disciples to Jesus asking, \"'Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for  another?'.  Jesus replies, tell John what you're seeing.  The blind receive their sight and the lame walk.  Lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear and the dead are raised up and the poor have the good news preached to them.  And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.  Notice that Jesus does not include Isaiah 61 to proclaim liberty to the captives and release from darkness to the prisoners.  The reason for this is because freedom and release from Rome is not what Jesus came to do.  Rather, it was to bring freedom from the bondage of sin and death.  Jesus goes on to speak words of woe called maledictions.  They're bad sayings upon a person.  And he was saying them to the cities who saw Jesus' mighty miracles and yet remained unrepentant.  He says to them, \"'It will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for  you.'\".  And it's in that context that Jesus then says, Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  You see, it's Jesus alone who can relieve the burden of sin and the constant need to perform works that can't save a person from the coming judgment of God anyways.  Now, I want to move on to another episode in this collection.  So we'll end this sermon with one more clip.  Rich is talking about learning from Jesus. ",

Then God blessed the seventh day and he sanctified it, setting it apart, because on that day he rested from all the work of creation that he had accomplished.  You see, friends, this is what the fourth commandment is all about.  We're to work for six days, but on the seventh day, which is now the Lord's Day, Sunday, we are to rest from our worldly employments as much as we possibly can and concerns, our worldly concerns, and focus ourselves on God and His goodness towards sinners who don't deserve His grace and mercy.  We are to focus on worshiping Him both corporately and individually.  It doesn't matter what you're dealing with.  It doesn't matter what stress or anxiety you walked in here with. ",

Come on, if you believe that.  Come on, lift up your voice in this room.  This is yet another example of a sermon, if you could even call it that, where Christ Jesus and his saving work was not proclaimed at all.  Let's go back to the passage that Rich was trying in vain to tackle.  Matthew 11, 29.  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  You see, that's what we need.  Rest for our weary, sin-sick souls.  And that rest cannot be found in spiritual disciplines or good food or showers in the dark.  It can be found in one place and one place only.  It's found in the one who said, I will give you rest.  It's found in the one who said in Matthew 12, 6 through 8, I tell you something greater than the temple is here.  And who also said, for the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath.  I'm telling you guys, Christians need to hear the good news of the gospel every single week.  Why is that?  Well, it's because the deceitfulness of sin is always crouching at the door.  The writer of Hebrews in chapter 3 starting at verse 7 says this, and saw my works for forty years.  Therefore I was provoked with that generation and said, They always go astray in their heart.  They have not known my ways.  As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest.  He continues, he says, \"'Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart leading you to fall away from the living God.  But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the very  end.'\".  And there's another place in Hebrews that's so fitting for what we have just experienced.  It's Hebrews 5, 11, starting at verse 11.  About this, we have much to say.  About what?  Well, it's about Jesus and his ultimate sacrifice for his people.  About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.  For though by this time you ought to be teachers, in other words, understanding and being able to explain the content of the Scriptures, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles, or the word of God.  You need milk and not solid food.  For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child.  But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.  You know, I have a strong suspicion that these mega churches with these ultra cool, ultra hip young pastors, that the people going there have ever had... ears that heard and have become dull but have always been dull because they haven't had a steady diet of the actual content of the Christian faith centered in and around the gospel on a regular basis.  Friends, find a church where grown-ups are in charge, men who take the Bible seriously, who are strongly convinced in their minds and hearts that the Bible is God-breathed, that it is authoritative, and it is all-sufficient for everything pertaining to salvation through the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Christian life and godliness.
