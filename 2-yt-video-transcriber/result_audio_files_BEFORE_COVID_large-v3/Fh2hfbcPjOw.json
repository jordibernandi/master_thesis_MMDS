There is a man by the name of Mr.  Clark and there is also another man by the name of Donald.  You are both watching me saying, could it be that God's speaking to me?  Yes, he is.  Somebody, just a few minutes before you came on the show, you went out and you took the American flag and you said, I'm proud of my nation.  And you raise it up and God said, you have been determined through your prayers to influence this nation.  You're watching the, you're an influential person.  The spirit of God says, hear the word of the prophet to you as a King, I will open that door that you prayed about.  And when it comes time for the election, you will be elected.  There will be a praying president, not a religious one.  But I will fool the people, says the Lord.  I will fool the people.  Yes, I will.  God says, the one that is chosen shall go in and they shall say, he has hot blood.  For the spirit of God says, yes, he may have hot blood, but he will bring the walls of protection on this country in a greater way.  And the economy of this country shall change rapidly, says the Lord of hosts.  Listen to the word of the Lord.  God says, I will put at your helm, for two terms, a president that will pray, but he will not be a praying president when he starts.  I will put him in office, and then I will baptize him with the Holy Spirit, and my power, says the Lord of hosts.  We are named in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.  Amen.  Thank you, Lord.  Deliver us now.  Deliver us.  Bring deliverance, Lord.  Deliver us from this enemy that has endeavored to handicap us.  And Lord, the betrayal that has been so evident in the White House, bring that to an end.  I see a president that shall come.  And this is not to speak bad about this one.  There is a president who will come.  And God says he will have absolutely no fear.  Absolutely no fear.  Will be decisive make decisions And then in the middle of the of the Restoration of America rapidly because of a source of energy that shall come quickly Because of medical breakthroughs and because of agreements between nations specifically China.  God said they shall say we never dreamed this would happen.  I Where they shall say Christ will reign and this we shall not implement at all.  Socialism.  Where we will, where they have said we will make history without God.  No you will not.  No you will not says the Lord.  For they are saying how do we kill the giant?  How do we kill the giant of debt?  How do we kill the giant of socialism?  How do we kill the giant of human secularism?  I have placed that man amongst you.  Take all these little remarks I'm giving you.  They are gems.  The name and the word gold.  And God says, these... that shall reject.  him shall be shocked at how he takes the giant down.  But God said, watch, I said 20,000, look not to Wall Street, however, observe.  And they shall say, what is your plan for this giant?  And he will take a simple stone.  Remember the name.  And he will hold it up and they will laugh at him.  But the plan is so brilliant, says the Lord.  It could only have been given by me.  They will shout impeach, impeach.  But this shall not happen.  And then God says highly embarrassing moments when another Snowden arises.  And people will become very afraid.  And God says healing shall begin and then it shall flow rapidly.  Schools will be free from potential damage and danger.  Shootings and murder.  Drug addiction.  Cartels shall be afraid of a woman.  a woman anointed by God a woman set aside and God says they will say we hated her but now we love her for she shall take the oil of healing and she shall pour it upon the scars of those left and those right and of the new party that has come forth and emerged.  therefore the healing that is necessary for this nation shall come.  at a time in the middle of the presidency there shall be a woman that shall come and God said there shall be oil that shall be poured upon the nation and they shall suddenly feel the healing and they shall say it is well with my soul it is well with our soul for the soul of America has been corrupted.  the soul of this nation has been corrupted with bitterness and anger and God said she shall say no more.  I was overwhelmed by a strong presence of hatred and bitterness permeating from the citizens of the United States of America.  When I sensed this, I sensed I was literally tasting the bitterness.  Not that would only come, but that is present.  And God was so grieved.  That politics and the economy and the news media has put us in a position where we are completely corrupted in our hearts.  And bitterness is coming forth.  instead of praying prophetically, calling out to God.  Lord, I pray today with your people.  I call to you, Lord, because you have shown me New York.  You've shown me New York.  You've shown me, Lord, how the enemy has once again planned something.  But this time it is completely different.  It is not like 9-11.  There is nothing like it.  This is the most strange infiltration that shall come upon your screens.  It shall come upon you in your movie houses.  It shall come upon the places of comfort and pleasure.  and they shall infiltrate and they shall say we'll even black them out.  we will even cause them to be so terrorized because there is darkness in one section and darkness in another section.  Canada keep your shield in front of you do not let it down.  but they are focusing on you.  spirit of God says one more thing.  I want to talk to you about that little dwarf In North Korea.  I'm getting a little tired of him.  I think I'm going to go and pay him a visit, says the Lord.  You watch and see what I do.  And that will be a big sign that the man that I'm sending with a stone for the giant is emerging.  Says the Lord.  You prophesy and shout it out.  Greetings, everyone. ",

And I must tell you, it's just... amazing what's unfolding already.  God told me to go to New York, and I shared, of course, before that.  when the Spirit of God leads you, even as Paul was led, sometimes it's not very clear.  But the dates changed slightly for New York, and just before I left, I said to my team, I need to meet with some leaders, and specifically felt that I should meet with Donald Trump.  We're about to leave now and I found out that he's just announced that he's going to run for president.  That is important to me because when the Lord leads me to put my feet on the ground, in any region there must be a reason for it.  So Neil, I don't know what your feelings are, but you're standing with me just before we get off the flight.  Maybe you could just share a little bit. ",

You know, I'm being told by our team, who's updating us now about Donald Trump announcing his candidacy for president, that the motto he's using is, Make America Great Again.  And you're going to the very soil where 9-11 took place, where the enemies of America tried to deal a permanent blow to puncture the heart of America.  But we're going back there now.  Your boots are going back there now.  And as you have prophesied, indeed, America is resilient.  So I'm very much looking forward to seeing what comes forth on this trip. ",

The gatekeepers, even though they should be, the gatekeepers are not the senators nor the governors in political realms.  Some are and some aren't.  But God said, my gatekeepers are the apostles and the prophets in hiding.  at this moment in time.
