            "text": "A few months ago, I made a video about my first job, which was at a Tim Hortons, which is a shitty Canadian coffee chain.  People seemed to really relate to that, so I thought I'd talk about my second job, which, in a lot of ways, was even more miserable, but at least I liked the people I was working with, so... Didn't feel that bad at the time.  It was at a Pizza Hut kiosk inside of a gas station on the highway, part of a national Canadian gas station chain called Irving.  You ever walk into a 7-Eleven and they have a bunch of slices of grody-ass pizza just sitting under a sun lamp for hours and hours?  Well, imagine that, except you could also phone in made-to-order pizzas.  We did not deliver.  And about a third of the phone calls we received ended with someone getting very angry when they had gone through a huge pizza order only to find that out.  As I tell you these stories, I want you to keep something in mind.  Imagine how things would have gone differently if me and my coworkers had even the slightest amount of control over our workplace.  And I'm not even talking about full seizing the means of production here.  I mean, just having like any sort of voice at all.  My boss was this tiny woman who eventually got fired for stealing money.  She used to. ",
