We have to get our country working for us again instead of the other way around.  We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy rather than inputs into a giant machine.  When you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens?  The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants, and you hope it works out.  It's time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.  That's why I'm going to do something unprecedented tonight.  My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families.  Someone watching this at home right now.  If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that.  This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people. ",

Everyone, we know we're on the same team here.  We know we're on the same team.  We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.  And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way.  As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees.  You instead pretend they're contractors.  It's harder to change jobs.  It's certainly harder to start a business.  The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.  Yes!  I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy.  We have to change the incentives.  so instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the healthcare system.  And the Cleveland Clinic where they're paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe.  Shocker, they prescribe fewer procedures and patient health stays the same or improves.

That is the immigration story that we have to be able to share with the American people.  If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by their immigrants or children of immigrants.  And rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities.  We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism.  And I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama-Biden administration.  I think we have to compete for talent.  And I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways.  He says, build a wall.  I'm going to say to immigrants, come to America, because if you come here, your son or daughter can run for president.  The water is great.  And this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life.  This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations.

A CEO friend of mine was in China recently, and he said that he saw pirated US intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head.  And he said, one, how can my workers compete against that?  So the imbalances are real, but we have to let the Chinese know that.  we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides.  So no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers. ",

Now, everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts.  Money finds a way.  Money will find its way back in.  So what is the answer?  The answer is to wash the money out with people-powered money.  My proposal is that we give every American 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like.  This would wash out the lobbyist cash by a factor of 8 to 1.  That is the only way we will win.  And as someone running for president, I'll tell you, there's the people on one side and the money on the other.  The only way for us to win is if we bring them together. ",

We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests, which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth.  But here's the big one.  The data clearly shows that 65 to 70% of our students' outcomes are determined outside of the school.  We're talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they're young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood.  We're putting money into schools, and educators know this.  We're saying you're 100% responsible for educating our kids, but you can only control 30%.  They all know this.

And even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini rise and maximum fall, lost investors hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed $100,000 in school debt.  My parents still told people I was a lawyer.  I guess it was a little easier.  So I remember lying on my floor, looking up, wondering how it had come to this.  Eventually, I picked myself back up.  I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years and eventually had some success.  Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you.  And so I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Wen, who's here in the audience tonight, who left.
