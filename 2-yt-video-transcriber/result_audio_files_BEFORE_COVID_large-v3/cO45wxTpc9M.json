            "text": "Taisha and in this video I am going to show you my new MCK micro conversion kit.  I will leave a link on where you can purchase this in the description.  I posted this picture on Instagram and everyone's like what in the world is that?  I am here to do my unboxing also to show you my new Glock.  okay so what is a micro conversion kit?  pretty much it.  There's an advantages of having a micro conversion kit is that it fits multiple Glock models.  That's this one.  There are other micro conversion kits for other platforms, but the one I have is for a Glock and it has a Picatinny rail so that you can put different optics and sights.  The one that I chose, it comes with iron sights and it also allows you to be ambidextrous.  So sometimes our left handed shooters are not treated so kindly while the micro conversion kit is ambidextrous.  So it's left hand and right hand.  friendly.  It has an ergonomic hand grip for safety and it also locks into a folded position so that you can transport it easily as well without having a super huge case or any kind of bulky carrier for it.  And it also improves your accuracy.  That's why I wanted a microconversion kit because it improves my accuracy.  Yes, I'm accurate up to, I would say, about 50 yards with the pistol, but with the microconversion kit, you can have accuracy up to 200 yards.  So let's go ahead and check this out.  All right.  So what is a microconversion kit?  Fresh out the box, it looks like this.  And I know this is like some weird child's toy, but it's no toy.  It's for grownups.  Okay.  So out of the box, what you have here is the unit itself, the MCK unit itself.  So what you're going to do is take the arm grip here and you're just going to lock that into place.  It is so simple to, you know, collapse this and fold it up.  It's on a hinge.  You just fold that up, pack it away, and you're good to go.  It's this big, so it's like about the size of my forearm.  And then as you expand it, this part here is your arm.  arm grip, okay, because it does not have a buttstock, but you don't have to put your arm in there, you can hold it up to your chest.  So this particular model here, it fits, and it says it on the inside, it fits Glock 17, 18, 19, 19X, 22, 23, 31, 32, and 45.  And as it just so happened, if you follow me on Instagram and Facebook, go ahead and follow me on those platforms, I bought a new Glock.  So this is my Glock 19 MOS.  I chose this kind of Glock because it allows me to add an optic without sending my slide in to get milk to put an optic on.  And I like that because I want to change it up and do some things with this Glock, okay?  It's my second Glock and I'm absolutely happy with it.  So you see, I have an empty weapon.  I have no ammo over here at all, okay?  And I'm going to show you just how.  I'm going to take my Glock 19 and put it inside of the MCK Convergent Kit, okay?  So at the bottom, you have this tab here.  You push this button in, and this elevator door comes open.  What I'm going to do is take my Glock and put it inside, and it's going to lock... at the slide, if I'm holding this correctly.  Here we go.  Bring this back.  My Glock is going to lock inside of here, okay?  So my Glock is inside.  So what I'm gonna do now is ride my Glock forward.  So I hear that snap.  Then I'm gonna snap this door closed.  And as you see, there was a red dot, okay?  That's how you know that your weapon is ready to fire, okay?  Once you have that up, it's locked, snapped into place.  And I just stuck my Glock in here.  That's all you have. ",
