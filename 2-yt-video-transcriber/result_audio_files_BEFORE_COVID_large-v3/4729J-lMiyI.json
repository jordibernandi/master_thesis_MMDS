When choosing your EDC, make sure you know what environment you'll be operating in.  Because that changes the dynamics of your... dynamics.  Rubber ducky, you're the one.  Rubber ducky, you make math so fun.  Come at me, bro!  Sorry, I dropped the glass.  No worries!  Rubber ducky, you're the one.  Hey babe, home from band practice.  Huh?  There's something weird about that.  Band practice, huh?  I was playing the song of freedom, okay?  If a firearm isn't the tool you want to use, make sure you try fighting and give yourself an unrealistic expectation of safety.  Give me no personal belongings.  No!  When choosing your EDC, you want to make sure you get a firearm small enough to make sure you can conceal it.  As you can see, you can't even tell that I'm carrying a firearm right now.  A lot of people ask me what my EDC is.  I'm actually a minimalist, so all I usually carry is an appendix carry and a cheap pocket knife.  Pocket 1911s.  hip revolver, cargo pocket 43s, back pocket Glocks, ankle carry SCAR, toe carry MP5s, and a thigh carry Glock, back carry shotguns, back carry AR, horizontal carry AR, flip flop carry shotgun, appendix AR, appendix AK, appendix carry turkey gun, prison wallet, suppress carry, Ballistic jockstrap carry.  Cap 308 carry.  Everyday carry resupply.  Salt bag.  And my watch.  Now I'm ready to go to the grocery store.  Let's go, buddy!  And remember, when you're at home, you don't need an EDC.  All you need is all the guns.  Everybody!  Everybody.  What?  Hey, thanks for watching, guys.  Hope you got some EDC tips out of it.  Also, my book, Thank You For My Service, is on pre-sale right now.  It took me three years to get this thing out.  I am so freaking excited to release it.  Also, check out blackriflecoffee.com.  It makes everything possible, all the videos.  Other than that, uh... Good job, Matt. ",
