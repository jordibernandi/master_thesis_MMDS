So on Newsnight yesterday the host Emily Maitlis was talking to the Brexiteer Rod Liddle and the People's Vote campaigner Tom Baldwin discussing the failure to deliver Brexit, the politicians and media betrayal since 2016 along with the Peterborough election.  Well Rod does not hold back when it comes to Emily and the BBC.  He knows her and the BBC hold a clear remainer bias and you can see this in the disdain he has for her.  Let's take a look at the first clip. ",

He blames what he calls the establishment.  Tom Baldwin is a leading figure on the People's Vote campaign, former adviser to Ed Miliband, and believes we'd be better off taking the mess we're in back to the people.  Welcome, both.  I wonder about the timing of your book, Rod.  You've called it The Great Betrayal.  We're about to leave.  We're three months away from leaving, probably with the hardest Brexit that anyone imagined.

Which is complete bullshit.  What about all the Ramonas before the referendum who said the economy would completely crash the day the UK voted to leave the EU?  I'm pretty sure that is the hardest Brexit anyone imagined, not the current hard Brexit we would be looking at, which I still worry we won't get on the 31st of October.  Rod also feels that way, pointing out he knows the fear of a no-deal Brexit is consuming the Ramonas, but we was due to leave on the 29th of March and we didn't.  Us having the same dynamics now that we did three years ago is what he's talking about.  Emily tries to claim that Theresa the EU appeaser has tried for three years to deliver Brexit.  Has this dumb bint been living in the same reality as us?  Theresa May has done all she can to prevent Brexit, along with the shit weasels like Philip Hammond, Dominic Grieve, and Rory the Soyboy Stewart.  Rob rightly points this out, saying Theresa May's claims of a no-deal Brexit had been a paper tiger due to the Ramonas within her cabinet, like Philip Hammond, before rightly pointing out that Boris has done a bit of flip-flopping himself over no-deal in the past, so could also be a paper tiger like before.  I have to agree.  It is possible.  You all know that I'm concerned.  Boris will either push through a rehashed May deal or extend the Brexit deadline.  With reports out now that the EU would be willing to extend it, it doesn't give me much confidence.  Now let's check out the next clip. ",

On that basis, you've got a kind of mis-selling scandal here.  You've got something which is not being delivered, which was promised.  You've got Parliament divided.

            "text": "So at the start of the clip we heard from the undemocratic fuck pig Tom Baldwin who wants a second referendum because he lost and like a fucking baby can't handle losing.  so comes on the BBC to join Emily's spunk trumpet mateless in attacking the Brexiteer.  He calls a no deal Brexit not what the people voted for.  Well everyone I know who voted to leave and a good few of the people who voted to remain now demand a no deal Brexit.  The EU won't give us a good deal, so off we go is the common thought these days.  Of course, Tom is determined to vote again, so pushes his idea of democracy, which involves ignoring democratic votes, believe it or not, if they don't go your way, and claiming doing it again is the democratic way to go.  The logic behind this tosspot is astonishing.  Rod rightly responds to this bullshit with the fact it's not a people's vote if you ignore the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the first time.  He goes on to state the politicians have betrayed the country on both sides by not delivering what the people have asked for.  Of course, Emily has to interrupt and claim Rod is happy because all the delays will allow him to get angry, which came out of fucking nowhere.  What a thing to jump in and say.  Brexiteers are pissed off with Ramonas like you delaying and trying to sabotage Brexit.  She tries to make out, like Rod's comments about Remainers.  calling Brexiteers.  racist is a bad thing.  Erm, you dopey cumbucket, it's the truth.  You and all the other BBC presenters do it all the time.  Rod points out this was the narrative used by the Remain campaign during the referendum, along with calling Brexiteers thick, old and multiple other smears, which then brings us on to Emily attempting to smear Rod as a racist.  Common BBC tactic then.  Rod ignores her bullshit and once again calls out the BBC for showing its blatant bias.  I mean, let's be serious here.  In my opinion, they have got this guy on here just to smear him.  She was waiting to call him a racist from the very start of the interview.  Her utter contempt for him is clear.  Her claims he is racist because of talking about terror attacks is fucking insane.  Unless he specifies a race, not a religion or nationality, it's not racist, you fucking idiot.  You can't be racist to a nationality or a religion, period.  She tries to use a joke he made about the possible election fraud in Peterborough as a means to call him a racist also.  It sounds a bit like the saga of a card Victoria Derbyshire smear attempt at this point.  Rod rightly shits on their claim because his comments on election fraud are based on facts and often involve the Pakistani community, hence why people got sent to prison for it.  Of course, to her that's offensive.  but she lacks the ability to argue the facts, so calls on the help of the other Ramona.  What a dirty tactic that is.  She can't win the argument, so she asks the other Ramona to back her up and defend her poor feelings from being hurt by this big bad Brexiteer.  The BBC are a complete disgrace for having this shit weasel hosting the show.  They attempt to use a spicy joke he made in a column before, I'm guessing as a means to smear him.  Nothing new there then.  Emily continues to smear by pointing out this guy has written stories about black MPs and female Labour MPs.  Like because he is white, doing that makes him racist and sexist.  What fucking world is this woman living in?  That has to be the most ridiculous attempt at backing up your claim someone is racist that I've ever heard.  I mean, he's a journalist.  He has to write stories.  I'm sure the colour of the MP is irrelevant.  The politics might not be irrelevant, but I'm sure the colour is irrelevant.  Rod rightly ends that clip calling out the disgraceful behaviour of the biased broadcasting corporation over the last two and a half years.  It's not just Brexiteers, it's a lot of people who hate the BBC and know it's a biased shit pit.  Let's be serious.  Now let's check out the final clip. ",

Eight minutes attacking the Brexiteer, two minutes gingerly questioning the Ramona who wants to ignore the will of the people and have another vote, or ten more votes until we stay in the EU.  How the fuck the BBC think this is a balanced segment is beyond me.  I think I will send a question into Newswatch asking how this is considered an impartial debate and why the show has such a blatantly biased host in Emily Maitlis.  So Tom continues his bullshit about democracy being ignoring the first democratic vote and having another one in the hope Remain wins this time.  It's a fucking joke.  Rod then shits on his parade, pointing out you didn't listen to democracy the first time, so you won't for a second or a third time.  Which is right.  These Ramonin fuckpigs wouldn't listen if it was 99% of people voting Leave and 1% voting Remain.  They don't believe in democracy.  They only care about themselves.  He actually laughs at Tom when he says there's no voting fraud in Peterborough.  Now I think there probably was myself as I've already said before.  The Brexiteer does prove to us at the end there that the left don't get jokes though.  It's probably why they use them to smear everyone.  So I'm going to end it there guys.  It was a two versus one as usual on these shows.  And as usual the Brexiteer made them fucking look stupid.  And shit on Emily.  so bad she had to call for backup from her Ramonin friend.  It's getting embarrassing now and the BBC's bias is clear for anyone to see yet again.  Now let me know what you guys think down in the comment section below.
