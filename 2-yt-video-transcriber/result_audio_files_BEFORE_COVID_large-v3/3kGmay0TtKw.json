            "text": "So there was a recent post on Twitter from a person that her name is Asia Young and her underscore name is underscore is just Asia.  And she was talking about a scenario where she went into a Walmart and she felt that she was being followed.  And throughout that process she felt uneasy to where she still stayed in the store for safety reasons.  But at the end, she ended up going to one of those little rooms where they put people in when they steal them and asked the people to run the camera back.  And then she saw that the people that were following her were actually following her from the time she left or came from the parking lot to the time she was possibly going to leave.  But luckily she took a detour in the store.  So this is her story.  So I'm at Walmart to make a quick store run like I always do.  I pulled up to park my car near the mid lane under the lamp post because I like parking where there is light.  Soon as I put my car in park and press my engine off, a lady gets out of her car and walks towards me.  Now remind you, some cars automatically unlock your doors when you press the stop engine.  So as soon as I saw her walking towards my car, I had a gut feeling, so I locked my doors back.  I don't care if she was African American like me, I locked them.  So I cracked my window so she could speak.  She said, hi, can you help me unzip my dress?  I realized I zipped it up too tightly this morning and I live by myself so I have no one to help me.  So Asia says, now I'm a nice person, so I almost fell for it, but God had me.  I started to look around and said, oh, okay, I don't have any shoes on.  Then she says, remember, ladies, it only takes as little as three minutes to get kidnapped.  It happened so quickly.  Glad I was thinking.  So somebody was asking her, well, which Walmart is it, Asia?  She said the Walmart on University.  And she gave us a description.  The woman drove a gray compact car.  And the man was in a white four-door Ford with tinted windows and a trailer.  And the police were alerted of this.  Somebody else came on her post.  and said oh my god the same thing happened to me at a walmart in louisville.  louisville is in in one of the suburbs cities of dallas.  please be aware of your safety.  so this person says after work I went in the grocery store and I went on a grocery side so I can get some fruit and when um when I got some bacon stuff as well.  then I went to the dog out and then I went to the.  she went to another aisle and she was on the phone and she said a guy bent over my cart and and a guy came up behind me and put his pelvis area directly on my butt and took his left arm and grabbed my wrist and flew up and turned around and he immediately started saying he was on his phone and ran into me by accident and I was just going.  everything was just going.  well.  then I noticed that he was following me literally everywhere I went and he met with another dude on.  Then they talked.  Then they walked their separate ways.  Well, I was at self-checkout checking myself out.  And I looked up and he was walking out of Walmart with nothing in his hand.  So I started freaking out.  So I go to the door greeter and I told the door greeter what happened.  And sure enough, he was standing out the front of the store waiting for me, signaling the other guy in the car.  Yes.  So when she viewed the cameras with the Walmart staff, she noticed that they had been following her the whole time when she had walked into Walmart.  So I got to thinking that this is nuts.  Now, when I was at Walmart, this was a while ago.  And you know what?  Let me tell you this other story.  It's one more.  So this happened to another person.  that saw JustAsia's post and she commented, she said that she honestly never goes to Walmart anymore.  She said once she was in the produce aisle, she was approached by a woman and was asked if she knew of God the Mother.  And she heard that this was a term that was used as a sex trafficking tactic, so she didn't respond.  and that was around 6 p.m.  in the broad daylight.  And then another lady came and responded to that response and said, a lady approached me too.  And I never heard of this until a man said that her husband started creeping towards her.  I mean, another man started creeping towards her and her husband and then said, God, the mother.  And she said, they too got on down at the store.  But really watch your surroundings.  There was also a documentary on, and I know a lot of times y'all be on your cell phones, you be texting and walking, pay attention and be alert because what they're doing now is if you ever get into a parking lot and you see a van, like two long vans, especially if they're white, but don't just walk around thinking, oh, because they're not white, this is not a suspicious scenario.  But if you have your little car parked in between two vans, one van is nosed in and one van is reversed in, that's a setup for kidnapping.  What one van is going to do?  Excuse me.  Both vans are going to block you in so nobody on the outside can see what's going on.  They're going to have a sliding door.  The other van is going to have another van.  It's going to be three vans.  That van or car is going to drive in and block you so the other people on the outside can't see you and then they're going to throw you in the truck or the trunk or whatever.  There was an all-white van that they actually just found about three months ago.  And when they opened the sliding door, there was no third row seats.  They peeled out all the seats, y'all, and had handcuffs on the ground.  It was like welded into the floor of the van.  And that's what they do.  They take out the seats so they can have a million hostages in there and they'll tie you down.  So I don't want you to be a victim because you're not paying attention.  And I don't care if it's Tom Thumb, Aldi's, Walmart, Piggly Wiggly, Save-A-Lot, the mall is a good place to pick up people.  Watch your surroundings because again, human trafficking is real.  And a lot of people are killing you for your organs.  Organ harvesting is even real.  Lure, put the R on the end.  I just don't want you to think because I'm telling you about the Arlington's the Louisville's and the Denton's that this is only happening in Texas is happening to our kids.  have you noticed that there are a lot of children missing especially in the Chicago area especially in California and especially in Texas?  you see the alert.  come on your phone is no games.  start paying attention to your surroundings because they're catching you when you're not looking and they're answering you.  they're asking questions like hey do you know what time it is?  and when you look down They're putting a little napkin over your nose.  There's another trick that they do.  Somebody might say, hey, would you like to buy this perfume?  Would you like to smell it?  Do not smell that because it has a fume on it.  that's going to knock you out.  I'm telling you guys because it could happen to any of us.  Again, start telling people where you're going.  I tell my friends, if you're going on a date, it's your first date and you don't know who this clown is, ping me your location because I need to know.  You look normal.  Sit down and kick it back on.  Come on in here.  We gonna be able to.  What is this all?  What?  Right here.  That's the power of everything.  That power, all this shit in here.  Extra air.  All that.  That's air?  It's like this, like all this.  I didn't even see that.  I don't even know what all this is.  It should look like a bomb or some shit.  This is, I don't know, this right here.  That's like the door.  I think this unlocked the door.  I want to close y'all in here and see.  Yeah, I'm going to open it.  I just want to see.  Knock on it so we can see.  Can you hear?  I will.  Climb out, Alicia.  Let her do it.  She ain't scared of him quite enough.  She from Texas with ice on her.  Knock.  Hold on.  Knock.  Say something!  Scream!  Open the door, tell her to scream.  You can't hear nothing.  You can hear it a little bit, but barely.  She said scream.  Closing the screen.  Do it again!  Oh, hell no!  You can't even hear it!  Hell no!  You can't even hear that shit!  It's crazy.  Listen to this.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that shit.  Yeah, they have some underneath here.  They look soft.  Because they don't weld it together.  That's the insulation, Alicia.  It's insulated.  It's insulated.  You can't even hear.  That's crazy.  This some fucked up shit.  Whole fucking power box.  And then this go, this connect to the outside.  That's how this thing get power right here, y'all.  This.  What is all this shit?  Like they tried to clean it.  The only thing you can see visible is that hill.  Yeah, and them little scratches.  Look on the roof.  Look at all them scratches up there.  Look.  I don't even know what that say.  That shit look like blood and everything.  It do.  It do. ",
