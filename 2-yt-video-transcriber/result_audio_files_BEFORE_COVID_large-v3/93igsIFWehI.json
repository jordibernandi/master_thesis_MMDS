I'm going to answer a question that I've been asked many times on this show by comments or email, but I've already answered this question many times.  So this one is going out to you mother fornicators who are too lazy to watch the older episodes.  No matter how many times we keep throwing back to them.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, there's one right here.  So once and for all, we're going to put to rest the space ghost conundrum.  Pop, why do you always mention space ghost?  What does space ghost mean?  I don't fucking care.  Space ghost.  When I say space ghost, it means exactly that.  I don't have any more dams, shits, or fucks to give.  In fact, I made an episode about that one.  Here it is.  Check it out.  I was in sixth grade.  Watching Space Ghost with my buddy Joey.  Didn't think anything of it.  We're just hanging out, eating fucking pizza, drinking coke, not giving a fuck about nothing.  Then the doorbell rings.  I remember I go there and there's Rami from down the street.  And the first time I was like, oh yeah.  The day before this, Rami was just a girl.  On that day after I answered the door, blonde hair, blue eyes, good fucking curves.  And I was like, oh shit, I need some of that.  And it was over for me right there.  When I say Space Ghost, in my mind, I'm going back to a time before I needed or wanted pussy.  With that being said, I officially petitioned to make Space Ghost the mascot for MGTOW.  From the age of like 14 to like 30 fucking 4, it's really hard to watch with Space Ghost.  Because up until you flip the switch... At 34, you're doing nothing but thinking with a little head, and that one has a hole in it.  And if she decides to beat it up a little bit, that's where all your bad decisions come out that you pay for for the rest of your life.  Three minutes of fun, 18 years on the run, and cheap hotels, they don't show Space Coast.  So, gentlemen, I hope that answers your questions.  In fact, we might have to make this an official trailer on the episodes for a while, so you lazy mother fornicators will watch it.  But don't just watch this video.  Go back six years.  We have over 500 videos.  It is hard to believe that I have over 500 episodes of 100% pure therapy.  Winning.  Your emails and your comments, they make it all worth it because I'm actually helping some people out there.  But if you really want to help me out and help me fight the fucking battles that's going on out there in the real fucking world, check out the links below and send us some cash because this shit ain't cheap.  So please hit the subscribe button and the bell and check out patrolbase.net for some swag because no matter how much YouTube is fucking with us, I'm not going away.  Let me rephrase that.  I'm going to watch me some Space Ghost, at least for a little while.  Bye. ",
