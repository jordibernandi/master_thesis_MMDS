            "text": "All right, everyone.  Yesterday, within 10 minutes of Trump making his initial tweet with regards to AOC and Tlaib and these others, I made a tweet as well saying basically it was my idea that Trump was baiting the Democrats.  What he was trying to do is force the Pelosi side of the party to embrace the far left that he was attacking.  See, they can't side with Trump over the far left.  So that means they have no choice but to side with the far left, give them a platform.  Lo and behold, what happens in what might be the most interesting day in U.S.  politics since the 2016 election.  100% correct, I guess, on Trump's motive, because he came out around 5.30. and confirmed that that was basically what he had done, which is, oh, well, yeah, Pelosi and the Democrats were trying to cast the far left aside, you know, basically as an embarrassment, which is what they are on a national level.  National versus state-level politics, and not working well for the Democrats right now.  And then he did that basically to force, as I said, Pelosi and the others to circle wagons around him.  Now, Ilhan Omar and AOC are the face of the Democratic Party.  They even had a lengthy and bizarre impromptu press conference in which these people were given a mass media platform by everyone.  NBC came out not long after.  NBC News.  Now, NBC, again... NBC Universal, parent company, also owns MSNBC, Comcast subsidiary, far, far left, democratically partisan, I mean.  They came out and they had a story saying, oh, well, Trump wanted Ilhan Omar and Cortez to be the face of the Dem Party, and he succeeded.  Yeah, his master plan totally worked.  In fact, it worked way better than I would have expected in the morning.  When I first saw his tweetstorm in the morning there, where he was talking about these things, I said, I know that this is a Trump plan.  This is 4D chess.  It's clear.  I told people that that's what it was.  It was obvious.  By the end of the day, it was 10,000 times more obvious, and Trump himself had basically alluded to the same thing, to the point where NBC is like, you know, the Democrats just fucked themselves.  And they did.  Internal polling.  that was not from that long ago shows that if trump is matched up against someone who was considered to be a socialist voters break heavily for trump.  if they consider that to be the case trump has managed to pay multiple democratic opponents of socialistic.  what he's trying to do now is make sure the whole party is labeled socialistic.  if he can successfully get the centrists the independent voters that ten fifteen percent of the population that really decides elections in a lot of vulnerable states If he can get them to consider the Democratic Party to be socialism friendly, he will win the election.  Not only will he win the election, he'll coast a reelection.  He will completely decimate his opponent.  The Republicans will probably retake the House, extend their lead in the Senate despite a map that's two to one against them, and wipe them out, the Democrats, on a state level.  They would be perilously close to being a minor party at that point.  The other effect is this.  It'll complete the paradigm shift.  Right now, you have a lot of ideological schism within the Democratic Party.  But that schism mainly takes the form of people fronting opposition candidates, like some far-left candidate, like a Williamson or a Yang.  or a Gabbard from the other side, arguably.  You know, disaffected people, they glom on to minor candidates, they threaten to stay home, they have angry words on Twitter for the DNC, stuff like that.  But ultimately, at the end of the day, it doesn't physically crack the party apart.  What right now is an ideological schism would turn into a physical schism, which is that groups within the Democratic Party, maybe the business Dems, maybe the progressives, maybe the corporate backers of the neoliberals, would threaten to leave or just up and leave because Trump has destroyed them.  That's what could happen.  From that, what you get is a reformation of the Democratic Party.  There's never going to be a one-party system in the U.S People say, well, there's going to be one Democratic Party.  Demographics is destiny.  Pretty soon there will be no Republicans ever again.  That's bullshit.  That's not going to happen.  Nor, by the way, will the fact that Trump is playing 40 chess all the time and outmaneuvering the Democrats constantly, will it destroy the Democratic Party forever?  No, it'll force it to change, to create a new form of itself.  The best possible scenario is they jettison the far left back to the darkness where it came from.  They jettison the socialism, they jettison the commies, they put them back in the green and libertarian movements, because the libertarians absorbed accidentally some Bernie bros actually recently.  They do that, they become a party of JFK sort of thing.  They become a business Democrat party that cares about American workers, that cares about American interests, that is more populistic, maybe even nativistic.  That would be good.  That would be a party that might even be worth voting for.  They would actually give a damn about the people living in the fucking country paying their salaries.  The Republicans have already successfully overhauled themselves.  There's still a schism within the party with the Never Trumpers, but it's really an afterthought.  It's not within the Dem Party.  The Democratic Party's primary structure helps the opposition.  Arguably, they're trying to fuck Bernie over again, like with the other day when they've set the groundwork for blaming him if they lose in 2020, and probably will.  And then I saw a bunch of YouTubers were uploading videos basically saying what I had said within 10 minutes of Trump's tweet.  It was obvious.  And you don't need a crystal ball.  It's very formulaic, Trump.  That's the thing.  The beauty of it is how simple it is.  He's made a career off of this basic same formulaic framework.  He redirects people's attention.  Basically, here's the basic fundamental idea, if you will.  And this is a bit of an oversimplification, but it's as good as I can explain it in a limited span of time because I've got other things I've got to talk about, too.  If you know how people generally will react to stimuli, and if you're in a position to potentially control stimuli, you can control people.  You don't have to, and it's easier in a representative democracy like we have, in a republic, because you don't have to, it's like with Abe Lincoln, what would he say?  You can fool some of the people all the time, all the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time, I think was the quote.  You don't need to fool all the people, though.  You only need to fool a slim majority of people in a majority of the states in order to become the president.  And in order to govern, you have to be able to fool 51 senators, basically.  Trump could do that.  He's having an easy time of it.  People are going to look back on the Trump administration much more positively than in the here and now.  Trump almost begs the tabloid press to beat up on him.  It's what he's used to.  He's able to deal with it.  I think if they weren't doing it, he would be bored.  So actually, I don't think he dislikes the legacy media quite as much as you'd think, which might be why he focuses on partisan politics instead of the true problem, which is money with regards to the censorship of the alt media.  Of course, he is embracing the alt media, but he's not really tackling the fundamental underlying issue.  It's a step in the right direction, but it's one small step for mankind and for the First Amendment, if you will.  But Trump is a master of these things.  He's been doing this his entire career.  And so it was hilarious.  It's hilarious to even watch his fans say, well, no, this time it was a big mistake.  This will unify the Democrats.  Oh, yeah, kind of.  Well, not really.  I mean, it's creating more disunity down the road.  Because when the Democrats, you know, now have to wine and dine the far left, what does that do for Biden?  Biden can't get a board with their platform.  This fucks Biden more than any other Democrat.  Did you notice that?  Biden has to go.  He's being attacked by Sanders again based on health care.  I'll be talking about that, too.  He gets attacked because he refuses to go far, far, far, far left into the AOC stuff.  He's like, well, no, I'm not comfortable with that.  He's trying to be sane, but he's under increasing pressure to be insane.  The Democrats have formed like a self-replicating cancer, an infectious cancer, if you will, in which those that are already infected are trying to convince those that aren't to infect themselves willfully, and they call them racist, sexist, horrible people if they don't.  You don't agree that everything under the sun is bigoted?  You don't think we need a 90% marginal tax rate?  You don't think we need to eliminate transatlantic travel?  You don't think that we need to bomb the Russians?  You are an evildoer.  That's the Democrats of today because they're being led by AOC and stuff.  Pelosi knows this.  Pelosi is probably on her 20th gin since Trump made his initial tweet.  She's probably been drunk as a lord for the last 48 fucking hours dealing with this because she knows what he's doing.  The beauty is, even if you know what he's doing, there's nothing you can do about it.  It's like a stage musician.  I've been comparing Trump to an illusionist for several years now.  When the illusionist does their show, the trick's being done down here.  The illusionist is trying to get you to focus up here.  You don't even see it.  All you see is the flashy floor show.  Why do you think these are?  Smoke and mirrors sort of stuff.  Smoke and mirrors, fire, pyrotechnics and sparks and electrical arcing and scantily clad women with double Ds and stuff like that.  That's what the illusionist does.  And loud music and stuff like that.  You don't even really see the trick.  You're just seeing the after effects of the trick that's been successfully completed.  These people understand what Trump's doing.  They know that it's illusionism and they can't help it.  They're just transfixed.  He's like the best stage magician of modern times.  He's up there with Copperfield and all the others.  Yeah, it's amazing to watch.  It's hilarious to see people taken in by it.  And then you sit back, you can admire that even if you're not like a hardcore Trump fan.  Like there are plenty of things that Trump has said and done that I don't agree with.  But watching him do this the same way over and over again, you're taking something he's been doing for 30, 40 years and made billions of dollars off of, put it into politics and still make it work.  It's magical.  Literally, it's a form of magic and it's hilarious to watch.  The Democrats are totally out of their league.  AOC has a mild understanding of the basic concept.  She understands Trump's strategy of constant attention seeking, but she doesn't understand the greater, more broad strategy that he employs with regards to his political illusionism.  So she's constantly trying to go toe-to-toe.  She takes up this self-righteousness.  I'm not afraid of you, Mr.  Trump.  You're scared of us because we're strong and in power.  He's not scared of you.  I assure you, the last thing in the fucking world he's scared of is someone who's making his job easy by being such an attention-seeking socialist within the Democratic Party.  AOC is a dream come true for Donald Trump.  AOC and the progressives that surround her.  like she's Queen Bee number two after Pelosi, you're his greatest ally right now.  You're Trump's greatest asset in the Democratic Party or anywhere in US politics.  And you don't even realize it.  And even if they did, What are they going to do?  Destroy their own careers and resign in order to allow the Democrats to beat Trump?  It's not going to happen.  They're going to field candidates like Kamala and Bernie Sanders and push them to the fore and say the party is racist if they don't nominate them.  When Biden almost inevitably becomes nominee, he's going to be so weakened by this, he'll stumble into the general election.  That's Trump's entire operative strategy.  It's in reverse psychology when he pretends to be afraid of Biden.  He's not afraid of Biden.  He's also not afraid of Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Ward.  He's got contingencies for all of these people.  Buttigieg's probably the only one he doesn't really have an active contingency for.  He probably should develop one.  He's gone after him, but he's pulled the punches.  I don't think he takes seriously the threat of him winning the primaries, which I think is decent.  I mean, there's like a 1% chance of that.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
