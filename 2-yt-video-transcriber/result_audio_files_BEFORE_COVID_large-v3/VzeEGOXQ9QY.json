            "text": "Previously at the Philadelphia show.  Who pays for this?  We're leaving, we're leaving, but we just need to do this business.  First time, you must leave now.  All right, can you make sure that you get that to the proper people?  I'm the deputy chief of the sheriff's office.  All right, great.  Washington, right?  What's your guy's number?  049.  049, all right, thank you.  All right, that's it.  I'll come back when you guys are open to give one complaint.  You can't record them.  Sir, you can't record them.  Sir, this is the sheriff's station.  You can't record them.  What's the law that says... I mean, why are you guys lying to us?  I mean, I don't get it.  We just want a public records request and a complaint form, and then we'll be out of your hair.  How many times did I tell him that?  He was like three times, bro.  How you doing, sir?  Where do I go to get a... There's no recording on here.  And if you read the sign... For the courtrooms?  Yeah, if you read the sign out there, you know that you can't record me.  What floor is the court on?  Did you hear me, sir?  You're still recording me.  Yeah, it's right around the corner there.  I've read it already.  I've read all the way through the actual things for the courtrooms and proceedings.  Look, we've read this before.  And I need my public records request.  Okay.  Yeah, this is the same thing, the one they were quoting over here.  Right, but look, this isn't the court.  This is not the court floor.  This is the sheriff's office.  Where they conduct court business.  So where would I go to get a public records request in a complaint format, sir?  Over here, I guess.  Sam 400 to Sam 41.  Can you direct me where to go?  I told you that you can't record in here.  You're still recording.  It's for courtrooms, and this is not the court.  Turn those off.  I need a public records request, and I'll be out of here.  Just one more, sir.  All right.  You asked me for it.  No, we're not.  Do we know what that law says?  I don't care.  I've read the actual whole law of that, the directive.  You can't record them.  Sir, you can't record them.  Sir, this is the sheriff's station.  You can't record them.  What's the law that says... The law specifically states that any citizen is allowed to report on public officials... They're not public officials.  Supreme Court protects them.  They're not public officials.  This guy over here, I believe, is the deputy chief, right?  This guy right here?  One of these guys that came out before?  So, I can record them.  They work here.  I can record them.  I mean, why are you guys, why are you lying to us?  I mean, I don't get it.  We just want a public records request and a complaint form, and then we'll be out of your hair.  How many times did I tell him that?  It was like three times, right?  Yeah.  You can lie as many times as you want.  It's fine.  You're reporting us.  Hello, how are you?  Okay, you cannot report here.  No, you can't.  You cannot report here.  Okay.  The CFR you have listed, PACF 0-1, only refers to recording a judicial facility.  Proceedings and litigants.  This is the sheriff's office.  If you go and read it, it says courtrooms, judicial chambers, where the witness is.  or other court business.  This is the sheriff's office.  And we do court business here.  We enforce court orders.  That's court business.  So you cannot... That rules for the court rooms.  No, it's not for the court rooms.  All we need is... Public records request.  Public records request and simple white forms.  Okay, get me some... You can have that.  That's all we want?  That's my problem.  We could have been already gone.  What you can do... Let me ask you a question.  Just ask a question.  If that's all you want, why are you videoed?  Well, we like to document everything in case things go awry, and we have the right to do it.  All right, but here's the question.  If we're not saying no to you, why do you need to get it done?  Oh, you guys were saying no.  That's why.  Who was saying no?  This guy right here in the red shirt.  He said no?  I said no.  And you recorded it, so you can go now.  He said I can't record it.  Have a seat, and we'll get you your complaint forms.  All right, great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Appreciate it.  Appreciate it.  No problem.  And with the cameras, you can go outside the door.  We have no problem giving you whatever you need, but the recording you can do outside the door, not inside of this area.  So you want the picture, you can have it, but that's not what you're going to do next.  I would suggest you listen to the sergeant and the inspector.  You can record outside here.  We're going to give you complaint forms.  I'll follow the orders at this point, okay?  I'm willing to compromise with you.  I'll record from right over here until we get our information.  All right.  We're going to get your forms.  We're going to work with you.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  We are going to double check that.  That's fine.  We will be back.  You will find that we're president's man.  He knows his stuff.  You're going to find out.  All right.  But we're going to get you.  Excuse me.  Can I get.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  And then also you're recording people who may be involved in PFAs.  Well, don't tell us that.  No, I'm telling you that because somebody can see it and something could happen.  I would never know.  Yeah, that has nothing to do with us.  It's a public place.  But actually you can't record.  I mean, if it's witness protection or something, yeah, I can blur their face or whatever.  I'm not here to record them.  I'm here to document my experience of how to get a public records request form.  A lot of people don't know that they can record the sheriff's office.  You can record in the sheriff's office.  I mean, anything other than that would be a lack of transparency, right?  You can't record here.  That's what I'm saying.  If you want transparency, you can get that.  Okay.  Boom.  Okay.  See that sign right there?  And I see that.  But also, even when you look here, Well, we already know what this is.  I read the actual document, which is pages long, and it's for courtrooms, proceedings, and litigants.  What do they define the court?  They say sheriff's office, DA's office, and all of that.  So we've been in plenty of DA's office, prosecutor's office, tax office.  We do this.  We do this.  We know our rights.  We're not coming in here blind.  Come on.  I'm not saying you're coming in blind.  You're coming in wrong.  I've read that whole order.  This is just a summary of what the directive that's here, 18 PACS statute.  I've been over it so many times.  It might be unusual, but it ain't wrong.  Say it again.  Where's the documents?  Now if we could just bring these guys some documents.  Bring these guys some documents.  Look, they take so long to get your information here that he just couldn't wait for them no more.  He just wants to get it for us so we can get out of here.  I mean, that's how customer service is supposed to work.  Here you are, sir.  Here you both go.  Okay.  Complaint form.  Public records request.  This is just the complaint form.  We have that.  We need the public records request.  We needed both, yeah.  Rights and no law.  Yeah, yeah.  We did a public records request.  The rights and no law.  So you could submit that to us if there's additional information that you're asking for as it relates to the law.  Oh, no, no, no, no, not about the law, like public records.  There's a form?  There's not a form that we have, per se.  If you like, you can go to the law department and get additional information from them.  What floor is that?  The law department.  It's over in, it's at 15th and JFK.  And they have public records information forms?  You can go to the law department to see if you can make that request there, okay?  You guys don't have them here.  You guys should.  Alright, we'll give him that. ",
