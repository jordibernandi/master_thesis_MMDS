            "text": "When I was little, my father was famous.  He was the greatest samurai in the empire.  Hey, everybody.  It's been a while.  This video isn't going to be anything groundbreaking, just a little chat, get you all up to speed.  Some of you have expressed concern over my absence from YouTube and have hit me up in various ways to express their appreciation for what I've done and their hope that all is well.  And for that, I am extremely grateful.  In fact, one gentleman named Jude came by the martial arts studio, not knowing I'd be there, and gifted me these nice training swords, and had some nice things to say.  Thank you again, Jude.  So, why the absence, and when will I be back?  This video notwithstanding.  Okay, this is how it went down.  In late April, early May, work got busy for a few weeks.  I was on site in East Texas doing long hours and not getting much free time to work on content.  And on the odd day when I would get a couple hours free from work or sleep, I would look at the comments to figure out the comment of the day topic, and I noticed an odd thing had begun to happen.  the anti-science comments had begun to disappear.  Not disappear like they were there and somebody deleted them, but they stopped coming.  In prior months, I would say that the anti-science position had been about 25% of the comments, and suddenly they were less than 5%, probably 2%.  And they would all be along the lines of, you're dumb and it's flat.  Some other flaccid nonsense.  The rest of the comments would be people laughing at Dmarble's embarrassing claims or Phuket Words' ignorance or telling me that I'm doing good work.  All of which is appreciated but doesn't make for good content to base a video on.  So I stopped looking at the comments altogether, focused on the work while I was on the road and participated in all the end of school year activities with my son who was ending his middle school career at the top of his class and getting some recognition for it.  Next thing I know, nearly a month has gone by and I think maybe I should check out the comments and videos and see what new nonsense is making the rounds and put something together.  And here's the honest truth, the absolute factual reason why I haven't made new content or responded to comments.  I found that I didn't miss it.  I found that giving the same answers to the same questions wasn't the slightest bit appealing to me anymore.  The idea of looking at more videos from willfully ignorant, fear-filled, fantasy-prone, and unstable people was just boring.  And I needed to heed my own advice when it came to this stuff.  I have to have fun doing it.  It is, after all, a hobby.  Not a job.  I have a number of things that I like to do outside of this platform, and all of them have been much more appealing than sitting in front of a camera and discussing the claims of the ignorant.  And I'm sure you all have noticed, but the anti-science, globe-denying community is drying up.  Their subscriber levels have plateaued.  Their content is stale.  They're a dying fad, and it shows.  New people aren't buying into their garbage, and it's getting really hard to get hyped up about flogging a dead horse.  So that's where I've been, in the world, enjoying the sunlight and conversations with normal people.  Am I going to be back and making more videos?  Yes, I am.  But not just for the sake of putting content out there.  I have to be inspired not only by the subject matter, but in my execution of it.  But don't worry, it's coming.  I have long-term projects that still aren't completed and more educational pieces that I want to get out there to clarify the science that so many online just don't seem to get.  I'm going to be focusing more on my illustration and comics, so you'll get content of that as well, which some of you may enjoy.  And as the 2020 election season ramps up, you'll likely hear more of my opinions on that topic, which many of you may not care for, because you want to agree with me at all times.  But that's not likely to happen.  But I hope you stick around.  So until next time, I'm good.  Don't worry.  I'll be back.  That's my job.  That's what I do.  I don't lose.  I win.  I win.  Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  Maybe you came by and congratulated me on last night's victory.  I have a number of... Anti-science, globe-denying community is drying up.  Hey, dog.  Hold on a second.  You need to go.  You need to go.  Go, go, go.  Come on.  Out.  Out.  Thank you.  And more educational piece... But don't worry.  It's... But don't worry.  It's coming.  I... Drying up.  Their subscriber levels have plateaued.  Their content is stale.  Okay.  Has been a while.  Back to life! ",
