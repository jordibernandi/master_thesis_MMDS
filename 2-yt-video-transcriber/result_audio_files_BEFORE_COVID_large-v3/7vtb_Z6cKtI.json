            "text": "Mr Speaker, this issue is very important.  I heard that Honourable Abonte talking that we should call the CBM governor to come and tell us the reason.  We don't need the reason.  Anything that will affect our people is our responsibility as representative of the people here.  If we see anything that will affect people, to stop it.  Mr.  Speaker, seriously, I heard some people today complaining that somebody with a capital of 300,000, he is scared to keep that money in his home.  He take to the bank.  Maybe the property you will get out of that 300,000 is 5,000 or 7,000 naira.  The bank will remove 15,000 for the deposit.  Mr.  Speaker, if we look at the situation, Mr.  Speaker, people are suffering in this country and now we are going to the CBN now are trying to become a robbers.  Definitely, Mr.  Speaker, if CBN, if CBN will post this, how can you, Mr.  Speaker, just take your money, your own money, to the bank to keep?  Bank will remove?  Just to remove something?  Because we keep the money? ",

Whenever you put money in the bank, They will remove the charges and monthly they will remove withdrawal percentage.  Every month.  Already there is that withdrawal percentage and others.  But this, Mr.  Speaker, just if you deposit money, you keep your money, so now they are telling us that our local people will appear to take their money to the bank.  and at last then the criminal will get opportunity to go and continue stealing the money.  so mr speaker seriously this issue will cause serious problems in this country.  that is why we must we must call the attention of the cbn to stop this implement now because they said If you are withdrawing above 500,000, there is charges.  Of course, since we need the cashless policy in this country, that policy is good.  If you need more cash, you pay.  But where are you at?  Just deposit.  You are depositing your money.
