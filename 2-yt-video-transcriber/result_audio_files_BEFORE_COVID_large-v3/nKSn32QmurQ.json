For the sake of discussion, I could accept the entire thing as is, and all we would have to agree to is that there was a sufficient cause for the universe.  To make the leap that this causes a deity is entirely outside of the scope of the cosmological argument, and does not follow from the premises.  Let's say someone emerged from a crowd to lay claim to the throne based on their royal lineage.  Prove that you are the son of the king!  Every human who was born has parents.  This is true.  I was born.  Also true.  Therefore, I have parents.  But that doesn't mean your father was the king.  Nonsense.  Hand me the crown.  So even if the Kalam succeeds, it ultimately fails.

If we're going to evaluate the truth of the first premise, we might first consider defining terms.  What does it mean to begin to exist?  For example, when does a chair begin to exist?  Is it when the plans are drawn up?  When the wood is cut?  When the pieces are assembled?  The first time someone sits on it?  In fact, perhaps we would be better off reworking the entire argument.  Premise 1.  Everything that begins to exist is a rearrangement of things that already exist.  premise to the universe began to exist.  conclusion the universe is a rearrangement of things that already exist.  that is equally as valid as the kalam and brings us to the conclusion that our universe came not from nothing but from something pre-existing which we'll get to later.  as for a cause Well, in order for a cause and effect to have relevance, it's clear that one would need to have time as well.  Cause must come temporally before effect.  If we try to extend this premise beyond time as we know it, then we'd be in a realm where there might not be causation as we know it.

In this case, the difference between universe and cosmos, as they are used in science, since that's where the discussion will be going.  The cosmos, as the late great Carl Sagan put it, The cosmos is all that is, or ever was.  Whereas the universe is best defined as the single instantiation of space-time where we live.  The universe is part of the cosmos, like a storage unit is part of a storage facility.  And we have no way of knowing if we are merely one among many universes, or one in a succession of universes, or maybe the only universe.  What's important is that modern cosmologists don't say that the universe has been here forever and is just there.  and that's all, as Craig asserts.  That's how they would describe the cosmos.  In science, cosmos and universe are not interchangeable terms.  Craig's video goes on to appeal to science's acceptance of the Big Bang theory to establish that the universe had a beginning.  As long as Craig sticks to the scientific definition of universe and doesn't pretend that it's the same as the cosmos, then we can skip that part and all just agree.  Oh, wait. ",

The Big Bang was the start of our universe's local space coordinates, x, y, and z, and time, t. But just as a piece of graph paper has its own localized x, y spatial coordinate system, that piece of paper still exists in the universe's three-dimensional space.  Thank you.  The cosmos may well have its own spatial dimensions.  It may have many more dimensions than our four, or perhaps it could have even zero dimensions.  The point is there could be any number of sufficient causes for our universe that exist in some semblance of space outside of our version of it.  The cause needn't be spaceless.  Timeless?  What applied to the three dimensions of space equally applies to the fourth dimension of time.  A stopwatch has its own temporal system, but the one pressing the start button still exists in their own temporal system.  The cosmos may have its own system of time, or it may exist in such a state that the idea of time is incoherent.  We don't yet know what the sufficient cause of the universe was, but it could easily have been temporal. ",

Whatever was happening inside that singularity would certainly have been material as we know it.  earlier craig appealed to the second law of thermodynamics but let's talk about the first law.  energy can be transformed but it cannot be created nor destroyed.  if this law holds we need not appeal to a god to deal with infinite regress.  our eternal constant is energy.  If energy has always existed, then it follows naturally that any existing universes could be a mere transformation of a part of that energy.  This is my personal cosmology.  That if something has to exist eternally, that thing is energy.  The advantage of choosing energy over positing an eternal God is that we all agree that energy is a real thing. ",
