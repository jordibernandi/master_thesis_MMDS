            "text": "I am excited to be announcing a 40-day Jesus Fast in 2020, March 1st through April 9th, the Lenten period, a global 40-day fast, daring to believe for a breakthrough globally into a new era.  of harvest.  before there was ever an original jesus movement there was an original jesus fast and it is our conviction that once again the spirit of god is driving his church into the wilderness to fast so that we might come out in the power of the spirit that those who sit in darkness will see a great light.  35 years ago i read a book by a man named derrick prince And the premise of the book was this, that fasting, corporate fasting is the key to shaping and shifting the history of nations.  For 35 years, we've been fasting and we've been calling for fast.  And then in 1999, a man came to me and asked me, to help him call the whole globe to a 40-day fast preparing for the new millennium.  And so I prayed, Lord, if you want me to do this, have someone give me Ecclesiastes 11.1 as a scripture to confirm it.  Cast your bread upon the water, and after many days you will find it.  In other words, throw your revelation out about the fast and don't eat.  a man came gave me a word not knowing anything and he said the lord is giving you.  ecclesiastes 11 1. cast your bread upon the water.  i knew it was my word and so we blew the trumpet.  i don't know how wide and far took place, how many were engaged in.  I do know this, that for 20 years now, we've been calling fasting in the nations of the earth.  Now, 2020, in the anniversary of the call, we believe this is the hour for the 2020 vision.  All across the globe, evangelists are talking about stadiums being filled.  There's an expectation of mass of Jesus fast to clear the skies, to prepare the way for a great Jesus movement.  And so would you join us March 1st through April 9th?  I'm going to nations across the globe.  We're talking to leaders.  Leaders are beginning to cast the vision for their nations.  You leaders who are watching this, would you pray about blowing the trumpet for your own nations?  And across the continents.  We believe it's the hour.  It's the time for the 2020 vision.  And it's time for the Jesus. ",
