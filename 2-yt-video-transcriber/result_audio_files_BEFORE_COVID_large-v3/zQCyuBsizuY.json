            "text": "Shalom.  Well, I opened the proverbial can of worms, didn't I?  This series, liars, lunatics and demons.  What were you thinking, Matthew?  Talking about what is scripture and inspired and what is not.  You've offended so many people and you even called out Ellen G. White, which is outrageous.  That's why I want to make this video today, because a very concerned person wrote me a letter and said that I made a mistake.  It's possible that I did.  Did I make a mistake calling out Ellen G. White?  Liars, lunatics and demons.  I'm opening up the comments section today because I'd like you to throw up some quotes that you have got from Ellen G. White and let's determine together whether I need to recant and backtrack my statement that I made about Ellen G. White last week.  Because there's a bunch of information out there and we want to get to the root of it.  Liars, lunatics and demons.  So I'm going to read you the letter that was sent to me this week, and you be the judge of whether I should repent, recant, and retract my statement that I made about Ellen G. White.  I have read, of course, her writings.  I have read... her quotes, but I have not read as much as the lady who wrote me this letter.  So let me read to you what she sent me.  Dear Matthew, You said Ellen White denied the personage of Yahushua and is a liar and influenced by demons.  Please know, I have read Mrs.  White's writings for 40 years.  Now, that's pretty impressive.  I haven't.  So maybe she's got a lot more information than Mrs.  White, and I need to backtrack on my statement and recant.  Let's see.  She goes on to say this.  They, those bloody Jesuits, she didn't say bloody, sorry.  They, the Jesuits, have manipulated her writings.  For instance, evangelism was written by Leroy Fromm and he was buried in a Masonic cemetery.  Well, that sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it?  She goes on to say, in evangelism is when the writings mention the Trinity or third person of the Godhead.  Now, that's what I was talking about last week is her breakdown on the triunity.  Now, she goes on to say these were statements EGW never said.  She believed Yahushua was the literal son of God and that the Holy Spirit was the breath of Yahushua.  Well, that would be problematic for me, but we'll read on more.  It's the manipulated writings that are not your brief.  Please retract your statement.  That's in all caps.  And I'm willing to do that if I'm wrong.  And that's why I'm making this video.  See if you guys can help me out in establishing.  what exactly did Ellen G. White believe about the gods?  godhead the triunity?  and am I correct in stating that she was a liar influenced by demons?  or have I fallen for the proverbial lies of maybe Leroy Froome and others that messed up and hijacked her writings?  it's possible.  that's why I'm making this video and I am thinking that you guys out there are going to help me out with your investigative looking and reading.  She goes on to say this, of course, please retract your statement.  If you haven't read her original published writings, you may get confused here.  It's important to explain here.  By your words, you will turn away many Seventh-day Adventist believers who are studying the Malkythetic message.  Now, that would be dreadful, and I certainly don't want to do that.  I certainly don't want to do that.  She goes on to say, please, Matthew, be careful.  You know everything and everyone has been infiltrated.  And infiltrated.  Seventh-day Adventist literature has been affected since before she even died.  We have many sincere Christians who will be turned off from the truth because of this hasty statement.  Help me.  Did I make a hasty statement?  Did I?  I don't think I did.  But it's possible.  i do get very zealous but i have read what i've read.  you see she goes on to say i would have said it like this.  now she makes a suggestion quote.  ellen white's writings have been manipulated by essay tan changed and tarnished.  she always encouraged people to go to get the truth from the Bible.  Only the original writings are valid regarding the personage of Yahushua and the Trinity was not part of the original pillars of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.  She also advocated the statues, but most Seventh-day Adventist ministries today advocate a false Godhead.  So, This needs to be dealt with as soon as possible.  She closes her letter that way.  So that's why I'm making this video.  There you have it in a nutshell.  I said what I said last week about Ellen G. White, and I believed it was true.  At this point, I still believe the statement that I made was true, but I am open to correction.  And this lady has read Ellen G. White's writings for 40 years, which is a lot more than me.  So that's why I'm paying attention to what she wrote me.  And I'm hoping that you guys out there will give me some quotes from Ellen G. White and then a little sentence or so on.  Yes, I was right or no, Matthew, you were wrong.  And then we can move past this.  And in the hopes of being good students of the word, make a good decision on what is going on with the liars, the lunatics and the demons.  Or is Ellen G. White telling the truth?  There's a question I pose to you.  Hey, catch us live this Shabbat where we'll do part two of Liars, Lunatics and Demons.  And give us a thumbs up on this video.  It does make a difference.  And subscribe to the channel.  Comments below.  Get busy.  I'll catch you on Shabbat.  Shalom.  ... ... ",
