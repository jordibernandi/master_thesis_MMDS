You also argue not merely that it is mistaken, but that it has done positive harm.  Discrimination and Disparities.  With the prevailing social vision came a more non-judgmental approach to behavior, as well as multiculturalism, a de-emphasis on policing and punishments, and an emphasis on demographically based fair shares for all.  So what you're talking about here is not explicitly governmental action or government programs, but the way people begin thinking about society.  In the United States, you continue murder rates, rates of infection with venereal diseases, and rates of teenage pregnancies were among the social pathologies whose steep declines in the 1950s reverse and begin to get worse in the 1960s.  Okay.  Ideas alone, it's what people carry in their heads. ",
