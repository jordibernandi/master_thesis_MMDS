            "text": "Look, there's the Black Holocaust.  I knew it was prophecy.  A thousand times worse than the Jewish atrocities.  Uneven playing field, there'll never be a fair score.  Cause in 1619, that's when they declared war.  We the 12 tribes, the ones that the promise reaches.  You need to have love in your heart like I do for you.  You got love?  Yes, I do.  How do you exemplify your love?  How do you demonstrate your love?  By standing here and choking in with your state.  By standing there and loving me?  Are you a racist?  Yes, I am.  So what are we going to do about it?  Here's what we do.  What are we going to do about it?  Hey, bring it out.  I'm going to continue to look.  Show me we're not a racist.  Show me you're not a racist.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey.  Back up, back up, back up.  How do you want me to show you that?  Not by a hug.  So you can murder 200 million people and all you have to do is give them a hug and it should be okay?  Right.  You said show me that I'm not a racist.  But that's a false equivalency to you trying to show somebody you're not a racist.  Go ahead and hit me.  Hit me.  Go ahead.  You don't take a hug?  You want to do a hit?  Back up.  I'm not trying to hit no old man.  You're just a shit.  I'm not trying to hit no old man.  I'm not a new man.  But I want you to go back to your talk.  I'm young.  I've got my wine skin.  He's 20 years old.  He's 20 years old.  He's 20 years old.  He's 20 years old.  If you're not preaching love... I don't know why you're bringing it up.  Jesus.  Bring it out.  It's the book of Revelation.  See, the white man thinks that he can kill 200 million people.  And he thinks that he can oppress a nation, lock their kids in cages at the border, and all he has to do is give you a hug.  And that's what makes it okay.  That's the real racism.  That's the real racism.  Go ahead.  Verse 27, he shall rule them with a rod of iron.  He's going to get ruled with an iron rod.  Why does the Bible say he's going to get ruled with an iron rod?  Go ahead.  As the vessel of a potter shall they be broken to shivers.  What do you think about white folks in there?  Give me a white folks in there.  I don't feel that.  I'm ashamed of my ancestors.  What's your ethnicity?  You don't want to say it, right?  Because you know they have a part to do with the translation.  That's right.  You know they have a part to do with the Mexican genocide, the Native American genocide.  They got it.  All the other indigenous people, they got it.  They got it.  Hey, white men, you're going down.  That's right.  1, 2, 3, devil!  1, 2, 3, devil!  1, 2, 3, devil!  Revelation 13, 10.  Racist!  Exactly.  Racist.  That's right.  You got to carry that.  You got to carry that.  You own that.  All of you guys own that.  You want to be racist?  Hey, chill out, man.  Give him some bucks.  Hey, chill out.  Come here.  Chill out.  Just come here.  You don't give a shit.  Come on, man.  Come on.  Let's have a conversation.  Chill out.  Chill out.  Do you believe in the Bible?  Do I believe in the Bible?  I believe in the messages from the Bible.  I also believe that you can use the Bible to justify anything, including slavery.  Okay, that's true, which your eyes did.  So the Bible is like a screwdriver, right?  You can use it to kill people, or you can use what it's intended to do and fix things.  So when you come to me, why are you wearing those?  Why are you wearing those?  Bam!  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Again, he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.  That's what the Bible says.  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.  That's right.  So they took this Bible, and they tried to use it to enslave blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.  Let them know.  And what they didn't realize is that the Most High had that number in this Bible.  That's right.  In the last book of the Bible, it says that the white man is going to go into captivity for what they did to the Negro and Latino.  That's right.  That's right!  And if you black aesthetics and Native Americans don't want justice out here, then to hell with you coon-ass niggas.  That's right!  You're a tiny man.  You're a tiny man.  Tiny ideas.  And they killed 200 million of our people.  Go ahead.  Must be killed with a sword.  So that's the gospel.  Right.  That's the gospel and that's the Bible.  God is picking up the Bible and omitting these scriptures to say, oh, just turn the other cheek.  Christ didn't say, Christ wasn't talking about literally.  Let me tell you a question.  Do you think Christ turned his other cheek?  Give me Revelation 1 and 7.  I'm going to show you that it doesn't mean what Christians say it means.  It means show mercy to your own people.  Hold your question.  I want to get to it.  Let me read this last scripture.  Don't forget it.  Revelation 1 and 7.  This is the book of Revelation, chapter 1, verse 7.  Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him.  Every eye shall see him, even who?  And they also which pierced him.  Pierced him.  Pierced him.  So if all eye is going to see him, according to those, even those that pierced him, if he's coming back to kill those who pierced him, why the hell wouldn't he turn the other side?  He's waited 2,000 years to come kill the people who pierced him.  That's a great point.  That's right.  He also said, and in red writing, he also said, if somebody hits you, don't fight.  Turn the other cheek and let it hit you.  I'm not sure on people.  I'm not sure on people.  Okay, I'll show you.  For example, in the law, it says Leviticus, what is that?  Leviticus.  The man smites you.  No, no, no.  Somebody grab that.  We're going to show you that all the Christ and Paul saying that exemplify mercy, it means within your own people.  Because if that's the case, Tim, we wouldn't have to fight against these nations.  Grab that.  We're going to show you that talking about the enemies amongst our own people.  Now the enemies outside of our people are ethnicity, like whites, Arabs, Africans.  Contrary to popular belief, we're not the Hamites.  The Hamites populated Africa.  Continentally, we moved to Africa and came from that location, but the actual descendants of Ham are african mostly mostly african.  all right.  so go ahead.  ah this is the book of exodus chapter 23 verse 4. if thou meet thine enemies ox if you meet your enemies.  this is moses giving the law to the israelites.  so we know he's only talking about the israelites.  go ahead or his ass going astray or his donkey going astray.  what should you do?  Thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.  Bring it back to your enemy, because it's your brother still, even though you guys are at odds and don't like each other.  Galatians 4 and 16.  Was that the question that you asked?  My question was, you know how you were telling the white guy right here, his ancestors as well.  So my question is, do we judge one person for all the other people that were like generations before him?  First Corinthians 2.  Go ahead, get that.  Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?  And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  So not only are we supposed to judge individuals, we're going to judge the whole damn world.  But that wasn't the shift that I needed.  What he's asking is, do we judge individuals or do we judge a whole nation?  Do we judge a whole nation?  God is not dealing with on a micro level.  He's going on a macro level.  So there was some good Mexicans, some good indigenous Aztecs and Mayans who still got killed, right?  Why?  Because God judged you guys as a nation.  The Bible says that Daniel had to go into slavery With Israel, even though he was a perfect prophet, so God is dealing with judging the whole nation, not just the individual.  So although you may be a good white person, you might feel bad about slavery, you still have to get judged as a nation for what your nation did.  Don't worry about that.  You mean Genesis 15 and 13.  Now, some of the Egyptians, when they had the Israelites in slavery, there were some good Egyptians.  They gave us their gold, they gave us some pearls, they gave us some silver, but God destroyed that whole nation.  Genesis chapter 15 verse 13, and he said unto Abraham, know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years.  and also that nation whom they shall serve.  will i judge after that that what that person that egyptian or that nation?  after that nation after that nation will i judge?  so because of what one man did pharaoh?  yeah all of egypt got judged and that's how it's going to be with the nations who put their hands on the black hispanics and native americans.  they're going to judge as a nation according to the bible.  Bring that out in Jeremiah 12.  Now, this is KJV, but we do comparative text.  We can use any translation that you want.  And guess what?  I'll make my agenda fit with it.  Give me Jeremiah 12.  This is Jeremiah 12, verse 14.  Now, if these nations repent, somebody say, well, can a nation repent?  Can an individual repent?  God don't care if one individual repents.  If these white men, if the white man wants to stop his judgment, well, let's take away the white man because the Bible says Esau came to repent.  Let's say the Arabs, they built the ships for the slave trade.  Let's say if they wanted to repent, the whole Arab nation would have to say, we're sorry for what we did, and we repent, and we want to follow the God of Yahweh, as some say it, but we say you haven't.  They would have to do that, and they would have to follow the laws, statutes, and commandments.  Bring that up.  Thus said the Lord against all my evil neighbors that touch their inheritance.  All my evil neighbors and all the nations who touch the inheritance of God is just people.  We're an inheritance of God.  White people is just a mix.  No, they're not a mix.  So what happened in the beginning was God created all nations.  He created humanity, but he only chose one people from humanity.  That's the Adamites.  Then when the flood happened, it got wiped out.  But through Noah and Shem... and uh uh noah shem eber abraham jacob to the top of israel.  now he said we are his chosen people.  this is the whole blood.  they were the fathers.  yeah that's the whole line.  yeah they were the fathers of us.  go ahead.  um which i have caused my.  we did a little louder.  Thus said the Lord against all my evil neighbors that touch the inheritance, which I have caused my people Israel to inherit.  Behold, I will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.  So the Lord said he's going to pluck these nations out.  This scripture right here is so powerful.  This is so powerful.  This shows you that there's going to be slavery in the kingdom of heaven.  Read it again.  Read it slowly.  Thus saith the Lord against all my evil neighbors that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit.  Hey brother, come out the ring.  Come up closer.  Go ahead.  behold i will pluck them out of their land.  so the bible says he's going to take these nations from out of their land.  yeah where is he going to do?  why is he going to take them from their land to do what?  he's going to take them to their land and bring them to israel so they can be put in slavery.  go ahead but watch this.  go ahead and pluck out the house of judah from among them.  so he's going to take us from among them showing you what When Christ comes back, we're going to be in these lands as slaves still to this day because we're still slaves, right?  Go ahead.  And it shall come to pass after that.  I have plucked them out.  After he has plucked these nations out, what is he going to do?  I will return and have compassion on them.  So?  here's the thing in the kingdom of heaven the lord is going to show mercy to these other nations after slavery but they'll still never be on a higher level.  well that's a. that's a whole another topic.  well you guys don't believe in hell.  yeah we don't.  we don't believe in hell.  yeah because the bible doesn't teach hell Contrary to what people believe.  Well, the Bible does talk about how Jesus went and took the keys of a gate.  He defeated death, pretty much, right?  Yeah.  When he rose again from the dead.  So some people say that he was in hell for three days, right?  Well, the story that I was meant to believe was that by him dying and defeating death, he took the keys to a gate.  So he pretty much, that's why when we die, we get judged.  Was Jesus the only one to defeat death?  Go ahead read that and will bring again every man to his heritage.  So he said he's going to take these nations, not to have a United Nation Council.  He's going to take them to bring them captive into Israel for a thousand years, and he's going to put them back in their nation.  Go ahead.  And every man to his land, and they shall come to pass, and they will diligently learn the ways of my people.  So they have to swear by my name, the Lord liveth, as they taught my people to swear by Baha'i.  So just like they have taught you Christianity, this false doctrine, and it's embedded in us, the Bible says the real truth is going to be embedded in them.  Go ahead.  Then shall they be built in the midst of my people.  But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the Lord. ",
