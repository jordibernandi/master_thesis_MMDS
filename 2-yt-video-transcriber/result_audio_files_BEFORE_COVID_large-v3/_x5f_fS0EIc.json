            "text": "Hi, this is Dr.  Gregory Sadler.  I'm a professor of philosophy and the president and founder of an educational consulting company called Reason.io, where we put philosophy into practice.  I've studied and taught philosophy for over 20 years, and I find that many people run into difficulties reading classic philosophical texts.  Sometimes it's the way things are said or how the text is structured, but the concepts themselves are not always that complicated, and that's where I come in.  To help students and lifelong learners, I've been producing longer lecture videos and posting them to YouTube.  Many viewers say they find them useful.  What you're currently watching is part of a new series of shorter videos, each of them focused on one core concept from an important philosophical text.  I hope you find it useful as well. ",

            "text": "In the first chapter of Zarathustra's Discourses, in the first part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche begins by having Zarathustra set out for us three metamorphoses, , transformations from one state into another.  And This is a rather enigmatic set of passages if we consider it solely in terms of the images alone.  But if we look at the explanations that Zarathustra is providing, it makes entire sense why you would need to move first to one, then to the next, and then to the next.  Nietzsche is not setting out some sort of developmental theory here that says that everybody goes through these, or this is the only way to proceed, but he's setting out a path that a person could in fact follow.  And we have the transformation of the spirit first into a camel, and then from the camel into a lion, and then from a lion into a child.  And you might say, well, you know, camel and lion, that makes perfect sense.  They're both creatures.  They have their own natures.  They can, you know, live in the desert that he's talking about.  A child, I don't know about that, but what is a child?  A child is a not yet finished and formed human being, potentiality.  as Nietzsche is going to say, a new start.  So it actually does make good sense.  He's not saying, by the way, that anybody or everybody could or should follow this path of the three metamorphoses, but this is what the person that he's writing the book to the person who does in fact have a spirit that is capable, a spirit or mind, a geist that is up to the tasks of self transformation, that's what they could do.  And these really are genuine transformations.  There's something good that's being attained in each of the states, something that's necessary for one's development, but then it gets left behind.  It gets actually, what's good gets turned into the burden that has to be abandoned or recognized as no longer sufficient.  So he says, I'm going to name you these three metamorphoses.  The spirit becomes a camel, the camel a lion, the lion at last a child.  how does the spirit become a camel?  He says, so there are many heavy things for the spirit, things that are difficult to bear, schwer in German, right?  Things that weigh upon us.  And he's going to give us a whole list of these that we'll go through.  Then he talks about the strong, the stark, weight bearing, , the one who can drag things, spirit in which dwells respect and awe, , right?  A respect for things that are noble, that are good, that are perhaps even holy, a recognition of values.  So this is not just anybody who can become a camel.  It's the person who recognizes something beyond merely the satisfaction of their appetites or their vanity, something we could say greater than themselves, something that requires of them some sacrifices or acknowledgement.  And then he says, its strength longs for the heavy, for the heaviest.  So again, he's making a distinction here.  It's not just the people that can put up with stuff.  When you really are strong, You want to find occasions to use, if not necessarily demonstrate to others, that strength that you have.  You want to do it for yourself.  If you know that you can, you know, run along ways, well, then you want to run along ways so that you can show yourself that you're still capable of it.  Now let's look at some of the examples that he provides.  He says, well, what is the heaviest thing, right?  What is heavy?  Says the weight bearing spirit.  It kneels down like the camel and wants to be well-laden.  What is the heaviest thing you heroes that I can take it upon me and rejoice in my strength?  Is it not this, to debase yourself in order to injure your pride?  You already feel proud of yourself.  Is it not to take on even more that shows that you're not so great?  To humble yourself.  It says, to let your folly shine out in order to mock your wisdom.  Or is it this, to desert our cause when it is celebrating its victory or to climb high mountains in order to tempt the tempter or to feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge and for the sake of truth, to suffer hunger of the soul.  Acknowledging something greater than oneself, right?  Not needing to be the center of attention, not needing to make it all about oneself, Although it is kind of all about oneself in a different way, isn't it?  Then he says, or is it this to be sick and send away comforters and make friends with the deaf who never hear what you ask?  To suffer without expecting other people to secure you, right?  Or is it this to wade into dirty water, which is the water of truth and not to disdain cold frogs and hot toads?  Or is it this, to love those who despise us and offer our hand to the ghost when it wants to frighten  us?\"?  So he goes on and he says, whatever burden you're taking on, the weight bearing spirit takes on these heaviest things, like a camel hurrying laden into the desert, thus it hurries into the desert.  Now, before we go on to the lion, How is this a transformation?  Well, you could take on these burdens and then complain about them or write a little tweet about it.  Oh, such a hard day.  Do some vague booking on Facebook, right?  Oh, it's so rough for me, right?  People do that sort of thing all the time.  They're not a camel.  They're just a complainer.  The camel is saying, this is actually going to be good for me.  I am going to take this stuff on.  I don't know if I'm really up to it, but let's see.  And holy crap, I am enduring it.  I'm making it.  Let me bear this burden and go out into the desert.  And that's where the second transformation happens.  The transformation from the camel into a new state of being.  The lion.  The lion.  The text, right?  The lion is what?  We talk about the king of the jungle, but really, you know, deserts were a really scary place to run into a lion because they're giant, they're fearsome, and there's nowhere to hide in a desert, is there?  So the lion is also sort of, so to speak, the king of the desert.  And if you look at ancient art, you see people hunting lions, trying to drive them out of these wastelands, right?  So he says, in the loneliest desert, the second metamorphosis occurs, the spirit becomes a lion.  What is this about?  What does this symbolize?  It wants to take on freedom.  So before it was about taking on burdens.  Now those burdens are gone.  It wants to take on freedom.  Freedom for what?  Freedom to run around and, you know, find an oasis and drink some water, eat some gazelles.  No, the freedom to rule itself, to be Lord in its own desert.  And here Nietzsche says, you run into something that would otherwise beat you down and that the camel could acknowledge as right.  And the lion is going to say, no, I will not put up with this.  So it says, it seeks here its ultimate Lord.  It's Letzta, right?  In each of these cases, its ultimate Lord.  It will be an enemy to him and to its ultimate God.  It will struggle for victory with the great dragon.  So we have three things here, all of which are ruling or presenting themselves as dangerous.  Lord, ruler, God, creator of everything, perhaps, dragon.  This figure of the dragon, what does it mean?  He says, the great dragon is called thou shalt.  The spirit of the lion in contrast says to it, I will.  And we're going to come back to that in a moment.  So he says, thou shalt lies on its path, sparkling with gold, a scale covered beast.  On every scale glitters golden thou shalt.  So it's not just one single thou shalt or imperative or rule or, you know, social more or something like that.  Instead, it's a thousand of them.  It's an entire system.  You're being confronted by this great beast, every single scale of which is a rule for you, a procedure, an order, a way that you ought to be.  And the lion says, screw you.  I'm going to do my own thing.  I am going to be free of you.  And in doing so, the lion doesn't confront the dragon with a, I've got a bigger thou shalt than your thou shalts or anything like that.  He doesn't play that game.  Instead, he opposes to that, I will.  I'm going to do this.  I choose for myself.  I'll create this space of freedom and forget about your rules.  I'll fight against you.  So he says, values of a thousand years glitter on the scales and thus speaks the mightiest of dragons.  All the values of things glitter on me.  The system opposes you and says, I am the embodiment of goodness, of rightness, of beauty, of value, of whatever it happens to be.  I've got the answers.  You need to get in line with the prescriptions that I have for you.  You need to obey these rules.  You need to acknowledge these values.  Even if you don't live up to them, you should at least feel guilty about not living up to them.  You should at least acknowledge that you're a failure.  And the lion says, screw you.  I'm in charge here.  I'm not in charge of you.  I'm not in charge of all the people who buy into you, but I'm in charge of myself and my little plot of this desert, which maybe is just where my paws are, but that's mine.  And I'm not going to listen to you.  or allow you to push me around.  So the dragon says another thing.  All values have already been created.  All created values are in me.  Truly there shall be no more I will, thus speaks the dragon.  There is nothing new under the sun.  I've already got you figured out, you rebellious little, you know, snot lion.  And the lion can say, well, maybe you think you do, but I'm going to oppose you.  I will.  I'm going to oppose my will to your thou shalt.  I don't buy your story, and I don't even have to disprove you.  All I have to do is stand up to you, and I'm already doing it.  So Nietzsche goes on and he says, to create freedom for itself in a sacred knower, even to duty, the lion is needed for that, my brothers.  We have to turn ourselves into lions so that we can say a sacred no.  Now, this is not yet something positive.  This is not yet a way forward, but it's needed to clear the space in which freedom can be exercised.  Without that exercise of freedom, we cannot, in effect, go further.  So we first have the camel, the camel, we carry all the things out into the desert.  Then we have the lion, we shed those burdens.  We confront the dragon.  that seems to have all the answers.  We say, forget you, I'm free.  The lion is not the final point though.  You can't live just in rebellion or revolt or revolution or whatever you're going to be, right?  So he says to create freedom.  for that, right?  We need the lions to seize the right to new values.  That is the most terrible proceeding for a weight bearing and reverential spirit.  Truly to the spirit, it is a theft and work for an animal of prey.  Once as the camel, it loved the thou shalt as its holiest thing.  Now it has to find illusion and caprice, even in the holiest that it may steal freedom from its love.  The lion is needed for this theft.  But Nietzsche goes on, what can the child do that the lion cannot?  Why must the praying lion still become a child?  The lion is something really quite magnificent and powerful.  Why does it have to become this weak, pale, flabby, vulnerable thing that is the child?  Because the child can do something that the lion cannot.  Where the lion can only say no, the child can say yes.  Where the lion can create the space for creation, the child can actually create.  And that's why we cannot just stop with the lion any more than we can stop just with the camel, according to Nietzsche, if we want to fully develop.  So he tells us the child is innocence and forgetfulness, a new beginning, perhaps dropping grudges, no longer insisting on that damn dragon and all the work that he imposed on me and how he scarred me up.  No, the child is something new, a potentiality that otherwise we would miss out on if we stay stuck in the lion.  He calls him a sport, a self-propelling wheel, a first motion, a sacred yes.  And then Nietzsche says a sacred yes is needed for the sport of creation.  What does that mean?  He tells us two key components to this.  Willing its own will, being creative in valuation, creating new values, creating new I wills.  being open to the world in a way that the lion who's needed in order to fight against this dragon, in order to keep the thou shalt away in a way that the lion cannot.  So willing one's own will becomes truly possible only as the child.  Nietzsche goes further and says something very interesting because willing one's own will, okay, that's really great.  But he says, by doing that, it wins its own world.  It's no longer just closed up in itself in negation of something.  It wins not the entire world, but its own world.  Its own space where it doesn't have to be taking on all the burdens, saying all the no's, in which something more is possible.  To have a world is to have relations to things that are other than yourself.  And for those to be positive, creative, value-generating relations, that is what Nietzsche is telling us about here.  So he says, I've named you these three metamorphoses of the spirit, how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, the lion at last a child.  These are steps that Nietzsche thinks are necessary for us to liberate ourselves and truly become creative and truly... set our own destiny and path within a world that we choose. ",
