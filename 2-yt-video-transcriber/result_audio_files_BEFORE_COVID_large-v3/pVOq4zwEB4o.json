            "text": "You need to know this about me.  I'm ashamed to admit this, but a couple of years ago, I went through a very, very dark patch.  I went through a patch of where I was a Christian and yes, I had desires.  I wanted to follow the Lord Jesus.  But at the same time, there was this big part of me which was tugging in my heart where I was like, I'm in my early 20s.  I want to do what my friends say.  my non-Christian friends who I'd see on Facebook, they were in Australia, they went to London, they had wild parties, they had all of this fun and all of this excitement and I wanted to do everything that young men would go out and do, all those sensual, all those sinful things.  I wanted to be like that and at times I was sitting in church, I was hanging around with 40 year olds, 50 year old men and I'm thinking, is this what I've given my life up for?  Am I missing out on my youth here?  Am I missing out on the chance to have fun because you're only young once, as Oscar Wilde said.  Like Solomon, I wanted to try every single thing to see, well, is it meaningless?  But this passage in the Bible from Psalm 73 saved me and kept me.  This word is so precious to me.  For years, this was gold dust to me.  And in Psalm 73, Asaph is asking the exact same question.  He's looking out and he's seeing the world, all of the pleasures of the world and he's seen all of these non-christians these unbelievers and they're having a great time they're prospering they're doing really well.  it's like he's filtering through instagram and he's seeing this person here this beautiful person here this attractive person here this car all of these wonderful things.  and he's jealous.  And he asks this question, he asks a question which has plagued millions of people, millions of Christians over time.  And the question is this, why is it that God allows the unrighteous, the unbelievers, the wicked to prosper and then the righteous go unrewarded?  The Christian suffers and struggles in life.  Here's the question which we're going to think about in this video.  Is being a Christian a waste of time?  psalm 73 verse 16 reads this so he's wrestling he's struggling and he says.  but when i thought how to understand this it seemed to me a wearisome task until i went into the sanctuary of god.  then i understood their final end.  the earl of oxford said the greatest gift a man could ever receive is to receive something called cubical thinking.  What on earth is that, Joe?  What's Cubicle thinking?  Well, just like a cube, this is a bit of a poor cube, but just like a cube has many different sides to it, he was saying that we should see all the different sides of a truth.  And Asaph in Psalm 73, all he's doing is he's seeing one side of the cube.  He's just looking straight at the side of the cube.  that is the side where the wicked are prospering, where the wicked are doing well.  But when he went into the sanctuary of God, what happened?  He saw all of the sides of the cube.  He saw the real truth.  What do you think is one of the greatest truths that we as Christians have completely forgotten?  Let me tell you.  We have forgotten that we are just a shell.  This body will only live for 80 years on planet Earth.  And you might say, Joe, come on.  Oh, come on, Joe.  Of course I know that already.  I know we're not going to live for long.  I know that that's going to happen.  We're going to die one day.  But my question to you is, do you live your life like you believe that fact?  A couple of years ago, I used to work in a high school I worked as a classroom assistant, a teaching assistant.  And if you spoke to those young people, if you asked them, what do you want to be like when you're older?  Who do you want to be like when you grow up?  Every single one of them pretty much would say, I want to be a famous celebrity.  I want to be a YouTuber.  I want to be world famous.  I want to be like Logan Paul, like KSI.  I want to have all of that fun.  But people are only attracted to the shallow appearance of it all.  They only see the surface.  They're always looking at the beginning.  They're always looking at how this life starts.  They never look at how this type of life ends.  Partly because the media, the world, YouTube, all of it, it never really portrays how this kind of lifestyle ends.  It never shows how Logan Paul will end.  It never shows how Ariana Grande will end.  a baity sort of way of how it all looks appetising at the beginning.  Let me give you two examples of two sought-after celebrities who've begun well, but the question is, how did they end?  Jack Nicholson, a Hollywood actor.  Have you heard of Jack Nicholson?  He won an Oscar for the best actor in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Rich, successful, famous, and he makes claims that he's slept with over 2,000 women.  Wicked claims, things we won't even speak of.  But when he was younger, many men would have looked at his life and said, oh, I would love to have a life like Jack Nicholson.  I'd love to be rich, famous, to have all the women at my palm of my hand.  I'd love that.  Many men would have envied him.  Very exciting, very pleasurable beginning.  But at age 77, how does Jack Nicholson end?  In an interview in 2014, Jack Nicholson said, I regret flurandering around with women when I was younger because now no woman will ever trust me and I've got no one to take care of me in my old age.  I'm terrified of dying in the house on my own.  And the second person who I'm sure you've all heard of is Elizabeth Taylor.  In the 1950s, she was the most sought-after celebrity.  Rich, famous, beautiful, with every single man in Hollywood doting over her.  Great beginning, but how does she end?  In the 1960s, when her looks began to fade and she gained weight, which naturally happens to us all, Hollywood became tired of her and gave her career away to younger stars like Jane Fonda and Julie Christie.  But this is the thing we all remember Elizabeth Taylor for.  What do we all remember about her?  She was famous for eight marriages.  After eight marriages, did she ever find true love?  No.  For most of her life she suffered from depression and was addicted to medicated drugs.  She died aged 79 with no husband, a broken, lonely woman.  But does the media portray this lifestyle?  Does the media show what a life rebelling against God, how will it end?  No, it doesn't.  And it certainly doesn't present the fact that death and destruction come to all.  The Bible says the way of the sinner is hard.  And I don't want anyone to click off this video without realising that the death of the ungodly is a terrible thing.  It's a thing to be feared.  And what do you think is their only comfort as they come to the end of their life?  their former success.  No hope for the future, no joy of eternal life, they can only look back at their former success.  But contrast that with the life of the godly, which on the surface seems narrow.  It seems a boring, a miserable way to live as a person.  But what do the world do?  They laugh at us because we go to church every Sunday, because we don't get drunk, because we don't have sex outside of marriage, because we live this life and we believe that a holy people is a happy people.  The world looks at us and they laugh at us and say, what a miserable way to live.  but what they don't remember is that we as Christians, how do we end?  How do we die?  That's the big question.  And as every man and every woman's life draws to a close, who is the one who truly prospers?  The wicked?  or the righteous?  who is the one who truly wins in the end?  well i think the non-believers see something in that.  i think they see that we are actually the winners in the end because as john wesley said about all christians finish the line our people die well.  Ultimately, it is us, the Christians, we die well because we've got a hope of the future, we've got a hope of eternal life.  So if you're watching this now, precious believer, if you're watching this now and you feel like quitting, you feel like you're suffering, you feel like you're plagued with problem after problem, you feel like your faith is going dead, you feel like, oh, it would just be so easy if I could live an easier, comfortable life outside of Christ, Whatever you do, do not quit.  Do not leave it because you will reap the harvest, a reward in heaven.  And even in this earth, you will know that if you live your life for 80 years living for the Lord Jesus, no one looks back and says, I wish that I didn't live my life for Christ.  Everyone rejoices because they know that Christ is the only thing that's eternal.  let me leave you with one final story.  in 1968 john stephen aquara was running a race for his country tanzania in the olympics.  and you know when you see in the races you know when you see there's a bit of a tussle a bit of a collide when they're overtaking.  well that's exactly what happened to john stephen aquara.  he's running and he collides into another runner.  As he falls to the ground, he dislocates his knee, his shoulder goes out of joint, he's covered in dust and blood and he starts to shake himself and get up.  Then the medical staff, they start crying out and they say, John, John, come to the side, we need to give you medical help, come on.  But John Stephen Equara, he ignored them and he got up and he carried on running.  Well, I tell a bit of a lie, he didn't quite run, he more limped.  As he got into the stadium, as he crossed the finishing line, there was no one left in the stadium.  It was practically bare.  They'd been to see the sort of Mofaras of the day.  There was no one around to watch him, to cheer him.  But there was this one stray interviewer.  And he called him over and he said, John Stephen Aquara, can I ask you a question?  Why didn't you quit?  Why didn't you give up?  You had no hope of winning the race.  Why didn't you just quit like everyone said?  This is what John Stephen Aquara said.  My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race.  They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race.  Christian, God did not save you to start the race.  He saved you to finish the race.  So keep running, fix your eyes on the goodness of God, and remember that the Christian ends well.  If you do those things, you'll be just fine. ",
