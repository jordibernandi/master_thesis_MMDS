So I stirred myself up, went out, found Clarence, and did this interview, which I'll never forget.  And as he walked away, he said, Right on time, Ray.  Awesome.  I hope you enjoy this.

That means they thought they could jump higher, run faster, and sing better than what they actually could.  All of us are subject to that.  I remember I was back when I was about 13 years old.  I thought I could sing pretty good and I sang into a tape recorder and I played it back and I was horrified at how bad it was.  And so for the last 50 something years, if I sing in public, it's always very, very quiet because I can't sing.  Tears come to people's eyes when I start singing.  They request that I sing on a hill far away.  So now, let's see if the Kruger effect goes over to the moral aspect.  Clarence, do you think you're a good person? ",

It's your friend.  It's making you step back from that cliff.  And what I've tried to do is put you on the edge of eternity and let the fear of God fill your heart.  Because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  Scriptures say it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  Jesus said, fear not him who has power to kill your body and afterwards do no more, but fear him who has power to kill your body and cast your soul into hell.  That's a strange thing for him to say.  I don't know if you heard what he just said, but let me say it again.  He said, fear not him who has power to kill your body.  Imagine lying in bed at night, hear the door creak open in the darkness, and you see a guy coming at you with a mask on, with a glittering knife.  He pulls the knife back to stab it in your chest.  Man, your heart would be in your mouth.  You'd be so horrified.  But Jesus said, don't be afraid of him compared to the fear you should have for God.  And so the Bible says, through the fear of the Lord, men depart from evil.  And so that fear that I'm trying to put in your heart by God's grace is your friend, not your enemy, because it'll make you let go of those beloved sins.  We love to fornicate.  We love to look at pornography.  We even love to lie and steal because, well, it gives us a bit of a buzz.  When I was a kid, I used to steal apples from the neighbors.  It was more exciting than getting them off the kitchen table.  He used to take lemons.  Because we've got a sinful heart that loves darkness more than light.

            "text": "The wages of sin is death.  Death is evidence that God is deadly serious about sin.  So the fear of God should fill our hearts.  Death should make us think, man, I don't want to fall into the hands of the living God.  That's a terrifying thing.  So Jesus suffered and died on the cross for our sins, took our punishment.  if you're in court Clarence and someone pays you fine the judge can legally let you go.  he can say Clarence stack of speeding fines here.  this is very serious but someone's paid him.  you're free to go and he can do that which is just and right and legal.  well God can legally dismiss our case forgive our sins commute our death sentence actually take the death sentence off us because Jesus paid the fine on our behalf rose again on the third day and defeated death.  Now what you have to do, and this is probably what was missing before, is repent of your sins.  Now let me explain why.  I think there's probably a problem.  If I said to you, Clarence, I've got some great news for you.  Someone just paid a speeding fine on your behalf.  If you didn't believe you broke the law, That good news of me paying the fine for you, or having the fine paid for you, wouldn't be good news.  It'd be insulting.  I'd say, what are you talking about?  I don't have a speeding fine.  But if you realize you've broken the law, that you went like 60 miles an hour through an area set aside for a blind children's convention, 10 miles an hour, you did a terrible thing.  And then I say, oh, someone's paid that fine for you.  Then that good news becomes good news indeed.  So The good news depends on how serious you see your transgression is.  And if you see sin as being deadly serious, lying, stealing, using God's name as a cuss word, lusting after women, committing adultery in your heart, then the good news of the cross will make sense to you.  You'll find a place of genuine sorrow.  And then the Bible says, godly sorrow works repentance.  You'll be able to truly repent, let go of those sins because of the godly sorrow.  That's the first thing.  The second thing you must do to be saved is trust in Jesus like you trust a parachute.  You don't just believe in a parachute.  You put your faith into it.  And when you have your faith in a parachute, you lose your fear.  If you're going to jump without a parachute 10,000 feet, you'd be terrified.  Someone gives you a parachute and you trust the parachute, you say, ah, I'm safe.  I'm going to land at five miles an hour on my feet instead of 120 miles an hour on my face.  And so when I face death, and it can come at any time, I've got no fear according to the faith I have in Christ.  I've put on the Lord Jesus Christ.  So I can look at death in the face.  I can look at judgment day and have boldness because I'm trusting in the Savior.  I'm trusting in his righteousness.  Does this make sense? ",
