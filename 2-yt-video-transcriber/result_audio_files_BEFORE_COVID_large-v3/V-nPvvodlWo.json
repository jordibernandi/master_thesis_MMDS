So in line with the rules of DNC, but this is where I think the interesting thing comes in is that obviously I have to imagine that they did Andrew Yang's campaign checked before they ran this, ran this tweet and posted their articles and said everything.  Remember we, we, we showed you guys a Hill article saying that he has qualified and I'm assuming they must've done their research.  So what I'm kind of interested in is what, What was the communication between Yang's campaign and the DNC?  Did it go like this?  Did they say, hey, we just saw we got 2% in another NBC poll or another poll.  Is that a qualifying poll?  And they would say, yes, that's a qualifying poll.  And they said, well, we have four.  We qualified them.  And then the DNC had to come out and say, well, you have four, but you could only use one of those NBC polls.  That's kind of, in my eyes, one of the most likely scenarios.  The other scenario, which I hope didn't happen, would be if they... the Yang campaign reached out and more directly asked them, did we qualify?  Do you have us qualifying?  And if the DNC came back to him and said, yes, you currently qualify, then came out a day later and said, actually, sorry, due to rules interpretations, you're one poll away.  That would be fishy, but before we move any further, one last thing I want to get to, before we go doom and gloom, these are the most recent polling polls.  If you look at the last 10 polls Andrew Yang has done, they're all qualifying, but the last 10 overall polls that have had Andrew Yang in the title, or that he has polled in, he hit the 2% threshold in 7 of the 10, and he has until the end of September to get one more 2%.  Yeah, I'm not worried.  I don't think it's going to change anything, but like I said, the thing that I'm interested in, what was the communication between the DNC and the campaign? ",

            "text": "Yeah.  Okay.  I'm not worried about Andrew Yang qualifying above this 2% threshold.  And honestly, if he couldn't do that, then the system's natural weeding out mechanisms would kick in and I would respect that.  I just don't have respect for unnatural weeding out mechanisms.  And to me, it's intellectually unsustainable to say, well, hold on.  Since NBC teamed up with the Wall Street Journal in one of these polls and then NBC teamed up with YouGov in one of these polls, both were partnership polls.  Oh, they both count as NBC polls.  If that's what's going on, I have a huge problem with that because partnership polls are unique in and of themselves.  And also, if three companies partner up, if YouGov partners up with the Wall Street Journal and partners up also with NBC, which one does it count for?  Wall Street Journal, YouGov, NBC.  And so if all of a sudden there were four polls that were all partnership polls done by the same four companies, let's just say Rasmussen teamed up with CNBC, teamed up with NBC, and teamed up with Wall Street Journal.  If all four polls were done and he polled at 10% in each poll, would they say, oh, no, no, NBC was a partner in one of those, and then disqualify it?  It just seems to me like there is a spirit of the law and there is a nature of the law, okay?  And... I'm sorry, there's a spirit of law and there's a letter of the law.  By the spirit of the law, he's completely passed.  And by the letter, unless you most cynically interpret it against him, has passed as well.  Nobody, nobody rational and reasonable when they saw Andrew Yang's announcement and the partnership polls that were done before him thought, oh, does that qualify?  In and of itself, to me, that shows that whatever interpretation of the law was intended in the original rules, he passed.  And to take one of those polls away from him, especially in the wake of what you did to Bernie Sanders less than one election cycle ago... Seems like you are disproportionately targeting a non-establishment character reminiscent of scheduling debates on Super Bowl Sundays and in competition with largest TV show programming out there.  so nobody watches your debates.

What I wonder is because, again, I mean, I like engineering.  We've spoken with some people on this campaign.  They seem like great people.  I wonder if this maybe could just be a slight little mix up on their end where they ran and said we had four polls.  Maybe they got a confirmation that those are indeed four polls that qualify.  And we're a little early jumping the gun saying we have the four we need.  And the DNC came back and said, well, hold on.  Now, the confusion you brought up.  I want to show us again.  Some of you guys might notice it before.  In that Democrats.org article, they say about the polling rubric.  This is what's interesting to me.  both Wall Street Journal and NBC News show up on there.  Now, maybe they consider, because NBC News, the organization of NBC proper, I have no idea if that's where it comes from, but it is weird that Wall Street Journal did a poll with NBC since they're both on it.  You say, well, why can't that count as a Wall Street Journal poll?  Why does that have to count as an NBC poll?  So I guess they count them together.  Now, this is something I believe, I feel terrible blank on the gentleman's name.  I believe he works for Politico.  He's doing a lot of good work kind of keeping up with this Andrew Yang campaign and what's going on with it.  and um he i think he said he's like the ruling is kind of in line with their rules.  but i never thought i'd have to ask an organization what if a?  what if one organization polls with two others like yeah do those like?

Our campaign has overcome every obstacle placed on our path and we will continue to upset the establishment well into 2020.

Oh, he actually got a 1% in the hill poll.  That's really interesting.  He had, up until that point, almost exclusively got zero percent in the hill poll.  Always got zeros for the hill, yeah.  But actually, one way of looking at it, that's a really good trend for him, going from zero for months to one.  But he still should be there.  That's the other thing about the whole.  they might be trying to screw him out.  He's just trending to be there regardless.  I think this is more... I don't want to go and say what people were doing, but this seems to me more like something that legitimately doesn't happen a lot, where you see one organization running polls through multiple other co-sponsored organizations, and they just honestly didn't think about that.  And then it came up to them.  They said, so does NBC Wall Street Journal count as one or the other or both?  And I guess it counted as both.  So that is weird.  That is the news today, guys.  It is... Again, I want to highlight one more time because this is the latest news we have that the actual staff for Andrew Yang and the actual Andrew Yang campaign do not agree with this ruling and view it as just another obstacle placed in their path, which I can't disagree with them entirely.  It is what happens when rules are written without... I mean, I always compare stuff to sports, and you look at sports, and every now and then something happens with rules, right?  Because rules are very important in sports, where they say, you know what?  this has to be interpreted by someone that actually isn't clearly defined in the rules.  And I believe that's what happened here.  The DNC made a bizarre interpretation.  I don't know why.  The only takeaway I want to take from this, one last thing I want to say before we get back to you.  The only takeaway I take from this, realistically, is that it seems to me that the DNC, because by doing this, what you're doing is you're making it harder for quote-unquote fringe or candidates out of the top four to make it to these debates.  It's really practically down the line.  saying less polls can be used for you Yeah.  It seems to me they want to thin the herd.  They said, we don't want to do four more debates with 20 people.  It's artificial thinning, though.  It is.  I'm saying that seems to be the interpretation from the DNC.  Which rule interpretation will lead to the least amount of people on stage in the future?  This is that rule interpretation.  Again, I don't want to put words in their mouth, but just the way they interpret the rules. ",
