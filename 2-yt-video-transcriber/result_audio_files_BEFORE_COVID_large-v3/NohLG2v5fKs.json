            "text": "Hey everyone!  So if you're new here you might not know this but if you've been around a while you might remember that probably a year, 18 months ago, something like that, I made a couple of videos about a book by Michael and Debbie Pearl called Train of a Child.  This book was horrific and it was basically a guide to child abuse but using the Bible and God as justification for How hard to hit your child?  What type of stick or ceramic rod to hit your child with?  When to throw them in a pond?  When to entice them to touch a burning stove?  It was messed up.  Turns out, the Pearls have written a huge series of books.  Some of these I've covered in various bits of videos and whatever.  But it's something I haven't... Hey, calm.  Calm.  But it's something I haven't touched on for a while, and I have been meaning to, I've wanted to.  I've got a couple of books by them.  One is called Jumping Ship, and it's basically about childhood indoctrination, like how to make sure your child doesn't leave the religion.  And the other one is one that I've lost.  Oh, Tyra knocked it on the floor.  You're so cute, I don't want to move you.  The other book I have is called No Greater Joy Volume 1 and I think at one point I did make a video about this book but it was so long ago that I barely remember what I covered and I could go back and watch.  but I hate watching myself on camera and also there's so many new people here since that I figured we would just kind of rediscover this book together again today if that makes sense.  so about 18 months ago I read this book and I made all these like notes and put these sticky notes in and highlighted passages and I can't remember any of it.  so today we're just going to be going through some parts of this book and kind of rediscovering them together.  It's gonna be a little adventure for us.  Hopefully you guys enjoy it.  Or not, because like I say, these people are horrific and should not be parents.  The idea behind this book is that it's a series of short essays by the Pearls but also it's like people writing in and asking them questions and them giving them answers and everything is like biblical based.  Now if you've not heard of Michael and Debbie Pearl before they're one of these like families that are part of the Quiverful movement which is a whole other thing that we should probably cover in a whole video by itself.  If you haven't heard of Michael and Debbie Pearl before, here they are.  This is them with their massive family.  They run a ministry that they call No Greater Joy.  They've done a few of the different things.  Now Michael is currently back with this like thing called The Door where he talks about really weird stuff and I'm starting to think he's maybe losing it a bit because of clips like this. ",

            "text": "Here I am, Mike Pearl at The Door and we're going to be talking about a subject UFOs identified at last.  Now these are not unidentified flying objects.  These are flying objects.  And I guarantee you there is such a thing.  I know exactly what they are and they are coming to the earth and you may have seen one and you may have seen something.  that's fake, but there are real UFOs in the Bible.  The Bible speaks of flying, palleted, saucer-shaped ships with portholes all around the outside that flies at the speed of light, emits burning coals when it sits on the ground, has lightning emanating from it, electrical discharges, and they're piloted by strange, multi-headed, multi-eyed, and multi-winged creatures that are a combination of humanoid and animal and bird features.  The Bible speaks of star wars between extraterrestrial creatures that last for weeks.  And the Bible describes a time when they will come to the earth and men will have heart attacks at seeing them come.  That's all in your Bible.  Now just because you didn't know that doesn't mean it's not there. ",

            "text": "yeah they write a hell of a lot of like books and blogs and make videos on kind of raising a family biblically and stuff like that and it's all very very extreme.  they have some very dangerous and damaging views.  but instead of me just telling you this i want to show you today and we're going to be reading a few passages from no greater joy volume one.  the first question we're going to look at comes from a parent who asks my child is always asking why what should i do?  Typical thing, right?  This is what kids do when they're trying to learn about the world and explore.  They ask why to everything.  My nephew does it all the time.  He is, what, like five now?  And he's constantly like, why, why, why?  Why are you doing this?  Where do you live?  What do you do?  What about this?  Why does this happen?  Why?  It's how kids discover the world.  It's an amazing thing.  And it's the most... I get it can probably be frustrating to parents at times when they're busy and they don't have time to answer the questions, but for me, a kid asking these questions is one of the most amazing things in the world, and answering them and helping them learn, it just, I don't know, I think it's a great thing.  The Pearls, on the other hand, say, When a child is told to do something he does not want to do, he will often ask why.  In most cases, this question is not promoted by a spirit of cooperative inquiry, but by a spirit of rebellion.  Or maybe the kid just wants to try and learn and understand the world.  Whatever.  The question is thrown at the parent as a challenge to his or her authority, wisdom, and motive.  The child's question is actually a statement of defiance.  Or maybe the kid looks up to you and wants to learn and is asking you about the world because they trust and respect you.  It's your job as a parent to teach them.  Wise parents will know that the character of the child is better served if the question is left unanswered.  The child should be led to trust the wisdom and good intentions of his parents.  The issue is not a deficit of information, but a deficit of submission.  Submission is a trend.  you will see throughout this.  The child who is perfectly compliant in spirit doesn't need explanations.  And that kind of summarizes everything that the pearls are about.  The child who is perfectly compliant in spirit does not need explanations.  Keep them in the dark, but keep them obedient.  They're not looking to raise children.  They're not looking to raise humans.  They want... They don't even want, like, a pet that they can just, like, tell what to do and, like, you know, have obedience.  Kyra has more freedom and independence and... ability to make up her own mind than the pearls like their kids have.  yeah they don't.  they don't want to raise humans.  what they want are little mini robots that will do whatever they say without question just immediately.  and it's kind of disgusting isn't it?  you're more independent than that don't you?  yeah that's because you're the boss of this house though aren't you?  Yeah, you're in charge, aren't you little lady?  You're in charge.  The next question I want to look at covers disobedient children.  A person asks, My two year old will not stay in bed when I put him down.  It seems like I am whipping him too much.  No matter how many times I whip him, he still gets up.  Another parent comments, My little girl will not stay out of the refrigerator.  Every time I turn my back, she is opening the door.  I spank her, but it seems to do no good.  So the Pearls are very into hitting their children.  They think that's the only way to instill any kind of obedience or respect, which is disgusting.  So here we have two parents who are concerned that hitting isn't working.  I wonder why.  But the Pearls say, look, it's not the fact that you're hitting them too much and that they no longer have respect for you.  That's not the problem.  The problem is you're not hitting them hard enough.  Beat that child.  I wish I was exaggerating.  It is sometimes true that mother's spankings are not at all painful.  If your spankings are too light to gain his respect, an increase in the intensity might be more persuasive.  If the child deemed the pain to be worse than the gratification, he would grudgingly stop.  Our goal is much deeper than just keeping the door shut or the refrigerator.  We want to train our child to control their passions.  When the child is possessed of the strength of passion, he cannot reason and remember those fear consequences.  Then apparently they talk about kids consuming passion to be gratified in lusts.  So they talk about, um, obviously like... beating kids use a switch every time they do something wrong like getting out of bed.  apparently when it is never a pleasurable experience to get out of bed his own self-love will cause him to stay in bed.  by your consistency you will eventually condition the child to always submit to authority.  you have a child totally self-willed at heart.  Yeah, because that's a bad thing.  If he is allowed to choose the areas of obedience, he is, in fact, never submitted to any authority but his own.  They end this section by saying, Train them right, and they will always obey.  They really aren't looking for kids here, are they?  They're looking for little robots.  Next question.  My three-year-old daughter often screams when she is aggravated by the other children, or when she doesn't get her way.  Is this normal?  Will she grow out of it?  The Pearls write... It is average, but not normal.  As she develops a social awareness, she will grow out of the screaming, but it will be replaced by more subtle tantrums to get her way.  It is an easy habit to break.  When she starts screaming, before you find out who is at fault without saying a word, go straight to the switch.  Spank her where she stands, and then inquire concerning the problem.  Explain to her that screaming will never be allowed again.  Never gain her any sympathy, only spanking.  You might just ignore any offence from the others when she screams.  Let it always be the fault of the screamer.  Never threaten, and never show mercy.  One squeak of a scream gets a switching.  If you are consistent, four to eight episodes should bring it to an end.  If you are 95% consistent and find it more convenient to only warn her most of the time, or if she finds that regardless of the spanking she is occasionally able to get her way by screaming, then it should only take about 18 years to break the habit.  Actually, it won't be broken.  But when she's married, you won't have to listen to her scream anymore.  It will be her husband's problem then.  There's just so much wrong with this.  so many levels.  I can't believe they're actually like promoting the hit first ask questions later attitude.  That's just gonna create some horribly reactionary children who don't know how to talk things through and come to like amicable solutions with people.  This is how you end up with like violent people who You know, hit first, think later.  The next little short essay talks about how it's never too young to start beating your children.  So they talk about how one morning they end up sat across the breakfast table from a woman as she was feeding her 11-month-old daughter.  After choking down half of a jar, the little girl shoved it away.  The mother pushed it back in front of her and said, don't you want some more?  Are you through?  Again, the child shoved it away, this time with a little more force.  She didn't voice any protest other than a grunt, and she was not mean-spirited.  She was just practicing being independent, demonstrating her ability to enforce her rights.  Yeah, cool, okay, that's what kids do.  Most mothers would have simply accepted the child's actions as a statement that she was through eating, because, I don't know, that's a reasonable thing to do.  However, this mother was wise beyond her years.  She picked up her little enforcer, which was lying on the table, and swatted the child's hand.  When mother once again placed the jar of green slime in front of Susie, she tried to shove it away and received another spat.  The little girl did not cry, but she got the message that she is not in control, mother is.  The mother was not going to allow the child to override her will in any way.  It's almost sadistic, the joy they seem to get out of this.  It's like the power and control they want over children is a little bit disturbing to me.  I watched the little girl stare at the jar, search her mother's face, and consider rejoining the battle.  She would start to reach for the jar and then jerk her hand back as if she had been switched.  I loved it.  It was beautiful.  It was the making of a well-disciplined, self-controlled, balanced teenager.  The joy they get out of seeing an 11-month-old child in fear is disgusting.  There was conflict in this 11-month-old child.  It was a tiny conflict, but it involved her whole soul.  I must encourage those of you with small children, train up your children now.  Do not wait until they are one year old to start your training.  Rebellion and self-will should be broken in the four month old when it first appears.  All this talk of training and breaking your children just disturbs me so much.  There's lots of weird messy stuff in here as well about homeschooling and things like that and how a lot of their kids couldn't read until they were like 10 years old and stuff and they're like, it's fine, it's perfectly normal, they don't need it.  The girls just need to be homemakers and the boys need to know how to chop wood, that's all they need.  There's a few questions from people asking about their teenage sons and daughters and going through puberty and stuff.  and Michael writes this really weird little section here about teenage boys.  It is often obscured in our perverted culture but a boy's destiny is to become a man.  As the kid grows, the male becomes more independent and domineering.  Keep in mind that the boys are growing into a role of leadership.  Leadership in the male population is not just an office.  they inherit upon marriage or at some manhood graduation ceremony.  It is a growing process that causes them to begin to assume authority at puberty.  It is not natural for a woman to rule over a man.  For that reason, the young man's conflict is more prominent with his mother than his father.  It is initially hormonal and psychological.  The boys will become more competitive and aggressive.  They begin to step away from the crowd, including the family, and seek their identity alone.  They become self assured and cocky.  They are ready to conquer.  go to war if necessary.  When a young man experiences this change, it is time for him to engage in hard work with the men.  It is against nature to place a developing young man in the care of his mother.  If his education continues, it should be under the tutelage of men.  Ideally, the boys should be engaged in physical labour.  Mother, if you must have your son under your constant care, do not try to pen him.  Pen him up like a docile female.  It's so outdated.  It's so weird that they think there's this like only one way to be masculine or manly.  What are my neighbours doing up there?  They have this whole like weird anti-fairness thing as well so they never want to necessarily like teach kids.  Okay that definitely sounded like a chainsaw.  Please tell me the mic picked that up because that was weird.  Sorry.  So they have this weird thing against fairness and saying life isn't fair, get over it, bitch.  When children complain of inequality, they are being covetous, as seen by the fact that they never complain when they are on the receiving end, only when they are left out.  If the parents give in to this complaining, they are rewarding their child's lust.  To deliberately seek equality is to send a wrong signal.  If a child is left out of play because the other children don't like him, it would be injurious to publicly take his side.  He should learn to be likeable.  He must earn the right to be included in social events.  Children will readily isolate a jerk.  Protective parents defending a child's rights create super jerks.  Their poor children must have felt so isolated and hurt and alone growing up.  I didn't have a lot of friends as a teenager and I felt that that was my fault and that there was something wrong with me and that I was the problem and it caused a hell of a lot of issues that I had to work out with counsellors for a long, long time.  If my parents had also been telling me, suck it up, you must just be acting like a bitch, that would have scarred me even more.  sometimes kids are cruel and sometimes kids leave out other kids for the most arbitrary of reasons.  sometimes it is because they're being a bit annoying or whatever but it's not always the child's fault and it's not fair to say that it is.  it's i don't know.  anyway that's where we're gonna end this.  this whole book is just insane.  Like I say, I also have jumping ship we can talk about if it's something you guys are interested in.  Sorry if any of these bits have been covered in a video by me before but it has been such a long time that I don't remember them at all and I tried to pick bits that at least felt new.  Let me know what you thought of this video.  What do you think of the pearls in general?  Do you think they're dangerous?  If you haven't seen my videos on To Train Up A Child, please go do that now because They are horrific and they are heartbreaking and it's horrible.  And the fact that Amazon still sells this book even though it's been linked to the deaths of at least seven children is incredibly worrying.  I just want to end this video with a little shameless self-promotion because it is Christmas and all my recent videos have been demonetized.
