There is no accident that one of those who was involved, Ed Snowden, is now in refuge in Moscow.  to make an equivalence between, as I'm afraid Jeremy Corbyn does, between us and, as it were, the West and Russia and China is monstrous.  I find, again, the tweet from Corbyn shameful.  Here is a man who invariably sides with the enemies of Britain.  who sides with terrorists repeatedly, who supports regimes which commit outrages.  The only outrages he's interested in are a tiny little fragment that suit his political agenda. ",

Because I remember when I saw some of the material that WikiLeaks published, I remember with the Afghan war logs in particular, seeing civilians being shot down as though it's a video game.  And I remember the disgust that I felt at that moment in time.  It was undoubtedly in the public interest for us to know what is being done in our names.  That's why Jeremy Corbyn is correct to speak on it.  And that's why all of us should be able to separate our personal feelings for Julian Assange from the legal process that he is now facing for shining a light on that wrongdoing. ",

There are invariably civilian casualties and the attempt of pretending there can't be is silly and particularly in dirty wars like Afghanistan.  Look, I am second to none in my hatred of what happened in Iraq.  I think our liberal interventions have been invariably couched as liberal interventions.  wherever they are, be it in Iraq, be it in Afghanistan, be it in Libya, have all been catastrophic.  That's not the issue.  We do not bear a unique burden of guilt.  We at least try to do good.  We very often do desperate harm.  But I think, frankly, it is wicked to equate the behaviour of the West with the behaviour of Russia and China and regimes like that, which of course... ",

And the reason why I think Jeremy Corbyn most certainly doesn't hate Britain is because I listened to him at a talk just the other week and watched him celebrate the history of the abolition of slavery, the trade union movement, the Chartists.
