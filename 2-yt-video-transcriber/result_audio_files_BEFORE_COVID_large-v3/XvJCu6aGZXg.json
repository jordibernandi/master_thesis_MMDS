            "text": "So the last video I made actually kind of exceeded my expectations for my projective viewership.  I actually projected that about maybe 4,000 to 5,000 people watched that video.  I thought it would be pretty average but instead it's kind of tripled.  Uh, and I feel it's a little unfortunate because I don't think people will stick around to see the sequel.  And I think the sequel is equally, if not more so, important than, you know, the original.  And that, if this is the first one you've checked out, I'm talking about, um... my video where I say we're all incels now.  So now the basic point of that video was to highlight that despite the fact that there's a community of individuals called incels who complain about their lack of ability to find relationships and get into relationships with women, there are probably a lot more men in general who are pretty normal and average and even like a good healthy state of mind as far as they go to work and they try to eat better and exercise and all that.  Who are having a very tough time finding women to date and be in relationships with.  Just the normal men.  Not even so much super fat, ugly, gremlin looking guys.  But just normal, plain, average guys.  And that there are men who will spend a good deal of money on porn, and men who will spend a good deal of money on cam models, on Twitch thoughts, you know, just so they could have some semblance of a connection with the woman.  Why?  Because they don't really have that in their personal life.  And the whole point of that video was to highlight the fact that even though there's a community of incels who people will quickly and regularly call vile and stupid and self-pitying and stupid and blue-billed, And give them all sorts of different names and shit, which is really interesting to me.  Which you'll see why.  Like, this is the video where I'm going to really crack down on why that's interesting to me.  Despite that, we still have all these other different men who are struggling to find relationships, who are struggling to find women to be with, and are not having sex at all.  Despite the fact that they want some, and thus would make them, in voluntary, how do you say, sentiments.  But I don't like that term.  And like I said, every time I talk about it in cells, I make a point to say, I think involuntary celibate is a stupid word.  Because the whole point of celibacy is a voluntary abstination from sex.  That's the whole point.  That's why you're called a celibate.  Because you're trying to not have sex until you're married.  You cannot involuntarily, voluntarily decide that decision.  So it's dumb.  But because I understand it colloquially... I'm going to use it.  So like I said, I always do that every time I talk about incels.  I think it's a dumb term, but I'm going to use it because other people understand what it means.  Now that being said, here's the thing that I find interesting.  I find it interesting how incels can complain about women.  And even other men will come and crack down on them.  But you'll see women really don't like themselves.  You'll see society in general do not like it when men complain about women and how dating is wrong and not fair.  But when they roll out of dust, when it is a young lady saying that she is tired of the men in her life and she now wishes to remain single, she is praised.  Now, see, here's the thing.  I saw this on Facebook the other day, right?  This is a girl I went to middle school with that.  somehow we've just stayed linked together on Facebook for a while.  I don't really know why.  But I used to think that she was really attractive.  She's still pretty attractive, actually.  She's still pretty attractive.  And she made a post on Facebook.  And that's what originally got me thinking about this topic in general.  And so this is her post.  Her post was... I don't know why I did that.  Single and never want to mingle again.  I have literally given up on relationships.  I don't seem to get nowhere being in one and I don't seem like myself in one.  So I'm over it.  I have beautiful sons and I have my amazing brother and awesome friends.  That's all I need.  Now, see, this was really interesting to me because... Lots of people like this status.  Lots of people liked it and then you have other ladies commenting upon it.  One comment goes, girl, focus on you.  Your sons are beautiful and you are as well.  Another young lady, I've been single for a minute and I'm loving it.  Freedom.  She goes, girl, that's what I need to be doing.  Dating is just a waste of my time and energy anymore.  And so finally I made this.  I expected to get some feedback, but I really didn't.  And I said, you know, maybe, I said, you think maybe your problem lies in the men you're picking and not the relationships themselves.  And I wasn't really being cheeky, but I was trying to point out to her that you say that you don't feel like yourself in a relationship.  But are you sure that maybe it's not, you know, the fact that you and I have to work together as a cohesive unit to raise our children together, but more so the person you pick to try to create that cohesive unit?  is awful, or maybe he's not awful, but he's just not a good relationship partner.  And not being a good relationship partner doesn't mean that you're a bad person, but bad people are often, insofacto, bad at being in relationships, I think it's kind of fair to say.  But, you know, it could just possibly be that the person is genuinely, you know, kind and nice but they're just not really good at being loyal or sticking to one person.  You know, they might really, you know, try to have their heart in the right place, you know, but they just might be lazy in some different areas in their life that are needed to have a relationship be functioning.  And that's possible, you know.  And if that's the case, it's not so much that a woman picked a bad relationship partner, but she didn't really pick a bad person.  But a lot of women are picking terrible people to be in relationships.  They are picking awful men.  And there's myriads of different reasons why, which we'll probably get into a couple in the course of this video.  But I think it's important to note, we have a really big problem here.  It's not just the fact that she is praised for wanting to be single.  It's the fact that people have completely ignored the fact that she has sons.  She has two sons, by the way.  And this is really painful to me, actually.  You know... because that means that she's given up or at the very least she is content with having their uncle or like her brother be the male figure in their life and this can cause a really big problem here because one her brother has to assume a responsibility that's just not his it's just not.  and it doesn't mean that your uncle can't be in your life.  it doesn't mean your uncle can't Be a strong male figure in your life.  I'm sure it's necessary.  But unless her uncle lives with them with a prolonged period of time, these boys are not usually, it's not one-to-one, but they're not usually going to look up to him for guidance and to be pretty much their father figure.  And their father is still going to be their father, even if their uncle... is there in their life.  and the closest, strongest male figure to you, your dad is not there, it's gonna cause a lot of problems.  For children in general, I don't really want to say especially for young men, because there's some equal problems for young ladies too when they don't have dads, but it's different.  And a lot of young men, they don't, when your father's not there, you don't really have a good standard of how you could be or who you could be.  You don't gain his legacy.  You know what I mean?  You don't gain who he is as a person to get passed down to you.  And it's interesting to me that she could say this and she's like, yeah, I'm going to commit to being a single mother and raise my sons.  and people are not, and people don't perk their ears up to that and think, you know, this is kind of really fucking sad.  Her sons don't have a dad.  Her sons have their uncle who might pass by every now and again.  They might see from time to time, but not a male figure to teach them subconsciously or even consciously what does it mean to be a man?  And so looking at that, that's just the element, the critical element that we're seeing a single mother here get praised by virtue of her existence, for being single.  They're happy for it.  And it's just really silly to me because this isn't a happy thing.  This isn't a status to like.  This is an admission of defeat.  I can't find a father for my children, so screw it.  I'm just going to use my brother and they'll be their uncle.  That's not a happy thing.  That's not a great thing to celebrate.  But I guess because maybe it's just because she's a pretty woman or maybe the people just weren't thinking about it.  And if they're not thinking about it, well, that's a problem unto itself that we are constantly having children raised without male guidance.  And then we're confused when all these young men are lost.  We're confused when all of these women are hungry for male attention.  We act confused when this is the obvious result that's going to be wrought.  But what's crazy to me.  still, let's get back to the incel thing.  And this goes for MGTOW, too.  MGTOW and incels are very similar in this light.  Now, some people might get their feelings hurt, but shut up for a second, okay?  I understand the difference is that MGTOW chooses to abstain from relationships with women or abstain from marriage.  And I understand incels desperately crave it.  I got it.  Thank you for the pedantic person who will say, MGTOW and incel totally shut up.  I know.  But there is a similarity.  There is a cross-section between incels and MGTOW, and that is the fact that they have harsh criticisms for women.  They are.  There's no way around it.  MGTOW are harshly criticized for the behaviors of women, as well as incels do.  There's just no one-two ways about it.  Now, the motivations behind it can be totally different, but no matter how you slice it, They are similar.  in that vein.  And I actually think that it's a good thing.  I actually do think that it is a good thing to be critical of the relationship habits and the things that women are attracted to and the things that women are collectively trying to gain while they're trying to date men.  Because the only way you're going to fix a problem is by identifying it.  But what is crazy to me is that by criticizing women, these men are often lambasted as terrible people who can't get laid.  The highest praise for a man or one of the highest insults for a man is someone that cannot be with a woman or someone that cannot have sex with a woman.  And it's an incredible two-step.  Actually, I'll make a whole video on that two-step actually some other time.  But I do want to put some focus on this and just how silly this shit is because my whole life, even now as an adult, women dog men out like there's no tomorrow.  There is no tomorrow when it comes to dogging men out.  And it is incredible to me that there are so many women who have all these shitty, nasty things to say about the men that they dated, the men that they picked, the men that they wanted at the time, and then project it out onto all men.  And that's fine.  There is nothing wrong with that.  If a woman has a string of abusive relationships, the problem is men.  It is not, let me analyze the similarities between those men I dated.  Maybe there's something with me that is... attracting these that maybe there's something i'm not seeing.  there's none of that.  it's i'm not gonna be in a relationship at all anymore because i just don't feel like myself.  oh i just i can't find a partner.  oh all men suck.  there is no there is no thought.  and the reason why you see here's the thing.  like people think that i'm crazy man I know they do.  They think that I'm on some other shit when I harshly criticize.  I'm just some mean misogynist.  I'm incel.  Some people think I'm gay.  I don't really understand that shit.  But here's the thing, man.  The amount of times I talk to a child or a kid that does not have a dad is way too fucking many.  Let's be real.  And that's where my motivations are coming from.  Even my parents got a divorce.  I didn't get to grow up with my dad in the house for the later half of my life until I became an adult.  So I lived it.  I didn't live it as bad as some of the kids I talk to when I go to work, but I've lived it.  It's real.  And that's where my motivation lies.  These women who are having bad relationships have an effect on their children.  And that is what's totally missing from the incels, from MGTOW, from feminism, from men's rights.  That is missing totally.  The fact that we are constantly having the same shit over and over again, and despite the fact that these children are fucking suffering because they don't have the love of their father in their lives, is totally missed.  And it's fine if a woman is, I want to be single, and I don't need a father.  I can raise my kid by myself.  That's fine.  And we can dog them out and say they're horrible, awful, shitty people unaware of the fact that our kids, well not mine, I don't have any children, but so many other people's children are suffering.  Why?  Because their dad is not there and they want the love of their father.  Do you not understand how strong and how critical and how important a man is to his kid's life?  Do you not get that?  The fact that these kids are sad and hurt and are pained by it?  And that is just so missed, so much.  And that's what pisses me off about that Facebook post that I had.  The fact that people totally neglect just how important and just how much her sons are going to need some man or preferably their own dad there for them to teach them how to be men.  And it's just totally gone.  It's just totally lacking.  It's men are bad.  Men are terrible.  It's totally fine if women want to abstain from men.  But if it's the opposite, if a man goes MGTOW, then there's something wrong with him.  Or maybe he's gay.  There's some issue with a man saying that he doesn't want to be with a woman.  And if a man complains that there's some problem with women's dating standards, there's a problem with the men women are selecting that they are complaining about, by the way.  Oh, he's an incel.  But the problem is, while we complain about these people on the internet, there are real life issues affecting children.  Affecting the people who will rob you.  Yes, a huge amount of thieves, a huge amount of murders, a huge amount of criminals come from single parent homes.  Specifically raised by single mothers.  And this isn't to say that all men are good, because that's stupid.  Evil is a force in this world, and I'm well aware of that.  But the problem is, the projection of man is bad, and man is horrible, and we got a dogman out, and they aren't shit, is destroying every bit of positivity.  It's destroying any standard of trying to be a man.  There's not even a chance... For as much as people are saying, you know, these incels gotta, like, you know, self-improve and become better men, it's like, well, what the fuck is the point if I'm gonna have to inherit the sins of every other man who did something bad?  That's a question that I haven't seen anyone address.  I haven't seen anyone ask that question.  I have to bear the weight and the sins of men I've never even met.  when I try to go up and talk to a girl?  I have to prove to her that I'm not going to cheat on her.  I'm not going to deal with, I'm not going to be all that in her past.  As well as be attractive to her.  As well as have a stable job, money, be tall, and be all these different things.  I got to battle literally phantoms of her past and show her I'm not horrible.  The problem is, it doesn't stop at just men and women.  It goes to our children.  It goes to the next generation.  That's the issue, and that's always been the overarching issue.  As much as MGTOW and incels and feminists, as much as all of that shit, when it comes down to it, there's no way around the fact, no matter what, men are needed in their children's lives.  and the bottom line is women are picking shitty fucking people to date they are.  they are complaining about them.  there's there's no complete.  there's.  there's no counter argument.  the mere fact that a woman can even complain about all the bitch ass niggas she dated she picked them she picked them she picked them if it's multiple times there's no counter argument none.  And the thing is, there's nothing men can do about it.  That is solely on the hands of women in general.  Women in general have to take up that responsibility and do something different.  Which is why it's really silly to bitch about incels.  It's really silly to bitch about MGTOW.  It's really silly to complain about men who have an issue with what women are doing because women don't have to pick them.  The nature of our sexual relationship between men and women is that women pick men.  That's it.  It's that simple.  Men decide whether to stay with a woman, which is how we have this problem.  But the barrier to even enter into a woman is she has to select you.  And if their selection processes is just absurd and stupid and awful, we're going to have this problem continue.  Yes, at the end of the day, this is a problem mostly on the hands of women.  Because it doesn't matter how great a man or self-improver becomes better if the woman does not pick him.  And we cannot pretend that women are not... electing to choose shitty people.  They are.  There's no way around it.  And this is what is pissing me off about this praise for these women.  These women can fuck their lives up.  And more importantly than that, fuck the lives of both their children because they don't have a father.  And then when they make some posts on Facebook, they get praised.  That is just some silliness to me.  And that's why I felt the need to make this video.  So with that being said, man, I assume you guys enjoyed today's video.  And if you did, man, go ahead and click the like button.  And shoot, go ahead and click that.  Bye.
