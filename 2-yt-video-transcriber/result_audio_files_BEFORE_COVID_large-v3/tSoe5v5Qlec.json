It'll blow your mind.  And we hear about this, and we're minutes away.  It's kind of one of the similar situations where the first Westerners would be there in a long time.  We go bombing over at high speed, and we get there, and the mom is off mourning the death of her child, but her child is sitting there still alive.  They have written him off.  And mom is literally mourning the death of her child, and he's lying there conscious but in total shock.  Fortunately, just because of the situation, we had a speedboat, everything else.  We bandaged him up, tried to keep his arms stable and his legs stable, put him in our speedboat, and it was six hours by speedboat to a hospital, really.  And so he got there, and his life was saved.  But we asked the people in the village, what were you going to do?  And they're like, there's nothing we can do.

And I'm not actually sure if the medic administered the EpiPen or not.  But he was like... We're in the middle of the jungle.  We're six hours from a village.  that's then a full day's travel by a charter plane from a hospital.  I mean, middle of fucking nowhere.  And his throat's closing up.
