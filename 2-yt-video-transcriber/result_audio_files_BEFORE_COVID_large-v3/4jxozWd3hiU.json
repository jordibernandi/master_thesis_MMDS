That's right, it's NEAS time and I'm your host, Chris James.  Although you might as well call me Mark McFly because I'm back from the future, baby.  That's right, I'm in the year 1980 and I'm in Miami trying to warn everybody about the dangers of cocaine use.  Last night I went to a bar and I got the microphone and I said, hey, I'm from the future.  and I want you to know cocaine is a dangerous drug, and I know that because I came in a time machine from the future.  Unfortunately, three or four other people who were high on cocaine were yelling the same thing, so it didn't have much of an effect.  Anyways, we've got a great episode for you this week, as we call The Man Cave and Patrick Netherton, plus a new show called Alice Eats the Apple.  First, though, NEAS has finally gone international.  That's right.  A new prankster called Nigel Farage and pranked him so hard that it made international news.  Da-da-da-da!  Check it out. ",
