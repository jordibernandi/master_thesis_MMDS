And I said, no, what, you know, my energies are directed towards solving the problem of racism, white supremacy.  And so I would never hear from them again.  but the perception of the black male as threat.  What they don't talk about is the threat that he has the genetic apparatus that can cause white genetic annihilation.  Now, if we talk about that, then we understand why we have to kill him when we feel like it, incarcerate him forever when we feel like it.  Make certain that black male children don't have father guidance, that they grow up effeminized, and then we don't have to worry about that. ",
