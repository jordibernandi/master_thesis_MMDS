They are more citizens of this country than his wife, than the first lady.  This is birtherism.  That's all it is.  It's just another form.  But we have heard this all of our adult lives.

Therefore, I am calling on the NAACP, an organization that I served 14 years on the board of directors, an organization that I spent almost 10 years as their political director, an organization that I ran the Detroit branch of the NAACP, the largest branch in the organization.  You must disinvite the President of the United States to speak at your conventions. ",
