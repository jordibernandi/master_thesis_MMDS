            "text": "Governor Northam in Virginia is asking for 6.8 million dollars to hire 28 law enforcement officials to enforce his gun control laws that haven't even been voted on yet.  Is he putting the carpet full of horse?  Stick by and watch this episode of Guns and Gadgets.  Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your source for Second Amendment news.  We're going back to Virginia today.  Yesterday were the budget meetings on the proposed budget bill by Governor Northam.  And if you broke it down, I went over a little bit on the video where I talked about how he is requesting an increase to a couple line items in the corrections budget.  to keep gun owners in prison for the unconstitutional red flag violations.  And that video will be above there.  Check that out.  if you haven't seen it.  And if you're not aware of his budget bill, he is asking for a lot of money for a specific thing that isn't even a thing yet.  So Northam is asking for $4.8 million to specifically hire 18 new enforcement officers to strictly enforce his assault weapon ban.  You know, the same assault weapon ban that hasn't even been voted on in either house, nevermind, made it to his desk to be signed.  So you see what's going on, right?  You can pick up what he's putting down.  Now like I said, yesterday were the budget hearings in different parts of Virginia.  And the VCDL, Virginia Citizens Defense League, and Gun Owners of America were trying to get a lot of people to those meetings because each citizen who went there could have three minutes to ask questions or present something to the representatives that were there.  And one of the things they specifically were asking people to question was, why is the governor asking for $4.8 million for 18 cops in a special team to enforce assault weapons bans that don't even exist.  In addition to that $4.8 million for the 18, you know, jackbooted thugs that he wants to hire to enforce a law that doesn't even exist, yet.  He asked for, in a different area of the budget, an additional $2 million to hire 10 officers to enforce his other gun control measures that don't even exist yet.  Yup, can't make this crap up.  He wants that unit of 10 to enforce things like universal background checks, the one gun a month club thing, and extreme risk legislation.  Red flag law.  Unconstitutional gun confiscation orders.  Yes, the stuff that isn't there, not a law, he's asking for a lot of your tax dollars to enforce.  Hmm.  How can that happen?  If you're in Virginia, you need to demand from your delegates and your senators, as written in that budget, What are they gonna do with these funds that he's asking for?  Because there's still, I mean, there's no gun confiscation laws on the books.  All the stuff he wants isn't there, so why should he get money for it?  And then what is that money really gonna be used for?  There's a lot of different angles here.  I think that it's a guarantee that he's going to try to pass this stuff.  And if you do live there, once everything goes through their processes, they're probably not going to be able to be on the books until July 1st.  But, but... That doesn't mean you stop what you've started now.  In certain aspects, you have them on the run and they realize they're in for a fight.  Now, next Wednesday is going to be a big day.  That's January 8th, 2020.  That is when the new incoming ass clowns that swear to pass this stuff take their oath and their first order of business, if you remember, is to make the Capitol building and the grounds a gun-free zone, which will directly affect the Lobby Day 2020 that is planned by the Virginia Citizens Defense.  League.  Now you know that I have a great relationship with the Gun Owners of America, and I am asking you because they are putting a lot of time and effort into these areas that Other agencies aren't for whatever reason.
