            "text": "I heard the bells on Christmas Day.  Their old familiar carols play And mild and sweet their songs repeat.  A peace on earth, goodwill to men.  And the bells they're ringing.  Peace on earth.  Like a choir they're singing.  Peace on earth.  And in my heart I hear them.  Peace on earth.  Goodwill to men.  In despair I bowed my head.  There is no peace on earth, I said.  Who hated strong and watched the song Of peace on earth, good will to men.  But the bells they're ringing.  Peace on earth.  Like a choir they're singing.  Peace on earth.  Does anybody hear them?  Peace on earth.  Goodwill to men.  Then ring the bells more loud and deep.  God is not dead, nor does he sleep.  The wrong shall fail, the right prevail.  With peace on earth, goodwill to men.  Goodwill to have.  Then ringing, singing on its way.  The world revolve from night to day.  A voice, a chime, a chance of life.  Peace on earth, goodwill to men.  And the bells are ringing.  Like a choir they're singing And with our hearts we'll hear them.  Peace on earth, goodwill to men.  Do you hear the bells they're ringing?  Peace on earth, goodwill to men.  Rock the angels singing.  Peace on earth, goodwill to men.  Open up your hearts and hear them.  Goodwill to ever.  Peace on earth.  Goodwill to men. ",
