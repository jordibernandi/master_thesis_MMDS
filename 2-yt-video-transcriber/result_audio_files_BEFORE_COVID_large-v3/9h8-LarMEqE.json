            "text": "One woman writes, I was raised in a family where women made it happen with or without a man.  And another woman replies, Women brag about doing everything, then feel overwhelmed and upset about having to do everything.  It makes no sense.  I'm a single mom.  My son and I are blessed with a good life.  I wouldn't say we don't need a man though.  Why would a man ever want to live in a house where the tone is, you're not needed?  I know I wouldn't want to live in a house with that attitude towards me.  It's uninviting.  I can say without a chip on my shoulder that my son would 100% benefit from a positive male role model living with us to teach him things and spend time with him.  I do what I can, but it's not the same.  I would love for him to grow in a functional family home with positive experiences from both a man and a woman.  It would also be nice to have an adult to talk to at the end of the day.  someone to tackle problems with as a team.  i think it's healthy necessary and respectful to acknowledge the contribution a good man makes to a home.  women who are chameleons who say what men want to hear to trap them are only dangerous for the men naive enough to fall for it.  camouflage serves both offensive and defensive utilities in nature and the same is true for women.  when a woman becomes a single mother and her value falls she reaches into her bag of tricks without a concern for credibility and pulls out exactly what she needs to survive the defense of the chameleon's camouflage.  once he attracts some poor beta bucks into her web that defensive camouflage becomes offensive as she drains him of his life-force and his resources.  The woman who embraces her declining worth and doubles down, shouting that she don't need no man, is forever a lost cause, doomed to a life of alcohol, Netflix, and regret.  But let's play devil's advocate with that other type of woman, the one who claims to now understand the value of the family unit.  There's two possibilities.  Either she's lying, for the camouflage just discussed, or she is easily manipulated.  Neither possibility are acceptable foundations to build a family on.  If these types of women were genuine, they would have looked to positive female role models in their lives to model themselves after, and if they had none, they could look to the historical role of the family.  If they're stupid enough to believe their children don't need fathers, that they don't need anything more than the cock carousel while the babysitter watches her kids, and only change their perspective until after they've done permanent damage to their lives and the lives of their children, they were never worthy considerations for traditional motherhood anyways.  The damage is done, it's too late.  Camouflage is dependent on prey and predators to have a function.  Without prey to stalk from the shadows or predators to avoid, it only acts as a cosmetic distraction.  As more men understand that these women are broken and avoid them and more women rely on the government to replace the role that men would have filled, that camouflage will yield smaller and smaller gains until it's nothing more than a last ditch effort to entangle a stupid, low value man who falls for it.  the desperation of single moms shows their precarious position.  but because most men listen to their words and don't look at what they do they fall for it and believe their bullshit.  the chameleons who now understand the value of that deception of being able to subvert men and extract resources are stuck between a rock and a hard place.  the women who are too moronic to understand that doubling down never works are ruining the con game for the rest of the women, but putting that stupidity down once and for all by embracing a traditional patriarchy would take away their freedom to be promiscuous and removes their cash and prizes.  As a result, you have the current climate where stupid single mothers are lightly countered by chameleons, but never outright shamed because any shaming of women is unacceptable in 2019. ",

And I think sometimes we beat ourselves up so badly on decisions, woulda, shoulda, couldas, and you could do that for the rest of your life.  You have to take control of how you think about yourself.  And you have to own your truth.  You have to own what's going on in your life.  Own what went right, what went wrong, and say, look, this is what it is.  There's a child that's about to come into this world. ",
