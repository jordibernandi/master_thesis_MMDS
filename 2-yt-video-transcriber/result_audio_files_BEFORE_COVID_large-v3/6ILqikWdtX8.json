Once they get into government or other positions of power, they can do some real damage.  Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a.k.a.  AOC, are both members of DSA.  And you see what AOC did to New York with the whole Amazon deal.  So although they appear to not have the elevator going to the top floor, there are a few fries short of a happy meal.  They are not to be slept on.  Now, before I get any further, Further into it, let's go ahead and roll the clip.  In this clip, you'll see exactly what I mean, some of the crazy antics, some of the weird ways they talk to each other, and a bunch of more things.  After we get done with that, I'll give you my two cents and then I'll wrap it on up with a nice bow on top.  So without further ado, let's go ahead and roll it. ",

You got to go through certain things as a child in order to be a healthy and well-rounded adult.  They're putting children on drugs, medication from a young age.  And that can go back towards the situations that happened over the weekend, the tragedies.  You understand?  People are not being allowed to be kids.  They're being medicated, drugged up like zombies.  They can't go through the natural things you have to go through as a child.  Therefore, once they get to be teenage years, things are really scary.  They're weird because they never had to experience them in a real way as a child.  Go through the pain of, you know, bumping your elbow on the ground when you fall from the monkey bars, you know, go through the, you know, the whole thing about being energetic and running around and playing and just exploring the world.
