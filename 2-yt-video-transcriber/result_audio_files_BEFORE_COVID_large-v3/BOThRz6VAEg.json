And they used the First Amendment as a guise to insult and verbally attack police officers who are trying to do their work on the street.  Most of you, I guess, have seen the videos that they upload online.  onto social media.  They are vulgar.  They are profane.  They are insulting.  And last but not least, they are unnecessary.  And again, they do that under the guise of it's their First Amendment right to say these things to police officers.  Well, the court proved them wrong yesterday.  I was in a trial yesterday over at Municipal Court of Jesus Padilla, as Mexican Padilla.  He was charged with three counts of disorderly conduct and found guilty at the end of the trial and charged a fine of $500 for each of three counts of disorderly conduct, plus court costs.  I think I can say for every police officer out there that we are pleased with that verdict.  I think it almost puts a dagger in the heart of their First Amendment.  excuse for insulting police officers and verbally attacking and assaulting police officers while they're on their posts.  And with us today is our head prosecutor at the city attorney's office, Jose Nino.  Thank you, Chief. ",

Our duty and our goal is to protect not only the citizens of the city of San Antonio, but our first responders as well.  They went above and beyond what we would normally consider free speech.  The judge agreed with us and went ahead and found that individual guilty.
