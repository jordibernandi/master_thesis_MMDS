            "text": "And now the pumpkin saga continues.  Oh, it really does, though.  Today we're going to cover how not, if you are a journalist, to cover a pro-genocide conference.  I am Mr.  Atheist.  Let's do this.  Alright, so, very brief recap if you haven't been watching.  This coming weekend there's going to be a conference called the Make America Straight Again Conference.  That conference is happening in Orlando to basically celebrate the Pulse nightclub shooting which happened a few years back.  Speaking at this conference are four pastors who advocate for the total genocide of the LGBTQ or GRSM community.  I made a video responding to their initial promotion.  They made a video calling me out.  video calling them out.  They made a video basically showing off how scared they are.  And we've been spending time, money, and resources affecting this organization in significant ways.  All right, that brings us to now.  Something you should be aware of.  A group of us have been working in the background, getting all kinds of stuff done.  We're working on a website that sort of lays out the way this organization works and and proves that it is a cult.  It's a collection of also all of their most bigoted things.  And we have a press release coming out within the next 24 hours that has been spearheaded mostly by Shannon Q, KC from Godless Engineers Channel, a lot of archiving work done by Atheist Rationale, and then also several others.  There are several other people working on this whole project in general.  And so, basically, the point of this press release will be to get press coverage, to make sure that this, which does not have an insignificant level of influence, does not have an insignificant way to influence the way other churches are speaking, and is sort of on par with the most radical sort of alt-right things.  you are hearing about how certain political factions in this country want to treat people, rather, In the GRSM community, coverage will be beginning soon.  However, prior to this happening, a local news station decided to pick up the story.  And as far as I can tell, it almost seems like as a method of promoting it.  Not really good due diligence journalism as a whole lot is left out about this conference.  And by the way, if you don't wanna be left out of things that happen on this channel and for nearly daily atheist content, make sure you hit that subscribe button, which I just remembered I forgot to mention at the beginning of the video.  All right, I'm gonna be showing you two videos here.  I'm gonna be showing you the actual news coverage by this local station of this conference coming up.  And then I'm gonna show you a video from Pastor Boyle's YouTube channel, where he's basically talking about this interview and that this interview was going to be coming out later today.  I think that's the right order to show this in.  I've been conflicted on which one I should do here.  And honestly, what happened was I watched both of these things and was just really kind of disgusted at the way these journalists handled it.  And so I'm entering the current war that seems to be between things like YouTube and traditional media to call out this absolute and complete utter garbage.  Anyway, have a look at this Pulitzer deserving news story. ",

And regarding causing tension with the LGBTQ plus community, yes, generally when people advocate for our deaths, generally when people advocate that we shouldn't live and the government should be enforcing that, but it's just based on their belief, which that belief, I have the right to hold that belief.  Yeah, we do get a little bit angry.  I guess tense wouldn't be inaccurate.

He's just being so bullied by these people that he calls every incendiary name he can and wants them to die.  Also, are you under the impression we're going door to door and you're beating us door to door?  The reason why society has been changing so rapidly is more and more people realize they know people in the LGBTQ plus community or the GRSM community.  I'm kind of using the language that has been being used in the report here.  I do prefer GRSM.  But as they realize they know more people from that community, as they realize it's their siblings, their family, their friends, and that actually the way reality bears it out is that there is nothing wrong or different about it than your straight love or what you think is the only correct kind of love, despite the fact, once again here in Spectrum News 13, despite the fact that you just on multiple occasions lie about us being automatically rapists or being automatically pedophiles yeah anyway spectrum news 13 you really did a great job reporting on this one.  let's finish out this this really just amazing piece of yours.

But to tell you the truth, I kind of played in the minors.  You went pro.  Cults and religious fundamentalism are always bad for the people inside them and the societies around them.  You are bad for this world.  But I'm not going to advocate for your death the way you advocate for mine.  If you want to come around to what's right and what's reasonable one day, that's great.  In the meantime, I'm going to keep destroying your message, winning because we have these things called like science, reason, facts, logic on our side, and crippling your reach. ",

            "text": "Yeah, that's great.  You're singing the Psalms from the book that you take literally, despite the fact that it has gone through interpretation after interpretation.  It's been had parts removed from it, had parts added by it.  Kings got their hands on it.  Popes got their hands on it.  But, you know, the literal word in there, that's the thing to absolutely live by.  By the way, has anyone told these four yet?  We've mentioned it before.  King James, which you think is the inerrant word of God, his Bible, he was bisexual.  So if God hates the retrobate so much, why did he use one to get his message to you?  Your entire life and identity is dependent on that there.  bisexual.  Feels good, doesn't it?  Anyway, back to the original point.  We will get better press coverage of this going.  The press release is going to be going out.  Hopefully somebody will email these people at this news organization or people will reach out who know this news organization and really show them what a failing they did here.  Send them my videos if you like.  Send them that first one of me covering the conference and really show them this isn't just some, you know, casual conference that it's sending waves.  You know, people are, this is a conference of hateful, hateful bigots.  Hateful bigots who want to murder.  people like me for who I tend to be attracted to and who I want to love.  And Spectrum News 13, what did you basically do with this?  You gave it free promotion, completely devoid of the whole picture so that people could actually get an idea of what kind of garbage is here.  You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself.  Again, even if you're only saying you were reporting on what's happening, you clearly constrained the actual picture.  and It's not just reporting because it obviously was trying to paint poor Pastor Boyle here, the champion of genocide, as a victim.  Do better.  You can reach me at my email, dearmratheist at gmail.com, if you would like to set up some kind of interview or something to correct the record.  All right, that's it.

Most of that money is going into different things like these websites that we are working on, promoting certain things.  If you contribute now, a part of it will probably go to my going to pride fund this weekend.  where I am hoping at least to make some content.  I actually went last year wanting to do that, and there were certain reasons why I didn't know if I would be able to post the content.  The presence of a certain Free the Nipple campaign, to be precise.  Also, follow me over on Twitter, Dear Mr.  Atheist.  There are specific updates that go out there as we are... going after certain websites and need help from crowds of people.  That is the best place there.  And also thank you to all of you people who have added a pumpkin to your handle as a show of solidarity for the incredibly homophobic attack they tried to make on me.  I love that we just took it, owned it, turned it around and made them regret it.  And now we end today's episode with my patrons who are so amazing and keep this channel going.  A special thank you to my Orbital Teapots, Mia, Commander Bork, Caleb, Ariel, Sassy Cat, Matthew, Godless Strayan, Mabity Babity, and Maya.  Here's some video suggestions if you want to support the channel by staying a while.  And thank you to today's patron of the day who is Pegasus.  With love, I've been Jimmy Snow.  Mr.  Pumpkin was not my father. ",
