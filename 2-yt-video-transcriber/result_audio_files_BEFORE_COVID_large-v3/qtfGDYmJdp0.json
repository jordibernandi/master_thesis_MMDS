So tell me.  Not like bunny sex, but I don't know.  If you go a couple times, it probably should be an hour.  Hour, right?  But on average, what's your average dude?  They don't last very long, but if they can go around two, that's good.  Okay, so you're saying, okay, all right.  15 minutes.  That's higher than average.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You're doing good.  Thank you.  You're doing good.  I'm a virgin.  Bro, shut the fuck up.  What, 30 minutes to an hour?  That's what you get normally? ",
