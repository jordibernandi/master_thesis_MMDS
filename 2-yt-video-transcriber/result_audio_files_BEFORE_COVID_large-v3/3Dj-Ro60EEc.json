            "text": "Hi, this is Mike Maloney and it's been a while since I've made a video analyzing the economy or the precious metals sector and so I wanted to give a little update here.  And there's been a lot of talk lately about Basel III and even websites saying that this was a return to the gold standard and that gold is going to soar between now and the end of the month.  Basel III It takes full effect on April 1st and the last trading day of the month is going to be on March 29th.  So there's a lot of people expecting gold to jump after March 29th.  You know, that may or may not happen.  I think that this is going to be a longer process.  But what's interesting about all of this is that this Basel III is part of the bank's getting ready for the next financial crisis.  Now this was all done back in 2013.  This is a document from the Bank for International Settlements, and it's just an update on finalizing.  But this is from December 2017.  Now, in doing a search for the word gold in this document, What we see here is that the most important thing about this document is that gold has been upgraded to a 0% risk asset.  So a 0% risk weight will apply to cash owned and held at the bank or in transit and gold bullion held at the bank or held at another bank on an allocated basis.  This is very important that they've gone from gold being a pretty risky asset because of the volatility in price to gold being a 0% risk asset.  It's basically that's a little bit like saying, you know, we really should be on a gold standard.  Now, they're just doing this in preparation for the next big crisis.  When will the next big crisis come?  Well, I don't know, but it looks like it's getting closer and closer to me.  A growing list of companies from FedEx to BMW are warning about the world economy, and they're warning about the slowdowns in their profits, in their business, their quarterly reports for their corporations.  Their analysts are predicting much slower growth going forward.  A lot has to do with the trade wars.  The trade wars were just a bad idea, putting tariffs on and stuff.  This is part of what caused the Great Depression and caused the depths of the Great Depression.  Now I'm going to shift gears a little bit here and go to a part of the early warning presentation.  I made a little modification here to it.  So this was talking about the different, there's articles that are written like I've seen it on Zero Hedge a dozen times and a few other places.  where they show a chart of the throughout the centuries, the different world reserve currencies.  And typically the chart says world reserve currency status doesn't last forever.  Now, all of those charts that you've seen are wrong because the world that we didn't have a reserve bank that was doing international settlements or acting as a hub of any type of monetary system until the Bank of England.  So when they show Portugal for 80 years and Spain for 110 years and then Holland being the world reserve currency and France for 95 years, These are just the predominant currencies on the planet, and the reason they're predominant is because their economy was the predominant economy.  They had an economic boom.  They were sailing all over the planet, and they were doing a lot of trade with other countries.  And when you import goods from other countries, your currency flows from your country to that other country.  So you have other countries all over the world flooded with the currencies from these different countries at these different periods in time.  And then the Bank of England established the, you know, we went on to the classical gold standard in the late 1800s, and the Bank of England was the clearinghouse for that, with the big pallets of gold down in the basement, and if one country owed another country gold, they could transfer a bar and make an entry, or just make entries on the allocation on the books.  Now, when that ended, Great Britain sort of faded.  It didn't happen suddenly, so I've modified this a little.  There's a little overlap there between Great Britain and the U.S Great Britain went off of the gold standard.  All the countries, all the combatants in Europe went off of the gold standard when World War I broke out and started printing tons of currency.  But then there was the banking conference in Genoa, Italy in 1922.  And they came up with a new world monetary system.  And in that world monetary system, Great Britain and the United States would become the hubs of the international gold standard.  And that was called the gold exchange standard.  And it worked until Great Britain pulled out of it in 1931.  So there's a 19-year overlap between these two gold standards.  But the point of all of this is that reserve currency status doesn't last forever.  And with the next crisis, there's chinks in the armor.  There's nails in the coffin of the global dollar standard, which we're on right now.  But the point of it is that predominant currency status, the average has been about 94 years.  And we're 98, 99 years now plus into this system of the global US dollar standard.  And it's a fiat currency standard.  But what was lacking from this chart that the people at Incrementum first introduced was the fact that gold has been the predominant currency for most of this period of time.  And it's real money.  And then it's been the predominant central bank reserve currency for almost 300 years.  And here's the breakdown on that.  And this is the reason that the Basel III Accord that them recognizing gold as a zero risk asset is very, very important in the long run.  Is it going to make any difference between now and April?  I don't know.  Will the price jump?  I don't know.  I just know that I'm positioning myself in gold and silver very heavily and have been accumulating since the early 2000s.  But this is a chart of 100% of the bank reserves.  So it's a breakdown year by year of what percentages of the different reserve currencies and gold are in the world's central banks.  And what you see here is that up until 1988, gold made up, on the average, more than 50%, far more than 50%.  And the further back you go, I mean, if you go back to before World War I, it was 100% of reserve currencies.  The intra-war gold standard, the gold exchange standard, there was a mixture of gold and bonds and so on.  So that's when these different currencies arrived.  started to become mixed in with gold.  But what you see is that all the other currencies have sort of squeezed out gold.  And so that gold is a little more than, I don't know what it is today, this chart is from 2017, but it's a little bit more than 10% of international reserves at central banks.  Now they've recognized it as a zero risk asset along with cash.  And so this is very important.  They're trying to create stability for the next crisis so that the banks don't go into a complete meltdown mode like they were beginning to go into back in 2008.  Now that was stopped, but it was stopped by a whole bunch of manipulation.  And that manipulation has caused distortions in the global economy that are going with this next crisis.  when it happens.  It's probably going to be like a two-stage crisis.  It'll seem like it's been handled, and then it's going to get worse.  And so I'm positioning myself in precious metals, and I just did a conference with Alex Daly and Jeff Clark of my company that's going to be released shortly about this.  storing precious metals.  And so this answers any questions that you would have about storage.  And that video is going to be released shortly, but the newsletter subscribers are going to be the ones that get it first.  So if you could sign up to our newsletter at goldsilver.com, I'd appreciate it.  Thank you very much for listening.  We'll catch you next time. ",
