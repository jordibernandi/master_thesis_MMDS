            "text": "Hi everyone, I'm Barry Stagner and this is his channel news break.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Russia's S-400 air defense missiles are currently being prepared to be flown to Turkey.  Speaking to reporters before leaving for Bosnia, Erdogan wouldn't say, however, when the Russian missile defense system would reach Turkey or where they will be deployed.  The preparations for the journey, the loading of the S-400, is continuing, and the S-400 will arrive by planes, may it be beneficial for our country, our region, and especially for the world, Erdogan said.  The delivery of the systems is likely to deepen the crisis with the  U.S.,  bringing Turkey closer to sanctions by the Trump administration.  Washington has repeatedly said it will cancel its own sale of its latest generation F-35 stealth jets to Turkey if Ankara goes ahead with its purchase of the Russian-made S-400s.  Turkey plans to buy 100 U.S.  F-35s and its defense industry has paid significant sums for the manufacture of the warplanes.  U.S.  officials have encouraged Turkey to buy the American-made Patriot missile defense system instead, but Erdogan has refused to pull back from the S-400 deal.  Last month, outgoing Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told Ankara that Washington would expel Turkish pilots from U.S.  training on F-35 jets if it didn't renounce the deal with Russia before July 31st.  The U.S.  has also threatened to hit Turkey with sanctions if it goes ahead with the S-400 deal, though Ankara previously said it was prepared for any possible U.S.  measures.  But after meeting his U.S.  counterpart, Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan earlier this month, Erdogan said he has been assured there would be no sanctions.  Trump at the time blamed the previous administration of Barack Obama for failing to finalize a deal for Turkey to buy the American Patriot system instead of the S-400.  The future of Obamacare could be at stake on Tuesday when a coalition of Democratic-led states and House representatives urge a federal appeals court to overturn a Texas judge's ruling that the U.S.  health care reform law is unconstitutional.  Republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act as it's known, since its 2010 passage.  And while the Justice Department would normally defend a federal law, the Trump administration has declined to defend its constitutionality against a challenge by 18 Republican-led states.  A coalition of Democratic state attorney generals, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, stepped into the void to defend the law.  The House intervened after Democrats won control in November's elections after many focused their campaigns on defending Obamacare.  A three-judge panel of the Fifth U.S.  Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans included two judges appointed by Republican presidents and one by a Democrat who will take up a ruling by a federal judge in Texas last year that the entire ACA was unconstitutional.  An appellate ruling declaring Obamacare unconstitutional could prompt an appeal to the U.S.  Supreme Court, opening the door for the top court to take up the issue in the midst of the 2020 U.S.  presidential election.  Obamacare, the signature domestic achievement of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, has been a political flashpoint since its passage, and Republican opponents call the law an unwarranted intervention by government in health insurance markets, while supporters say that striking it down would put at risk the healthcare of 20 million people who have gained insurance since its enactment.  One thing we do know in the last days is that there will be few in control of the many, and this story gives us a reminder telling us to keep looking up. ",
