            "text": "Good afternoon again, honorable representatives.  My name is Desiree Mays.  I'm a Christian, a wife, a mother, and a member of Apologia Church.  I come here again to plead with you to protect the lives of our pre-born neighbors.  I first off just want to tell you that our church and my family, we're praying for each of you.  We come here, you know, a couple times a month, but we want you to know that we care for you and we're praying for you.  You might be sitting here today thinking that because abortion is legal, it makes it moral.  Well, first off, I'd like to say it's absolutely not legal.  Abortion first and foremost breaks God's law that clearly states you shall not murder.  Abortion also violates our Declaration of Independence, and abortion is still illegal here in Arizona under AZ Statute 13-3603.  But for argument's sake, let's just say it was legal.  Would that make it moral?  In Hitler's Germany, killing Jews was legal.  Was that moral?  In the US, owning a slave used to be legal.  Was that moral?  So now we have what's considered legalized abortion.  Does that make it moral to kill a child in the womb?  No, legality does not equal morality.  We know these things are wrong, because the God of the Bible, who rules over this earth, has given us the gift of a conscience.  Conscience means with knowledge.  With that knowledge, all people know that killing babies is wrong.  and this must stir us to action.  Today I came in and I wanted to show you some pictures of children who've been saved because of Christians who've gone out and fought for their lives.  I actually brought you six pictures, but they were confiscated from me today, which I find interesting.  I also brought a picture of a baby who has been killed, one that didn't make it, like 60 million others, and that as well was confiscated from me, and I'm not quite sure why that was.  Perhaps you guys can answer the question.  Do you know why those things were taken from me?  Anybody?  No?  Because we had another... ",

            "text": "Okay, now the security took it from me and said we're not allowed to have any pictures of any type of sort, so I gave it away, but then my sister over here was able to bring her picture of her beautiful family, which I'm thankful that she was able to.  I'm just curious as to why mine was taken away, and I think it is because you guys are afraid to see the consequences of your inaction.  I mean, what would be the problem of showing an aborted baby if... And I'm sorry, what's your name over there in the leopard, smiling?  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm talking about a baby that was murdered.  Yeah, so I think it's just interesting that you guys took that right away from me but you didn't right here.  So it just kind of shows the arbitrary nature of your guys' roles here.  So anyways, I'll just give you some names.  Olivia, Grace, Carmelo.  Those are babies that are alive because people fought for them.  So we need you guys to fight too and make Arizona a sanctuary city.  Thanks.  Can I ask a question?  City manager.  Could you inquire regarding the photo, the picture? ",

It's illegal for us to engage with people that are doing, individuals that are doing citizen comments, just so you know that.  I mean, there are new people here.  You've been here before.  But just for the individuals that are here, we engage.  We're basically breaking the law because it has to be posted within 24 hours on any subject.  And so that's why you see most of us just not say anything at that point.  Thank you, Mayor. ",
