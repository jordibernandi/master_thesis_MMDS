The Three Arrows logo is, of course, a reference to the Iron Front, the German paramilitary group that was made up of mostly socialists, as well as social democrats and union workers in Germany, that rose to... It was a paramilitary organization that rose to combat the rise of Nazism in Germany.  The Nazi Party, which is often told to be an organization that was elected into power, actually was elected into a minority of power and then slowly gained more political power through a series of events.  And we're not going to get into the entire history of that.  However, Dan is using their logo for his purposes.  He is not co-adopting the Antifa logo.  Antifa also adopts some imagery from that period, and we can get into that as well.  I'll pull up exactly what they do, where this logo comes from.  This is the most common one used by Antifa.  Now, Antifa and other organizations do co-op the Three Arrows, but it's very important, and an important distinction here is you cannot suddenly claim that Dan Arrows is an Antifa channel in any way, shape, or form.

I'm not even going to try and \u2013 levy him with the charge or the paintbrush that this has something to do with the globalist conspiracy or anything like that.  But if we just want to talk about corporate leftism, perhaps we should reference a study.  So I'm just going to pull up a little study here.  What do we got?  Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation.  So maybe I'm sure you and me, Tim, we can agree that maybe Harvard Law School, it would be a justifiable source in this case.  There's not really any reason to kind of ad hominem this attack or anything like that.  Right.  So let's look at this, uh, in terms of CEOs in the United States and, uh, their power, if they were to say swing one way or the other.  So if we classify CEOs as Republican, if they contribute primarily to Republican candidates or Democrat, if they contribute primarily to democratic candidates and neutral, if they split their financial support on the two parties, We find that 58% of CEOs are Republicans, while only 18% are Democrats.  Now, 18% isn't insignificant.  It's certainly a large percentage, but you can't really keep levying the charge that there's this large corporate democratic contingent.  There's certainly rich Democrats and there's rich members of the Democratic Party.  And the Democratic Party as a whole is not exactly what leftists, when you say leftism and you keep using that word left, they're not directly associated with them.  They're liberals.  And liberals are quite different from leftists.  But I mean, all these little nuances and distinctions that we have to make, it gets complicated, obviously. ",

At the end of the day, if you watch him for too long, you basically have to take Brain Force Plus just to regulate your thetan.  So I wouldn't recommend watching anymore.  What is important to take away from this is what exactly is Tim Pool doing here?  A lot of it has to do with something called the fallacy of composition, in which he's basically taking... small elements of certain concepts, ideas, groups, and then he is then extrapolating.  Therefore, if X happens, then all of these groups happen to be under the same purview.  So say, for example, if a car has four wheels, and the wheels have tires, and the tires are made of rubber, therefore, because of that, the entire car is made of rubber.  It's that same concept.  So if you then take it to the extreme, like he's doing here, Dan Three Arrows uses the three arrow symbol.  Therefore, Dan is a member of Antifa because Antifa have also used the same symbol in their organization.  And it's a fallacious argument.  It's usually done in haste.
