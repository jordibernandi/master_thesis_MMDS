That's perfect.  Was that a threat?  Yeah?  Thank you.  Just got a threat on camera.  He even said it was.  This is his motorcycle.  Personal motorcycle.  Bunch of thugs that work here, man.

Just go inside and you'll... He said, I hope I don't have a run-in with you.  I said, is that a threat?  He said, yes.  So, and that's one of the things I'm following is a harassment complaint against this department, too.  So, it's wonderful how you guys just build a case for me.  It's wonderful.  You were nice and cordial.  I appreciate that.  There we go, guys.  Salem PD.  This is why I'm doing it, guys, because people are scared and this is why they use these fear tactics against us.  Here's the guy that threatened me.  Sarge number 88.  Of course he's 88.  We know what that means.  That means hail Hitler.  Oh, there he goes with it.  Hail Hitler.  Sarge 88, of course.  Perfect for him.  You don't like to be in the public eye, don't be a police officer.  Bunch of thugs that work here.  Bunch of thugs. ",
