This guy's a really good friend of mine, you guys.  Please take the time right now to go subscribe to his channel.  This guy will make you guys laugh.  He makes me laugh all the time.  I love his videos.  Love this guy in person, man.  This guy is awesome.  Check him out, you guys.  News Now California.  Thank you, guys.  Sir, may I ask what are you doing here?  Who are you?  Okay, I'm a postal employee.  May I see your ID?  Can I see your ID?  I'm right here.  No, I'm in a uniform.  What?  I'm in a uniform right now.  What did you say?  This is a federal building and I'm in a uniform right now.  What are you doing right here, sir?  I'd suggest you take about two steps back and I'm going to defend myself.  I'm going to call the police because you're supposed not to do anything.  video on the federal building.  Do you understand that I'm on a public sidewalk?  No.  Okay.  You stay right there, okay?  Okay.  No, you stay right here.  You told him that I'm coming out to get a reaction.  Those were your words.  And I'm calling you out on that because that's bullshit.  Okay.  What are you out here for then?  Are you stupid or something?  I just told you.  To record what?  How did you become a cop, dude?  You didn't answer my question.  Dude, you're too stupid.  Officer, why don't you tell them the truth?  I thought you didn't want to have a part of the conversation.  I changed my mind.  Okay, let's have a part of the conversation.  Why would you tell them that I'm looking for a reaction?  I come out here so I don't get one because then it shows they're respecting my right to film in public.  But you tell them I'm just coming out to get a reaction.  So what you're coming out of your mouth is bullshit.  Yeah, I know, and I'm saying what you're telling them is horseshit.  It's cops like you that are a disgrace because you're lying.  You know what the First Amendment is?  I mean, if you just tell them, look, I'm out here filming in public, I got a right to do it, instead of saying I want a reaction.  I don't want an engagement.  It means they're respecting my right and they know the First Amendment, which you don't know, dickhead.  How many people's rights have you violated?  Huh?  What good have you done?  You're a bad cop.  I can already tell by telling him that kind of nonsense.  You're a bad cop.  You're probably on the list of the 12,000 that the Attorney General doesn't want to let loose.  And then you're going to weed yourself back into law enforcement.  It's guys like you that why there's a disconnect with the community, man.  Just recording.  You're Sergeant Bowley?  Bowley, sir.  Bowley.  Yes.  Excuse me.  What's your badge number, Sergeant?  93.  93, sir.  Thank you.  We're not fighting anything.  I tried to ask you a question.  I tried asking you a question, too, right?  Yeah, but there's a difference, man, of what I'm doing.  It's personal to me.  Okay, but I'm working.  Yeah, and you represent the company, and you should tell me the demarcation of what's open to the public and not.  You said that's personal.  Yeah, well, you nailed it yourself.  What?  You nailed it yourself.  You're like, from right here, right here.  You didn't confirm anything.  You didn't confirm anything either.  I don't need to confirm anything with you.  So how is this going to work?  When your supervisor comes out.  He said 10-4.  10-4 is yes.  No, it says that I understood what he said.  No, no, no.  He said, are you harassed?  Are you being harassed?  You're the supervisor of Alberta?  So we're out here doing public photography.  I asked him.  where the demarcation is because it's Indian land and I wanted to find out is the post from here to here open to the public that we're able to stand here and film as opposed to going on to?  because this is an easement?  this is an easement you have to.  Indian land has to provide an easement for people to walk.  and his answer to me was I don't answer personal questions.  Yeah, you're fine on the street.  That's not my question.  My question is not the street.  You didn't hear what I said?  What's publicly accessible?  What's publicly accessible?  Is it from that post to the curb?  That's what I'm trying to determine.  I can call and find out.  Yeah, that'd be good.  It's a simple question.  It's not personal information.  Well, I don't know why you're saying that.  I'll find out.  Good.  One minute, 37 seconds later.  He's telling you to walk away.  Get on your bike and go.  Yeah, get on your bike and go, Alberto.  Don't fall off and hit your head.  For the seventh time.  You are harassed.  No, he actually said he almost got hit six times.  Who are you to educate me?  Well, you're giving me an order.  I didn't give you any orders, first of all.  Okay, so I have a legal right to do it.  Is that what you're saying?  Huh?  Is that what you're saying?  Why don't you kick rocks, man?  I'll stand right here just like you are, right?  Public property?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll stand here too.  Yeah, you're a tough guy, aren't you?  No.  Yeah, you're a tough guy.  Who am I to educate you?  Who are you?  Yeah, who are you?  You're a guy in a costume.  You said you wanted to educate me.  You're a guy in a costume.  I'm asking you to educate me and who you are to educate me.  No, you told me who am I to educate you.  You come off all aggressive.  I didn't come off aggressive in any way.  You can call me.  I have my hands in my pockets.  I'm aggressive?  Yeah, in your tone of voice, fool.  Okay.  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate that.  Good name calling.  Yeah.  What you gonna do?  Well, if you have a question of mine, just let me know and we're up there.  Yeah, no, I told you I didn't, so can I get back to talking to him?  Because you interrupted me.  Okay, well... Thanks, you can leave.  Okay.  What's the law?  You can't state it because it isn't a law that I can't film.  It's a First Amendment right.  I do this all the time.  As long as I'm in public, I'm allowed to film here.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  I need help.  Yes.  This gentleman here, he, you know, I'm trying to enforce the policy.  Yeah.  And he's been taking, like, videos, and I'm trying to get his identification, like... In this day and age... Yes, sir.  Right, right?  In this day and age... Right.  I've heard it a million times.  I've heard it a million times.  Who am I speaking with?  Yeah, he's not a... Excuse me?  You want to be a smart guy?  Is that what I'm hearing?  What'd he say?  He said, excuse... Go and call Port Police.  Yeah, I did that.  That's already been done.  And they left.  No, that was the Port Security.  I'm talking about this is the Port Police that I called.  Oh, I got confused.  The Port Security who said that they respect what I'm doing and I'm on public property and I can continue doing it.  That gentleman?  That's the Port Security.  Right, right.  Not the... I'm not on the premises.  I'm not on your premises.  I'm on public property.  He's videotaping the refinery, Joe.  Don't bark orders when you don't know where I'm standing.  Well, he... You need to respect... No, you need to respect me.  I'm on public property.  I know, but you're not... Monica, walk away.  Monica, walk away.  There you go.  Walk away.  Good advice, Joe.  I took a photo of him.  He refused to get ID, so... Yeah, you're not law enforcement.  I don't have to show you ID.  It's not that what I'm... Walk away.  Walk away, Monica.  Talk to smart-ass Joe.  No, he's not.  Really, he's a good guy.  Yeah, I called Joe and Joe told me to walk away.  Now what do I do?  Well, there you go.  The walk of shame.  You've got to have permission from the county.  From the county?  Yeah.  Is this open to the public here?  In here, is this a public lobby?  Yes, but before you walk in here with that, you've got to have permission to record.  For example, I own copyrights to my own face.  I can sue you right now.  For example, I own copyrights to my own face.  I can sue you right now.  What you talking about, bro?  No, you can't.  Yes, I can.  You're in public.  You're in public, bro.  That's funny, dude.  No, you can't.  Don't be silly.  Don't be silly.  This is open to the public.  We're allowed to be in here.  What is this for?  Is this open to the public?  What is this for?  Is this open to the public?  Well, you're already telling things that aren't true, so why would we tell you what we're doing?  Then what's the purpose of being here?  If you're just going to goof around.  Goof around?  Yeah.  Instead of goofing around.  Well, answer my question.  What's the purpose of it?  What is it we have to answer to?  And who are you to record?  We're citizens.  American.  Free man.  Of the United States.  Okay.  And my job is to escort people out if you don't have an appointment.  Do you have an appointment?  This is open in the public.  It's a public area.  accessible area.  Hopefully when we do these, we don't get engagement that we're told we can't come in here with a video camera.  Okay, we do this in police departments, we do FBI, we do DEA, we go into all government facilities.  A memo in 2018. that exactly what we're doing is perfectly legal.  What organization do you work for?  We're no organization.  We're just people that go out and do this.  We don't have to sign up to be free Americans to do what's allowed.  Yeah, but see, what's happening right now is we're taking your word for it that what you're telling us is the truth.  We'll call the police.  We'll have to do that.  Call the police.  Can you stop videotaping until we call the police?  So you're just going to continue to videotape.  So we're going to have to take your word for it.  No, no, I just asked you.  Sure, take our word for it.  We're not even shooting.  when she did that.  I said, what is wrong with you?  I have every right to film here.  She says, we pay for this.  I said, yeah, and I pay for this.  I'm in public.  Leave me alone.  And then you came down.  Got it.  So if I can ask you, where are you going?  What?  Why are you backing up?  Well, you got a gun.  Do you want me to stand this close and we can dance?  No, I'm standing here, Clark.  No, but I'm talking to you and you're walking backwards.  You're leaving.  Why?  Well, I could zoom in on you.  Is something making you nervous right now?  No, but I want to give space.  There's something that's called personal space.  But we just met.  We were talking upstairs.  Yeah.  I'm not afraid of you.  I'm just backing up.  Then why are we backing up?  Well, how close do you want me to stand to you?  I just want you to stop.  Don't move.  Don't move?  Don't move.  Just stay right there.  I'm trying to talk to you and you're backing away.  That's rude.  I'm not going anywhere.  Okay, then why are you backing away?  If I want to take a step back, what's wrong with that?  Like you're walking away as I'm approaching you like you're afraid of me.  No, I told you I'm not.  Are you afraid of me?  What did I just tell you?  Well, your body language is saying otherwise because you're walking backwards away from me like I'm going to do something to you.  I took one step.  It's not like I'm taking multiple steps, Claude.  Phil, let me ask you.  Go ahead.  What are we trying to accomplish today?  Where are you going again?  You're backing away.  What are you talking about?  Where are you going?  I'm going nowhere.  Look, my feet, when you're talking to me, if I want to go like that... Okay, but every time I like to talk with my hands, okay?  Right.  Well, why do you talk with your hands?  Because that's just the way I am.  Okay, well, then I back up because that's the way I am.  Okay.  How's that?  Phil, let me ask you this.  Let me ask you this.  What are we trying to accomplish today?  What brings you to the beach here?  I'm out here so everybody understands that I have a right to film in public.  Okay, but you're doing it in a way that's very antagonistic.  How?  Because you're on the bike path, you're in their face.  I wasn't in their face, dude.  I was standing with three people here.  I'm going to explain something to you.  You don't need to.  Okay.  We're done, Claude.  I liked you up there, but what you're doing now is wrong.  What am I doing, Phil?  You're telling me that I'm antagonizing them.  I was putting my camera in their face.  You're very close to them.  You're very close to them.  I'm 30 feet away from them, Claude.  Now?  But when I got here, you were almost at that line where they're trying to conduct business.  They're here trying to... promote a product for the public.  Are you gonna let me finish?  Not really.  Not really.  At this time, whatever you're gonna tell me isn't gonna... You just don't like what I'm gonna tell you.  What I'm gonna ask you to do is to walk up there to that second ramp.  Why?  And if you want to film from there, you're more than welcome to film from there.  So you're telling me that if I stand right here... You are not gonna stand right there.  No, but you're telling me that if I stand right here, what are you gonna do?  Um... Nothing.  Here.  Don't stand in the bike path.  Because if you're standing in the bike path, now you're loitering on a bike path.  Okay, so what if I walk along there?  If you walk and you're just moseying along, then that's fine.  Okay, like this.  This is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to go like this.  And I'm going to do this.  Why?  Because you're right there, you were stuck.  Now you're just loitering.  Okay.  So what you're saying is, I can go like this, but I can't do that.  Right?  Right.  How was that?  Was that okay?  where I did a circle?  This isn't loitering.  Nope.  I'm going to still do it, Claude.  So Claude turned out to be an idiot.  I'm keeping my feet going, Claude.  But you're loitering.  No, I'm not.  Yes.  You're in the same area.  You're going to arrest me?  You're going to arrest me, Claude?  You're not.  You're just trying to intimidate me, man.  And I know the game, man.  I'm not loitering.  Phil.  Leave me alone, brother.  But what is the reasoning for this?  Why are you even doing this?  Leave me alone.  They elevated it.  Leave me alone, dude.  What are you trying to accomplish today?  I already told you.  What are you trying to do?  They need to respect my right to film in public, man.  That's it.  Bottom line.  And you can.  No, not according to them.  You can do it from here.  I just can't have you on the bike path.  Sure I can be on the bike path.  There were three other people filming.  And they were stopped.  But it's a bike path.  I understand.  So if you want to film, you can sit here and film all you want.  So you're telling me... Let me explain something to you.  Hang on, Claude.  So you're telling me that when pedestrians walk on this bike path, if they want to stop to look, that's loitering.  That's what you're telling me.  What you're doing is totally different.  Why?  You're making circles.  You're doing rounds.  Come on, Officer Claude. ",
