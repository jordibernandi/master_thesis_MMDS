But as you might imagine, you've been a topic of conversation on this campus a lot in the past week or so, certainly among a lot of us who discuss politics.  And one of the things that sort of united people who like and dislike a lot of your ideas is that we appreciate your defense of free speech, and we appreciate you coming here to talk about it with us.  But one of the things I thought was really interesting is Professor Van Dyke addressed the distinction between you and Jonathan Haidt.  And you mentioned this as sort of a temperamental one.  And I think, I'm sure that's true to some extent, but I notice you've made a lot of more sort of substantively inflammatory claims.  In the course of this lecture, you called the authors of Facebook posts demons and totalitarians.  In past events, you've called them things like neo-Marxists, cultural Marxists.  You've called them, I believe, a fifth column that is committing treason against the West.  And it seems to me this is more than temperamental.  This is a substantive difference. ",
