            "text": "Greetings, family.  Hi, everyone.  I'd like to thank you firstly for coming to my new YouTube channel, I should say, which is called Blacksit.  And this channel is really about trying to demonstrate by showing the reasons why we feel that you should repatriate back to Africa and why it's important for us to do it.  I'm going to be interviewing people who have repatriated and I'll also be showing you aspects of African life that differ completely from your life within the West, Europe or England or wherever you may be when you're not home.  So I want to show you how easy it is to make that jump here to Africa.  I also want to show you all of the opportunities that are here in Africa.  I also want to dispel a lot of the myths about Africa in order to If you like, ingratiate us all back to Motherland to encourage you to come back home because it really is an absolute, absolute honour to be living here.  And I couldn't, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.  I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.  And I believe that some of us are just wasting our time living in the West.  and we're not getting anywhere and we're not happy.  We're facing extreme racism, extreme discrimination, unconscious bias, lots of microaggressions every day and never seeing yourself represented.  So I'm going to look at marketing and how when you see yourself represented in Africa, how it changes your mindset, how it changes your life.  And so this channel is really all about changing your life and encouraging you to come back to the motherland.  I'll also show you about opportunities, how to buy land, how to build a house, how to buy a house, and show you a lot of the beautiful places that are available here.  So I really want to talk about the social and economical aspects of being here as well, and how your mental health is improved by being in this environment.  And I think that's important because far too many of us are suffering from mental health conditions living in the West.  So, yeah, I mean, that's me.  I'm Juliet.  I'll tell you a bit more about myself and my life story too because my journey has been an incredible one and I want to share aspects of that with you too.  So if you know me or you've seen me in the media before, please follow me.  If you don't, then please get to know me.  so yeah come on and uh keep watching.  i'll gonna try and post as much as i can and you came here because of what am i?  can i just say what am i?  i created this channel for me.  yeah what am i?  i created this channel for me.  what am i?  i created this channel for me and i will be eternally grateful.  so i've made an agreement with what am i that i'm going to create content exactly and i'm going to put content out to promote africa in a positive light And to show the real Africa.
