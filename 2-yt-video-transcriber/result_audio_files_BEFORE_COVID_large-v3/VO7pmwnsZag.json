            "text": "If you're from Orange County, California, then you've likely heard stories of the infamous Black Star Canyon.  If not, well, let me fill you in.  You see, growing up here, I would always hear these crazy myths and legends of all sorts of illicit activity that's happened in the canyon over the years.  Everything from hauntings to demonic activity and secret cult meetings.  Now, while it is true that there are actual recorded crimes that have happened in Black Star Canyon, they're really few and far between.  So, if you ask me, a lot of the myths and legends come from bored Orange County housewives with nothing better to do.  Okay, that's probably not true at all. ",

            "text": "The trailhead to Black Star Canyon is located about 18 miles east of downtown Santa Ana, just off the 241 toll road between the unincorporated communities of Santiago Canyon and Silverado.  Shortly after beginning, you can decide to take the easier and more popular 6.8 mile round trip hike to Black Star Canyon Falls, or if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, the more strenuous 15.4 mile round trip hike to Beaks Place.  This weekend, I opted for the latter, and two days later, my knees and feet are still paying the price.  The trail follows an unmaintained county easement road called Black Star Canyon Road to the top of the Santa Ana Mountains.  Along the way, I couldn't help but recall the story of a purported Native American massacre that occurred in the canyon in the 1830s.  Now the details vary depending on where you get your information, but legend has it that Californios living near what is now Black Star Canyon contracted the services of fur trappers to hunt down a band of Shoshone horse thieves.  Some versions claim that the Shoshone were stealing the horses to eat them, but all of the stories end with the fur trappers overwhelming and gunning down the Native Americans deep within the canyon.  if true then this would have been one of the largest indian massacres to have occurred in southern california's history.  however without concrete proof the legend will have to remain just that a legend.  What is true is that Black Star Canyon was named after the Black Star Coal Mining Company, which mined coal deposits in the canyon from 1879 until the early 1900s.  Black Star Canyon Road ends at the top of the Santa Ana Mountains that separate Orange County from Riverside County.  It is here where you will find the remains of two stone cabins built by Joseph Beek in the 1930s.  to this day beak was the longest serving secretary of the california state senate.  in addition he also served as the newport harbor master and established the balboa island ferry which is still privately owned by his three sons.  to-day If you're in the Orange County area, I highly recommend checking out Black Star Canyon.  It's a beautiful hike that can be enjoyed all year round.  Before you go, please leave a comment down below letting me know your favorite hiking trails in Orange County.  Thanks for stopping by, and remember to never stop exploring! ",
