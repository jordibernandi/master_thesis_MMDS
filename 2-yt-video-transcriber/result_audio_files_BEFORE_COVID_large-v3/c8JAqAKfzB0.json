            "text": "Now, ten years ago, darker peoples everywhere and their friends was rejoicing because of the liberation of Africa.  The United Nations declared 1960 the Year of Africa because so many independent African states joined that body that year.  And joyous independent celebrations were held throughout Africa.  Then in May 1963 at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia came the first great African summit conference.  I was there.  It was a magnificent pageantry of color and eloquence and passionate speeches.  We hailed the organization of the African Unity.  The Charter of African Unity was signed there.  And we wrote about it, how wonderful it was.  I was one of the many people who wrote about how wonderful this was.  I know now that much that happened at that summit conference was really very foolish and very naive.  Why do I say that?  For how sensible was it to stand up and proclaim our intentions to the world of imperialists, colonialists, neocolonialists, plunderers and thieves when we did not have the power to rebuild Africa in our modern world.  We boasted at that conference of an independent, united Africa, a strong, bountiful Africa.  We told of the marvelous resources of this continent, of how we were going to take them and use them for the development of our own people, how we were going to be able to invite the children of Africa, wherever they were, to come back and share in the riches of this very, very rich continent, beautiful continent.  We got up there and told all of our plans.  And before the ink on that charter was dry, the enemies of Africa had united to bring us down.  And in a short time, wave after wave of coup d'etats swept across the continent.  And country after country fell under the man's hammer.  Imperialists, neocolonialists, call them what you will, whether they come from west or east or north or south, they are the same greedy exploiters.  Had my generation learned so much, that we thought we would liberate Africa by cooperating with the age-old exploiters of that continent, they who had grown fat and sleek and prosperous had no, never will have, and have not now any intention of retreating into their predominantly cold, gray fastness of their northwestern zones.  They love our African sunshine, our beautiful broad rivers, our bright gold, our sparkling diamonds, our copper, magnesia, bauxite, and oil.  They do not love Africans or the children of Africa, wherever they are. ",
