            "text": "Something absolutely huge has happened that will affect your freedom and prosperity in the future.  I think that everybody really needs to pay attention to what's going on here.  This article that came out on July 8th, China's central bank developing its own digital currency in response to Libra.  If you haven't paid attention, Libra is a cryptocurrency that Facebook intends on coming out with.  And you'll see the importance of this event.  Back in 2007, I think it was, I started telling people that before the end of the decade that we're in now, that the world will probably have a new monetary system.  Well, I might be wrong.  It might not be by the final day of 2020.  It might be by 2021, 2022, 2023.  But we're coming up to a shift in the global monetary system.  I'll get to all of that in a minute.  But let me show you how important this is and what the impact has been.  So they're developing their own digital currency system in response to Facebook's Libra because it could pose a risk to the country's financial system.  Now, this is China.  It poses a risk to China's financial system.  So the director of the People's Bank of China Research Bureau says that you know if it's widely used for cross-border payments and so on yeah and could function like money.  it could have a large influence on monetary policy financial stability and the international monetary system.  now that's what I've been talking about for years.  I knew that there was a new monetary system coming that the one that we're currently on the global dollar standard.  it's been developing stress cracks now for more than a decade and it's happening faster and faster, and I know that this is going to fall apart, and there will be a new monetary system, but there's going to be some chaos and possibly war.  A lot of times war accompanies the shifts in the world monetary system.  It happened three times during the last century where the monetary system changed.  But if you look at some of this wording here, if the digital currency is closely associated to the U.S.  dollar, it could create a scenario under which sovereign currencies, so the independence of their own countries, would coexist with U.S.  dollar-centric digital currencies.  But there would be, in essence, one boss.  That is the US dollar and the United States.  Now, all of these countries have really started to hate the global dollar standard because we've been weaponizing the dollar.  And if somebody does something we don't like, we freeze them out of the global monetary system because it used to be that the entire monetary system of the world, when one country would send funds to another country, even if it was a private business, you would convert it into US dollars, send the US dollars, and then it would get converted into the local currency there.  the result is that more than half of all the currency on the planet was u s dollars and more than half of those dollars resided outside the united states.  if so it would bring a series of economic financial and even international political consequences.  Continuing on, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency faces more backlash.  This was a huge announcement when they announced this last month.  I'm busy writing my book, so I didn't make a video on it.  But things are starting to get hot when it comes to this.  The Indian government, it's the third largest economy in Asia, is considering not allowing the currency to be traded.  And in April of 2018, all entities regulated by the Reserve Bank of India were banned from dealing in cryptocurrencies and virtual coins, although individuals trading currencies like Bitcoin remains legal.  However, last month it was reported that the Indian government is working on a draft of laws that would propose a jail sentence for any crypto users.  And this is the backlash from the Libra announcement.  This is very dangerous.  We're getting to the point where there is this choice of freedom or enslavement, and the actions that we take are going to determine that.  Now, I urge everybody to watch this video by Andreas Antonopoulos.  I interviewed him for Episode 8 of Hidden Secrets of Money.  I've met him a couple of times.  This is fascinating.  And he did this the day after their announcement.  So he was like right on top of things.  It's a very, very in-depth, good video at where the world monetary system is going, but the monetary system is going to change, and it's going to change very rapidly, and that change is going to make some people poor, it's going to make some people rich, it's going to enslave a certain class of people, and it's going to free another class of people.  Now, how many people achieve freedom depends on what our own personal choices are.  I also urge you to watch Episode 8 of Hidden Secrets of Money if you haven't.  If you already did, you might want to do a refresher on it.  It'll let you know how important this technology is.  In the beginning of the episode, I say that mankind stands at a crossroads and the path that humanity chooses will have more impact on our freedom and prosperity than any event in mankind.  And we're standing at this crossroads where distributed ledger technology that was introduced by Bitcoin in 2008, this is going to have, it's going to touch the lives of every person on the planet without exception.  At first, it's going to be things where you're interacting on the internet.  You're going to be interacting on a website and you won't know that you're actually interacting with a blockchain or hashgraph or some other form of distributed ledger, but it's going to be a distributed ledger.  But as this evolves, if you use power, if you drive and you use the traffic grid, if you use water, all the distribution of these things and the control of these things are going to be done on distributed ledger.  And if you eat food, if you're a person that eats food, that food will be going through a distributed ledger process when it's all tracked and shipped from the farm to the stores.  Everything that happens to it and all of the accounting of all of the business, this is all going to be connected with distributed ledger technology.  It really is this important.  Now here's Libra's website.  So it's part of Facebook.  They're introducing this wallet.  So you just download a little app from the app store and if you've got a Facebook account, you can then use this currency.  You can buy some of this currency.  You can store value on it.  You can send currency to anybody that has this app and you can receive currency from them.  So it's a great idea, and this idea has existed for a long time.  Facebook has just stolen this portion from some people, this portion from another people.  Part of what they stole was from Hedera Hashgraph.  They stole some of their governance models and a few other things, and so Hashgraph took out this ad in the Wall Street Journal, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  Now, Facebook may have ulterior motives, and if you watch that video that I said to watch by Andreas Antonopoulos, you'll see that he talks in there about, you know, every once in a while you get an update on the terms and conditions of your use of something, whether it's from Apple or Google or Facebook.  You have to agree with the terms and conditions before you can use it.  Nobody ever reads that thing, and if it's a really long legal mumbo-jumbo, you're going to just accept the terms and be using something where you've just given them the right to sort of control and look at your finances, look at your spending habits, and you just become more of a product of Facebook.  Now, the world population is a little over seven and a half billion people.  Facebook has 2.38 billion users.  The US only has 327.2 million people in it.  So the percentage of Facebook users is almost a third of the global population, almost a third of the people on the planet.  interact with Facebook.  The US population is only 4.3%.  So the people that are familiar with using dollars in day-to-day transactions, all of the people, you know, when you go shopping in the United States, when you take a cab and you pay with dollars, that's 4.3% of the population.  Facebook is introducing a currency to a third of the population of the world.  This is really huge.  It's a giant attack on the current monetary system.  I've been giving a presentation for more than a decade on the death of the global dollar stand.  Now, the importance of this to show that we're getting toward the cracks in the global monetary system, how important this is.  It's a huge crack.  This is the beginning of the dam bursting.  You know, when I was a kid, there was a big flood in Los Angeles when the Baldwin Hills Dam broke.  And the floodwaters, we drove through the area afterward, and you could see not that many people died amazingly.  But you could see mud 14 feet up on apartment buildings and stuff.  You could see on the news, you saw pictures of homes floating down a hill on this torrent of water.  It was just amazing.  Well, That crack opened up in the dam hours and hours and hours before and it was reported and nobody took it seriously.  and it got bigger and people started calling in and when they finally went out to inspect it, it was too late.  There was nothing that could be done.  All they could do was watch the slow collapse of the dam and then the sudden bursting of the dam.  So here is a letter from the United States House of Representatives Committee on Finance Services, and it's to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and so on.  And Facebook and its partners, they want them to immediately agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on Libra.  This is the U.S.  government that is shaking in its boots because of this.  And the wallet, the proposed wallet, Calibra, which is interesting.  It looks like they may have taken California and Libra.  And by the way, that video from Andreas Antonopoulos, it's Libra, not Libra.  Libra, L-I-B-R-E.  It's short for freedom.  It's short for liberty.  And that's the title of his video, Libra, Not Libra.  and its proposed digital wallet.  It appears that the products could lead themselves to an entirely new global financial system that is based out of Switzerland, intended to rival the U.S.  monetary policy and the dollar.  This raises serious privacy, trading, and national security issues.  National security.  They're putting that right in here.  that this is a threat to the global monetary system and monetary policies and concerns, not only because of their 2 billion users, but it goes on.  It's worth reading these things and trying to read between the lines.  because they've already got people signed on board like MasterCard, PayPal, Visa, and Uber, Lyft, Spotify.  A whole bunch of big companies are signed on board ready so that you can download this app, their wallet, and use Facebook's currency to take Uber, Lyft, you know, Airbnb is already on.  There's a whole bunch of companies.  already on board with this.  so this is a a huge huge thing that has happened uh... and it is a crack in the?  u s global dollar standard.  it's a nail in the coffin and i've been giving present.  you know years and years ago when i was writing my book back in i think two thousand six or two thousand seven i stumbled across this.  i was researching all of the different uh... monetary systems that the world is actually.  I'm a believer in cycles.  I was trying to find waves and cycles, and so I put every financial crisis, every series of bank runs, and every change in the monetary system, because I was researching the monetary systems to write those chapters in my book.  And back then, nobody had put together an entire history showing that every 30 to 40 years, the world has had a brand new monetary system.  and so i stumbled across this and i started uh... talking about it in my appearances and then i started giving lectures on it.  this one uh... was posted it back in twenty thirteen but it's actually from a presentation i gave back in twenty uh... ten.  i'm pretty darn certain that i am the very first person that ever started talking about the death of the global dollar standard and saying that it was coming and back in in two thousand nine.  I was saying that there would be a brand new monetary system before the end of this decade, which this decade that we're in right now ends December 2020, the last day of December in 2020.  So here you can see the different monetary systems in this, and this one says 39 years plus, and that is 39 years from 1971.  In other words, 2010, that's when I was giving this presentation.  So watch this presentation.  It's 140 years of monetary history in just 10 minutes.  So it's only 10 minutes of your time.  If you've already watched it, it's worth reviewing because I didn't know what this would look like.  I didn't know what the next monetary system would be.  or how the stress cracks would develop.  I just knew without a doubt that this was coming, that there was going to be this change, that it was going to affect everybody on the planet, and that everybody needs to start getting ready for this.  If you don't prepare, you're going to be on the losing end of this shift in global monetary system because it is coming, and it's coming at us like a freight train.  So watch this, watch those other videos.  We're going to put the links to them below this video.  And that's the end of part one.  I'm going to do a little addendum where I cover a very old presentation that I gave many years ago that was never recorded on video.  So protect yourselves.  Get ready for this.  It's going to be scary, but it's going to also be very exciting.  And you know, if you can figure out in advance what's going to happen and you get ready for it, there is a tremendous wealth transfer that will take place during this event.  A lot of assets are going to be going down.  A lot of assets are going to be going up.  And that is a wealth transfer because if you're in the assets that are going up, When you decide to sell those ones that were going down against whatever you're in that's going up, when you sell, you can buy a whole lot more.  They're like on sale at pennies on the dollar.  That's what a wealth transfer looks like.  It's not somebody specifically transferring their wealth to you by like writing you a check or giving you cash.  It's invisible.  You can only see it if you know what to look for and you get prepared.  Thank you very much.  I'm Mike Maloney.
