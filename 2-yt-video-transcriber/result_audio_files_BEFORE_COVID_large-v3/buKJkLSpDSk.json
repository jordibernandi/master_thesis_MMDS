On that basis, any country in the world could ban, say, Apple's iPhone or our American-made Androids.  Why?  Because think about it.  We know that these companies are giving a backdoor to the NSA.  That's been revealed.  They cooperate with the intelligence agencies all the time.  It's been revealed that not only have they cooperated with intelligence agencies, but the USA has actually violated treaties and spied on UN missions in cooperation with these tech companies.  So it's kind of absurd.  We all know that American tech giants... are very, very close to the intelligence agencies, to the Pentagon, but yet we expect Chinese companies to be a thousand miles away from the government.  That's a double standard.  It's pretty ridiculous. ",

The United States leaders kind of have it in their head that somehow that they're going to twist the arms of countries around the world and tell them not to buy phones from Huawei or ZTE or other corporations.  But that's not how the world market works.  If you want to do better, you should make a better product.  And the craziest thing.  is that Huawei has actually been reaching out to American tech giants like AT&T and Verizon.  And they've actually been trying to get together strategic partnerships so that they can work together and help the American tech giants make better phones as well.  But because of political pressure, now those strategic agreements are being canceled left and right.  This is really ridiculous.  It's a lot like how we've been trying to tell European countries that they can't buy natural gas from Russia.  That's not how the world market works.  If you want to do better, make a better product.  This is really, really absurd.  The Chinese corporations want to cooperate with the American economy, but we seem determined to twist people's arms, force them off the market, and shut them down. ",
