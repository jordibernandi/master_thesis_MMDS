            "text": "What's up everybody?  Happy Tuesday.  Wanted to hop on here and just say hey to my channel family.  And man, I'm on my lunch break right now and I'm just feeling really scatterbrained.  I feel like there's so much to do.  I'm just feeling really overwhelmed.  So I decided to take my break and hop on here and just talk to you guys for a minute.  And you know, all this rapture talk, let's just not talk about it for a second, okay?  I want to talk about something else today.  And I wanted to ask you guys a question.  Do you, I don't care who's watching this right now, whether you're saved.  I'm sure that there will be people who watch this and maybe you don't know what to think.  Maybe you're an unbeliever.  Maybe you're waiting for a sign.  Maybe, I just want to tell you something.  Do you know how much Jesus loves you?  And I know that we've always heard, you know, Jesus loves us.  Jesus loves us.  But do you really even, do you even really know how much he loves you?  Can you even fathom?  I mean, do you really know how madly in love your God is for you?  Like, do you, do you really have an understanding at all?  Because I promise you, if you truly understood, and you know, I can't even fathom the amount of love that he has for us.  But if we could, I think that we would feel a little more worthy.  I feel like we would stand a little taller.  I feel like we would keep our heads a little higher.  I want you to know right now that Jesus loves you.  so so so much.  whoever you are whatever situation you're in right now whatever you're dealing with whatever you're going through whatever sins you keep Doing over and over and over again I want you to know that if you feel like that you're stuck.  if you feel like there's just absolutely no way out.  I want you to know that he wants to wants to release you from that.  and I want you to know that If you don't know what to think, if you don't know what to believe, cry out to him.  Whatever situation that you're in right now, cry out.  You know, at the end of the day, Jesus wants to have a relationship with you.  It's not about religion.  It's not about, you know... You have to do this and you have to do that and you have to live up to these expectations and hopefully you'll make it.  No, Jesus says, accept me into your heart.  Seek me, truly seek me and you'll find me.  I will reveal myself to you and I want to deliver you from all this evil and all this bad.  I loved you so much that I created a way out for you.  I didn't want to see you perish.  So I came down from this perfect life.  I came down in all my glory and I wrapped myself in flesh and I died for your sins so that you didn't have to go to hell.  I loved you that much.  I was thinking of you on that cross when I died for you.  I bared all of your sins so that you don't have to bear them.  I want to deliver you from your sins.  Accept me into your heart.  Let me show you that I'm real.  Give me a chance.  Open your heart to me.  I'm right here.  Reach your hand out and grab mine and I will change your life for the better.  I wanna make it all okay.  I don't want to see you suffer in hell for eternity.  I love you so much.  I want a relationship with you.  I want you to know that you can call out to me Whatever you're going through, I will make it okay.  But you have to accept me.  I will reveal myself to you, but you have to accept me.  That is what he is telling you guys.  So everybody, we're sitting here going back and forth arguing about who's right and who's wrong.  Well, the Bible says this.  Just stop.  And if you don't know what to believe... Call out to him, guys, because that is what he's been waiting on.  And if you feel like you're not worthy enough, you feel like you can't get out of this sin, you feel like you're dealing with porn or depression or anxiety or fear or anger or alcohol or drugs, call out to him with a genuine heart and say, take it off of me, Lord.  I can't deal with it anymore.  Call out.  He might not deliver you the first day, but let me tell you something guys, I'm not going to go into detail, but I was dealing with something in my life a couple of years ago I could not get delivered from.  And every time I would feel condemned, condemned, condemned, And I felt the conviction and I cried out to him, God, I can't, I can't let it go.  Take it from me.  And one day guys, I promise you delivered completely delivered.  So whatever you're going through, whatever you're dealing with, he will take it away from you.  He will make it all okay.  He will make your life new.  He will change you from the inside out.  He will change your heart.  He will change your desires.  And if, like I said, if you don't know what to believe, cry out to him and say, Lord, I'm a sinner in need of a savior.  I'm reaching out to you right now because I don't know if you're there.  And he will show up.  Have faith.  Believe.  Guys, we go one or two places when this life is over.  And we're not guaranteed our next breath.  We don't even know if we're going to have the chance to die before he comes back.  He may come back within a couple hours.  We know we're in the season.  He's coming.  But if you're not guaranteed your next breath tomorrow, and you were to die, and you don't know where you would end up, cry out to him.  Because the truth is, if you don't accept him into your heart, his free gift, he doesn't say, accept me, well, and, you know, he says, accept me, believe on me, and I will give you everlasting life.  Somebody who loves you that much, somebody who literally died for you.  Do you know anybody else in your life who died for you, who would do that?  I don't know anybody else who died for me and thought of me.  while they were getting beaten and hung on a cross to die.  The most gruesome, the Bible doesn't even do it justice, guys.  We serve a God who is real and who loves you.  He wants a relationship with you.  So, talk to him when you're alone.  Move the stuff out of your passenger seat and say, Jesus, come ride with me, let's talk.  If you don't have anybody sitting in your bed with you tonight, Move this stuff off of the side of the other bed.  Or, you know what I'm saying.  And say, Lord, come sit with me.  Come watch TV.  Let's just talk for a second.  Talk to him.  He will reveal himself to you.  I love you guys.  I'm going to go get something to eat.  I'm hungry.  It's raining.  Talk to you guys later. ",
