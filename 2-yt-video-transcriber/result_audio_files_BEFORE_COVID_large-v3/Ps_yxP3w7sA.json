            "text": "Hi, I'm sure you've heard everything possible on the Trudeau blackface thing, but I have to add my two cents because I'm angry at some conservatives reaction to the whole thing.  I've seen a few conservative pundits say that Trudeau is clearly not a racist.  He's the most progressive prime minister in history.  I've never seen proof of his racism.  just as love for immigrants, and the right needs to stop using the left's cancel culture and stop the insanity.  Um, excuse me?  Speak for yourself.  Let me remind you, we are in a war with these people.  They are the enemy.  Trudeau and his progressive agenda that is killing jobs, killing pipelines, Flooding our country with insane levels of immigration, giving billions of our tax dollars to the third world, and shoving non-stop social justice garbage down our throats is not a guy I feel inclined to stick up for in a moment of weakness.  There will be no coming together with people that believe in Trudeau's vision, let alone the guy implementing it.  Trudeau has expressed his disdain at average Canadians on several occasions.  Why would I give this guy the benefit of the doubt?  Do you think for a second if Shearer or Bernier were caught in blackface one time, let alone three or possibly more, that Trudeau, his party, and his devout cult-like followers would say, let's think of the other side for a second, or let's take the high road?  Nope.  They wouldn't just be calling for their resignations, but their heads to be chopped off in the public square, committing the ultimate leftist sin of racism.  Leftists want to ruin your life over accusations of racism.  They come after your livelihoods and your family.  Look at what they did to Megyn Kelly in the US when she just briefly mentioned that blackface wasn't that big of a deal.  They fired her despite having to pay her millions to get her out of her contract.  So why would we ever give the Prime Minister, with an election just a few weeks away, a pass for something that's a clear violation of leftist law?  Hey, I didn't write the rules, but it's time for Trudeau to die on his progressive sword.  I will make it clear, I don't care about blackface.  At all.  But that's irrelevant to the situation.  What I care about is the blatant hypocrisy of Trudeau.  You're not allowed to be the progressive king, morally preaching, virtue signaling, and sneering at regular Canadians, including insinuating they're racist, and then get caught in blackface.  I don't care how long ago it was.  He was 29.  If you're gonna act like an elitist goof, preaching about how great you are, you better be squeaky clean.  And we all know how Trudeau weaponizes words.  He called Andrew Scheer a white supremacist earlier this year because he was in the same vicinity as Faith Goldie at a yellow vest protest in Ottawa.  This coming from a prime minister who wears blackface.  He grew up in a wealthy white neighborhood with white parents, went to white schools, married a white woman, and had white kids.  Sorry dude, but playing by the left's rules, it's you Trudeau who is the white supremacist.  The reason I tell people to never back off of attacking Trudeau is also because this guy will stop at nothing to blame regular Canadians for his mistakes.  He's a total narcissist who projects bad behavior onto others.  Case in point.  At a recent presser, Trudeau connected his blackface scandal to Canada's issues with systemic racism.  Listen to what he says. ",

            "text": "I think we all need to recognize that even in an incredible country like Canada, there's still a lot of more work to do.  People are still facing discrimination and marginalization every single day.  Anti-black racism, unconscious bias, systemic discrimination, they still exist.  Systemic discrimination still exists. ",

            "text": "What do you mean we all need to recognize?  Um, we didn't get caught wearing blackface, Trudeau.  You did.  This sounds an awful lot like that time he told us Canadians we needed to do better.  when it was discovered he had groped a female reporter.  Oh yes, our feminist in chief PM is also a pervert.  Who do you think he's accusing when he says Canadians are guilty of anti-black racism, unconscious bias, systemic discrimination, and the like?  That would be white Canadians.  So once again, he's accusing white Canadians of horrible things, including the charge of racism.  So let's get this straight.  The leader of our nation was caught wearing blackface.  He then lied about how many times he wore it.  And then he said he wore blackface so often that he has no idea how many times it was.  All of this, of course, breaks the progressive rules because in their minds, blackface is the worst form of evil racism.  Trudeau then proceeds to blame Canadians, white Canadians, for a slew of racial injustices after he's caught this.  This is why you attack Trudeau ruthlessly.  And remember to vote this motherfucker out in October. ",
