He said, but the actual strike on the tankers and on the drone was done by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard itself. ",

He actually gives me the information.  I found it.  I was able to confirm it.  Bolton and Rubio Giuliani have been on the payroll, not payroll per se, but have been paid for speaking at the Mujahideen camp in Iraq.  And he gave me the information.  He said, Steve, he says, look, he says, we hate the Iranian government.  He said, but we hate the Mujahideen worse than we hate the Iranians.  the Iranian government, he said, because they turned on our people and killed a lot of our people.  He said, so we don't like the government, but we don't like them even worse.  And then he gave me the information about how evil and crooked this organization is.  It's really, really bad, which I'm doing a news on it right now on that part. ",

He said, in 2009, the height of the tension between the U.S.  and Iran, it came to a point that the U.S.  airstrikes and attacks seemed imminent.  The leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in their interviews tried to sound confident, but you could feel a sense of resignation and hopelessness in their statement.  This time around, there's nothing but confidence.  I believe what played down in Syria, where the U.S.  was using the best Arab fighters seasoned from Afghan war, combined with U.S.  reconnaissance, weaponry, air support, He even says in here, Brother Paul, that we were using ISIS and al-Nusra.  Al-Nusra I knew we were.  And I knew about ISIS, but nobody ever wants to believe it.  But he says the Iranian Revolutionary Guard came out on top, and this is the reason for their self-belief or their self-confidence.  He said, I believe Iran has just showed a bit of what it can do.  The drones penetrated over 1,050 kilometers into Saudi Arabia and hit seven spots, And they hit the stations.  They showed they can close Bab al-Madad and don't need to close the Strait of Hormuz. ",
