            "text": "Well, howdy there internet people.  It's Beau again.  So tonight we got a message straight to the Republican party.  See, I don't know if you guys know this, but in my entire life, I've only gotten out and supported one Democratic candidate.  One.  He was running for County Sheriff and had been personally known to my family since him and my great grandfather ran Shine together.  One.  But I'm not a Republican.  See, I am that t-shirt, blue jeans, and work boot wearing, truck driving, white heterosexual male that lives in the rural area of a swing state.  I'm the GOP's target demographic.  So what you got on the platform for me?  I, like most Americans, know that free trade is good and trickle-down economics doesn't work.  So your economic platform's out.  I don't think the 19-year-old kid from down the road who just signed up should have to go fight for the Saudis.  I don't think we should be arming the Saudis.  I don't think we should be allied with the Saudis.  I don't even know why we're doing this anymore.  We're a net exporter.  I certainly don't think that come next fall I should see a gold star in front of his parents' house because you guys want to increase your stock portfolios.  I'm not a gun owner, but the Second Amendment is an important right, and you guys, at least in rhetoric, have always been able to be counted on to defend that.  But now you've got that guy in the Oval Office who's enacted more restrictions on firearms in two or three years than Obama did in eight.  And y'all had the chance to get rid of him, but you canceled the primaries.  That's you cosigning everything that he does.  while his Attorney General wanders around Capitol Hill talking to you guys, asking y'all what kind of gun control you're going to support.  Okay.  What else you do?  Approve projects without the funds to complete it, like that criminal justice reform bill or that stupid wall, and then you take the money from DOD, making that gold star in front of his parents' house a whole lot more likely.  That's 30 to 40 percent of your platform right there.  Nothing in it for me.  And the other 60 to 70%, I can answer that in one sentence.  I don't care about somebody's skin tone, country of origin, religion, gender, orientation, or the language they speak.  I'm not a bigot.  I don't care.  If they're a good person, more power to them.  I don't care.  And that takes out the other 60 to 70% of your platform.  I know what you're thinking.  Is this the guy that called into C-SPAN?  No, and that should worry you.  Because you've always been able to count on guys like us.  The reality is now, there's a whole bunch of guys that look like me, sound like me, real sick of you.  No, we certainly don't believe all of the things that AOC and the squad believe.  But I believe they believe it.  It's more than I can say for you.  Anyway, it's just a thought.  Y'all have a good night. ",
