We only get the information from the government and the mainstream media, and those are the two things you can never trust with information.  So we're like, well, I guess we have to go and check this out and see if it's even real.  For all we know, there might not be anything there.  It's always lies what they tell us.  And for all we know, there could still be some activity going on there.  Maybe Bill Clinton's there.  Maybe Jeffrey Epstein's there.  No one's looking into this.  So we took it upon ourselves to, well, let's do it.  But it wasn't easy.  Most captains said they wouldn't take us to the island.  There's all kinds of different countries on different islands.  So we had to work our way around that and make sure we weren't doing too many illegal things all at once.  And, yeah, just rolling up to the island and actually seeing that temple, which is there, so we have verified that.  This is a lot of verification of what is actually there.  It was pretty surreal.

This is a man that literally, when he was finally, finally put to court, was given a slap on the wrist by someone who was previously working inside of Trump's administration.  that somehow was connected, again, interconnected of Jeffrey Epstein is just absolutely mind-boggling.  I mean, we're talking about billionaires, leaders, bankers, the most influential people who were on that island, and there was really no one else to verify it.  All I've really seen from independent media is a guy who is anonymous or a girl who is anonymous that is flying drones over the island and just documenting what is there.  So being in the area, I'm like, we have to see what's going on here because there was other drone footage showing that there was stuff moved before the U.S.  federal government came in.  And then as we know, the U.S.  federal government, the federal authorities can't be trusted here.  For over a decade, they let Jeffrey Epstein go on and be totally free.  He not only had a private wing of his own jail cell, he was able to leave during the day.  He was supposed to check in with parole officers that he never did check in.  But even the journey here of trying to find a boat, we were able to find out some other information about how this wasn't even that big of secret on this island at all. ",

It's just like when we go to Bilderberg, right?  The mainstream media doesn't cover any of that stuff.  They don't cover, oh, because we knew about this.  I know we were talking about this for years about Epstein Island.  We were talking about it before everyone heard about it in the mainstream news.  And we're talking about how Bill Clinton's going there and Prince Andrew's going there.  And no one is, it's really, it was just like so out in the open.  They were so brazen.  That they're like, well, no one can arrest us.  We're involved with all the people who would arrest us.  So rolling up to the island was pretty surreal.  And we did not know what to expect.  Because no one had ever done this before.  So we didn't know if there was going to be 100 DE agents, FBI agents, all armed.  We didn't know if there was anyone on the island.

We were kind of bickering with each other like, come on, we got to do this.  And then what ended up happening is this random last minute the captain who said he wasn't going to.  He said he was like, yeah, I'm not getting my boat seized.  I'm not getting in trouble But last minute we were just going around the island.  I was like, let's go around island.

Let's be quiet.  Let's traverse this.  And we traversed a large part of the island.  We didn't get to see everything.  We kind of stayed out of the fray.  I was always looking, always paranoid.  At first, we thought no one was there because there was no kind of signs there.  But pulling up, I was always a little bit skeptical because the grass was kind of taken care of.  We also looked at the pool and we're like, the pool's also taken care of, so there's people there.  And it's important to understand here is that this independent anonymous drone operator who's afraid to release his identity, who's flying the drones over there, captured Epstein's Island with particular items in there that were swept between the federal government coming in.  And with the federal government and their investigations not trustworthy, this is why we went in there to try to take a look at everything.  And I looked at everything.  I looked at every garbage pallet.  I went into the ambulance.  I checked into briefcases that were in the dumpster.  I made sure that there was no stone unturned.  I remember there was a lot of people talking about the possibility of tunnels there.  Sadly, we were not there for a long time.  We were there for about a half an hour traversing a lot of landscape.

So we went up and we checked and yeah, it's just a flat wall.  The door is painted on.  And I have to say about the temple, you know, he was a billionaire.  I say was, he's probably still alive, but he is or was a billionaire.  That seemed like the cheapest little temple I've ever seen.  Like, why would you just paint?  Like I could have built that myself for about 5,000 bucks, I think.  And the dome flew off, and there was no hole underneath the dome, which is what you would have if you had a true dome.

I also found a chair that was completely made out of horns and looked like some kind of animal hide that was very creepy and kind of very weird to look at.  But other than that, we weren't really that successful because as we're going through our little mission, We're like, okay, the pool is taken care of.  There's someone here.  We got to be quieter.  You know, luckily, somehow I got service.  And our good friend, Joby Weeks, called me.  He was like, dude, there's a lot of people.  There's people running all over.  We just heard screaming.  Are you okay?  There's people going around in golf carts.  Like, get out, get out, get out.  And I'm like... crap like like.  yeah this is not you know.  so this is something that has a lot of serious implications.  there's a reason the guy who flies the drone around the island is anonymous.  there's a reason you know epstein was able to evade any kind of justice for his horrible acts for decades and decades.  uh there's a reason why this case is so significant and yet the mainstream media just totally threw it out of the news cycle.  i mean this is crazy.  this is absolutely crazy.  And we were there, we were also there at the helicopter pad, and it was even reported previously before that Epstein would just get on his private jet, land at the St.  Thomas airport, take a helicopter over so no one else would see him to do other things.  There was air traffic control that actually came out and whistle-blowed and said that he saw many small children going onto the helicopter, going onto the private jet.  You know, the severity of this case is still widely unknown.  We still don't know so many significant parts of this story.  And the story is just erased from the mainstream media.  No, the story can't be erased.  The story can't be ignored.  And it can't be ignored only if we start paying attention to it and start sharing.  You know, the fact that this is still an open case, this is still a case that has a lot of serious implications where we have royalty like Prince Andrew in the United Kingdom that are still running about free to do whatever horrible acts that they want to do.  And again, the implications here, the allegations here are so, so severe.  And it's just insane.  I mean, even talking to that guy yesterday, he was like, yeah, the whole island knew.  Everyone knew what was going on here.  If you know about these really sinister acts happening, like, holy cow. ",

It's more Luke than me.  I'm not really a journalist, so to speak, but Luke is.  And, you know, he gets no support.  There's no pharmaceutical company who's going to sponsor his things, and he wouldn't let them anyway.  So, you know, just support these sort of channels.  At least hit the like button.  At least hit the share.  And actually, you might want to download this and maybe put it on other channels because I'll be surprised if this stays up. ",

Like, if I'm on that boat, if I'm on Jeffrey Epstein Island by myself, I would not be going as far looking and trying to investigate everything I could be because it's absolutely terrifying.  So I want to thank Jeff Berwick, the dollar vigilante.  Check out his YouTube channel.  Check out Anarchapoco, a great way to meet other like-minded freedom-evoking individuals who want to promote liberty, who want to promote freedom.  And if you want to find out about that, just go to anarchapoco.com.  A great event happening in February.  A lot of surprise speakers that we can't even talk about right now that you told me.  And I'm like, whoa, this is definitely going to be worth coming out to.  Use the promo code WRC to get 10% or 20% off your ticket.  Still not sure the exact amount, but you'll get a discount just by using the promo code WRC.  And I hope to see all of you amazing human beings in Acapulco, at Anarchapulco, with a more freedom, anarchy kind of mindset with your fellow brothers and sisters.  Thank you again so much for watching.  Stay tuned for more here on wearechange.org.  Jeff!  There's people on golf carts!  Get the fuck.  to the side!  To the side!  Jeff, to the side!  To the side!
