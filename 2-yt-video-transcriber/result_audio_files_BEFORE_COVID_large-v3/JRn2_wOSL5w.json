            "text": "Here is your latest Africa news update.  ECOWAS, the economic community for West African states, have adopted a new single currency named the ECO, which is planned to be launched next year.  As part of its plan to make Africa a more integrated continent, leaders of ECOWAS adopted the name ECO for a planned single currency to be used in the region.  The ECHO was adopted in Abuja in a meeting of the 15-member country regional bloc.  ECHO was set up in 1975 and comprises of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo, representing a total population of almost 400 million Africans.  Discussed for 30 years, this single currency between 15 countries is seen as a strong political statement in the world, and especially France.  This is because eight of the ECOWAS countries, Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, and Senegal, currently use the CFA franc.  They are moored by a single European currency and are gathered into an organization called the West African Monetary Union, or WAMU.  The ECO is supposed to boost economic development in the West African region and improve cross-border trade.  If implemented, countries across the region will be able to move and spend money across different countries without worrying about the exchange rates and costs, says economic analysts.
