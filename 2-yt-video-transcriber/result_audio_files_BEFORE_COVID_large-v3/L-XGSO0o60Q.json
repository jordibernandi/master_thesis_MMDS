            "text": "Remember, as I have told you before, you have no idea of the reality of God, Alien Space Brothers, or in fact, your own projection into this play.  I, for instance, can give you in detail the difference in my command and that which is generally recognized as Ashtar's command.  Why is there difference?  Why are there different races and species on your planet?  Ashtar itself is terminology, is a command, not a cute little space being.  There is a commander and for identification this commander is recognized by simply Ashtar.  I have almost nothing to do with that command.  It is a tremendously large brain, as in computer system.  Your closest thing to this system would be recognized as your computer system called the Beast.  Is Ashtar a beast?  Well, I guess sometimes, but that's beside the point.  His purpose is to tag every living being and wood at a time of necessary evacuation.  Have every living thing wiretapped for expedious removal or rejection.  Saint Peter?  Perhaps.  I suggest you stop your silly efforting to find secret mysticism in everything.  Example?  Jerusalem.  This is pure balderdash and a game of distraction.  What's in a name?  Anything you want to choose to be in a name.  What are we about these days, in early awakening, to understanding that in some of these comiches, even the perceived dark councils, sits what you call extraterrestrials?  I assure you that on at least one very, very important council sit at least two alien brothers who were present among your founding fathers.  Ah, indeed, they are old.  But when you are not concerned about age, the Expedius takes precedence over the observed generality.  So, who am I?  I am that which represents the hosts, or the wayshowers, of lighted grace, and expression, of goodly portent, intent, and perfection in these intentions.  This does not mean that the majority of the visitors are even goodly sports.  Most are not.  Therefore, a couple of goodly actions and all will be fine and dandy is not going to happen.  You will, however, be given the method way to transfer the basic structure into one of honor, integrity, and equality of acceptance as you move through the passages and activities.  God always provides the way, if man will but choose that particular passage.  Man has never shown any desire to achieve such perfection, so mostly the exercises become more earth-binding experiences, instead of learning truth, into knowing soul perfection.  Do I have the most clout?  Yes, but I and mine are not interferers or interventionalists.  We are here to see to our mission, bringing the word, the truth, and the light.  In other words, the actions of physical plane will be as man allows or structures it to be.  We will build places for remnant passage and lay a foundation of example and production and service while making available the transportation to necessary security of our people.  Anyone who wishes to become one of our people is certainly welcome to join us.  But you're not going to be able to tell by skin color, size, breed, or anything, who those are.  You had better best go look into the mirror and then consider your own actions, and you can discern pretty well if you are honest.  Pretending will not cut it longer, good buddies.  for it will be your sole intent that brings the final sorting, placement, and judgment of self as projected.  It is from within that the knowing of status is recognized, no matter where you are, who you are, or your purpose here.  If the response to the image is more excuses a new tale of lies to fool mankind so be it.  if you really believe the lies you had better take a really good hard look at self because simple brain function knows when you lie and when you speak.  truly i don't care which you are or do except as to how it affects my people.  You are most certainly welcome to deny me or my existence.  It is not my business as to what you think about me.  More important, what might I think about you?  So, to answer that one, basically, I don't think about you at all if you deny me.  Further, if you deny me before God and men, I will most certainly shall deny you before God.  Moreover, I shall allow the adversary to do that which he will with you.  This is usually a rather dastardly and mean evolvement of physically negative responses.  When we find ones who involve themselves deliberately and detrimentally within or against my people or against my mission or my people, I turn them over to those entities who function in such capacity of gamekeeper or warden.  What happens with those entities is a game, not my business.  Your church doctrines and teachers thereof have so lied to you that their own ignorance as to be amusing, if it were not so incredibly dastardly.  No, I do not expect a big liftoff or a rapture of any sort in transition into  glory.\".  I do expect a lot of physical deaths and ascension as recognized by souls' infinite ability to continue.  There are a lot of souls already departed through migration, both good and bad.  You are populated by millions of soulless beings experiencing a physical expression.  As to prophecies, I would say that there are as many possible endings to your play as there are ones of you.  However, the reason you can count on prophecies as written No matter how written, to be fulfilled is because the writers of the play are already in control, subject to possibilities of free will.  mankind, changing his mind.  There will not, however, be a mass turnabout of all mankind prior to depopulation of the planet and clearance of the numbers of inbred animal life.  How do you note animal versus sold human?  Sometimes you obviously can't.  However, you can look into that which breaks all laws of God and creation and discern pretty well who you would want to travel in your adjacent seat on the plane.  If he advocates illicit, illegal, and horrendous behavior while spreading deadly disease with every breath, you would not desire his presence as your mate now, would you?  Spouting unconditional love will not cut the mustard, my good friends.  That very spouting becomes the biggest lie of all and dirties the name and the terms goodness, love, and godliness.  God is loaded with conditions, and selection and discipline are ultimately His.  I am both amused and astounded that you would think that I, as commander of a mission, would be a sleazy wimp of some kind.  What makes ye think these stupid thoughts?  Ah, I thought so.  Those nice teachers who drain you of your assets while pointing at another and leading you through the tin rings through thy noses.  Tin?  Yes, for they take the gold and they let you blame others that ye have but sharp-edged tin bindings.  But you disagree?  Why?  How?  Who cares?  If you want not to do with me or mine, go thine way.  Where did you come by your perceptions?  Are they really built on truth and foundation?  Oh, you've read a thing or two and I have spoken.  You have even sat in on a meeting or two.  And you didn't like the discipline and unattachments of myself and my program?  I do not have a church or group, commune, or mystical game-playing bunch of acceptors at all idiotic costs?  I have a mission.  I will fulfill my mission, as will my team.  What good does it do you to go into groupies and deny, taunt, assault, and babble about those who choose to work in God's vineyards?  What gains you in this endeavor?  How dare you once speak in such total ignorance and lies, as I project around the nation?  Do you expect me to have no anger, no loss of patience?  Forget it, good brothers.  Not only do I respond in anger, but I am to the very point at this very moment when the sword of truth falls upon the necks of the liars and cheats.  It will be an interesting thing.  I do not protect those who deny me.  Creator can do that which He will, not me.  Men are given their opportunity to serve and change.  Never is it too late in hours to change.  But few change towards God only further away from Him.  I neither forced nor coerced any man, woman, or child to come into my proximity or ask them to serve in any way past that which they offered and volunteered.  Now, you anger because your volunteering is not suitable to you, or another claims your service to be somehow menial, better menial than not at all.  Ponder it.  These are words of Hatan from Phoenix Journal 95.  I am India in the Machine and I thank you for tuning in and tuning into the Phoenix Journals, the most important books of our time. ",
