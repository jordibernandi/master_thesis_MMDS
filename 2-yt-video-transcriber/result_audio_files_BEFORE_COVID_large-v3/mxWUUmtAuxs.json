            "text": "This article came out in the New York Times that was making waves on Twitter.  Only seven black students got into Stuyvesant, New York's most selective high school out of 895 spots.  So this, of course, started to really alarm people.  Even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got in on the action.  She tweeted out.  68% of all New York City public school students are black or Latino.  To only have seven black students accepted into Stuyvesant, a public high school, tells us that this is a system failure.  Education inequity is a major factor in the racial wealth gap.  This is what injustice looks like.  But is it?  Let's just dive into these stats a little bit more.  So seven out of 895, that does sound like a really alarming number.  And the number has been shrinking.  Last year, it was 13.  No, I'm sorry.  Last year, it was 10.  And the year before, it was 13 that were admitted.  But here's the thing.  Seventy four percent of the students at Stuyvesant are Asian-American.  And in fact, out of all of the elite public schools, because New York works on a two-tiered system, what they've got is a public school system with 600 public schools.  And then they've got, for high school, you can test into these elite high schools the same way you would test into college.  So you take an exam, and it's kind of an all-or-nothing exam like ACTs or SATs.  And whoever does really well can test into one of these handful of really elite schools to invest in being the most elite out of these schools.  And out of these, 60% of the student body out of these elite schools are Asian Americans.  So what is really going on here?  And by the way, it even says in this article that many of those students, the majority of them are low-income Asian Americans.  So this is not about wealthy Asians out testing blacks and Latinos who are poor, who don't have the resources.  These Asian-American kids had the same resources.  They had the same crap schools, the same crap teachers, the same broken system.  And yet a huge chunk, a disproportionate chunk were able to test into these high schools.  Now, Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, he's had some plans.  He says, well, maybe we can even it out by taking the top students from all of the middle schools rather than just the top students who test.  Maybe we should just, you know, say the top five students from each of the middle schools gets to go into this into these elite schools.  But the problem with that is the studies show that that would actually eliminate half of the current Asian-American students.  They would not be able to go to these elite schools.  This is a real problem.  Now, I myself, as an Asian-American, I can tell you that there's not enough advocacy from the Asian-American groups.  You rarely see Asian-American advocates, right?  You don't see very much activism going on inside of the Asian American group.  There's a couple of reasons for this, if we're going to be just quite frank.  First of all, Asian Americans, largely when they vote, if they vote, which is not often, the percentage is low, they're not very political.  When they do, it's often Republican.  So Democrats don't care about Republican Asian American kids.  And that's just part of the truth of it is that it's easy to kind of say, you know what, you guys are aligned with white conservative America.  And so we're going to advocate for the people that are with us and you're not.  That is one of the real issues that's going on.  Secondly, there's a group of Asian American students who are suing Harvard.  They've been at this for a while.  They feel like they're being discriminated against because Harvard started to say that they were going to take a more holistic approach to admission, which is looking at the whole of the student rather than just their test scores and academics.  And that, by and large, was discriminating to Asian American students who were then unable to get into the schools based on their test scores and their academics.  Some of the admissions, it was showing that they were saying that these Asian students had lacking in personality.  And so they were suing.  People then said, oh, well, who's really behind that lawsuit?  It's a bunch of white conservatives that are using these Asians as props.  That's insulting.  It's insulting to assume or to even insinuate that Asian Americans are somehow pawns or props or stupid and therefore easily manipulated by white conservative America.  That's insulting.  These kids, they worked their asses off.  This comes down to the rule of 10,000 hours.  That's all that this is.  Now, do we have inequality in our school systems?  Yes, we do.  We have a system that is not fair.  It's not equitable.  The rich kids get better resources and the poor kids get crap.  Schools are funded based on property taxes.  That is unfair.  It shouldn't be that way.  But this particular situation is comparing apples to apples.  These are kids that came from the same socioeconomic groups that had the same crap resources, and one group just happened to do better.  Why is that?  Well, it's because in Asian American culture, there is a huge emphasis on education.  There's a huge, massive emphasis on education, particularly in the math and sciences.  And there's a real big emphasis for students when they go to college to study math and science and get jobs in engineering, computer sciences, or medical field.  Why?  Well, because these Asian American families looked around and realized that the only way to succeed in this capitalistic culture is to have money.  So what do they pressure their kids to do?  They pressure their kids to go into fields that are going to make money.  Now, white families, I can talk about whites and Asians.  I can't really talk about black and Latino families.  But I can tell you from my experience being a mixed race person who has a unique vantage point inside of the lives of Asian Americans and inside the lives of white Americans, I can tell you that white American families often say to their kids, do what makes you happy, honey.  And as long as you do your best, I'm proud of you.  That is not the Asian American kid experience.  That's not what they're told.  Oftentimes, Asian American kids are told, why can't you be more like that neighbor kid who got an A?  Why can't you be more like that kid, your cousin, who's going off to medical school?  Why can't you be more like so-and-so?  There's a lot of shame and a lot of comparison in Asian American families.  So these kids work their asses off.  It's the rule of 10,000 hours.  Some kids, they put more effort into sports.  They put more effort into music.  They put more effort into dance or whatever it is.  But Asian American kids largely put their effort into sports.  academics and they study extra.  it's not just what they're learning in class.  they're going home after school and they're studying their asses off and on weekends instead of going and playing with their friends they're studying their asses off And because of it, they excel.  It comes out in the test scores.  So it's really unfair to then look at these kids, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did, which I'm disappointed in, or others on social media, other leaders, and they point at this and they say, well, look, all of you kids are getting in.  The system must be broken.  That is insulting to say to these kids who've worked their asses off.  And it's especially insulting when these kids are dealing with oftentimes shame and comparisons at home.  And they're pressured to work really, really hard.  And I don't want to paint it like it's an abusive relationship or anything like that.  It's cultural.  But still, it's insulting to these kids to tell them that their efforts are really just a product of an inequitable system that's racially biased.  That is insulting to these kids.  They don't deserve that.  They work their asses off.  This is what a merit-based system looks like.  When you're comparing apples to apples, this is merit-based.  Again, if you want to compare this, these kids have the same disadvantage compared to wealthy Asian kids compared to wealthy white kids or wealthy black kids.  They are at the same disadvantage.  But when you're comparing them together, they were able to compete, they put in their time, and they excelled.  Now, if you want to look at what I believe is the root of the real inequality that's happened, it's not in the education of these particular kids when you're looking at the system that they're all equally in.  That does need to change, but that is not what the issue is.  What the real issue is, is the home life.  And when kids are in a stable home environment, they excel.  When they have somebody at home telling them that they need to be studying, they excel.  Now, what would cause the breakdown of the family life?  Well, that is where our system has failed certain groups of people.  When you look at African Americans in our society, what has happened to them?  Their families have been systematically destroyed.  We know that if you can keep a family together, you can excel.  We see this with immigrant cultures, immigrant communities that come into America.  If you can keep the family together, the family will thrive together.  and excel because they pull resources.  They often live together in one roof.  They, you know, grandma and grandpa will raise the kids while mom and dad go off and work.  You know, my family scrubbed feet doing nails.  Other families, maybe they work at gas stations or 7-Elevens or whatever it might be or dry cleaning services.  And they're crap jobs, but they're going and they're working all day, every day, Monday through Friday, seven days a week.  They don't get a break.  Grandma and grandpa stay at home and help raise the kids.  And the kids have experienced a stable home life.  Black families, that was not the case.  When black families were enslaved, they were torn apart.  They were sold.  That's the phrase, sold down the river.  And then when you fast forward into like the 1980s, mass incarceration, that was a way of tearing families apart.  So when you tear families apart, you can break up communities and keep them poor.  It's a strategy that is used to keep people poor.  We see this also with Hispanics.  What's happening to them?  Well, deportation.  What do you do if you deport dad?  Then mommy kids can stay, but they all of a sudden go from maybe being poor to be extremely poor.  You know, if you can break families up, you can keep people poor.  Breaking families up has been the single most, that has been the single thing in my mind that has really been detrimental to various communities.  It's the breaking up of the family.  And the way to fix that is to implement systems to correct that somehow, to say, okay, we're going to give you resources.  Because your family isn't together, we're going to try to give you some resources so that we can make up for that.  So, for example, child care, high-quality child care that you don't have to pay for.  And that is going to be for before work and after \u2013 you know, before school and after school \u2013 and preschool and infant nursery care.  We're going to give you that.  We're going to make sure also that your kids have free college education so that you can push them and say, look, here's the way out.  This is the way out of poverty, which is what immigrant Americans know.  They will scrub feet so that their kids don't have to.  They will scrub feet so that their kids can work on math and science and go off to college and become engineers.  and then make a half a million dollars and no longer be impoverished.  That is why Asian Americans have been out earning whites these days.  And it's because of that mentality.  It was like, we're going to scrub feet or we're working at the gas station and we're going to do this all day, every day, seven days a week so that you can have a better chance.  And they instill this in their kids.  They don't say to their kids, do what makes you happy, be well-rounded.  They say, no, no, no, no.  I'm sacrificing so that you have a better shot and you better do it because this is the only way out.  They know that from looking at this capitalistic system.  But they were able also to do it because the family unit was largely able to stay intact.  One thing about Asian Americans is that we largely came over together as families.  So rather than one trickling in or another trickling in, it was largely groups coming in together and being able to remain together.  Hispanics have had a different experience because we're often deporting half of them back, right?  We say, okay, well, mom can stay with a couple of the kids, but one kid and the dad had got to go, you know, because they don't qualify or whatever.  That is a way to impoverish people, to keep people poor.  That is, I think, the single most damning thing about our system is the tearing of families apart.  in a variety of ways.  And we've got to have systems in place to correct that.  And when we see those systems, when that is beginning to be corrected, we're going to see people climbing out of poverty because they're going to see light at the end of the tunnel.  Look, mom might never be able to do anything other than a crappy job.  She might be cleaning houses for until the day, you know, until she's too old to do it.  But it might not help her climb out of poverty, but it helps the next generation climb out of poverty.  Because the next generation can focus when mom knows, look, I'm going to be cleaning houses all day every day so that I can make rent.  And if she has a living wage, then it's a lot easier for her to do.  She doesn't have to work two jobs 80 hours a week.  She can work one job 40 hours a week so that she can at least be home and telling her kids, hey, you need to study.  You need to study.  You need to get it together.  And when she's got high-quality childcare and when she knows that she can send her kid off to college and she's not going to go broke, then these are the systems that need to be implemented in order to raise people up out of poverty.  Rather than pointing at the school system and saying, in this particular case, and saying, look, this is a broken system.  This is the problem.  We need to fix this.  We need to make sure that there's equality in the results.  That's not going to make a fair and equitable society.  What we need to do is focus, and this is why I champion progressive policies, because I believe that these progressive policies are going to be the key to getting people out of poverty.  I really believe that having universal education, and universal health care and universal nursery care and preschool care and living wages, that these are the things that are going to really break the cycle and get people out of their poverty and get people seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that maybe they themselves will not have the best life, that they won't be rich, that they won't be living in a middle-class home, but their kids can have that shot.  And that's what we got to work for.  That's the system that we need to fix. ",
