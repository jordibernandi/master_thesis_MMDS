Why does Pokimane have the ninth most points on my channel?  She hasn't been in here in, like, six months.  Why?  You want to know why?  Because her fans... her die-hard fans will gamble points in here.  okay they will gamble for points in here when the stream is not on in the offline chat and then take all of their points and give it to their queen like it's like the ant mentality like i kind of admire it.  they're like working diligently here and like gifting their queen the top points.  staff's boyfriend watches your content Hasan laugh.

You know, they have the right to go into the men's room, but if they're still having periods, they have the right to have, you know... No, other hand.  No, other hand.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You want a treat?  You want a treat?  Hey guys, it's time for some incel math, okay?  She's wrong in her assessment, though.  Yes, at the top levels, there aren't many women.  However, if we scale this from low, 1 to 50, mid, 500 to 1K, and high, 2K plus, then if you're a guy and think for yourself, oh, I'm funny, I want to start streaming on Twitch, unless a miracle happens, you'll be stuck in the low portion for years and never make any progress.  If you're an attractive girl, you can just DM Raj.  And you can go on his podcast and you can have a relationship with a male streamer and thus get exposure through his audience.  Horny guys will literally boost you to mid-level for just being attractive.  So yes, if you are a girl, you can get into a position where people can watch you way easier.  Just show your tits once and claim it was an accident to get on LSF.  Bam!  You got a one-day ban and exposure you want.  So many ways for a female to get to that mid-level.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.
