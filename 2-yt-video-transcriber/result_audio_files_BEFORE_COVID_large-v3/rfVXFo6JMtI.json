            "text": "So you may have seen this video of Elon Musk's latest spaceship, the Starship, blowing up whilst fueling, whilst testing its oxygen tank.  So why did that happen?  Well, rockets are traditionally two giant fuel tanks, some very powerful pumps that pump that fuel over the period of about two minutes into the engines, which then takes you up into orbit.  Those tanks, one of them usually contains a powerful oxidant like liquid oxygen.  And liquid oxygen, obviously a cryogenic liquid, boils at about minus 170, that sort of thing.  But there is a colossal amount of it in there.  So if you pump it in at minus 170, minus 180, that sort of thing, then the vapor pressure above the liquid will be one atmosphere.  That means that you don't need a pressure vessel to store it in.  which are probably what all those tanks in the foreground are actually.  They're cryogenic storage containers.  Now, when a rocket sparks itself up and starts pumping that fuel from the giant tanks into the engines, of course, it sucks a vacuum into these giant fuel tanks.  And if you didn't compensate for that somehow, the vacuum would cause those tanks, or the partial vacuum would cause those tanks to collapse.  You'd lose the rocket.  You'd have a bad day.  So what typically is done before the launch of the rocket is you pressurize the headspace of the rocket, of the fuel tank, with something that won't liquefy liquid oxygen type temperatures, which is usually helium.  Helium is what is used.  So with all the big rockets that I know of you want that pressure to be as low as possible Because that means the tanks can be as light as possible a bar.  Yeah, I want them to be strong enough to survive.  So with the Shuttle tanks and with the Saturn 5 tanks they were pressurized to about two atmospheres to bar prior to launch.  and The thing is, here, there is obviously a colossal amount of pressure in there.  You know, my reckoning is, you ballpark figures, you've got to know what the volume is prior to the actual explosion.  But if you say that these tanks are like half full and they expand to 10 times that size, that means there was 10 atmospheres of pressure in there.  Which would be insane.  now turns out that SpaceX have been trying to do something clever Which is fine.  you may remember that they had a rocket that blew up some time ago and What caused that?  was a rupture of one of the high-pressure helium tanks?  Those the exact same helium tanks that are used to fill up the headspace of the rocket such that you don't pull a partial vacuum in your fuel tanks and Destroy the rocket.  Now, SpaceX wanted to get rid of those with some sort of automatic system that repressurized the tanks using some clever mechanism from the exhaust or something.  You gotta be very careful with this because if you're gonna pump any gas in there, The gas, if most gases will simply condense or shrink, contract the second they hit the cryogenic liquid.  So you really need a gas that won't liquefy.  And like I was saying, it's basically helium.  It's light and it doesn't liquefy.  So how the hell did they pressurize this thing up to getting on for 10 atmospheres?  This I just don't have a decent answer for.  If you wanted to pressure test these things, there's numerous ways you could do it.  If you just wanted to test the pressure, you fill it up with water and then just inject a bit of gas into the top.  that would pressure test you for the pressure.  You might want to pressure test it at cryogenic temperatures, in which case you don't need to actually completely fill the thing with cryogenic liquids, which it looks, from the way this thing blew up, it was mostly full of cryogenic liquid.  So this is another thing that gets me.  You can actually look up the vapor pressure of the liquid oxygen at various temperatures.  So, you know, you start off with liquid oxygen under one atmosphere, boils at about minus 170, that sort of thing. ",
