            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we return to talking about Adam Canover, aka Adam Ruins Everything, a starkly liberal wannabe smarty pants who has his own show on TruTV.  Recently, Adam was a guest on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast here on YouTube and, well, things didn't go well for the little guy, to say the least.  At first, I thought this was going to be another boring and lame guess for Joe Rogan, but when I saw that Joe started pushing back on Adam's pseudo-intellectual bullshit, it really did become fun to watch.  As many of you may know, we've covered Adam extensively over the years here on this show, combating his faulty logic about things like the suburbs being racist, Or him trying to stand for minorities, calling all stereotypes in 90s sitcoms racist.  Yeah, pretty much everything is racist according to Adam.  And he always finds the way to attack whites and Americans and try and make us look bad.  And that's why he really sucks so bad too.  I've got a link to my entire Adam Ruins Everything playlist below this video, if you want to catch up on things.  But for now, let's move on to his more recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience.  You see, one particular topic came back up there.  There was a discussion about alphas versus betas.  as it relates to humans in modern society.  We've covered this topic here too, in our own video, back in 2017 when Adam first covered the subject.  Basically, alpha males don't exist in humans, according to him.  And he goes into this whole big roundabout way to try and justify that too, using animal science and other nonsense to defend a stance he already believes.  Yeah, Adam essentially reverse engineers his arguments like this, meaning he starts with a conclusion he likes and believes, and then works back from there in order to justify it.  Not a very open-minded, rational, or scientific way to go about things, but, alas, that's what's brought us here today.  It's also worth noting that my original video and rebuttal to Adam's Alphas Don't Exist nonsense, well, that video is one of my top ones, with over 700,000 views, so, needless to say... I think our side might be more accurate here.  The truth is, alphas and betas do exist.  It may be scientific, or it may not be.  Or you could call it what you will, but there are certainly some people who are more confident and dominant than others.  While on the other side, some can be more meek and submissive too.  Pretty hard to deny that, but Adam does it anyway, as you'll soon see.  Fortunately though, in today's video, we get to see Joe Rogan combat Adam's bullshit logic in real time, in the room, which is pretty excellent to watch, to say the least.  So, pay attention, and make note at how nervous and overly defensive Adam becomes right away.  And also, it's hard to not notice how many times he says right here.  Right, right, right.  Which is, of course, a classic liberal move after... ",

You also try and frame this alpha and beta thing as if it has to be scientific, and testable and provable in some kind of experiment, like you're testing people for some kind of virus or something, when really, that's not how this works.

But instead of taking this L and moving on with your life, it looks like Adam has gone even further with his false logic, even doubling down and finding other weird ways to justify something that he thinks everyone else is wrong about.  But as I said before, though, my video and reaction to his anti-alpha stuff, well, it got three quarters of a million views.  So yeah, I certainly think a lot more people agree with my more reasonable side of this.  But instead of trying to figure out why he's wrong, Adam just thinks everyone else in the world is wrong.  Not him.  No way.  And I have to say, what a doofus.  And I really don't get why this beta boy Adam thinks he's so smart anyway. ",

Adam just doesn't want him to take away the terms alpha and beta because his whole counter-argument is based on narrowly defining those terms in a scientific way.  But when Rogan or myself break it down without those terms specifically, using real-world rationality, well... Adam's pitch completely falls apart, as it should, because he's completely wrong.  Really, what I'm seeing here is Adam is clearly a beta soy boy, and he has a problem coming to terms with that, so he's trying to change the whole world, language, and common conceptions on these issues, all in order to fit his preferred worldview and to make his ego feel better.  And then, when he presents that, Adam says his opinion is a fact, and presents it as a fact to all of us, when really, it's not that at all.  And does this tactic sound familiar to you guys?  Because this is exactly what all liberal SJWs do about everything.  Think about it.  They always like to play these different kinds of word games, like this.  In fact, we just went over a video from Teen Vogue a couple weeks ago that had SJWs changing the terms male and female in order to fit their own weird trans and gender non-binary bullshit.  Then there's things like when liberals call everyone racist or Nazis, even though their opponents aren't doing racist or Nazi stuff.  They're changing words, clearly, and they're imposing their new minority definitions onto the rest of us, just like what Adam is doing with alphas and betas. ",

Please, Adam is just struggling more and more as we go on, because he knows that Joe Rogan knows that he's wrong about alphas and betas.  This is also why he keeps saying right here.  Right, right, right.  He says that more and more as he goes on.  It's because Adam knows he's met his match.  And it's pretty pathetic too, since Joe Rogan isn't even a genius or anything.  He's not a rogue scholar, academic, or anything like that.  Joe's just a knowledgeable, level-headed, rational guy.  And most important of all, Rogan is willing to change his mind and admit when he's wrong about something when it's necessary.  And that's a big reason.  he comes across as world smarter and more reasonable than some SJW crackpot like Adam Canover. ",

It's because they are weird, wrong and non-intuitive.  Let's be real here, Adam.  You're not some kind of secret genius who figures out secrets about the world each week on your stupid show.  You're a wannabe smart guy beta who thinks if you disagree with common conceptions in the world, that makes you smarter than the rest of us.  But really, it doesn't.  And I personally never trust a guy who says right every three or four words like you.  It comes across as you being wrong, actually.  And you're trying way too hard to convince others that you are right.  If you were really right or correct or accurate, that would be self-evident in itself in what you see.  And it would be easily seeable to us.  But you're not right.  So you have to tell people you're right all the time to try and desperately convince us.  For one last example of that, just look at this last clip where Adam goes way over the top with all the rights in his speaking.  Take a look. ",

In the end, we've seen another embarrassing performance from Adam Ruins Everything.  It looks like the snappy writing and smooth editing of his TV show are really what helped him appear even somewhat coherent.  But in this live, on-the-fly podcast, he's really blowing it.  And today, also, Adam has shown us that even if he's wrong, he will still defend his silly and debunked position years later.  without any budging or evolution of his opinion at all.  And sure, being stubborn and holding your ground on something can seem confident and bold, but when you're wrong about that, it just makes you look like a bullheaded loser like Adam.  And this is an especially bad look for Adam considering the image he has built for himself online, on TV, and with his show.  As I've said before, He acts as if he is this smart guy, intellectual, unbiased scientific, when really, Adam is heavily biased, and he's a left-wing hack who doesn't present facts at all.  Really, he's pushing SJW and liberal propaganda.  What do you guys think?  Did you watch this Joe Rogan experience with Adam Ruins Everything?  I couldn't take much more of this.  That whole two and a half hour show must be really hard to watch because I could barely make it through this 13 minute section on alphas.  Speaking of which, do you guys think alphas and betas exist?  Or is everyone who uses those terms ever, no matter what context, are we all wrong because Adam Canover says so?  Comment your thoughts on everything below and thanks for watching, no bullshit.  Hit that like button if you enjoyed this video and we'll see y'all next time.  um. ",
