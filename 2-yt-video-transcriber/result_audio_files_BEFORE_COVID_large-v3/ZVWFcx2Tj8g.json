            "text": "hello mature content today very mature content.  this one is not for children.  when you desperately want children and cannot make them your family and friends and even complete strangers will sometimes be tactless and cruel.  why don't you have kids?  when are you gonna have kids?  don't you want kids?  don't you like kids?  kids are great.  you should have some.  you're so good with kids.  haven't you thought about having some of your own?  hey don't you think it's time you grow up and start a family?  You will often wish to machine gun these people.  Have you ever considered adopting?  Now that is a reasonable question.  Adoption can be a beautiful thing.  I have friends who have adopted children and they have made beautiful, loving families.  My butler, whom you have met, heavyset fellow, was a foundling left at the church side door, and we love him, and we are so glad that he's in our life.  But, for one thing, I know that adoption, like everything else in life, sometimes doesn't work out very well.  and this can lead to pains and sorrows and regrets sometimes for the adoptive parents who have to live with the results of their actions and sometimes for their biological children who also have to live with the results of their parents actions.  there is a dark side to adoption a very dark side.  Also I was inspired by Abraham, by his good example of patience and prayer, and by his and Sarah's bad example of impatience and of taking things into their own hands and creating trouble for themselves and for their servant Hagar.  and for Ishmael.  And then there's all of the trouble that has come out of Ishmael.  But, Hengist Mountebank, if you adopted a nice little Chinese or Korean baby girl, it is highly unlikely that she would grow up to become a pedophilic, blaspheming warlord.  Myrtle, my friend, I know you love me, and you mean well.  But I've put my hope in God, and it is not for me to withdraw it.  Not even if he kills me.  Twelve years ago, I was walking my dog downtown.  She was a terrific dog.  I took her to work with me every day.  This day was cold, it was winter, and my eye happened to spy a girl in the crowd, because she had no coat on, and because she was behaving like a lunatic.  She was sobbing and screaming and frantic, and she seemed pulled in every direction and no direction.  And she was being a great nuisance to a lot of respectable people who were forced to step around her.  Excuse me, miss.  Do you need help?  Yes, yes, I need help.  Come with me.  I'll take you to the police.  No, no police.  Do you want an ambulance?  No, no.  The young woman, or girl, had thrown up on herself.  My office is near here.  It's just over there.  Do you want to go there?  You can get warmed up and cleaned up.  Yes, yes, please.  I sat the girl down and called my wife.  Could you please come quickly?  and bring some extra clothes, something old that you wouldn't mind giving away.  My wife came, and after a quick whispering talk with the girl, I was sent out shopping.  And after I returned, pretty soon the girl was all cleaned up and more settled down.  It turned out that minutes before I found her, She was in an abortionist's chair.  Her feet were in the stirrups.  Everything was ready to go when suddenly she felt that she couldn't go through with it.  What are you doing?  Get back in the chair.  Don't be foolish.  We're just about to start the procedure.  You're being silly.  Get back in that chair right now.  You can't leave.  Come back here.  The boyfriend was not in the picture.  The girl was alone and she was frightened of her parents.  Especially she was frightened of her father.  I am not a father.  My wife and I can't have children.  But if you were my daughter, I can't imagine that... Look, I might be angry.  I might be disappointed, but I'd say, Honey, I still love you.  We love you, your mother and I. We'll help you.  And together we'll find a way forward.  The girl was not so sure.  I offered to speak with her parents, to take her home and go in the house while she told them.  And if they disowned her, we would bring her home with us.  We would not abandon her.  Thank you.  Maybe, she said.  We talked for hours.  It was interesting because we had opposite troubles.  She had the baby that she didn't want.  We wanted the baby we couldn't have.  Listen, I told her.  Right now, you think you don't want this baby, or you think you can't take care of it, but you don't want to abort it either.  That's why you jumped out of the chair.  Oh, you feel hopeless now.  You don't feel like a mother now.  But I think that if you have this baby, when you see her little face, if it's a girl, or hold his little hand it's a boy.  I think you will fall in love and I know you'll be a good mother and you'll be very happy together with your baby and if your parents throw you out of the house we will help you.  you will not go homeless.  on my word you will not go homeless or friendless.  but if you have this baby and you don't want to keep it give it to me.  my wife and I will adopt it and love it and raise it and give it a wonderful life.  my wife stayed quiet and I wondered what she was thinking but I knew what I was thinking.  I made every appeal for the life of the child, and we came to no conclusion.  She thought she might want to speak with the boyfriend again, and speak with her parents.  Of course, of course.  I'm so glad I found you today.  Thank you, Mr.  and Mrs.  Mountebank.  Thank you for everything.  I feel much better.  Thank you.  I'll call you soon.  I believed that God had answered my prayers.  A few days later I came home.  My wife was crying.  She got the call.  The deed was done.  A few years later God did answer my prayers.  He put an idea in my head.  A simple idea.  I tried it, and at last, after ten long, barren years, we got a baby girl, Matilda.  She's seven now.  And then another baby girl, Florentina.  She'll be three in a few days.  They're everything I wanted.  And they wouldn't be here if we'd gotten that child.  We'd have taken a very different timeline.  And who knows, but after I die and go to heaven, maybe I'll have another daughter or a son waiting there.  Because I wanted that little one too.  And my wife did too.  And I still feel sad about it.  And she does too.  Well I do ramble on.  Thank you for listening. ",
