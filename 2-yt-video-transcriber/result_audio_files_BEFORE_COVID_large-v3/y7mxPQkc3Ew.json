            "text": "So the next article I wanted to take a look at was J.K.  Rowling's response to this whole situation.  I can't even do it justice without reading the article.  So let's take a look at it and see what happens.  This is by CNN.  J.K.  Rowling under fire over transgender comments.  Harry Potter author J.K.  Rowling has come under fire for expressing support for a woman who lost an employment tribunal over comments she made on social media about transgender people.  Maya Forstater brought a claim against the Center for Global Development and CGD Europe, an international development think tank, after she lost her job as a researcher following comments on Twitter criticizing UK government plans to allow people to self-identify their gender.  Forstater does not believe that it's possible to change sex and that men who have undergone gender reassignment surgery are still men, even if the law recognizes them as women.  For a little bit of context here, I don't get terribly involved in this whole side of politics, as in I don't know a whole lot about it.  I've been trying to keep up with it and trying to learn and understand more about this, but in the grand scheme of things i'm really not extremely knowledgeable like there are more knowledgeable people out there than me on the subject.  so i'll do my best to work my way through the subject because i feel like it is important to talk about for stater does not believe that it's possible to change sex and that men who have undergone gender reassignment surgery are still men even if the law recognizes them as women.  I don't think people should be compelled to play along with literal delusions like trans women are women, she wrote in a private message to a co-worker that was cited in evidence in the case.  So let me tell you my understanding of the situation.  When we're talking about sex and gender, there is a difference between the two.  Okay, so I try to go with the science on everything, if possible, on this subject.  And the science and the psychology behind this is telling us that gender is a separate thing from sex.  For example, in the DSM-5, it talks about gender dysphoria.  So gender is the mental aspect of this, and sex is the physical aspect of it.  So sometimes people's gender and sex don't align.  And they can experience gender dysphoria, like the feeling that something is not right, like they should be different than they are.  And I actually have a family member who I'm not going to name, but because, you know, for privacy and all that.  I have a family member who is trans, and she has said that she hates taking a shower because she's forced to face what she is.  And it just bothers her.  Like, she can't stand it.  It eats her up inside.  That is the type of thing that a lot of people deal with.  So this person, Maya Forstater, is something known as a TERF, I believe, which stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist.  Typically, in my experience, they're extremely toxic.  The ideology behind it is extremely toxic and doesn't recognize the science behind this.  and doesn't recognize or show any kind of understanding for the people who are experiencing this type of situation.  So with that in mind, let's continue reading and see what else it says.  The tribunal, making a preliminary ruling in her case, determined that Forstater's views were not protected as a philosophical belief under the Equality Act of 2010.  Details of the tribunal held between November 13th and 21st were published Wednesday.  The employment judge, James Taylor, wrote in his judgment that he considered Forstater's view to be absolutist and incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others.  So I did a little bit of reading about this, and from what I understand, there are some protected beliefs, protected viewpoints, and things like that.  For example, if you believe that Jewish people don't eat bacon, that is a true belief, but not entirely.  There are some Jewish people who do.  But aside from that, it's protected because it doesn't violate human rights or human dignity.  Let's see, it says the judge wrote in the judgment that he considered Forstater's view to be absolutist.  Being absolutist about anything, like being black and white thinking in general, I've said this a billion times, black and white thinking is, will be the death of you.  It is a bad thing to just have black and white, all or nothing, us versus them kind of thinking.  Like if you can't see nuance in something, then you've got a problem.  You have to find nuance in things.  Nuance exists.  And having this absolutist black and white thinking ideology is counterproductive.  It's extremist by its nature.  In a statement posted on Twitter Wednesday, Forstater said she believes that sex is a biological fact and is immutable.  As I said, there is a difference between sex and gender, and that is recognized by science, like I said a minute ago.  So the cells in your body are, at this immediate moment, cannot be changed.  The cells in your body, i.e.  XX, XY, or any variation of that.  But gender is the mental understanding of who you are and is recognized in the DSM-5.  So you can say that sex is a biological fact and is immutable.  Sure, your cells can't be changed at this moment.  But gender is a. gender is something that exists in your brain.  And I don't see what attacking and hurting people and destroying them emotionally is helping.  Like, I don't understand why you're why is this even coming up?  Like, yeah, OK, sex is technically a biological fact.  And the cells in your body at this moment cannot be changed.  What does that have to do with people who experience gender dysphoria?  And why are you making their lives worse?  Why are you making their lives harder?  All right, let's continue reading.  There are two sexes.  Men are male.  Women are female.  That's not true.  Men and women, as I've said, in my understanding, the terms men and women reflect gender.  Male and female reflect sex.  So if you are... physically like your the cells in your body are made up of x y for example then you are biologically.  this sex doesn't mean you're not a man or doesn't mean you're not a woman.  those can be the terms that identify you and your the the state that your mind is in how you see yourself And I really don't see why it matters.  Why does everybody care so much how somebody identifies?  Why do you even give a shit?  Why does it matter to you?  Let them tell you who they are.  Who are you to sit there and tell somebody that they aren't this thing or that thing?  Just let them be who they are.  Why are you inserting yourself up into their lives like that?  It doesn't make any sense to me.  Rowling, okay, J.K.  Rowling.  Now this is her role in this.  J.K.  Rowling announced her support for Forstater on Thursday, writing, dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like, sleep with any consenting adult who'll have you, live your best life in peace and security, but force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real?  I stand with Maya.  This is not a drill.  Not sure what this is not a drill hashtag means, but anyways.  This isn't the only instance. ",
