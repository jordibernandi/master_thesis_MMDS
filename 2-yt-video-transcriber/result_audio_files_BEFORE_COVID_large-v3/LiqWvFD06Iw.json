If you write them above your laptop, if you stick them on your wall, if you put them above your wheel as you're driving your car, these three words will totally change your life.  Last Sunday, I heard a preacher say this, God is dangerous.  Oh, but you say God is a God of love.  You'd be right.  He is a God of love.  He's a God of grace.  He's a God rich in mercy.  But he's also a God who needs to be feared.  And if you push him too far, there will be consequences.  If you need to repent of the sin of foolishness, you need to remember those young men who slandered the prophet Elijah.  And what did God do?  He sent bears to gobble them up.  If you need to repent of the sin of greed, remember those two people, Ananias and Sapphira.  You have lied to the Holy Spirit.  dead like that.  if you need to repent of the sin of impure eyes remember that man samson who could not stop staring looking up and down of those philistine women.  so what did god do?  he had his eyeballs ripped out from his sockets because samson wasn't going to do it himself.  If you need to repent of the sin of pride, remember that man called Nebuchadnezzar, who stood on his palace and said, what a great king I am.  And that very day, his whole kingdom, everything was snatched from him.  And he went out into the beast, degraded like a wild animal.  If you need to repent of the sin of lack of love for the lost, remember that man, Jonah.  Who ran away because he did not want to preach the good news.  And God sent a storm and a big fish to get his attention.  And if you leave with one thought today, you need to leave with this one.  There is zero difference between us and the early church.  You say that was back then, it was in Bible times.  No, there is zero difference.  Jesus Christ is the same today, yesterday and forevermore.  And let me just say this, if you are a lukewarm Christian, if your heart has grown cold, if the fire is gone, one of the best things God can do is to slam you to the floor, to turn you back on your knees so that you turn back to God and get a heart of prayer back.  So I suggest we all remember that God is dangerous and that we all begin to tremble at that very fact.  Two quick things before we part ways.  First thing, please do subscribe.  Second thing, if you want to hear this sermon, which literally tore me in two, I'll leave a link in the description box. ",
