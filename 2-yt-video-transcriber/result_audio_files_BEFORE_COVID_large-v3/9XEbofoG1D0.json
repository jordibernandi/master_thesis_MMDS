            "text": "Hey, guys.  Thank you so much for your support and kindness these last few months.  I know I haven't made a video in several months, but I wanted to do some explaining today.  As many of you that watch my Sunday night podcast, Beauty and the Beta, which is always linked below, already know I am pregnant, finally.  I'm about four months pregnant now, and I have been really, really tired.  I know I'm prone to hyperbole, but seriously, it's like that kind of teenage hormonal exhaustion.  you had freshman year of high school where you'd sleep for 10 hours, come home from school and sleep another three hours.  I cannot get anything done.  I am constantly dragging ass, but it is getting better now that I'm out of my first trimester.  Additionally, pregnancy has made me extremely dumb.  I am forgetting basic words, dropping things, leaving important papers everywhere.  I don't think I'm going to be speaking intelligently about much for a little while.  Those are a few reasons that I haven't been making content.  Another reason is that I feel hyper-focused on the baby, and I have a lot of anxiety surrounding my pregnancy.  It has totally eclipsed political developments, my channel, my vanity.  I am just thinking all the time, how am I going to get through getting this baby out of me and raising her properly?  Not to mention that pregnancy is fraught with uncertainty, especially in this stage when I can't feel the baby, I'm not showing that much.  If I didn't feel like garbage and I wasn't gaining weight, it would be hard to tell that I was pregnant.  It's just a really strange period of time and I'm really scared, I'm really anxious, and I just wanted to disappear from the online sphere for a little bit to kind of deal with this without the outside pressure.  People can be ruthless and I've felt especially vulnerable the last few months.  And even though not making content causes a lot of stress, it seemed like stepping away for a little bit was the best course of action.  Maybe not the best, but it was the easiest.  Becoming a wife, moving and starting my life over, trying to conceive, and just losing passion for politics because my focus has shifted so much.  It all sort of happened at once, and there was just a huge content slowdown.  I didn't want to put out crappy content but I really felt like I was disappointing everyone.  I still do and I am so sorry for that.  But I have known since I started the channel that once I got pregnant especially but really once I moved that things were going to have to change.  I've always struggled with this part of me that wants to give everyone the finger and say whatever I want which I do.  But then sometimes I seriously regret it.  I retreat into myself and I'm totally unable to handle the backlash.  In that way, I have picked the least sustainable and suitable job for myself and my personality type.  My ego is just too fragile.  I sort of feel like you're either Ann Coulter and you have what it takes to deal with all of this or you don't.  And I clearly don't.  I'm too neurotic.  I have too much anxiety.  And even though I'm very proud of the work I've done and feel like I'm really good at this, it has just been... so stressful.  Now that I'm feeling the responsibility of another life, the life of a little girl that needs to be protected and raised so that she surpasses me and lacks my bad qualities like being a loudmouth, I am really beginning to understand just how important all of this is.  This really is what it's all about.  My whole life, the mistakes, the red pill, the channel, everything has led me up to this mammoth task.  I just have to do a good job.  And wrapping my mind around it, around the enormity of this task is consuming me right now.  I feel so blessed to have the opportunity to raise a new generation.  But I'm scared of the condition of the world around us, of our country.  And even though our ancestors had babies in wars and famine through death and destruction, I am still acutely aware of how difficult it's going to be to protect her from the society that we've created while allowing her to develop her own personality.  The last decade has, frankly, been horrible.  Not necessarily personally, although I'm convinced that the red pill and being immersed in the online political sphere has deleterious effects on mental health of people with sensitive personality types.  But as a society, we're really coming apart at the seams and there isn't the simplicity or the comfort of having a place in the world that previous generations experienced.  It's going to be very important for me to focus on what is good on the future, on what is positive, because I have a tendency to be nihilistic and now have a very serious moral obligation to avoid infecting a new generation with this nihilism.  I asked E. Michael Jones about this element of our culture in the conversation that we had over the summer.  And he said, we just have to look ahead and get excited about what we can build after this society fails.  And that's really what I'm doing by bringing new life into the world.  It's what I have to do.  I guess the question that I'm grappling with Is it possible to do all of these things, to raise a daughter, to be a good wife, to stay positive, and to continue doing this channel as I have been?  The channel exposes me to risk, to extremely high levels of stress.  I want to do the right thing for my family, but I still desire to make content.  There is also this question of women's role in the movement.  I'm not seeing a lot of women that have young kids and are still able to do this job unless they have a really specific personality type.  As far as current events and politics are concerned, I am pretty much maxed out in that arena just with my weekly podcast with Matt Christensen and our call-in show.  So amidst all of the bannings and getting burned out with current events, with demographic issues that we've discussed ad nauseum, with fiscal issues, I'm seeing a lot of people change direction, which I totally understand.  And that is something that I want to do as well.  I'm not saying there will be no more content on this channel.  I just don't have the same zeal for it that I once did.  Who knows, though, I don't want to shut it down because I might have this baby and that anger, that rage that drove me might return, might even be stronger.  I won't know until I meet her and see what I'm capable of.  I'll always do Beauty and the Beta, of course, but I'm also really feeling this urge to completely change direction.  I've decided to start a channel with my dear friend Critical Condition, Robin Riley, and she is also pregnant and newly married.  My audience here is so predominantly male that I don't think I can start rolling out the kind of content that I want to with my current branding and the demographic of this audience.  We're calling the channel Motherland, and it's linked below.  We've already recorded our first episode.  It will air tomorrow at 1 PM Eastern.  I know there are oodles of motherhood, cooking, birth, childhood development, marriage channels.  I watch them.  But what I see from almost all of them is a complete avoidance of the appearance of political bias.  There will be none of that.  And we have to let the channel develop organically like I have here.  But there are so many cultural issues that affect child rearing, that affect gender relations and marriages, that affect families and communities.  We want to talk about all the mom stuff, of course, but we want to be more than that.  We've talked about the direction of that channel and the future content on our premiere episode, which, as I mentioned, is going live at 1 p.m.  Eastern tomorrow and is linked below.  I really hope that you subscribe to our channel and that, man or woman, you enjoy our content.  I hope that you understand why I want to do this and that you don't feel like I'm being disloyal or unappreciative of the four years of support that you've given me.  I cannot thank you enough for that.  I truly can't.  I just feel like I have to make a different kind of content right now and I really hope that you come along with me.  Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you soon.  Bye. ",
