            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we return to talking about the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, Avengers Endgame.  With the movie's record-breaking opening weekend finally wrapping up, Endgame enjoyed massive success, making over a billion dollars in its first week.  That's amazing.  But with success and popularity also comes attacks from the social justice warrior crowd.  As we've seen time and time again, radical leftists like this love to attack things that are popular and fun.  Even sometimes trying to invade these spaces and take over the place.  And well, this latest Avengers movie is no different.  First, we're going to go over some complaints about the gay representation in the movie.  And then later, there's a number of other PC police who were turning their sirens on full blast when the movie made some fat jokes about a certain main character.  All of that today and more, but first, I wouldn't worry too much about spoilers here today.  We mostly are just going to talk about one or two minor plot points, so unless you're really strict about that sort of thing, we all should be good to go, so... Let's start things off with an article from ComicBook.com called, Here's Why Many Fans Aren't Happy With Avengers Endgame's LGBTQ Representation.  This should be good.  Let's go ahead and check it out.  Avengers Endgame finally hit theaters this weekend.  It's already smashing box office records and taking its place as one of the highest rated films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  However, one moment in the movie is causing some debate amongst LGBTQ fans.  Marvel boasts that this film has the first openly gay character in the MCU, and while that's sort of true, it definitely leaves something to be desired.  And well, right out the gate, I think this is a great example of how SJWs will never be pleased.  It's never enough for spoiled brats like this, so if you try and give them an inch, they'll complain about it and ask for a mile.  Also, this reminds me of how self-important these people are too.  I don't know if they realize this, but only about 4% of the population is gay, lesbian, bi, or trans.  That means if there were a hundred different Marvel characters in this movie, only about four would be gay.  But for some reason, these sex-obsessed creepers and liberals, they always think half the planet is gay like them.  When really that's just their presumption because they only hang out with other people like that.  In the film, Steve Rogers and Captain America leads a support group for people who lost loved ones to the Thanos snap.  One of the members in the group reveals that he finally went on his first date since the decimation.  And based on the he pronouns he uses, love it when they obsess about pronouns, it's clear this character is gay.  The moment packs a mildly extra punch since he's being played by Joe Russo, one of the movie's directors.  However, the fact that he plays an unnamed character with a few lines almost feels like a slap in the face to the people waiting 22 movies to see themselves represented on screen.  Sure, we're glad to have confirmation that gay people exist in this universe, but it feels too little too late.  If you say so, buddy.  I personally thought this whole gay confessional scene was really kind of cringy, and it pulled me out of the movie's story for a bit.  In fact, now that I remember it more, I distinctly recall feeling weird about Captain America comforting this gay guy so much.  Not that he shouldn't or anything, or not that there's anything wrong with a gay dude, it just all seems so forced in the movie.  No one wants to see a badass character like Captain America talk about his feelings and shit, let alone Cap trying to sound woke and down with the gay dating scene there.  Needless to say, it was awkward as hell.  Next, let's talk about this fake idea that everyone wants to see themselves represented in popular movies.  We don't.  Only weak-willed, self-centered SJWs think like this.  Not everyone else.  They are the ones focused on race, gender, and sexual orientation.  Then they pretend we all want to see that shit in our media too, when really we don't.  You're projecting here, guys, so stop.  And get over yourselves too.  I don't need to see characters exactly like me to enjoy films.  I often like watching movies with black people, females, or even animals as lead characters.  Superman is an alien from Krypton for Christ's sake, but his story can still captivate us all despite that.  So this idea that we need characters like ourselves on screen is just bunk.  Really, that's just the SJW's excuse because they want to take over every popular space with their nonsense.  In addition to being what some people are calling tone deaf, many fans of the Marvel television shows are annoyed that Avengers Endgame is taking credit for the first openly gay character in the MCU.  There are multiple queer characters in Jessica Jones, Runaways, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  However, those characters' existence don't change the fact that 11 years worth of blockbuster films have avoided the subject altogether.  With any luck, Joe Russo's character will be a stepping stone into a much more inclusive MCU, but for now, it's just not enough.  This reminds me of a gripe I do have with Marvel.  The writer of this article is right about something.  The MCU always tries way too hard to make claims that they are the first in all these different things.  And they're claiming they're first in things that have already been done years ago.  Like last year, for example, Black Panther was supposedly the first black-led superhero movie.  When really, there had been loads of those made before.  Like Meteor Man from 1993, which has a much better claim at being the first black superhero movie.  And then there's also my personal favorite, Blank Man, which came out just one year later in 94.  And for those who might say Black Panther was the first black Marvel comic book movie, well, let's not forget about the Blade series, which had three movies come out starting in 1998.  Then the next first that Marvel tried to claim was this year's Captain Marvel.  which was, again, called the first female-led superhero movie, even though Wonder Woman came out just about two years ago and did really well.  And before you try and say this was the first Marvel female-led movie, well, let's not forget about the failed Electra flick that came out in 2005, a spinoff of Daredevil.  So as much as Marvel wants us to forget about that movie, we really can't.  It still happened, and I still see Jennifer Garner as a weird ninja spy.  I think you get my point now though, so let's move on to the next article and topic.  Next we see another group of SJWs complaining about supposed fat shaming in the Endgame movie.  The Daily Wire collects a number of good responses about this in their article called, Let's go ahead and take a look.  That is though, not the strangest SJW complaint about the epic Avengers blockbuster.  That trophy belongs to a host of women's sites and SJW sites that complain that his fellow Avengers fat-shamed and emotionally disturbed Thor, who let go of his superhero physique while recovering from a traumatic experience.  The once Adonis-like Thor has taken on quite the dad bod from a life of eating pizza, drinking beer, and playing video games.  when he's contacted to return to Avengers headquarters for a new mission.  The fat jokes and sight gags begin almost immediately, and showcase star Chris Hemsworth's ability to be a comedic actor in addition to a barely troubled hero.  But social justice warriors are now deeply concerned that moviegoers will be emotionally triggered by the gentle ribbing.  Are you serious?  Fat jokes are off the table now?  What the hell has this world come to?  I thought Thor with the dad bod was one of the funniest parts of the movie too.  Chris Hemsworth was hilarious.  And I also love seeing his character go through such a big change here.  He's really evolved and seen some shit happen to him since his first movie back in 2011.  But I guess when it comes to SJWs, they are just never happy or pleased with anything.  Whatever, moving on.  Next, let's see where their exact complaints are coming from here.  The Daily Dot explained that fat jokes made at Thor's expense suck, and that Marvel should know better.  Over the past few years, body diversity and fat acceptance have become mainstream topics in pop culture criticism, even though they're stupid and shouldn't be.  Marvel presumably wants Avengers Endgame to have a long shelf life, but this mean-spirited recurring fat joke is going to age very poorly very fast.  Now, you see, I beg to differ here.  As I said before, Thor getting a beer belly was one of the best parts of the movie.  At the least, it was the funniest bit for sure.  Iron Man even calls him Big Lebowski at one point, which was absolutely great, especially considering the fact that Jeff Bridges, the actor who played the dude from Big Lebowski, well, He also played a villain in the first Iron Man movie.  What a coincidence.  And probably something the directors thought of and planned out here.  Well done.  Regardless, obviously these so-called fat jokes in Endgame aren't some kind of crime against humanity here.  It's not like they were straight up making fun of some fat kid who couldn't help it either.  The whole point here is, and why it's funny is, because Thor's fat when he's usually not.  Usually Chris Hemsworth and all of his characters are just as tall, dark, and handsome and in great shape just like he is.  No homo or anything, but that guy's ripped up.  So them changing that in Endgame and making him have a beer belly, that's what the real joke was here.  And I can't believe I have to explain this shit, but I'm not surprised I have to either, because SJWs like this, they really have no sense of humor.  Cosmopolitan claims the fat jokes crossed the line, and that the jokes regressed Thor's character and minimized his mental illness.  Oh boy, we're getting into mental health stuff.  Here we go.  The point they're trying to make is clear.  Thor is plagued by PTSD and mental health issues.  My own depression manifested overeating and weight gain.  so, like, it me.  And if they want to focus on his recovery and help him process his grief, this could have been an incredible moment in the MCU timelines.  But instead of tackling his issues head on, his fellow team members repeatedly ridiculed and belittled him for his appearance, specifically his weight.  They were so relentless.  I breathed a visceral sign of relief when he was able to wield his hammer.  Half convinced his newfound physique would mark him as unworthy in the eyes of the powers that be.  Yeah, well, Thor did still kick ass at the end here.  And I feel like the complainers here are brushing over this fact because they can't stop focusing on the few and far between fat jokes that kind of blinded them while watching this movie.  Really, Thor had as good a story arc as anyone else in this movie, especially the main characters.  Thor started off sad and broken and overweight, all caused by the tragedies that happened at the end of Infinity War, the last movie.  But throughout Endgame, Thor eventually toughens up.  He gets his shit together and he overcomes the adversity, eventually fighting his ass off at the end despite his new beer belly.  and his long hair.  In this ending, this fighting should really be a big fat acceptance, body positive moment too.  I mean, we saw a big dude who stood up to Thanos and gave him a hell of a rousting too, but the SJWs are just too focused on complaining about the small negatives here because they're sad, negative people who need to get their own lives in order first and stop worrying about representation and how woke popular movies are.  In the end, the Russo brothers could have made half the Avengers gay or trans, and the SJWs would still complain about something.  Because as we've seen over the years, people like this are just never happy.  And much like the villains in the MCU movies, so too can the SJWs never be pleased.  What do you guys think?  Was Captain America having a talk with his gay friend a good LGBTQ moment in Endgame?  Or do you think the movie needed less or more of that?  And what about Fat Thor?  Were the jokes at his expense offensive?  Comment your thoughts on everything below and thanks for watching.  No Bullshit.
