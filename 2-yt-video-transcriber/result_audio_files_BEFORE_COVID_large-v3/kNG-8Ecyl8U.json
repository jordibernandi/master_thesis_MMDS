            "text": "What's up, guys?  It's Young Men's Daily Red Pill, and this is my first official podcast on this channel, so I thank you for checking out this channel for the first time.  You enjoy the content.  If you want to just drop a like, and if you want to stick around, consider subscribing.  But today's going to be a very important video.  Because I feel a lot of red pill content creators tend to talk about women and basically not a lot about getting on your grind as a man and focusing on your purpose, which is what I really, truly believe you should be focusing on as a man.  There are quite a few that do talk about being on your purpose.  And for the sake of this video, as you can tell from the title, we are going to be talking about building a relationship with your purpose rather than with women.  And even if your ultimate goal is to attract a high quality of woman or a certain type of woman, you're going to have to be on your purpose in order for her to chase you.  You should never be chasing a woman.  All right, so the first point that I want to make starting off this podcast is if you're young, you shouldn't even think about women.  Like I'm 22 years old.  I just turned 22.  As I stated in my first official video on this channel, you shouldn't be thinking about women.  You should be thinking about how can I improve as a man and how can I improve my quality of life moving on within the next 10 to 20 years to 30 years of my life?  And quite frankly, having a woman is not going to help with that.  And in order to build a relationship with your purpose, you must be willing to sacrifice.  All right.  Whether that means getting up early in the morning and going to the gym so you can get your workout in.  So you're on your grind and you stay consistent with that.  You have to be willing to put in the work.  No one else is going to be there with you.  You know, I can't.  I can't just be making videos every day to encourage you.  I mean, that's my goal.  I want to encourage you all I can and as well as the other MGTOW red pill channels.  But You have to find it within yourself to motivate yourself.  And we can't always just be there for you.  We can talk to you and encourage you all we can, but it has to come from within and has to come from a place of wanting to grow and wanting to learn this knowledge and soak it up and apply this information.  Hard work and dedication to something, especially something you're passionate about, it takes time.  And having a relationship with a woman takes away from your purpose and business.  Such as if you're constantly having to entertain or please her, this changed your wallet and your mind.  I mean, I can think of many times, especially in my previous relationships.  I'm single man right now.  I'm living the bachelor lifestyle.  I am not trying to get back into a relationship.  But I can think of a handful of times where I've been in relationships and the woman has dominated the majority of my time.  And boy, it just drains you.  I was getting so exhausted, having to constantly go back and forth with her, trying to figure out how to make her happy rather than focusing on myself and what was making me happy and what was healthy for myself mentally, physically.  I mean, I physically look like shit at a certain point in my life.  And I take responsibility for letting myself get to that point.  But honestly, it was just because a lot of my money and my resources and my time was going towards her.  And it was just draining and draining me.  I look like shit.  It literally took over my life, consumed me.  And you should never let a woman get in the way of that.  You should be focused on your purpose and building a business.  If you truly want to unlock and discover your true purpose in life, you must go without.  And I know Steph as Cole talked about this before, but I'm going to reiterate it.  Going without is so important.  You must deal with pain.  You must deal with hardships.  You must be at rock bottom, literally.  You must feel what it's like to be completely broken down and almost destroyed completely.  If you want to grow and if you want to be able to build yourself back up again, mentally, physically, all of that, you don't need a woman to build you back up.  You need yourself.  You need to be reading.  You need to be praying.  You need to be meditating.  You need to be focusing on what you can do to improve your situation.  I can't be encouraging you.  Other red pill channels can't be encouraging you.  You have to do it yourself.  Well, we can be encouraging you, but you have to go out and actually physically do it yourself.  I need you guys to ask yourself as a man.  What are some ways I can become financially independent?  Alright, this is another important thing about why you should be building a relationship with your purpose, not with women.  What are some ways I can become financially independent?  You want to create multiple streams of income as well.  And in my experience, so my story is basically I went to two junior colleges for three years.  And in that time, I realized I wanted to have multiple streams of income.  I was tired of the junior college lifestyle.  If any of you have been in junior college, you know what it's like.  You're living with your parents.  Because it's usually local.  You see the same people from high school.  It's just a whole mess of a situation.  And I wanted to better myself.  I wanted to create a better opportunity financially for myself.  So I went and I decided to create a YouTube channel.  And that channel now has over 15,000 subscribers and two and a half million views.  And I busted my ass on that channel.  I literally would upload three to four times a week.  And I finally got it to where it is right now.  And I am focusing on this channel though, however.  Because I am so passionate about Red Pill and MGTOW.  That I felt like my opinion and sharing some of my life experiences and stories with you guys would be encouraging.  But you guys need to find a... Multiple streams of income.  Multiple streams of income.  You want to keep yourself busy, okay?  This will keep your mind off of women.  This has kept my mind off of women.  You want to be focusing on yourself.  What you can do to improve.  How you can improve your life.  What are some ways in which you can capitalize on something you're good at and market it to other people.  I also work two jobs.  And one of which I actually commute 45 minutes to an hour to get to.  And that's in the Bay Area.  Right now I don't live in the Bay Area, but I do commute an hour to work in the Bay Area because of better job opportunities.  Yes, the very blue pill, very liberal California.  I live in the Bay Area.  I mean, I commute to the Bay Area.  And I have some very, very, very funny stories of what goes on in the corporate world in liberal California.  Let me tell you, there's some crazy shit, guys.  Ask yourself, how bad do you want it?  How bad do you really want to live this red pill lifestyle going your own way?  How bad do you truly want to sacrifice?  Do you want to sacrifice going to bars and clubs on the weekends and instead work on a trait?  You want to build something?  Or you just want to be like everyone else your age?  And go party on the weekends, blow all your money that you've earned, that you've worked for.  Blow your money on your girlfriend.  Get fat, get out of shape.  You don't want to live like that.  That's what everyone does.  That's just that's that's going to waste your life away.  You're going to feel incomplete as a man.  Our purpose as a man is not to do that.  And I know when I've settled down into feeling like, boy, I need to be providing for this woman or I need to be.  I need to be going and drinking and like turning up every weekend, blowing all my money I've worked so hard for.  I have literally felt so empty and shallow as a man.  It's a feeling of being incomplete.  But when you're on your purpose and you're passionate about something, you work hard for something, I'm passionate about this channel.  And I want it to grow.  And I want to spread this message.  The younger you can fully take the red pill and completely just accept it for what it is, realize your mistakes, move on, and better yourself as a man, the better off you will be.  sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice guys and i'm telling you it will pay off in the end.  if your heart's truly there and you really want to grow and you really want to sacrifice for the right reasons you can do it.  um your purpose must be something that you truly desire and you're truly passionate about.  don't let negative comments of friends co-workers or family like knocked you off track of your grind and hustle.  They're just haters.  They don't understand this whole red pill philosophy.  They still have blue pill lens on.  They're not going to understand why we do what we do, why we are so much different, why we do not prioritize others ahead of ourselves.  And why we don't pedestalize women.  That sort of thing.  They're not going to understand it.  So just don't.  Whatever they say, let it roll off you like water off the back of a duck.  Let that shit just roll off you.  And only allow others around you that will build you up and add value to your purpose.  If you dare add a woman to your life, I'm encouraging you truly not to add a woman to your life.  But if you do add a woman to your life, make sure that she's adding some sort of value, some sort of purpose.  Like she's helping you build something.  She's helping you build a brand.  AMS has talked about this.  Step This Cold has talked about this.  They can only be in your life if they are adding to you.  If they are not adding to you, they have no purpose in your life.  So cut them out.  Alright?  You can have sex with them.  But don't invite them in your inner circle.  And don't become blue pill and simp over them.  Because at the end of the day, they are women.  Alright?  And loneliness is a time of reflection.  Does the man you are destined to become show through your actions?  Does it?  Does the man that you truly want to be, does it show through your actions?  What are you doing each day to improve as a man?  You have to ask yourself these questions.  What am I doing to improve my situation?  What are some things I can work on to improve my situation?  Guys, it's 2020 and it's time that we as men improve.  Build a relationship with our purpose and not with women.  I don't want to see you guys simping anymore.  I gave up simping a long time ago.  I used to be a super blue pill beta simp guy.  And I've given that shit up.  Guys, it is so much more freeing to be red pill aware and walk through life with a red pill lens.  I want you guys to build a relationship with your purpose.  Find... something that you can capitalize on and that you can bring to better the world, better yourself, and you will physically, mentally, spiritually be unstoppable.  Thank you, guys. ",
