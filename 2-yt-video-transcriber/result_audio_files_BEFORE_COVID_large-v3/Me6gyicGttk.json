            "text": "Hi everyone, I'm Barry Stagner and this is Channel Newsbreak.  The G7 summit in France took place amid sharp differences between the United States and its allies on a range of global issues, including trade, climate change, and Iran's nuclear program.  The summit wrapped up this past Monday with US President Donald Trump hailing the quote, tremendous unity end quote between himself and the leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada.  It was truly a successful G7, he said, standing alongside France's President Emmanuel Macron, who hosted this year's gathering.  But just how much did the leaders of the seven advanced economies achieve in their three days of talks?  The summit took place amid fears that an escalating trade war between the US and China could tip the slowing world economy into a recession.  On Monday, Trump held out an olive branch, heaping praise on China's President Xi Jinping, saying negotiations would resume very soon on ending the year-long dispute, which has seen tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods on both sides.  Chinese officials had been in contact overnight, Trump said.  China has taken a very large hit in the last few months, 3 million jobs.  It will soon be much more than 3 million jobs.  Their chain is breaking up like no one has seen before.  And once that happens, it's very hard to put it back together.  I think they very much want to make a deal, according to President Trump.  Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also spoke on the subject, saying, I hope there will be good results from U.S.-China trade negotiations that will help stabilize the global economy.  Earlier on Monday, Chinese Premier Li He, who had been leading the talks with Washington, said China was willing to resolve the trade dispute through calm negotiations and opposed any increase in trade tensions.  The G7 pledge to spend more than $20 million on fighting fires tearing through the Amazon rainforest was a point of convergence for the group's leaders.  The agreement was made at a meeting on climate change that Trump did not attend.  But Macron said the U.S.  supported the initiative.  Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro denounced the plan, however, saying it treated his country like a colony or a no-man's land.  The G7 summit was Boris Johnson's first foray into global diplomacy as Britain's new Prime Minister and came amid an impasse between London and the EU over its impending departure from the 28-nation bloc.  He said he was marginally more optimistic about the chances of clinching a divorce deal by the October 31 exit deadline, but acknowledged it would be difficult.  The EU has so far rejected negotiating a new deal, which was approved by the British government under Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, but repeatedly rejected by the country's parliament.  Europe is very much unified in its representation here, said Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.  We will have some work to do in the autumn on Britain's exit, so we face some busy weeks ahead.  Before the summit, Johnson and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, had traded barbs over who would be known as Mr.  No Deal if Britain crashed out of the EU without an agreement.  He later found a more congenial partner in Trump who promised a very big trade deal with post-Brexit Britain, bringing Russia back, also came onto the table.  And there was no agreement on whether or not Russia should be readmitted to what used to be the GA.  But Trump said he was inclined to invite Russia's President Putin back to next year's summit in the US, saying it was better to have Moscow in the tent rather than outside the tent.  Well, once again, we know that there are going to be bizarre things happening on the highest of levels around the world, negotiations to move towards a single system of world governance, giving us today's reminder to keep looking up.
