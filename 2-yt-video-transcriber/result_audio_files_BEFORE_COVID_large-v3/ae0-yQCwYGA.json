            "text": "what's up everybody?  i just want to do a quick video here.  it seems that apparently according to at ravishing on twitter here that uh someone has been arrested outside of the trump rally in dallas said it was one man a counter protester outside the venue and he's wearing headgear a vest a backpack had a gun on him a breathing mask and an aerosol.  can she continues down here show some uh pictures?  she said a local reporter at center looks like the mask and a few of his things and then this picture here looks like the gun and a vest.  Now, again, this hasn't been reported in the news.  I'm not so sure how much something like this would be reported in the news.  I get the feeling that a lot of this is suppressed by the White House.  But I have to assume that this actually is real based on a few cryptic things that have happened this week, actually three.  first one here is nancy pelosi.  i mean she's just losing it to begin with.  but uh she pulls up her arm and says oh this is a bracelet this is an orange bracelet made a bullet.  and then says i told the president we're not going away like they're very very cryptic.

You even got on part three of the Project Veritas video that CNN that came out today saying, oh, the only way it's going to go away when Trump dies, hopefully soon.  Hopefully soon.  Ukraine thing?  Or just Trump in general?  Trump in general.  The only way this will go away is when he dies.  hopefully soon you got tom arnold big mouth.  tom arnold tweeting today.  don't get too cocky traitor.  they showed up for jfk too jfk who was shot in dallas.  where is exactly where trump is speaking tonight?  do they know something?  we don't know.  and he said nancy had that meltdown the other day at the white house.  but i mean that's too many little slip-ups and especially biden of the 17th and they catches himself.  if he would have just went with it no one would have thought anything.

            "text": "I mean, are you, is this guy senile?  He's literally answering a question about his son.  making billion dollar contracts with foreign influencers while he was the vice president of the United States.  I mean, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what George Washington meant when he said he was scared of foreign influence on the frigging White House.  Like, you know, China giving your son a billion and a half dollar contract.  What do you think they did?  The kindness of their heart?  Think they did that because he's so good at his job?  No, they did that so they could buy the ear of the vice president of the United States.  You think the billion dollar deal from the Ukraine was legit?  That's just to buy political favors.  That's why they do these things.  What about Biden's brother getting a concrete contract out of Iraq for over a billion dollars?  I mean, who didn't have this guy's ear?  This might be the most foreign influenced man in the entire history of the White House.  And he's got the nerve.  This is how he answers this question.  But either way, something shady.  They are falling apart before our eyes.  Now talking about.  orange bullet bracelets.  i mean they call him orange man.  that's literally what they do and say.  well i told the president we're not going away.  this bumbling idiot said oh the 17th right after saying he has to be removed.  i mean cnn talking about oh hopefully soon as if that's a possibility.  And then lo and behold, some guy in professional gear caught outside of the Dallas rally on the 17th, arrested with a gun, a mask, and an aerosol can.  I mean, was that, is that a biological weapon?  I hope everyone's paying attention to this.  I mean, not you guys.  I know you guys are.  But I mean, I hope the general public is starting to see what the hell is really going on in Washington right now.  What is really going on with Trump?  Because this is just insane.  But anyway, say an extra prayer for everyone in Dallas tonight and the president because thank God this man was caught. ",
