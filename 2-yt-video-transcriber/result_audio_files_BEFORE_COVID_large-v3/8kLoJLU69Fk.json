No, I'm asking you a question.  Detained for what?  I didn't do nothing wrong.  You can't fucking tell me I'm detained.  And you can't tell me fucking shit, dude.  No, you can't, dude.  No, you can't.  Try what?  What law did I break?  I didn't break any law.  I didn't break any law.  I want him to prove it.  Prove it.  No, I'd like... No, dude, you're not... We didn't trespass anything.  We didn't.  We didn't.  We didn't.  We didn't.  We were on the sidewalk when he drove up on us and he asked us what we were doing.  I'm not taking a seat, dude.  I don't have to sit down.  I don't have to sit down.  I'm not a fucking dog, dude.  I don't have to sit down.  I'm not giving you anything.  We didn't break any law.  He's lying.  How about that?  There's two of us here.  Okay, then go get your camera and show it to them so you can prove it because until then I'm not doing anything.  I didn't trespass anywhere.  I even asked you where exactly is private and you try to tell me all of this is private, which is a fucking lie, dude.  You lied, bro.  No, you lied.  I asked you specifically.  These are public sidewalks right here.  Yeah, which is what we're doing.  We're not riding them.  We're riding them.  We're not riding them.  We're walking.  And you've been following us around.  for what reason, dude?  We're in bright clothing.  Are we ducking behind bushes?  Nope.  All right.  Are we making a nuisance?  How?  Walking around quietly, having a conversation and enjoying what's around here.  That's not nothing wrong.  I want to know what lie broke because you're trying to claim my trespass.  I didn't trespass anything.  And when you said we were on that private property, what did we immediately do?  If we were on it.  Then you just admitted that you were on the property.  No, if we were on it.  It's a sidewalk.  This is all sidewalk.  It looks like sidewalk.  We walked onto it.  We can take you back to that building and show you exactly what we did.  We're not inside of the halls.  We're not walking, jumping fences or anything.  Okay?  I don't appreciate you coming up here and trying to tell me whatever you just tried to do.  And I don't appreciate you all of a sudden assuming that we're guilty of something that you have no idea of.  He said.  Okay, and your job is to come and ask.  No, it's not.  Oh, it's not?  You have to investigate.  supposedly?  If a crime was committed?  Aren't you supposed to investigate?  And we didn't.  We didn't.  We didn't trespass.  When you trespass is when you're asked to leave.  Okay?  And we've been on public sidewalks.  Did we not leave?  We did not, I didn't admit anything to you.  I'm explaining to you what happened.  First of all, first of all, I'm giving you the courtesy of explaining something because I didn't have to explain anything to you because he didn't trespass, okay?  You think because we have skateboards or some shit, we're like up to no good?  Dude, that's fucked up.  We're just walking.  Irrelevant of the time.  We're on the sidewalk, dude.  You can't tell people.  You try to tell me this was private.  You fucking lie, dude.  That's where we were at earlier.  None of these signs say private roads.  These are public fucking sidewalks, dude.  What the fuck is going on?  And you try to tell me to fucking sit down and you try to bark at me, dude?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I don't appreciate that shit because I'm calmly walking.  What if I was on a bike as a girl in a fucking dumbass suit that those guys wear?  You wouldn't say shit to us.  Please, be fucking real, dude. ",

I'm not here for a popularity contest, but I much appreciate you guys doing that.  But it's not necessary, guys, really.  Just comment, let the guy know you support what he did in the video.
