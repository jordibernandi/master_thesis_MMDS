Here's the thing, genuinely believing in a flat earth or similar cosmologies is an uneducated position.  And I mean, you presumably had access to proper education your whole life, high school at the very least.  And as such, it's kind of shocking when you go against what everyone has been taught through their entire lives.  and what every scientist has been saying for millennia.  But it's a bit different for traditional indigenous beliefs.  For one, I don't know how many native people still genuinely believe in those old cosmologies.  They may just be old ideas that they remember for the sake of preserving their culture.  Another thing to consider is that Native Americans don't have as much access to proper education, what with poverty and the 54% dropout rate among Native Americans.  It's, uh... Sadly, things are really tough for Native Americans.  But I see this argument coming up every now and then amongst Flat Earthers that, uh, ancient or old civilizations believed in a Flat Earth 2, or some similar sort of model, so it's not that crazy.  Well, I mean, isn't it funny that as civilizations began to advance, they started to accept the globe Earth?  It's almost as if things appear to be flat at first, but when you really scrutinize the idea and you analyze the facts, you know, the measurements, observations, and such, the Earth proves itself to be round.

I don't know why George Carlin is the face of this all of a sudden, but point is, these guys have to ignore the authorities.  And that's because every space agency, as well as every astronomer, and every astrophysicist, and well, every scientist in general, says that the Earth is a globe, and they've given pretty strong evidence for it.

Does the moon rotate on its axis?  Now, this seems like it should be a pretty easy question to answer, one that an educated populace would be able to answer without so much as a glance at a textbook or looking the answer up online.

That's all the Flat Earth Hypothesis is.  I've actually made a video about that topic, and you can check it out here.  If I can remember to put it there, I'm pretty bad at remembering it.
