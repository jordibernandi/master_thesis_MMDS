            "text": "So some messages got leaked on Onision's Patreon.  For those of you who don't know, Patreon is a service in which consumers like yourself give a creator money.  It can be in tiers.  Essentially, you create a different level of tiers, $1 tier, a $5 tier, a $20 tier, and then you give your audience something back in return for money.  For example, my own Patreon I have set up to where if people want a webcam with me every single month, there's a pledge to do that.  It's a really cool concept, and a lot of creators use Patreon.  However, for those of you who don't know, with the financial rut that Onision put himself into, and the fact that every single one of his videos for the most part gets demonetized, Onision primarily relies upon Patreon to pay his house payments and all of his other expenses.  And that's fine, that's cool.  yo, there's nothing wrong with somebody doing that.  Your Patreon is used for yourself, to use your money that you get for however you see fit, or to give back to the community that you've created.  But there is something wrong with someone like Onision when he makes a big deal about harassing somebody who un-pledges them.  When someone un-pledges your Patreon, that means that they're no longer giving you money monthly.  So let's take a look at Onision's Patreon.  A couple months ago, he was making almost $3,000 a month on Patreon.  He was roughly, I think it was like $2,700 a month, $2,500 a month, and he stooped down to $1,900 a month.  You can see that he has three different goals, that if he hits $15,000 per month, he's going to send autographs to 10 random Patreons and 10 DVDs featuring his best Onision content.  If he reaches $8,000 a month, he's going to make a full movie with all of Onision's characters.  If he hits $4,000 a month, he's going to make a TV pilot with Onision's characters.  If people want to pay for that pathetic garbage of a content creator, by all means, they're entitled to do so.  However, I just find it an absolute gem on how he's lost so much money in the past few months.  Well, actually, it is no surprise, because once you see these messages, you'll understand why exactly people are pulling their pledges.  Because if you are a content creator, a content creator on Twitch, on YouTube, on any site, and you treat your fans who give you money like absolute garbage, they're not going to want to give you money.  What is so hard to understand about this clearly difficult concept that Onision doesn't seem to comprehend?  If you treat people like crap, they're not going to want to give you money, whether it's a dollar, two dollars, or five dollars.  But let's see what Onision says.  I wanted to apologize for something.  I'm sending this to everyone that I did could have impacted.  A few months back, I removed the possibility of being a $1 patron of mine.  I did this so I could batch all the $1-$5 pledges into a $3 pledge to simplify their needs and combine the perks.  Unfortunately, my actions led to an exit survey I read today that informed me that they wished that they could continue being a patron but could not afford $3.  I had essentially lost patrons because of what I thought was a good way to simplify all my patrons' rewards slash tiers.  I've returned the $1 pledge for the most so anybody can afford my patron again.  I hope you guys realize how stupid this makes Greg.  Because the whole point of making a $1 tier on your Patreon, that a lot of people have, myself included, is so if people don't have lots of money to give you, $5 a month to give you, they can go on the cheapest side, which is $1.  the majority of my patrons are one dollar patrons.  whether someone gives me one dollar five dollars fifty dollars a hundred dollars i treat them all the same because a dollar is a dollar.  five dollars is five dollars and if they can't afford five dollars or three dollars versus they can't afford one dollar that's okay.  why would i take that?  that's the whole point of having tears on patreon.  so you give people flexibility to be able to afford to give you what they want.  But Greg's so stupid in his little small pea brain.  This is the same guy who, remember, blamed TurboTax for his wrong deductions.  He blamed the software.  Let's remember, guys, he blamed the software TurboTax for his own wrong deductions for taxes.  So he now eliminates a $1 Patreon tier.  in hopes that he'll get more money because he's going to put all the perks into a $3 tier.  But Patreon is about affordability to the consumers who are giving you money.  If you take away their ability to give you a $1 pledge, you're going to lose money.  This just goes to show how stupid and how unprofessional and like he lacks simple basic business practices so he could make the money that he supposedly needs.  But regardless, we all know that he's dumb when it comes to finances.  That much has been established.  So let's see what exactly he said to a patron of his who decided to revoke, get this, who decided to revoke a $2 pledge.  $2 per month.  $2 per month.  I have to emphasize this again.  $2 per month.  This is not $100, $200, and even if it was, it still doesn't justify this type of response that Onision gives.  Hey, it's Greg Onision.  You were once a patron of mine.  Is there anything I could do to ever earn your pledge back?  My patron is such a huge deal to me, and so are all of my patrons.  Anytime someone un-pledges on Onision's Patreon, this is the default message that he sends them.  But literally, we had an argument a few months ago.  I support Shane.  End of discussion.  I'm not going to pay you money to be an internet slime ball.  And honestly, I agree with her.  Why would you want to give somebody money or donate to anyone who treats people like garbage and then makes up slanderous claims about somebody?  that are the worst things that you can accuse somebody of?  If you want to earn pledges back, you'll quit being an SJW and go back to the old Onision that wore a banana and minded his own business.  I don't believe that you're a he as much as I don't believe Shane is.  I will just politely retract my patronage.  I'm not going to be a psycho and lose it on you because I don't want hate videos made about me.  But we can both agree to disagree about this.  And I'll continue watching Shane.  I'm not holding this against Lainey either, still subbed and still watcher, but I can't respect your views anymore.  Thanks for the nine years of entertainment, have a good one.  So I entertain you for nine years and you turn your back on me because I called a guy out for being undeniably creepy?  He even admitted and apologized for his creepy behavior.  What is your logic?  Punishing me because of the guy that you're defending agreed with me?  First of all, first of all, Dimbo.  Shane never agreed with the things that you claimed about him, which were absolutely vitriolic in nature, completely slanderous, and just simply not true.  To be honest, I've been watching less and less for the past few months, so that's another factor.  But yes, I'm going to stop watching you because I strongly disagree with your views.  Chill out, man.  I don't want to argue.  At this point, I actually think this is somewhat borderline harassment of a patron of yourself, which is against patrons' rules and regulations.  Like, if someone unpledges you, you don't get up in their DMs and start insulting them and trying to make them feel guilty for unpledging you.  That's really slimy tactic.  It's completely within the consumer's right to not want to contribute money to somebody who has done horrible things, or their views don't reflect their own.  If they don't want to pledge to somebody, they don't have to.  Her money is her money.  And at the end of the day, you have to accept that, Greg Onision.  And if you don't, you don't deserve to have a Patreon, much less make even $1,900 a month.  My one less view and $2 is not going to bankrupt you, Greg.  And you didn't just call the guy creepy.  You called him a... Predator.  There's a difference between being creepy and being a predator.  Predators do and say exactly the things he did and said.  Do I really need to go through a long list of things he directly did against children?  Do I have to go through a long list of all the disgusting things that he has said?  He literally harassed a 12 year old.  Jesus Christ, lecturing me isn't going to get me back on your side.  Take the lost man.  be a grown up, and just move on.  Sorry that losing a fan gets you super upset.  Yes, someone who cares enough to reply to a fan.  Best wishes for you and Shane.  Could you not be condescending?  I like the guy's content, not a crime.  Same to you.  If you notice that last sentence there, it says, yes, someone who cares enough to reply to a fan.  Greg, you're not replying to a fan out of kindness.  You're replying to a fan because you're upset that they don't agree with your worldview and your screwed up thinking and that they revoked $2.  Who gets upset at $2, man?  That's the most absurd.  That's like something a 10-year-old would do is get upset that his mommy or daddy didn't give him $2 to buy a candy bar.  That's the level of juvenile thinking that you operate by.  And at the end of the day, my money and the consumer's money who watch me are completely their own.  If I say something really screwed up or I do something really crappy to somebody else... and somebody doesn't want to support me, and they don't want to donate to me, that's their prerogative.  Why would I get upset by that?  I don't live and operate through the internet based upon, oh, one fan doesn't like what I said on this, so therefore I'm going to rage them out on DMs because they took away $2 or $5 pledges.  That's pure absurdity.  And quite frankly, I hope that your Patreon diminishes even more.  Because not only are you breaking Patreon rules by trying to harass a fan, by trying to make them feel guilty for taking away $2 because they didn't agree with you, but it goes to show how desperately financially reliant you are on fans.  Which, honestly, is one of the worst things you can possibly do, is to rely strictly upon an income from fans only.  It is extremely stressful to go down that route, relying upon a fluctuated income from Patreon.  And you have to ask yourself, Greg, why are other than you being crappy to patrons, why are people un-pledging to you on Patreon?  Maybe it's the fact that your quality has went down abysmally in the last few months.  I mean, now you're uploading on your channel mobile videos, vertical videos, vertical phone videos of you and your little stupid wigs just doing these weird random rants as your Onision characters.  You're like stuck in 2009 and you can't move forward to make something new and original without using your old content that nobody watches anymore. ",

That's another huge reason why your channels have failed, why you're losing Patreons, because people outgrow you.  And you can't deal with the fact that people outgrow you because you're still the child yourself!  So next week I have a video hitting your sub boxes that you guys will want to watch in regards to EC and Onision because he's made a bunch of videos about her.  and I have been slowly collecting a plethora of stuff from him in regards to not only his complete double standards, but his lies.  I'm literally going to start just calling out lies as lies in my next video on him and EC.  So be looking forward to that in your sub boxes.  All my socials are linked down below.  I'm streaming today on Monday and tomorrow and Thursday.  I stream on Twitch three days a week every single week.  If you want to catch me live, if you want to watch me live, if you want to see me play video games, follow my Twitch at twitch.tv.  slash Repzion.  That's the best way to talk to me.  Until next time, thanks for watching this video. ",
