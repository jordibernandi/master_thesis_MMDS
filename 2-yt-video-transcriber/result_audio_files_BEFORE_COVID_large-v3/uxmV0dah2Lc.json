Socialism's record isn't hard to parse.  First it was tragedy, now it's a farce.  Let's unite people for every nation in peace, exchange, and cooperation. ",

            "text": "Liberalism arose as a political and economic philosophy of individual liberty.  Its modern origin is John Locke in his Second Treatise on Government, where he speaks of each individual's natural right to his life, liberty, and property.  That's encapsulated, for instance, in the American Declaration of Independence.  We hold these truths to be self-evident.  And that is the starting point for Mises's liberalism, that a liberal society is one that recognizes the freedom the autonomy, and the dignity of each individual.  It is not the duty of the state to regulate, control, intrude, direct, educate, brainwash, or micromanage the affairs of the individual.  The individual is considered to be a self-governing entity who should be viewed as having the latitude and liberty to determine his own goals and select his own peaceful means. ",

            "text": "Liberalism was born to solve the problem of religious conflict.  So there's two ways you can solve heterogeneity in religion or religious differences in society.  You can have one winner and force everybody else to convert.  That caused a lot of bloodshed throughout Europe.  Or you can just announce, all right, believe whatever you want.  That's fine.  Just don't interfere with anybody else's right to believe what they want.  Let's try that, see how it works, and then we'll go back and revisit the question later.  Well, it was tried and it did work.  So the idea of liberalism was just gradual unfolding of this discovery that freedom was working better than any attempt to impose results on society.  And so it began with religion, but yeah, then it went to printing and publishing and speeches, you know, and so freedom of speech.  And then it came to civil rights and the right to move, the right to own, the right to train, start your own businesses.  The guild system started collapsing.  Liberalism is the word we use to describe the gradual unfolding of freedom from the late Middle Ages all the way through the 19th century.  this ever more discovery of applications for how we should be free in ever more ways.  So liberalism was the reason slavery went away.  It was the reason capitalism made so much progress, why you can believe whatever you want, why you can start a business, why you can make progress, why you can marry who you want.  Liberalism gave us universal rights.  So all these things liberalism gave the world.  But, you know, by the 20th century, there had been this big revolt against liberalism, really that began in the late 19th century.  It really began earlier, but it really began to take shape in the early part of the 20th century.  So Mises seemed to be, to many of his contemporaries, a throwback.  They didn't think of themselves as old-fashioned, but everybody else tried to characterize them that way.  He thought of himself as a modern guy.  He thought statism or socialism was a reactionary ideology. ",

            "text": "The market economy is essential to preserve that liberty.  Without private property, there is no liberty of any form at all.  If the state owns all the means of production, then it owns all the printing presses.  It owns all the paper and the ink.  Who then decides what gets in books, in magazines, in newspapers?  The state.  The Soviet Union had a beautiful constitution under Stalin in the 1930s, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion.  But what freedom when the only thing that gets in the media is determined by the government because they own all the newspapers?  What religion can you have when the state determines what resources will be allocated and land permitted for the construction of some building?  And comrade, if there are other purposes that are of a higher social value, you're out of luck if you and some other people wanted to have a church for common worship of your faith.  That is the kind of tyranny that the critics of socialism in the 19th century liberal era warned against and which all manifested themselves following the communist revolution in Russia and then in other countries.  Therefore, this idea of the market and private property and competition and the ability of alternatives and rivals and entrepreneurs trying to satisfy what consumers want, therefore, was seen by Mises as the only institutional setting that assured both prosperity, the self-interest motive of pursuing profit and trying to do better, and the new and the different and less expensive, and at the same time the setting that gave the individual a wide latitude of personal choice and autonomy that he could never have under a socialist regime.  That's what it meant for Mises to be a liberal.  And he, in fact, wrote a book about this in 1927 called Liberalism. ",
