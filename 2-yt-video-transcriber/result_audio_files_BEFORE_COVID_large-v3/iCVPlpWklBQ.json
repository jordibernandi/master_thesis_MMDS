Over time, I've come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself.  I got something important wrong.  I got something important really wrong.  I didn't understand that back then, the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities.  I was totally focused on saving lives.  But as we know, good intentions aren't good enough.  I now see that we could and should have acted sooner and acted faster to cut the stops.  I wish we had.  I'm sorry that we didn't.  But I can't change history. ",

Excuse me.  They went to the Supreme Court.  This thing went through courts.  What do you mean?  nobody told you?  You had a plethora of attorneys telling you.  You had the NAACP telling you.  You had Al Sharpton telling you.  You had hundreds of people telling you.  You had lawyers telling you.  Isn't this a... I mean, and he just sounds so sincere.  I just didn't understand.  But, you know, as I look towards my future, I'm focusing also on my past.  Translation, I want to run for president of the United States.  And so, therefore, you know, I've changed my position.  Look, even the police commissioner or the president of the, I don't know, was it the union, police union?  They're even jumping him.  I hate to be on their side.  Usually I'm, you know, but they know BS when they hear it.  Oh, come on.  He would have been better.  You know what he would have been better doing?  Look, man, I apologize.  I apologize.  I was wrong.  Period.  And the courts proved me wrong.  This is what you call political expediency.  This is bull.  Man, I wouldn't put... This is bull.  And I'm going to tell you, I just said to Sam, let's get Bloomberg on.  I was with, hey, we got something in common.  We were on stage together at Washington University when they gave you an honorary doctorate degree of law.  I got the same one at the same time.  We talked.  No, he won't remember.  No, I'm serious.  He won't remember.  He might.  He might not.  I don't know.  I personally don't care.  But if he was sitting next to me, And anybody out there knowing, tell him, come on in here.  Because if I was, you know, I don't give a damn that he's a billionaire.  I really don't.
