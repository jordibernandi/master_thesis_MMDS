Let me just tell you, I'm not gonna use the name of the guy.  But this is how he is described.  He had a chilling journal of demented scribbling and satanic drawings, spoke of hunting someone at the University of Dayton, Seek and destroy, it said.  He was very ADHD, paranoid, schizophrenic, strong bipolar.  He ranted about drugs, violence, and women, referring to them as bitches, even being dissatisfied by his own looks.  His friends said that he was smoking methamphetamines all the time when they were hanging out.  He thought Donald Trump was a bad guy or a dumb guy, but didn't like Hillary Clinton either.  what's do you think the?  what do you think the narrative was on shooting number one? ",

This one happened in El Paso, Texas, and Donald Trump was immediately because the media said his manifesto talked about illegal immigrants, okay?  And how they were invading the country.  So for two days, we had Fox News stop using the word invade on the air, okay?  But I wanna read his manifesto because A, we never read manifestos, I never do.  But this one is important to correct the record.  You tell me who's responsible.  My ideology has not changed for several years.  My opinions on automation, immigration and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president.  I'm putting this here because some people will blame the president or certain presidential candidates for the attack.  But this is not the case.  He then goes on, talks about the need for universal basic income.  for universal health care, and he ends like this.  The American lifestyle affords our citizens an incredible quality of life.  However, our lifestyle is destroying the environment and our country.  The decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations.  Corporations are heading to the destruction of our environment by shamelessly over-harvesting our resources.  This has been a problem for decades.  brilliantly portrayed in the decades old classic, the Lorax.  Watersheds around the country, especially agricultural areas being depleted, fresh water polluted from farming and oil drilling.  He goes on and on and on.  He ends it with this.  I just want to say that I love the people of this country.  But goddamn, most of y'all are just too stubborn to change your lifestyle.  So I guess the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using resources.  If we can just get enough rid of enough people, then our way of life can be sustainable.  Does that sound like a Trump supporter to you? ",
