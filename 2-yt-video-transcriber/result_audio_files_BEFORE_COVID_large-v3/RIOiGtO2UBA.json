Germany foolishly shut down a lot of their nuclear plants, so what did they wind up doing instead?  They wound up burning more coal.  France, on the other hand, gets more than 70% of its power from nuclear energy.  They pay some of the lowest electricity rates in Europe, and their emissions are excellent. ",
