            "text": "If you've ever driven Interstate 15 in Southern California to Las Vegas, Nevada, then you've likely come across an odd sight in the middle of the desert between Barstow and Baker, an abandoned water park.  I can't wait to tell you all about it, so be sure to like this video, subscribe to this channel, and turn on notifications.  during its forty two year operation this now defunct water park has gone by several names.  when it first opened in nineteen sixty two the park went by lake dolores and was named after owner bob byer's wife.  it featured a two hundred seventy three acre man-made lake and a basic campground but eventually morphed into a full-blown water park over the following two decades with the addition of water slides and other attractions Kept in business mostly by Vegas-bound motorists, the park reached peak attendance between the 1970s and mid-1980s before a decline in popularity forced it to shut its doors.  In 1990, the property was sold to an ambitious three-person investment group with a vision of rebranding the park with a 1950s rock and roll theme.  It reopened on the 4th of July in 1998 as Rockahula Waterpark and featured several attractions reminiscent of the classic rock era, such as the Big Bopper waterslide.  Despite its flashy new reboot, the new and improved Rockahula Waterpark didn't survive very long.  It was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000 after amassing $3 million in debt and losing a $4.4 million lawsuit after an employee was seriously injured in 1999.  Attempts were made during the 2000s to reboot the park for a third time, however nothing ever came of them and the park has been sitting vacant since the summer of 2004. since that time the remains of the park have either been destroyed in acts of arson or vandalized with graffiti.  it has also been the set of numerous low-budget films and skater videos.  If you feel like visiting the park for yourself, do so at your own risk, but I'll put specific coordinates in the description below.  The park is located roughly 15 miles from the city of Barstow, California, using Interstate 15 North.  Before you go, I'm curious to hear from you.  If you've ever visited Lake Dolores or Rockahula Water Park, let me know what your experience was like in the comments down below.  Thanks for tuning in, and as always, remember to never stop exploring! ",
