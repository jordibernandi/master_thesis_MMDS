It's the second of your big three policies, Medicare for all being the third, we've heard of that.  You say the emphasis right now on corporate profits isn't working.  Human-centered capitalism focuses on three primary principles.  One, people are more important than money.  Two, a dollar is not the economic unit.  People are in that case.  Three, markets exist to serve the common goals and values of society.  This is now getting into, I guess, economic theory.  I don't know if I particularly get it, and maybe a lot of people watching at home don't get it.  So how would this change daily life, I guess, as we know it?  What changes for businesses or jobs or how we pay for things if a dollar is not the economic? ",

And GDP would measure her work at zero, and the market would value her work at zero.  Yet we know that her work is among the most valuable work that anyone can do, and that our society should, if anything, be channeling more energy and resources towards that sort of work.  So right now, we're in another trap, which is that GDP is going up and up, even as more Iowans and Americans are getting left behind.  And you can see it in the stats.  Life expectancy is declining.  Drug addiction is climbing.  Suicides are at record highs.  Our labor force participation rate is at a multi-decade low.  It's the same levels as El Salvador and the Dominican Republic.  If you look at those measurements, you can see we're not doing very well.  But then if you look at headline GDP, you're like, oh, things are going great.  So we have the wrong measuring sticks right now, and what human-centered capitalism is about is trying to make the measuring sticks the things that actually matter to us, like how healthy we are, how our kids are doing.

Public libraries can play a big role in this, because right now they have community bulletin boards that people turn to to see what's going on in their community.
