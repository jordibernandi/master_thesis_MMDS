            "text": "Following my video about the false rape accuser, Sarah Parkinson, so many people have contacted me with tales of women behaving appallingly.  I've seen photos of knife wounds from violent wives, heard from a mother whose son committed suicide following false violence accusations.  I've heard stories of mothers using their children in endless family court battles.  And here's Gillette telling us it's men who are brutal and vicious.  Obviously, I'm not saying that most women behave like that, but the truth is neither gender has a monopoly on vice or virtue.  And while our cultural dialogue resounds with women condemning men for their bad behaviour, it's really rare that men dare publicly voice complaints about the way women behave.  Jordan Peterson is visiting Australia next week, which reminded me of his first visit here almost a year ago.  I just started making YouTube videos when I heard I was going to be MC at a couple of his events and would be able to interview him.  I rather nervously prepared for the event with the great man, very aware of how much I admired his knowledge and intellect and courage over so many issues.  One of the few areas I took issue with him was his willingness to push men to step up and act responsibly, to take up their load when he so rarely calls out women over their deficiencies or bad behaviour.  This was actually just after the famous Cathy Newman interview, which taught me I'd be crazy to take him on.  So what ended up happening in my interview with him was I made various comments about women behaving badly, which seemed to give him license to be a little bit more outspoken about women's inappropriate behavior.  Here's a classic example where I suggested he's wrong in thinking that women aren't exercising their newfound power. ",

After that time, Peterson had made a few vague comments about sexual obligation in marriage.  But here I pushed the issue a bit more and he went a lot further.  Men always say to me, how do I know I pick a woman who will see this as part of the marriage contract, as you were saying, as it used to be?  Because plenty of women now just shut up shop if they're not interested.  Is that something you've encountered in your clinical work? ",

It's like, what's the minimum, this is something every couple needs to ask, what's the minimum requirement for sexual intimacy in your relationship?  Zero?  No.  Wrong.  You're going to be torturing each other to death over that.  So yes, you can say zero, but believe me, there's a price to be paid for that.  Well, I'm willing to pay the price.  Okay, well, no problem.  Say, well, what's the minimal requirement?  My sense with couples is that if they're not intimate, something approximating one to two times a week at a bare minimum, with an accompanying 90 minutes of conversation about their ongoing marital relationship, like their life, that they drift apart and then they start to go to war with one another.  And then they develop stress-related illnesses and get old fast and bitter. ",

He always treads very carefully about not blaming women for anything.  Yet Peterson does sometimes challenge the feminist orthodoxy, such as his famous comment in the Vice interview, where he's talking about sexual harassment and points out women wear lipstick and heels for a reason.  But he's still very careful to frame his answers generally, rather than naming women's manipulative behaviour.  Here's our exchange about that lipstick comment.  Now, one of the things that fascinated me was that Vice interview where you talked about women wearing high heels and lipstick.  And what I thought was extraordinary was the reaction of your interviewer, who was clearly gobsmacked at the idea and your concept that this had something to do with being sexually provocative. ",

And it's very hard for people to do that because people tend to react when you're thinking about something abstractly as if reality itself is at stake, which you can't really do if you're going to think because you have to consider a wide range of possibilities and weigh them.  And so that's what I was doing in that interview.  I was putting forward a question.  It's like, well, if we're going to regulate sexual behavior in the workplace, which we apparently are hell-bent on doing, then fair enough.  Where's your boundaries exactly?  To what degree are we going to regulate it?  And I don't mean vaguely.  I mean exactly how are we going to regulate it.

And as an academic who spent much of his working life surrounded by feminists, he's learned to be very cautious about calling out women's misbehaviour.  I confronted a similar mindset in another interview, this time with Australian Josh Zeps, who has a podcast called We the People.  I think that podcast was actually really worth listening to because it ranged over a huge, wide range of issues.  And Zephs is really smart.  He's a clever interviewer who's well known for listening carefully and welcoming diverse views.  However, he's also a self-confessed lefty.  He presents occasionally on ABC radio, which should tell you everything about him.  Naturally, he's surrounded there by women who feed him the usual feminist claptrap on the sort of issues I talk about.  He introduces my podcast, sounding almost apologetic for including my interview in his series.  He stresses so many times how controversial I was.  Speaking to him, I was very conscious that he was being exposed to views he'd rarely heard voiced.  Like my talk about the fake rape crisis at our universities, and the way feminist activists are shutting down debate on female sexual responsibility.  He's really challenging and sceptical at the start of the long interview, but as it progresses, he ends up supporting many of my arguments.  I actually think he found himself surprised to be agreeing with me on issues which I'm sure would have had his feminist listeners grinding their teeth.  So here we're talking about whether no always does mean no.  And I refer to the hugely popular romance novels, which often include themes of reluctant women being seduced into sex.  Zephs bravely responds with a story that supports my argument.  They think they have to play games and not say yes initially, and they want him to.  to break down their resistance.  Have you ever looked at, you know, there's a whole genre of chick flick, chick lit stuff, you know, the bodice rippers, the romance novels, which are all about women.  One of the major themes is women saying no, no, no, no.  And he, and then yes, yes, yes, yes.  When he pushes through that resistance ",

Yeah, you're right that there is a cultural trope that up until three seconds ago in cultural time has been regarded as uncontroversial, which is that women sometimes play a cockatish type who isn't interested in sex and wants to be pursued.

Both of these men are from leftist cultures, academia and the ABC, where they've been trained to be very, very nervous of plotting their copy book with the feminists.  Conservative men are equally reluctant to call out women's bad behaviour, but for different reasons.  Here, the problem is chivalry, old fashioned adherence to the guy in a century ideal of women on a pedestal whose virtue no gentleman would challenge.  This form of benevolent sexism exploits men's culturally imposed desire to protect and show reverence for women.  And that makes it damn hard to acknowledge that women can be very, very bad.  Andrew Bolt on Sky News is a classic example.  Watch him struggle to cope when I tell him I'm not surprised men are choosing to steer clear of women now that we're showing our true evil colours.  And I'm not surprised we're seeing men going their own way.  We're seeing a lot of men making the decision to stay away from us because we've proved how dangerous we are.

It's frightening how men have been coward and now just keep their heads down and endure the constant attacks.  So this is a call to arms, encouraging other women to get more vocal.  We need to be bold and talk openly about how some women are behaving and expose the cover ups that deny women's role in family violence, their blatant disregard for the truth on any number of issues, from why boys are doing badly in schools to the fake rape crisis, cancer funding, harassment in the workplace.

I put a bomb under him, telling him that most people, most psychologists know this is all feminist rubbish, but the only reason the APA gets away with publishing it is that the sensible majority remains silent.
