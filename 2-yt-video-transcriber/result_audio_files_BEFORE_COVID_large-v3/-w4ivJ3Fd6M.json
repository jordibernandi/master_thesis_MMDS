That's not a threat is it?  No, I'm being polite.  Okay, you said I'll see you so usually that doesn't... Well, imagine if neither one of us is going to die, we might see each other again, right?  Well, maybe.  So I don't know guys, that was weird.  Manoway County employees only parking.  That kind of sounded like a threat almost but we'll take it as he was just being nice and we'll see you around.  Be careful how you take those words though guys.  Those words have hidden meaning.  Okay guys so you can see the Lenawee County Sheriff's Office is operating of the public defender's building currently.  While their main sheriff's office is under renovation, or they're getting a new building built, they're operating out of a private public defender's office.  What's that tell you guys?  That tells you Lenawee County sheriffs and the public defenders are working together.  There's collusion together.  That's why you can never trust a public defender.  Never in a million years.  There's a share patrol unit pulling in.  Boy, there's a big deputy.  He doesn't miss his donuts and coffee in the morning.  You can guarantee that.  You can see down there where the big tower is.  That's where the former Lenawee County Sheriff was.  Well, it still is.  It's just under renovation.  We'll go take a look.  Okay guys, here's a view of the old Lenawee County Sheriff's Department.  You may remember our Michigan cops freak out video over photography.  It's filmed here at Lenawee County Sheriff, the old building.  There's the massive tower.  So as you can see, the building is now gone.  Freedom Fighters, thanks for joining us here today.  Thanks for all the support.  Can't thank you enough.
