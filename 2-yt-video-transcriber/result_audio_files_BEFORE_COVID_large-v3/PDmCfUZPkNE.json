If you're ugly, everything in your life is going to be harder.  People are gonna treat you with suspicion.  Women will treat you worse.  Don't believe me?  I've got proof.  I'm gonna share with you the results of a research study where they tested women's responses to identical situations where there was only one factor that was different.  whether the man was attractive or not.  First off, I have a clip that I want to show you.  These are some women describing men being creepy. ",

            "text": "Nice watch.  I find that funny, there's so much reluctance to just say, if he's handsome, has an attractive face, if he's genetically good looking.  No, it's about the clothes and the watch.  Putting that aside, I appreciate these girls' honesty, because they admit, if he's handsome and attractive, then it's not creepy.  So let's step back for a second.  In our society, there's lots of talk about privilege.  You know, like if you have a certain color skin, if you have a certain amount of money in your bank account, then you're privileged.  But why don't we talk more about attractiveness privilege?  Because if we're trying to figure out who has an advantage in society, there is no bigger privilege than being good looking.  This isn't speculation.  There have been a number of studies that have looked into this phenomenon.  They found that political candidates that are good-looking receive on average a 20% boost in their voting numbers.  There have been studies that have proved that in jury trials, if you're good-looking, you're way less likely to be found guilty.  Good-looking people are more likely to be hired for jobs, they're more likely to get paid more and be promoted.  the list goes on and on.  one of my favorite studies on this subject was done all the way back in 1974 but it was a great study.  it illustrates this point so well.  in the study people read two essays and each essay had a photograph attached.  One essay had the photograph of a very attractive person, the other one of a very ugly person, and the people were asked to judge the merits of an essay.  For one essay, people consistently said that it was badly written, ill-informed, no intelligence or insights contained within.  You already know what happened.  When people read the essay written by the ugly person, they thought it was badly written, without merit.  When judging the essay written by the attractive person, they thought that it was intelligent, insightful, and well-written.  But guess what?  Both essays were identical.  This all confirms what's called the halo effect.  That's the tendency for a good impression in one area to translate automatically into good impressions in other areas.  So when we see somebody who is physically attractive and we have a positive opinion about their looks, Unconsciously, we develop positive opinions about other traits to do with them, you know, their personality.  We just believe that they're kind, compassionate, intelligent people, even if there's no evidence of that.  But the study that I want to talk about today focuses not on the halo effect, but on the devil effect.  This is when people have a tendency to prejudge somebody's actions and interpret them in a negative light because of a judgment that you've already made about them.  that's negative, such as, they're not good looking, they're ugly.  The study was done in 2015 at the Eastern Kentucky University, and the title of the study was called, You're Okay Until You Misbehave, How Norm Violations Magnify the Attractiveness Devil Effect.  This research was created so we could study women's responses in social situations when comparing a man who's attractive with a man who's ugly.  Women were given two different social situations, one with a low violation of social norms, just asking to borrow a pen, and the other with a high violation of social norms, telling a woman that she's beautiful, that she should be a model, and asking if you can take a picture of her.  Women then filled out a questionnaire about comfort level and personality characteristics of the man.  Let's have a look at the results.  As you can see in the low violation, there isn't much difference.  2.16 compared with 1.93.  Women prefer to lend a pen to the handsome man, but not by much.  There's just not a lot at stake in that situation, so it's pretty forgettable.  But look at the results of the high violation scenario.  Ugly men are 2.5 times more likely to be judged negatively in the exact same situation with the exact same behaviors.  So maybe you've never actually heard anybody explicitly state this before.  You may have thought it inside yourself, but no one's ever told it to you that one of the reasons why you might be struggling in life is because you were born with a disadvantage.  You're not attractive.  This is true.  Your dating life would be a lot easier if you were born good looking.  If you were handsome, women would treat you nicer.  You'd get the special treatment.  This doesn't apply to everybody.  And right now I'm just addressing those members of my audience that are unattractive.  My hope is that by talking about this and sharing the research, I can validate what you've always suspected to be true, but nobody's directly told you.  Yes, you are disadvantaged because of your looks.  Now you can grieve.  Show some compassion to yourself because you're suffering over something that was never in your control.  It was genetic.  But don't stop the process there.  Don't get lost in victimhood.  After the grieving process is done, take a look around you and consider what is in your control.  You're born ugly.  You're disadvantaged.  That sucks.  You can't fix your genetics, but there are some things that you can fix.  You can lose weight.  You can put on muscle.  You can fix your hair, fix your clothes.  Get a good job, get a good personality, develop your self-esteem and become a high value guy.  Yes, you need to grieve for what you do not have, but don't get stuck in grief.  It's about where you choose to focus.  And if you want to live a happy life, don't focus on what you can't control.  Remember the opening lines of the serenity prayer.  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
