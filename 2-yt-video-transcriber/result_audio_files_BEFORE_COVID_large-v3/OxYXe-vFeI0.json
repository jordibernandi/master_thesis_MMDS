            "text": "Hey everybody, I just wanted to do a quick announcement of why I'm not doing a live stream tonight.  This Tuesday no live stream, I'm postponing it.  We'll do it next Tuesday and here's the reason why.  I've been sick and that set me back a few days in my prep and studies and the thing I'm preparing and studying for is a debate that's happening Thursday on apologetic methodology.  For some people this won't make any sense, but basically I'm representing the classical system and my debate opponents representing the presuppositional system of apologetics.  And we're gonna be discussing, debating which one's biblical.  Well, I'll tell you more about that in the future after the debate's over and it's available online.  That should be maybe Friday, hopefully.  And I'm not gonna be doing the stream because I need time to prepare for this thing.  I'm just set way back in my prep and I really need the hours I have available to do that.  On top of that, my wife's car broke down, which is the car I'm sitting in right now.  I'm here at the dealership and we're gonna get it worked on, get the thing hopefully fixed up and going.  So this is kind of just, My week has been set back, and for that reason, this stream, this Tuesday that was going to be on evidence for God, a wonderful argument for God's existence, we're going to break it down in a simple way that you can grab it, understand it, and even answer objections to it, even thoughtful objections.  That will be next week with special guest Braxton Hunter, next Tuesday, 5 p.m.  Pacific Standard Time.  As for now, I'm waiting for someone who works at the dealer to come over here and help me out with this broken car.  Have a great day. ",
