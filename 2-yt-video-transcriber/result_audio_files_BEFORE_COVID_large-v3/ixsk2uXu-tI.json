And the reason why we do that is not for entertainment, it's not for enjoyment, it's to point people to Jesus Christ and into salvation.  That's the whole point.  These are signs of the end times.  They are warning signs.  we believe that they are from god.  so that being said guys can you look into scripture look into the bible for yourselves look at what the word of god says and educate yourselves.  don't listen to what everyone else says.  don't listen to your friends or your family's opinions.  look into god's word.  look at what god's messengers his apostles his prophets who were called by him who delivered his messages with power with God's authority and read them guys and I think once you get into God's word and you study and read ",

Or go online.  Look at Bible Gateway.  Start reading it for yourself.  Or buy yourself a Bible.  Whatever.  Just look into it for yourself.  Do yourself a favor, guys. ",

If you want answers, people just find it so easy just to turn to their friend or really buy into what one person's saying.  Why don't you really find out what God's saying through the word?  Just read the Bible.  That is the best book to read.  Stop assuming.  I remember we mentioned this a few videos back about.  people are saying, oh, Jesus is just a messenger.  His whole message is in the Bible.  It's found in no other book.  So if you think that Jesus Christ is a messenger, then do not actually think that you should find out what his message is.  Again, it's in the Bible.  Find out what that message is, people, because it will change your life.  It really will.  So, yes, get into the scriptures.  Find out what it says.  And, yeah, just don't delay.  Do it. ",

Yes, it can.  Absolutely.  It could shake your life.  It may make you feel uncomfortable.  And you may read stuff you don't like.  But the bottom line is you are coming to the truth.  You're coming to God through Jesus Christ.  You're coming into the light.  And as Jesus said, the truth shall set you free.  You will feel a lift in your spirit.  A burden will be lifted.  Again, you may not like everything, but at least you're living.  in a real world a reality and you're connected to god and you'll know and you'll feel different within yourself and that the positives far outweigh anything that you may not like.

            "text": "i remember one thing before i um gave my life to the lord jesus and i was like flicking through the bible.  um like every practically every day just sort of like trying to understand it.  I remember I was so unpeaceful.  I was so distressed.  I was confused.  I didn't know why I was here.  I didn't know what was going on.  I really felt a great pointlessness to working, to earning money or to doing anything.  I just felt everything was absolutely pointless.  Why?  And it wasn't until I received the Lord Jesus Christ, then everything kind of made sense really.  And my direction and my purpose was kind of, I don't know, I just felt rewired.  I just felt like I just had this huge amount of peace, sit with me every single day.  yeah i can have bad days yeah i can be stressed but inwardly i had that inner peace and i just knew that there was a god and i just knew that he loved me.  and i just knew that um i'd been saved.  and um that is what happens people and that is so hard that is so hard to try and package that.  and let you know if you don't already know that yourself.  so that's why we encourage you pick up the bible and to turn to the lord jesus christ because you can have that peace too.  it's an absolute promise.  so if you're depressed or you're distressed or you're worried or you're confused or you felt you feel like your life is a complete and utter mess.  it may even be going really really well but we can promise you um peace.  if you if you if you the lord jesus christ that is a promise.  so what have you got to lose people what have you got to lose?  so all right do that now.  we're going to end the video there.  um if you want to reach out to us put some comments below people.  do read them and if you have made a commitment love to hear from you again put some comments below.  all right we leave it there.  we have uh the children's mission update coming up very very soon so on monday.  so look out for that.  all right take care.
