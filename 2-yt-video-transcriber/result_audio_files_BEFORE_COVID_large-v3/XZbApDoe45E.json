            "text": "It has long been suspected that most women only have eyes for the top percentile of men, but in the modern age, we have access to data to back this up.  In an experiment run by Medium.com, they found that there was no equality amongst the genders when it comes to dating.  The odds were heavily skewed in favour of women.  In terms of attractiveness, they found that the bottom 80% of men were competing for the bottom 22% of women, and the top 78% of women were competing for the top 20% of men.  When put into a graph it looks like this.  The area in blue represents the situations where women are more likely to like the men.  The area in pink represents the situations where the men are more likely to like women.  Ultimately, for a man of average attractiveness on Tinder, only one in every 115 girls is likely to swipe right on him.  Experiments like this confirm what we already suspected.  The majority of men are invisible to most women.  But are women aware of this?  We went to the United States and England to find out. ",

            "text": "Is it true when looking for a partner, most women look at only the top percentile of men?  Not in my case.  I don't think that's true.  No.  It depends.  It depends.  It depends on the person.  Yeah, because a lot of people don't have their... a lot of people aren't realistic.  I honestly think it depends more on the individual, more than their position.  Um, no.  Not really.  Like, I don't really think about that.  I feel like most women do.  Yeah.  And then, obviously, they settle.  I mean, yeah.  For me, I would choose someone who's, like, sort of in the middle because you can keep building and grow with that person as opposed to someone who thinks that their priorities are already straight and they're already at the top.  And, you know, you'll be dealing with someone who I feel like things will be too good for you.  I mean, I feel like some people have really high expectations of what they want and then When they don't get that, they just feel like they sell or, you know.  Something less.  If you're going on looking for anything, if you're going on shopping, you look out for the good stuff, but then it doesn't mean, like, if I see a really nice top, it's, like, a tough sell-off.  If I try it on, it doesn't mean it's going to look good on me.  It depends on what you sell.  Yeah.  Is it, like, the physique?  Is it, like, personality?  I had a schizophrenic Russian boyfriend who hacked my social media, was dating me to get to my best friend, and then I had to call the cops on him.  And then we met up a few years later, and he was like... It's really great that you called the cops on me because I was finally able to get on some medication.  And then he's now a pro boxer.  I don't really go in with any, like, idea.  I just kind of, whatever happens, happens, I guess.  I'm not really looking for any specific persons.  Whatever happens, happens.  Yeah, he said he was going to murder me.  Oh.  But we all goodness.  Does every woman ideally want to date a kind, successful, and handsome man, would you say?  Yes, ideally, yes.  I would say yes, ideally.  Of course.  I think, yeah.  That's what we're all aiming for.  Is it going to happen?  I don't know.  I think yes, for the most part, because it hits all the markers for, like, a good biological companion.  Everybody wants someone who's kind and successful, yeah, definitely.  Because you want somebody that's going to be attractive so that you'll have, like, good kids.  Yeah, I think, yeah.  You want somebody that's smart so that you'll have somebody, so you'll have, like, smart kids.  Um, probably, ideally, yeah.  not necessarily.  i feel like there's some girls who like like a real bad boy or something i don't know.  i feel like.  consciously we say that because it feels like it's the right choice.  unconsciously We just apply for what we need.  If someone's not successful at all, though, it's not like the biggest deal as long as they have aspirations and a good heart.  I think that's all anybody wants.  Successful to me could mean being happy with yourself, for example, and achieving your dreams, what you really want to do.  For me, I would strive for a successful, handsome, friendly, well-mannered man.  I mean, some people are successful.  you know, in their own way, working at PetSmart, for example, you know.  That wasn't a good example.  What percentage of men your age would you say have a chance of dating you?  Maybe 30%.  I would say 40 or 50.  30%?  30.  I have no idea.  35?  30.  I feel like that's a stretch too.  20 maybe?  A very high percent.  My bar is set so low.  I would give it like... A 50% chance, because you never know.  If I had to give it a percentage, I would say, I don't know, like 30%?  This is the thing, okay?  Guys, most of the time, are less mature than girls.  So most of the people my age, I wouldn't go for.  I'll give anything a try.  Like, I'll try anything at least once.  See, I'm 22, and a lot of people around my age, they're not.  I would say they're not really about their business.  I would go for someone more, a little older, someone who's already somewhat established.  Would it be accurate to say there is a percentage of men that are invisible to women because they aren't legitimate dating prospects?  Maybe, yeah.  Yeah, I think there is.  Yeah, 100%.  Of course.  As sad as it sounds, the answer is probably yes.  Yeah, I've seen my family.  Yeah.  Yes, yes, because it has to do with personality.  So like if shy people don't want to open up, yes, they are invisible in that way.  They don't open up?  I would say so, yeah.  I'd say mostly it's the men that are invisible are the men that don't put themselves out there.  Yep, there are.  There's a lot of men who girls or women would overshadow and not think.  That's something that is beneficial because they don't look the part or they don't, you know, have the means to fulfill whatever that person needs.  But I think there are a lot of men who are overshadowed and overlooked for their good qualities.  Again, I didn't even know what you were talking about.  You explained what an invisible man was.  I was like, what?  The who?  I mean, I feel like men as well.  Yeah.  Like men have their own idea of what they want.  Right.  Right.  in a girl and then yeah i don't know there are a lot of people that uh we are all different.  so i think that everybody have the chance to find someone.  if they're not the type of men that i would see myself dating i just take them.  let's be honest.  you know how people say.  you know it's all about personality.  no if you're looking at someone and you think oh they're really good looking Then you're like, well, I'm going to go for that person.  But if you see someone who's not really attracted to you, you're not going to go up to that person and be like, let me get your number.  It's also those same men that are typically like, it's so hard to find a nice girl.  But then it's like, you're not playing yourselves out there.  And then what do you think the dating experience is like for a low status man who isn't attractive or wealthy?  What would you think it's like?  I bet it's hard because there are a lot of people who go for the superficial stuff, looks, money, status, and stuff like that.  No idea.  Probably terrible.  Probably not great.  Yeah.  In life, I think it's very, um, scarce.  Sad.  No, but just because it's invisible for you doesn't mean that for everyone else.  It would just be the same because there's other girls out there for that reason.  It depends on their personality, but... I don't know.  It could be nice.  It could be a good experience.  He could be dating a lot of girls.  Does he maybe like all of those girls?  No.  You kind of got to have some qualities to fall back on.  Who knows?  Maybe he's like a nice person.  A lot of men need to like step up.  Mainly people here in the US, because they feel sometimes too shy.  I feel like in Latin America, it's very like, they're going to let you know.  It's true that nice guys who are overly friendly can come across a bit pathetic, do you think?  Well, that is really sad to say.  I wouldn't say pathetic, I'd say a bit seedy.  Sometimes, maybe.  When you say seedy, is that kind of like suspicious?  Yeah, like a little bit too friendly can be a bit creepy.  I mean, maybe not pathetic so much as just like insecure.  No, not necessarily.  I wouldn't think that pathetic would be friendly.  I would think more about a friendly interaction than dating.  Yes.  Yes.  Just trying too hard.  To a lot of girls, yes.  A lot of girls do like men who aren't manly or like... can take control.  I like a nice guy but then if I'm not interested in them maybe I can see that as a bit pathetic.  but then if I'm interested in them I'm like okay you can be my husband.  I've had so many guy friends that are just like.  they're really nice but they're also like very timid and they don't go for it. ",

            "text": "I mean, there's plenty of reasons.  They come across a bit arrogant.  I heard income is a big thing.  Narcissistic.  I don't like cocky guys.  I think they need a bit of confidence.  I would say a lack of communication.  Are they clean?  Are they working?  Are they savvy?  A bit too over the top.  Or a little bit too reserved.  Smoking.  People who just are arrogant and are just rude, I just don't like.  Especially in LA.  First would be looks.  Second would be income.  Hygiene.  If a guy's got terrible hygiene, you meet him and he's just like nasty.  Absolutely not.  Red flag number one.  For me, the top thing is like... You know, someone doesn't, like, respect you.  If you can't respect me, how am I supposed to, like, respect you, you know?  If he's immediately, like, really overbearing, that's red flag number two.  Are they motivated in their life and in what they're doing?  There's, like, so many things that, there's, like, a list that you could just go down and be like, okay, check, check, check.  What advice would you give a man who no longer wants to be invisible to women?  I would say just give it a shot.  I think being friendly, but not too friendly, is the perfect recipe to meet someone.  Maybe just be yourself.  Just take care of yourself.  Why don't you just go out there and talk?  Girls love a guy that's confident, that goes for it, that knows what he wants and what he's doing.  Just look at the mirror and love yourself.  Maybe don't make yourself.  Are you available?  Go out there, talk with girls, hang out with them, listen to them.  Be someone who communicates very well, someone who is nice, has very good manners, is just an overall gentleman.  And women see that more than they think.  Girls actually do love to be, like, listened to.  Even if you're a saint, they're like, mm-hmm, uh-huh, oh, tell me more, mm.  Be nice.  Be a nice guy.  But don't be too nice in a way that they're going to friend zone you.  Even if you're not feeling the confidence, exude the confidence.  Make it till you make it.  I feel like everyone likes games.  Girls, boys, a little bit.  If you make it too easy, it's not fun for anyone.  Don't be invisible to yourself.  Find out what's unique about you and then go pursue it.  Just be yourself, be authentic.  There's nothing more a chakra than confidence.  It's very unparalleled. ",
