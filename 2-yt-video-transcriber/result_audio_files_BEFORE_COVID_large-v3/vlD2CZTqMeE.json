White Snake, time, five-zero, authentication, Yankee, go.  This is Celebrity, out.  Okay, so is that not the creepiest thing ever?  uh... more sky king messages went out.  this is a very serious thing when you hear these.  if it's twice in a row and we kind of showed you how it kind of works and and the graph uh... if there's two sky king messages just to explain what sky king messages are they are eight global message that goes out with the uh... nato phonetic alphabet and they're basically completely encrypted and you have to have the other side of it to understand what it's saying.  So I think that they send the one-time code to decrypt it at the other end.  I don't know how exactly it works.  But basically, there are emergency action messages, which could go global, and then there are Sky Kings, which are above that.  Sky Kings over over.  they supersede any other message.  So there's a global message going on between different countries, say us and our allies.  This message supersedes it.  It goes over all radio waves, everything.  And what it usually is, is something to do with nuclear orders.  Now, three was is like three in a row where it's like Sky King, Sky King, Sky King.  You basically know that that is a type of Sky King.  It's like a placement order or like they're telling them to go from here to here.  Four in a row are basically go or no go nuclear capable orders.  Now, if you want to put the exacts on this, they can be.  And that means that it could be a nuclear bomber going from one location to the next.  It could be them going from here to here and then another one to say, no, we're not going to use that.  Or it could be just, you know, go fly over this as a drill.  I don't know.  But two is normally a test.  That's where you know it's Sky King, Sky King, and it goes, you know, this is a Sky King message, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever.  If it's two in a row, then it's usually a test.  Three, it's normally a simple order.  And then four, if it's four in a row in succession, then it's usually something serious.  Now, that doesn't mean they're dropping the nuke bomb on anybody, but it does mean that something... of that kate of that level is being told what to do.  so yesterday uh... this is the e a m dot watch dot log.  now this is put on.  this is the thing is is people actually put on videos?  yesterday i believe there was five in thirty five minutes which uh... i don't know exactly how to read this.  so we are actually getting an expert to look at this and to see.  you know what is this.  So, you know, these were the messages that were put through.  And again, these were on all stations.  This one says three all stations and five from Sky King.  So I cannot tell you exactly what this means.  But what I have told you before is when we reported these Sky Kings the next day.  They told us basically there was nuclear bombers in the Middle East.  Now, a couple of the people in our group that have been looking at this said because of the time they were sent, it was daytime in the Middle East, that that was it.  We can't automatically assume that.  So I'm not going to assume anything.  But I will say this is something that we are watching very, very closely because this is where we would hear an alert go out before anything else.  So again, yesterday was lit up.  If we felt like it was something serious, I would have went live.  I was ready to last night.  But again, so that is something that we are watching extremely carefully, and we will make sure to keep you guys filled in on that.  And again, get a part of our Marfugal alerts on marfugalnews.com.

But then again, there was five times within that 35-minute period.  If you guys don't know, if you're totally confused what we're talking about, Sky King messages are essential.  They are a global message.  If we were to send nuclear boomers over to Russia, if we were sending them to a little island to just nuke the hell out of it, these would be the way they would communicate that.  They would actually tell them through Sky King.  They're above all other rankings of messages.  And we just had ones in the last... Looks like in the last 45 minutes, at least four.  And one of them said Pink Floyd time and Poison time.  These are official message NATO phonetic alphabet.  So the other ones make sense, them being completely encrypted, but the fact that that says Pink Floyd time and Poison time, that's just weird.  So I don't know what's up with that.  What was that?  Oh, yes.  Oh, that would be great.  Okay.  So we're going to play a couple samples here.  Okay, great.  All right.  We have actual audio of the Sky King.  So this is going to be awesome.

These are actual Sky King messages, how they're read.  So this is a different one.  I'm going to play it right now.  Sky King, Sky King, do not answer.  1, 2, 3.  Authentication.  Romeo, November.  I'm saying it.  Sky King, Sky King, do not answer.  1, 2, 3.  Authentication.  Romeo, November.  This is Eddieworth, out.  You know, I almost think, Dex, do you almost think that that was like straight up, maybe they sent somebody somewhere and then like backed off of it?  Like they were just, they didn't even like want to encrypt that.  They just said, do not enter, do not enter.  Like, do they throw in regular things?  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Do you have the sample?  Do you have the sample sheet?  Okay, all right.  The sample sheet shows you, it says, do not answer, do not answer, Sky King, Sky King.  And however many times they do it, the more they do it, the more serious.  People are looking at it like this, oh, who cares?  This is really serious stuff.  Bubba, I'm going to turn you back on.

Well, anyways, Bubba News, I always appreciate you.  What was that?  Okay, so I'm going to pull this up.  Before you go, I'm going to pull this up real quick.  But this is the cheat sheet to basically understand what these mean.  And I'm going to put them up on the screen, and I'll even full screen it.  So if you are watching the replay, you can actually... you will be able to pause it and look at this information because i i do believe it is incredibly important right now.  okay so this is kind of the cheat sheet.  so i'm in a full screen.  this and kind of explain over on the left bottom corner you have normal EAMs.  an example of a normal EAM uh... you know.  K5XL717 standby blah blah blah.  it repeats.  i say again KXL blah blah blah.  off it out.  Okay, then there's main sail EAMs, a general call for a ground station to answer, usually a low priority or test message.  Then you got over here.  These are Sky Kings.  Sky King is a call sign directed at single integrated operational plan assets, such as nuclear bombers, submarines, and command planes.  Those are the three main ones that these are directed to.  Do not answer means that the recipients of the message should not reply or ask for authentication, for it would give away their location.  So that's where that do not answer comes in.  The more times the phrase Sky King, Sky King, do not answer is repeated, the higher priority the message.  One Sky King.  One Sky King, low priority in terms of Sky King's most likely attest message.  to sky kings low priority in terms of sky kings most likely a test message the most common sky king you will hear.  to sky king sky king do not answer.  now you have three times sky king.  high priority.  probably not a test.  likely actual orders to nuclear capable forces.  sky king sky king do not answer.  sky king sky king do not answer.  authentication echo sierra uff it out.  then you have four times sky king highest priority.  most likely not a test potentially nuclear.  go no go codes or target orders.  example Sky King, Sky King, do not answer.  Sky King, Sky King, do not answer.  Sky King, Sky King, do not answer.  Sky King, Sky King, do not answer.  Whiskey Alpha Romeo, time 09, authentication November, Oscar Andrews out.  That would be an order.  That would be saying, you go bomb this place.  So this is what we are looking for.  If we hear this, we will know beforehand.  or at least it's not going to give us that much time.  So we are hoping that we get any kind of heads up before something happens.  Like I've said, I have family that will actually give me a heads up if it's heading my way.  But I can't guarantee they'll call me if it's going to hit New York or somewhere else.  So either way, we are looking at this very carefully and this is a very serious situation.  Hopefully it's, you know, all normal.  Hopefully it's all drills and hopefully it's not, you know, it's not anything else.  But with what is going on right now, the fact that there are, you know, all these Sky Kings out of nowhere.  It's kind of freaky.  And we have nuclear-capable forces all over the world right now.  Like, you know, actually deployed.  So anyways, enough with that.  Bubba News, appreciate you.  I hope you call back again.

EMP Shield is the world's first and only military-tested EMP protection device of an EMP, E1, E2, and E3.  EMP Shield provides complete and tested protection from electromagnetic pulses, coronal mass ejections, lightning, and all forms of power surges.  So I just want you guys to know I have never, ever worked with a company I don't believe in.  This is 100%.  We've had engineers and certain people say, no, this couldn't be, this couldn't be.  This is grounding the signal faster than an EMP, all three stages.  From five nanoseconds where an E1 peaks, where this thing grounds it in one nanosecond.  We're talking millionths of a second.  This thing is that fast.  So I only partnered with these folks because I believed it.  This is the same company that the DHS, the actual resilience report suggested by name for you to go out and get to protect yourself.  This is what the military uses.  These are installed on military installations.  These guys work with the big dogs.  So why leave it to somebody else to protect themselves and then have them come save you?  There's tons of questions I'm sure people ask, but one thing to let you guys know, if you have a vehicle that's in the year range that could be knocked out by an EMP, they make a car one.  They make a house one.  They make a generator model.  They make one for everybody.  You can save $50 per device.  So if you get one for your house and one for your car, you can save $50 with the promo code MARF.  You can go to empshield.com slash Marf, or you can use our way, marfuglenews.com slash EMP. ",
