            "text": "Hello, here we are again on the powernomics.com YouTube channel and on what we call Connecting the Dots.  I'm Dr.  Claude Anderson, your host.  I've been away for a while and I apologize for that.  And again, having survived about two or three major health challenges and I guess it has some impact on me and reminds me a lot of what my grandmother said when she was at 99 going on her 100th birthday.  And I asked her, how do you feel?  She says, the body is weak, but the mind is strong.  And I said, well, if that's the case, what can I get for you for your next birthday?  She said, I don't really need anything.  I said, what is it you really want that you never had?  She said, I'd really like to go see inside of a school system.  I'd never been to school a day in my life.  And so I arranged that with a few friends in the neighborhood who has a sister who was teaching an elementary school, and they arranged that so she could get a chance to see the inside of a school system before she died.  She said she wanted to learn some history and learn about life and some other things that she didn't have a chance to learn in school.  And so I'm back to try to provide that helpful information to you.  As I said, but on the sad side, one of my friends called me a couple of days ago and said, Dr.  Anderson, I saw you, but you just look so tired.  And I said, yep, those two or three health challenges have aged me.  I can tell you the truth.  It does make me feel much older than I used to be and took away some of the looks I used to be proud to have.  but that has not affected my mind.  Like my grandmother said, the body is weak, the mind is still relatively strong.  So today what I'm going to try to do is address some of the comments that I got.  I got some marvelous comments from you while I was resting and recuperating.  I looked at some of those emails, and I must express my profound gratitude to the wonderful support I have out there from all the poor blacks across this country and around the world.  It's what you all said to me, it was just heartfelt.  Something I had always hoped I would have, and that is the support and love of most Black folk across this country.  And those comments are so wonderful.  I wish I could have recorded them, but I can't record them.  So I can't post them on a bulletin board someplace, but I have recorded them and I'm posting them in my heart.  I love you all and I love the poor Blacks.  And I learned a long time ago before I got into we're really into national politics rather than state politics.  i said i'm gonna identify with poor blacks for a very simple reason and in history i learned early that there are more field blacks poor blacks than they are rich black house blacks.  so i'm gonna stay out of these house blacks and rich and rather than going with the rich blacks.  that's why i guess i'm always going to be poor and uh i don't have a major organization to help me.  i just got a little small team of family to raise issues and try to educate and redirect black folk in this country.  So I'm back with you and I'm going to try to respond to some of the, to maybe two or three of the, uh, questions that were raised or comments that were raised while I was, uh, recuperating.  One of the first that I want to raise is that one woman sent in one, she said, what she said, sort of, sort of sarcastically.  was that, um, basically saying, uh, she disagrees with, I guess what Boris Walken was saying, or I said that, uh, about whites gentrifying cities and taking over things from Black folk and not having given Black folk ample opportunities to get an education.  But see, that is documented stuff.  And I'm going to respond to it very quickly because all of my books cover this.  Every book I've ever put out covered that.  And she was saying Black folk are not the victims.  And if the Black folk weren't the victims, who were the victims of slavery for 360 years, another 100 years of Jim Crow semi-slavery?  another 50 years of benign elect.  Somebody was a victim.  It certainly wasn't Asians.  It wasn't Arabs.  It wasn't gays.  It wasn't whites.  It wasn't ethnic groups from Europe.  It had to be only Black folk.  But somehow, see, people don't want Black folk to feel like they've been the victims.  And they would say, because Black folk had ample opportunities to get to do everything they wanted to do.  That's the tale.  Now, and the question about education.  Every document, starting first, if you read Black Labor, White Wealth, start there.  And read that.  And I'll show you all the various laws that were passed in the South and in the North to deny Black folk an education.  It was against the law to be caught teaching a Black person to read and write for 360 years.  They wanted to impose ignorance on Black folk.  because mostly the Southern whites, they didn't want Black folks to learn to read and write.  You know why?  Because about 90% of all the whites coming from New York, coming to America, came in here with about the equivalent of a third or fourth grade education, point one.  And two was that most of them could not read and write as they came in as immigrants.  So there's no way they were gonna support anything that would teach Black folk an education so that Black folk would say, hey, we are being mistreated, let's get out of this enslavement.  And so they denied Black folk slavery, again by passing those laws, saying if we catch you teaching Black folk to read and write, it'll cost you $100 and 39 lashes with a whip.  That was a fact in law.  And after slavery ended, they did the same thing by giving Black second class education, which means they restricted what Black folk could learn.  When Black folk did go to school, they weren't really schools as you know them today.  Most of these schools They call them elementary schools or high schools.  They were an equivalent of something like about fourth or fifth grade.  That's why my father only got to the third grade.  My mother got to the fifth grade.  There were no real schools and most of the teachers, anybody that got past the fifth grade could turn around and become a teacher.  In the old days in the South, in a black school, they could become teachers.  But when they became teachers, whites would pay them something like about $7 to $10 a week for teaching black kids at most.  And the schools were only receiving something like $150 for every, not 150, but $1.50 for every black child going to school and $12.50 for every white child.  So they wouldn't get any education.  So I don't know where people get this thing about when blacks were the victim of a dysfunctional and denial of an education opportunity.  That is stupid.  Don't be, don't be let, don't go read by black labor, white wealth and read it or buy any of my books and read it.  Black folk were intentionally denied an education because white folk did not want them to be competitive.  And because the immigrants come to this country, their education was about as bad off as blacks.  As a matter of fact, after slavery, 97%, 96% of all the white people coming to America after, after slavery ended, 96% of them could not read and write.  And that's why they didn't want to come South.  They came into the North where they can come in and be a part of the management class.  And so quit letting people tell you that somehow black folk, well, they had a chance to have an educational opportunity.  It was turned down.  The only school that was provided a maximum opportunity to educate black children was Howard University.  The reason Howard University got that opportunity is because it was primarily designed to educate the offsprings of white congressmen who had had babies by Black businesses or Black wives.  That's why Howard University was set up for the elite Blacks in the country who were the mulatto's offsprings of, again, of white congressmen in the Washington, D.C.  area.  Therefore, Howard University was privileged to be the only school in the United States, Black school, that could have a law school or have a medical school.  All those schools could not have curriculums that would teach black kids to be competitive with white kids.  And that was a fact.  So the people who are saying blacks are not victims, they must learn how to read.  And that's what my books are for, to educate, re-educate not only whites, but black folk too, that come to get the truth.  But our people operate too much off of misinformation or no information.  The second thing they said is, well, Dr.  Anderson, in that comment that in these cities, schools, I mean, these cities, majority black cities, Blacks were given all types of opportunities in those black cities when, yes, white folk abandoned them, but black folk didn't take advantage.  Black folk could not take advantage.  In the 1950s and 1960s, whites pulled out of the urban areas and created what we call suburbs and ex-burbs.  They intentionally extracted, relocated all the wealth, resource, power, industries into the suburbs.  They took everything from the banks and the businesses and factories and industries and relocated them.  either relocate them to the suburbs or relocate them into the south or into distant countries.  They moved major manufacturing countries, companies into places like Mexico, then into Europe and all the industries that used to be peculiar to this country.  Up until that time, up until the 1960s, this country was producing about 90% of all the commercial products on the earth.  until the integration occurred.  When integration occurred, white folks says, we're gonna leave, turn these cities over to these blacks who wanna integrate, but we're gonna practice a burnt earth, scorched earth philosophy, which means anything of value, we're gonna take it out of the urban cities and stick it outside in the suburbs where the wealth will be located and the power will be located to look back and control those cities, even though they live outside the cities.  Because during that period of time, United States in America was noted for producing the best shoes in the world.  We had about somewhere between 150 to 200 shoe making and building businesses in the United States making high quality shoes.  200, 150, 200.  Guess what?  They moved all those shoe industries out of the United States so that Black folk could not get their hands on them and build shoe industries.  They built, they shipped all those industries.  The whites shipped those industries and commercialized those industries And through globalization, they moved them into places like Korea, South Korea, China, Formosa, Hong Kong, and India.  So that's why most of the shoes you buy now were not produced in America.  They came from those industries that were relocated outside of the country.  The United States was noted for producing all the telephones, radios, TVs, automobiles, furniture.  or kitchen equipment, we would have noted for all those industries, but they intentionally relocated those industries out of the urban areas and to foreign countries intentionally to deprive Black folk of the chance to build industries.  That's why right now, historically, Black people in America, Native Blacks are the only, the only people, and I know of in this world, besides the people that are colonized in African nations, The only people that have deprived an opportunity to have the advantage of having been industrialized.  Black people are the only people that were denied and shut out of industrialization that occurred in Europe during the 1700s and the United States in the 1800s.  Black folk have never, never had a chance to build industry.  Go look around this country right now in 2019 and find some industries.  Those industries are not owned by blacks.  Blacks never had a chance to own industries.  You don't have industry, you run into a major problem.  And so the response to the comments from the young lady, and I appreciate her offering those comments, and I want her to continue to support anything I do, and I'm always open to any suggestions she might have, but she needs to pick up those library packs and start reading those books.  It'll be very helpful to her.  But I want her to continue to be supportive of all the things we talk about.  But if you really want to get past those problems in conclusion about where Black folk have failed to take advantage of opportunities in major cities, And to say that Black folk, whites are not taking over major cities from Black folk, that is called gentrification.  All the major cities in the United States are going to be gentrified.  And all those Blacks who left those urban cities 20 or 30 years ago to move to the suburbs to be with whites, those new ghettos in America will be in what used to be suburbs.  And whites are going to come back downtown and take over every major urban area in America.  And that's everything across this country that used to be a majority black city will be taken over and gentrified.  And once they gentrify it, they're going to privatize all the public resources and put that back into the hands of the wealthy class who took the wealth with them to the suburbs when they extracted it out of the urban cities under a scorched earth policy in the 1950s and 60s.  They're going to bring that wealth back in and they're going to take over those industries in every city.  And pretty soon you'll be able to go to any major urban city in the United States.  And where you used to see blacks walking down the street, you're going to see either whites under gentrification or newly arriving immigrants.  And so it's going to be a very different thing.  Now, the reason black folk could not take advantage of those cities and build industries is because they were deprived of the opportunity to have the wealth to do it.  And see, you can't produce unless you have something called resources.  And that was the whole point of slavery, to maldistribute 100% of all this nation's resources, minerals, rights, land, businesses, income, opportunities, rights, and privileges, and controls of everything into the hands of the dominant white society.  Blacks have not been able to build industries in this country because they don't own and control the resources.  And in my powernomics books, I keep telling you, the primary thing you should be searching for is not social integration and not civil rights, but to be served by trying to find resources, own and control resources.  That is the basis of capitalism.  And we'll talk later on in the next and following presentations on a YouTube channel for Connecting the Dots.  I'll teach you what you should be looking for and how they connect up.  Again, I appreciate your support to me.  Stay with me.  I love you all.  And I got you.  We got my team.  My team started years ago when I was in the governor's office with presidents.  Me and poor black folk.  I love it.  We're going to make a good team.  We're going to survive.  We're going to compete.  And we're going to be emotionally, physically, financially, and commercially competitive in this society.  I promise you that.  So I'll close now and I'll catch up with you in my next episode here on the YouTube channel.  Keep your faith.  Bye-bye now. ",
