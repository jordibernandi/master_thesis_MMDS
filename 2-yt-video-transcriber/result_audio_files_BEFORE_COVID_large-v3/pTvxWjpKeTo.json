I took it to the store.  I thought you'd take this puff of it.  What's going on?  Can you give me your ID for me?  Do you have an ID?  I'm a private citizen.  Do you have an ID?  Okay, well, Rule 37, Chicago Police Policies and Directives, requires you to give your name, rank, and star number when asked by any member of the community or any department member on or off duty.  So, again, sir, I'm going to ask you, ID.  Officer Goss, star number 18736, currently assigned at 11 District.  Okay, why are you smoking in a city vehicle?  You're not smoking in a city vehicle.  You're not smoking in a city vehicle.  All right, sir, we got police.  And what's your ID, sir?  Officer Palazzo, 114714.  Okay.  You too, buddy.  Don't put that cigarette inside the vehicle.  I know you're going to hang it out there the whole time.  I'm sorry?  What are you doing?  I'm just talking to the police officers.  Do you want to talk?  You're walking in the middle of the street.  Yes, this is a street.  You need to get on the sidewalk.  I'm a grown man.  I've been walking the street for a long time.  I have to go across the street.  No, you're blocking traffic.  No, you are.  You're in a car, and there's four cars behind you.  I'm a police officer stopping you for blocking traffic.  There's five cars behind you, and I'm blocking traffic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good idea, sir.  I'm going to give an idea.  Why are you so hostile?  I'm not hostile, but you're blocking the street.  You had your cigarette in a city vehicle?  You're smoking in a city vehicle?  Are you kidding me?  You think you can smoke in a city vehicle?  Can you ID for me, sir?  Can you ID for me?  No, sir, there's nothing against the law.  I was not obstructing traffic.  No, sir, I have it on camera.  That did not happen.  I was not obstructing any traffic.  I was talking to police officers.  I was talking to police officers.  So did the police officers tell me to get out of the street?  I was talking to police officers at the time.  So the police officers didn't have a time.  I was engaging in a conversation with them.  I was not blocking the street.  Stop it.  You guys are making stuff up.  You're making stuff up.  Stop it.  I was just asking questions.  It's what I do.  It was going to be a nice conversation.  It didn't have to be adversarial.  Sir, you're not getting an ID.  I didn't break any law.  I just told you, Lawyer.  Why are you trying to... Well, it's not... Okay, well, it's not... We can do it the easy way or the hard way.  Well, listen to this.  We can do it the hard way.  I don't have to have an ID.  It's not legal.  That's what you do when I ask you for it.  No, no.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  So you're telling me it's the law that I have to have an ID?  I have to have a state ID.  I have to buy a driver's license.  So what if I don't have a state ID or a driver's license?  When I ask you for it, if you broke the law, yes, you do.  Okay, so if I don't have a state... Hold on, hold on.  If I don't... What's the last name?  If I don't... Bam!  That's all you got.  That's all you got.  Go ahead, write the ticket.  Write the ticket.  That's all you get.  That's all you get.  You're done.  You're done.  You're done.  You're done.  I gave you everything you had to give.  That's everything I have to give.  Terry v. Ohio.  Terry v. Ohio, 1968 Supreme Court case.  Terry v. Ohio.  Terry v. Ohio, 1968 Supreme Court case.  Supreme Court case set precedent for the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.  Now, will you ID?  What's your ID?  I'm glad you remember that.  What's your ID?  What's your ID?  I just gave it to you.  It literally... What's your ID?  What's your ID?  Wow.  He's not getting an ID.  Look at this guy.  He has a private citizen ID, yet he himself is above reproach.  I don't know who you are.  You don't know I'm a private citizen?  What do you think I am?  You're on public waste.  I don't know who you are.  I just gave you my name, first name, last name, and birthday.  You don't have an ID.  I don't have to have an ID.  Actually, if I do... Okay, so it's a law that I have to have a state ID or a driver's license?  It's a law that you have to have one?  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  I'm talking about you.  ID for me.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  I told you already.  I literally just told you.  You can tell me anything.  Okay.  Well, who are you?  Who are you?  16730.  Yep.  Who are you?  I already told you.  Listen, I can't say it over and over and over again.  I spelled it out for you.  You can tell me his name, Father.  Okay, well, that's for you to figure out, not me.  Exactly, so where's the idea?  I don't have to have an idea.  There's no law that I have to have an idea.  Who told you?  Because you're aggressive.  I'm not aggressive at all.  Okay, that's a walk of shame.  That's a walk of shame.  Not period.  Have a good day.  Okay, Meeks.  Have a good day.  The Meek shall inherit the earth.  The meek shall inherit the earth. ",
