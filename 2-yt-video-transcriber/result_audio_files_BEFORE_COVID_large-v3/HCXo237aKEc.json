            "text": "Some politicians would have you believe that gun registration is a great way to prevent gun deaths and prevent crime.  However, I've said it before and I'll say it again.  The only purpose a gun registration serves is to make it easier for the government to confiscate guns.  That's it.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Take the case of Ronald Starlinsky, a 64-year-old man from New York who used a gun that he inherited from his late father to shoot and kill two criminals after they broke into his home.  Sounds like a pretty open and shut case, right?  Wrong.  After defending himself, Ronald was arrested and charged with a felony.  Not for defending himself, but because the gun he used to do it was never registered with the state in his name.  The gun was initially purchased legally and registered in his father's name, but because the gun he inherited wasn't registered in his name, the state of New York thinks it necessary to treat Ronald like a mass murderer instead of the victim that he is, and charged him with a felony.  Imagine two bastards break into your home and you're forced to do the one thing you wish you'd never have to do, take a life in self-defense.  only to have the state treat you like the criminal because you didn't register the gun that you used to defend your life with.  Maybe I can understand this type of prosecutorial diligence if Ronald had tried to steal a nuclear warhead or something.  But we're talking about a law that literally does nothing to prevent crimes, and this case proves it.  Here you have a man with an unregistered gun who shot and killed two other people.  Now imagine the shooting wasn't justified.  Did the registration stop Ronald from shooting two people?  Did the registration stop Ronald from getting his hand on a gun in the first place?  If the registration was so effective, how did it not stop the acquisition and subsequent shooting of two people?  It didn't.  And we're not even talking about a career criminal here who actively seeks to break laws.  We're talking about a guy who broke a useless law on accident.  Think about it.  criminal.  the only way a cop knows I didn't register my gun is to commit a bigger crime.  that would require the cop to come and then take the gun where they would then learn that it wasn't registered.  and at that point I don't really give a damn.  I'm being charged with murder.  you think I give a damn about an unregistered gun charge.  I already killed the people.  A gun registry isn't the infinity gauntlet where you can snap your fingers and then the people who were killed are brought back to life.  If anything, a gun registration will turn more non-criminals into criminals on accident than it would catch actual criminals.  The man's already traumatized by having to take two lives.  Now you want to force him to fight for his freedom and financial well-being because he forgot to write down the name of the gun he owned?  just so you can feel good about the fact that you know which law-abiding citizen, who we're not worried about, mind you, has which gun in their possession?  This is a joke.  Gun registration is a big, morbidly obese, bureaucratic joke.  The only thing a gun registry helps is a government when it decides it wants to take guns away from the people.  All they would have to do is say, Mr.  and Mrs.  America, turn them all in.  And if you don't, I know you didn't, because I have a registry that proves it, and now I'm coming for you.  Wake up, people.  Stop letting these slick-talking, disingenuous politicians talk you into giving them more power, because that's what a gun registry does.  It gives more power to the government to exploit if they ever so choose.  Look, the aftermath of a self-defense shooting is hard enough emotionally, but it's also hard financially.  Right now, Ronald has a GoFundMe page where you can donate and help Ronald with his legal fees while he fights his felony charge.  I'll post the link in the GoFundMe in the description section.
