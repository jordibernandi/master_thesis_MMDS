            "text": "All right, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Bradford.  You're watching another epic, amazing, awesome episode of the Boxing Authority.  On this episode, we are going to show you how to change your SIM card on a Netgear Model LB1120 4G LTE modem.  for Blazing Hog or whatever company, it's the same modem, okay?  This video is brought to you today by Blazing Hog 4G LTE.  Get blazing fast internet speeds up to 150 megabits per second.  You get $49.99 off when you use the code and the phone number in the description of this video or the code right below my finger here, the coupon code.  it works anywhere rain or shine within five miles of an AT&T or T-Mobile cell tower.  check it out.  all you have to do is call 1-888-306-7062 and mention account number SR2808 when you call.  these speed tests keep changing because some people are using this cell and they're not.  look we're now at 50 60.  There we go again, this is what I was talking about, 63.  We actually got up to 63 that time.  Okay, we're going to upload again.  18.32 upload.  Now enjoy the rest of this video!  That's an order, son!  And so these modems, I believe, work with AT&T T-Mobile.  I don't think they work with Verizon.  Somebody, I think, said they could get to work with Verizon.  But basically, if you want truly unlimited, unthrottled 4G LTE that's going to be reliable and everything, not going to all of a sudden poop out and all that kind of stuff, You want to get it from Blazing Hog, and you've got to use the phone number in the description of this video and the coupon code there to get $49.99 off, or just tell them that Justin Brighthop sent you from the Unboxing Authority.  But the big thing is, with this modem, this is a very powerful modem, okay?  And, I mean, that's one of the reasons you've got to plug it in.  It's 12 volts, 1 amps, and just on its own, without any booster antenna or anything, these modems are very, very powerful within 5 miles of a cell tower.  Now, otherwise you might need a booster repeater if you're further away than that, but they still seem to work.  Very good modem.  So today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be replacing that SIM card.  So let's do that.  Now I got a notice from Blazing Hog saying that I needed to change my SIM card for whatever reason.  So we're going to do that.  I'm holding the card backwards because I don't want you to see the numbers on the front of the card.  So I'm going to go ahead and just pop the new one out.  Make sure it doesn't break.  And it pops out perfectly, so that's great.  There's no personal information on it, so that's also good.  There is some personal information on the bottom of my modem, so I'll try to cover that up for you while I change it.  Very easy.  So we just pop this cover off.  See how easy that came off?  It just comes right off.  No issues there.  Um, now let's see, I need to pop this guy out and I haven't done that before.  So, oh, okay.  So it says to open it, we're supposed to push.  So we're going to push and see, I didn't read the directions.  It does come with directions.  Let's take a look.  Okay, so 1, 2, lay the modem flat.  It says, using your finger, slide the metal bracket toward you until you feel a click.  Okay.  So, and they've got it the same way I've got it.  So it says, slide the metal bracket toward you until you feel a click.  Maybe I'm doing it the wrong way.  Oh, away from me in my case.  Okay, now what, does it flip up?  There we go.  Okay.  So now we take our old SIM card, we set it there.  Yes, it looks identical.  to the new one, so you got to make sure you don't get those mixed up, okay?  And now we want to make sure that it's perfectly seated, that all the connections are making contact, and we'll look at the old one for reference just to make sure everything looks good.  Okay, let's pop it down.  Make sure it's completely popped down.  That's really easy, actually, a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.  And then we just pop this in here.  I've seen cell phones that are harder to work on than this.  Okay, so with these modems, they're extremely powerful.  They work really well with the internet.  But here's the thing.  You can plug in one Ethernet device to it or a router, a Wi-Fi router, and you can plug in all your devices, use everything wireless.  What I found with this modem in use is that if you leave the modem on for an extended period of time, And none of your devices are connecting to it.  The router's not connecting to it, anything like that.  Sometimes they will need to be turned off and turned back on.  So now it's on, now it's off, I believe.  Yep.  And so you may have to reset it from time to time.  I actually can reset it remotely.  If it does get locked up, it's weird because I can still log into it remotely and reset it.  But I don't have that problem anymore because I leave my router on that's plugged into this 24-7 and it doesn't lock up anymore.  So that's just one thing to know about these modems.  But one really big advantage is that by not having the Wi-Fi built in or the router built into this guy, All of that's being done somewhere else, so it's not interfering with the 4G LTE signal.  This is pretty much the best way to go.  If you live on a farm in a rural area, anywhere like that, trailer park, and you're close to a cell tower, that's either AT&T or T-Mobile, This is going to be the way to go with the Blazing Hawk.  Now, I will warn you that I found out, and a lot of people found out the hard way, there's a lot of other companies out there, and they're selling these AT&T iPad plans, which only work to 22 gigabytes, and they shut you off.  You still have internet, but it's really, really slow.  Some people say, well, why would you pay?  I have some relatives that just came here today.  They've got a trailer.  They just parked it out here, and they're going to be parking the trailer out in the middle of nowhere with no electricity or anything.  But this will run on 12 volts, it says, right?  So I told them, I said, if they get a generator, whatever they do, I said, you get your Blazing Hog, you set it up in your camper there, and you've got internet.  And they said, yeah, that's right.  So that's definitely the way to go.  But to get the $50 off, you've got to use... The phone number in the description of the video and the code there.  And then they'll give you $49.99 off.  It's $99 a month for this.  When you first start, these modems are like $150.  So you could buy one of these used on eBay, Amazon, whatever.  And then just have Blazing Hog send you the SIM card if that's what you want to do.  But if you want to get it through Blazing Hockey, you pay $250 for your first month with the $49.99 off.  And so that's $100 for your net service and $150 for the modem.  Otherwise, there's extra fees and charges, and that's where the extra $50 comes from.  So using my coupon, they don't charge you for the extra activation charges and all that.  All that's gone.  They just charge you for the $99 month of service and the modem.  And that's it.  But again, if you get your own modem that's compatible and you give them the IMEI number and all that off the back, they should be able to ship you a SIM card that will work with your modem.  But the best thing to do is just get one of these through Blazing Hog because these work great.  I mean, I haven't really had any issues with these whatsoever.  The only thing they warn you about Is not to buy a Netgear router with AC in the model number.  Because some of them, not all of them, but some of them do not work with these modems.  And I have not run into that issue.  And I actually know people that have AC, Netgear AC routers, have no issues with this modem.  But there's enough of them on the market that don't work with this modem that you would not want to buy it.  So don't do that.  And soon, very soon, there's going to be 5G, you know, LTE internet.  And then possibly there will be 5G LTE modems.  And there will be 5G LTE Blazing Hog service.  And those are supposed to be some seriously fast speeds.  So make sure to check it out.  Give them a call.  And find out.  Give them your name and your service address.  And find out if it's going to work for you.  Now I will tell you this.  The average speeds posted on their website.  On Blazing Hog's website.  Are what you get in a large city.  Okay, out here in a rural area where I am, people get between 63 megabits per second up to 71 max.  And average speed is usually somewhere between 40 megabits per second down and 63 for me.  So I'd say about somewhere in 50, 55 megabits per second down, which is fine.  And then the upload is always about 20 megabits up.  And the speed changes and fluctuates based upon how many people are using the tower in your area, which is why it's great in rural areas and farm areas.  If there's signal interference, of course, if you get a booster, that's going to help.  And you can get the, you can honestly, you can get the boosters for these on Amazon for like 50 bucks.  Okay.  I would love to try one out and review one for you guys if you want to help me on Patreon or whatever.  But basically the boosters, what you got is you got to have a dual MIMO.  It's got to be dual MIMO, it can't be a single one.  So you might have to get two boosters depending on the booster you get.  And you just plug them in here, and then you're supposed to have two separate antennas.  Because if you're doing two different boosters, you're going to have two different antennas.  And you'll have one pointed at the tower in this direction, and one pointed at the tower in this direction.  90 degrees from each other.  And the reason for that is because with 4G LTE, That's the way that the towers work is they'll send one signal this way and one signal this way.  And if you put them both the same way, you're probably gonna get a huge drop possibly in your speed.  So you wanna make sure that you mount, if you're doing two antennas, you wanna mount one this way and one this way.  And so if you get a single antenna that has the two connections on it, internally, most of those antennas, what you'll find is there's an antenna going this way and there's an antenna going this way, or like this, inside the box.  if you were to take the antenna apart.  Because that's how they get all the speed, is they use one signal probably for upload and one for download or something like that.  I don't know if they mix them or what they do, but they use two different signals.  One's parallel and one's, you know, I think perpendicular is the word.  I'm not sure.  But it's 90 degrees to parallel.  How's that?  Horizontal.  Horizontal and vertical.  That's better.  Horizontal and vertical.  That makes more sense.  Anyway, so there you go.  And you can watch my other videos.  I've got a video about how you can take this modem, stick it in a, or an antenna.  But I use just this.  I stick it right in the DirecTV dish.  Actually, it's a dish dish I am using for this.  The DirecTV is the one we actually use for TV.  But I stuck this in a dish dish from Dish.  And it boosted my signal by 10 decibels, 10 dBi.  And so that's where I put this.  And so I'm going to put it in, test it up, and I'm sure it's going to work.  If it doesn't, all I have to do is there's a phone number on here from Blazing Hog.  It tells me to call them.  But when they send you the modem, and the chip it's already set up and working you don't have to do this.  you don't have to install a chip in the modem because um and you don't have to activate it.  they just send you a chip in the modem and it comes to you and it's already going.  um this was a rare thing i think.  where basically uh they?  um this is from bruce hackfield chief of operations.  um Basically, they are upgrading the Sims.  I don't know why.  I can call them and find out later.  But they're upgrading the Sims in all of the modems right now.  And so they sent them out.  And they didn't even tell me they were coming.  They just sent it out and gave me this letter.  It said I have seven days to switch from the old Sim card to the new one.  So I'm all switched.  And everything should be fine.  So I'm going to plug this in.  I don't anticipate any problems.  But... Anyway, that's the way to go.  And my modem is parked within about a mile of the tower.  And I'm getting, like I said, up to 63 megs.  My neighbor is getting 71 from the T-Mobile tower because the T-Mobile tower is faster.  But it's possibly less reliable than the AT&T one.  But he's getting much faster service through T-Mobile than I am.  through Blazing Hog.  And if you were to buy this service directly through those companies like T-Mobile, AT&T, whatever, you're usually going to pay more or you're going to have a data cap, one or the other.  You're either going to have a data cap or you're going to pay more.  And with this, $99 a month, It's a good price for mobile internet, okay?  It's off the grid.  You can take this with you on your farm, your homestead, in the mountains.  You're just going to get lost in the mountains.  If there's a cell tower there, if there's a 4G cell tower there, you know, it's going to work.  If it's the right kind, you know, if yours is AT&T, it's got to be AT&T.  If yours is T-Mobile, it's got to be T-Mobile.  But these work great.  Now, I went all over town.  I went up to I think three miles away from the tower with this guy experimenting and I still got 40 megabits per second down and that was with it restricted because I had it on a slower router and stuff and I was using my cell phone through Wi-Fi.  So I went from cell phone to Wi-Fi to old fashioned router to this thing and I was getting 40 megabits per second down and 20 megabits per second up like three miles away in a trailer park.  Now, I've also done a speed test where I was much further away.  I believe further away than 5 miles, I'm pretty sure.  And I could barely see the cell tower.  And I got, and I believe I did that on film, and put it on my YouTube channel.  I got some decent speed.  You'll have to go back and check that out.  I think it was at least 25 megabits per second down.  And I believe I was way outside the 5 mile area.  So I have to check that out.  But yeah, this, you know, and I wasn't even putting this in a dish.  I wasn't doing anything special.  I did put an antenna on it, and that helped to direct the signal, but... Most of the time, if you put an unamplified antenna on these things, you're going to get worse service.  Now, if you get the cheap modems, the little tiny modems, not these ones, then yeah, the antenna will actually boost your signal.  But the thing is, is that with these guys, they've got great antennas built into them.  And every time I tap this thing with my finger, I can feel it vibrating.  The antenna, whatever it is vibrating in there.  But... Basically, they got a very, very good amplifier intended built in.  I couldn't give you the specs because I don't know and I haven't torn this one apart and I'm not sure I plan to because they're $150 modems.  I don't want to tear it apart.  But basically, very powerful modem, and when you add an antenna to this, all it does is allow you to use the antenna outside, and it allows you possibly to direct it a little better.  But, you know, to be perfectly honest, the very best results I got with this modem is when I put it in my hand like this and aimed it directly at the tower, just like I'm aiming it at the camera right now.  And when I held it in my hand just like that, aimed at the tower, that's when I got my very, very, very best results.  I was unable to reproduce those results in a different location, so I put this in the satellite, the dish, so that it can hold it in that angle.  And it gets just about the same strength as where I was holding it.  And the place where I was holding it would not have been suitable for this modem to be installed.  It was above a microwave.  You don't want to install these around microwaves or anything like that.  Like I said, this is in its own isolated building.  That's where I use it.  I actually have this in its own little isolated building where this is the only thing running, other than maybe a little heater during the winter.  And it just does its job, sends the internet over the cable.  Um, the only other time I've had issues with, no, actually, no, I haven't had any other issues with this than what I mentioned in the video.  Um, it was, it was just that I shut the router off.  You never, if you have a router plugged into one of these things, you leave it on all the time, leave your router turned on.  That's all I can say.  Leave the router turned on because if you don't, um, mine at least will time out.  And I don't know if that's AT&T's problem.  I don't know whose problem that is.  But anyways, and of course, the instructions for accessing this on your computer and changing settings are on the back.  And the other thing is you do get a phone number with this.  It has a phone number, and it can send text messages and receive them.  So if you wanted to, just for the fun of it, just to use another number, you can log into this modem via the web interface, and you can make and send and receive small text messages if you want to from a different phone number.  just to mess with people or whatever, you know.  But anyways, so I'm going to go ahead and reinstall this and turn it on.  And I don't think there's going to be any problems.  If there is, I'll let you guys know.  But I'm just going to go install it.  All right.  Thank you.  God bless.  Bye.  Do you want to learn to follow the commands of the almighty one true God?  If you do, go to ChristianCourts.com.
