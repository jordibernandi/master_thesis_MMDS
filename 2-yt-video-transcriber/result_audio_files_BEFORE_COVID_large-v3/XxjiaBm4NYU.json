            "text": "This motherfucker.  First of all, here's a video he made.  I'm cringing to death watching this video Armored Skeptic made, which he originally titled Ed the Cuck, where he is literally arguing with a sock puppet about how evil feminism is.  Starting to think he might be the worst person to ever live.  Can you imagine making a video called Ed the Cuck and using the word cuck non-ironically?  God, so fucking cringe, man.  This is so fucking cringe.  Apparently, Ed the Sock is a... Some kind of character in Canada that is much loved.  And he made a YouTube series where he basically spoke out in favor of feminism.  And of course, can't have that.  You can't speak out about feminism without us making fun of you.  So I'm going to call you a cuck.  Seriously, if you unironically use the word cuck, please unsubscribe from me.  Please.  If you're on my Patreon, stop.  I don't want your money.  I don't want to be associated with you.  These are the people that I'm embarrassed by.  It's just cringy.  Anyway, this is the best thing that he did that I'm going to cover.  So just to show you. ",

            "text": "Thank you.  Fuck your idiot, Greg.  God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Basically, what he's doing here is he's whitewashing.  He's whitewashing violence caused by white supremacists because he's doing this.  It's not even a false equivalency.  He's not even saying they're equal to Antifa.  He's saying Antifa is worse, even though, as I just showed you, let me pull this back up.  Seventy three percent of extremist killings in the United States were caused by right wing extremists.  You know that only three percent were caused by the left.  You know, white supremacy murders doubled in 2017.  They're the ones committing all the, I say, real violence.  But yeah, some Antifa guy hit somebody with a bite clock.  But we're talking about multiple fucking murders, okay?  Multiple murders.  Can you name one leftist, one Antifa member, anything who has killed anybody in the United States?  I couldn't find any.  Maybe they did.  I don't know.  But... The vast majority of this are right-wing white supremacists.  And here's Greg saying, no, white supremacists are not nearly as bad as Antifa.  This is total whitewashing of white supremacy.  100 fucking percent.  Now, can you imagine if Greg just came out and said, okay, I fucked up.  I'm an idiot.  I'm so fucking stupid for doing that.  And I completely disavow... Not only white supremacists, but Lauren Southern.  I'm sorry I helped make Lauren Southern more popular.  I'm sorry that I was involved in this.  If you're following me and you believe in the Great Replacement, fuck off.  If you're following me and you believe in white genocide, fuck off.  If you're a shitlord in any way like that, I don't want you as a subscriber.  I want to distance myself from right-wingers, these right-wingers, as far as I fucking possibly can.  And I was an idiot for this.  He absolutely should do that.  But let's see if he does.  Because this is like, this is what I was saying, folks.  Like when I came out and I said, you guys are helping the alt-right.  You guys are help spreading alt-right propaganda.  And they made videos smearing me and lying about me.  I was fucking telling the truth.  I got the receipts, motherfucker.  Alright, next up, what else you done, Greg?  What else?  Oh yeah, the feel when Jordan Peterson mails you an autographed copy of his book to thank you for your video which backed up his lies on Bill C-16 and directly led to the mountainous amount of hate towards trans people.  This is Greg posting a picture that he's all proud of of Jordan Peterson.  I guess mailed him an autographed copy of his book.  I guess, how did he get your address, Greg?  You guys having some friendly conversations?  But he obviously did this because Greg put out a video that basically backed up all of Jordan Peterson's lies about Bill C-16, which is what made Jordan Peterson famous to begin with.  Jordan Peterson went out and lied.  He literally said that if you make fun of somebody's clothing choice, you could be charged with a hate crime.  Talking about trans people, which was totally ridiculous.  The Canadian Bar Association actually had to come out and release a statement explaining why he was lying and wrong.  Because his lies were directly causing tons of fucking hate towards trans people.  And you don't have to believe me.  You can just go on Twitter and you can type in Bill C-16 trans and you can go back to the last several years that he did this and read the mountainous amount of hate that was aimed at trans people because of his lies.  And Greg fucking made a video where he backed up Jordan Peterson's lies and Jordan Peterson sent him a nice little friendly autograph book as a thank you.  So fuck you, Greg, for that.  Can you imagine if Greg came out and he said, OK, I think Jordan Peterson lied about Bill C-16.  I'm sorry I was a part of this.  I'm absolutely fucking sorry.  I'm sorry for all the trans hate that was caused by me spreading these lies.  I disavow Jordan Peterson, but he won't do that.  And you know why he won't do that?  Because he's going to lose tons of fucking fans and tons of fucking money, and he's a sackless coward.  That's exactly why the fuck he won't do that.  All right, next up.  And back in the day, like when I was trying to talk to these people, when they were smearing me and lying about me and saying that I was lying about them and saying, don't listen to Dusty.  He's just irrelevant trying to be popular and attacking people to make money.  I was like, motherfucker, let's debate.  I'll debate you.  I'll pull up all the fucking receipts and show you this shit.  And then, so he gets on his fucking Twitter and he acts like a badass.  And he's like, I don't know about bearing, but I would debate Colton Dusty buck naked if it would shut him up about my cartoon character.  And so same day, look, same exact day, November 14th.  I messaged him and I was like, awesome.  Let's do this fucking dude.  Let's do it.  What's good for you?  Immediately.  Let's fucking do this.  And, of course, he posted online right after that, I was just kidding about that.  I was just fucking kidding.  I'm not going to debate Dusty.  Fuck no, you're not going to debate Dusty.  I know why you're not going to debate Dusty, because I would fucking call your ass out.  I'd play your fucking videos, and I would show you the receipts of what you did.  And that's why he fucking chickened out.  So he's a fucking coward.  He got online, and he acted like a badass, like he would fucking challenge me and take me on.  And the very moment he got the opportunity, he tucked his tail between his legs, and he ran like a fucking bitch.  That's the gospel.  Oh yeah, and then he made a video recently about H-Bomber guy.  What a stupid fucking move.  And he took massive shit about that.  He looked like he was drunk to me.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  Going up to H-Bomber guy, that ain't smart.  What the fuck are you thinking, dude?  Even his own fans started turning against him, as they should.  And so he got on.  I guess he said something about Francesca Ramsey, who is the chick who runs the show on MTV, who I guess for some reason, when he was really popular, she was trying to get him on her show or something to do a segment or something or another.  Her bad.  Francesca should have done your research a little better.  But anyway, he got on there and he basically claimed that she was trying to bribe him.  Um, for $300.  Ooh, what a bribe to say shit that he didn't believe in.  And that's why he was, he stood up for his beliefs and he didn't do the show because he just wasn't going to be bribed.  And of course she dragged his fucking ass and he like backed away real fucking fast when she was like, Motherfucker, are you out of your goddamn mind?  You lying your ass off.  I have all the receipts, and I'll show fucking everybody.  And he was like, oh, sorry.  Maybe I just overstated.  Yeah, bitch, you lied.  You trying to play the victim card and act like you some brave motherfucker, but you ain't.  You just a liar.  So anyway, I like Francesca Rapsley.  She's pretty cool, and Greg is not.  Alright, one more.  Oh, yeah.  And so, here's one thing I do all the time.  Like, when people come and defend TJ against the shit I say, or come and defend Greg or Chew on Head, I like to go look these people up to see what kind of people you're attracting.  And this motherfucker who was defending you guys literally has a swastika as his fucking picture.  Look at that shit!  And so, you go to his fucking, uh, went to his Twitter account, just to take a peek, see what kind of fellow this guy is, and look!  This is the kind of guy that you're attracting.  This is the kind of guy that was defending you guys.  Fucking, whites will be the minority.  Great replacement propaganda.  This week on the alt-right.  Yeah, really surprising.  New video by Martin Selner.  Literally retweeting the guy who the Christchurch shooter sent over $10,000 to.  You're attracting these alt-right shitheads.  These fucking racist white supremacists.  are coming and defending you, okay?  Now, I guarantee you, I ain't got no fucking white supremacists defending me.  I ain't fucking attracting these people except for them to come troll me.  So, isn't there a point where you have to self-reflect and ask yourself, why are we attracting so many fucking shitheads?  What are we doing?  At the very least, you're attracting these people... Or, like, if you don't want to say that, if you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, at the very, very least, you're definitely not doing enough to distance yourself from these people.  Because I distance myself from these people, and they ain't fucking standing for me.  Absolutely not.  They fucking hate my guts.  Why don't they hate you?  Well, there's a reason for that.  Because you're not fucking speaking out against it like you should.  You're... dog-whistling to these people.  You're saying lots of fucking ridiculous shit you shouldn't be saying.  You're signal-boosting for people you shouldn't be signal-boosting for, and so you're attracting all these people to your content who like you because of your fucking actions.  None of this has anything to do with guilt by association.  It has to do with guilt by your fucking actions.  What you are doing is causing harm to spread, and that's why I'm calling you out for it.  Too late. ",
