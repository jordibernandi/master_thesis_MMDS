            "text": "The Regulatory Transparency Project is a special project of the Federal Society.  RTP advances a national conversation about regulatory policy and works to identify critical areas for improvement.  It is important to recognize that some regulation is necessary, but it should follow the laws set forth by the legislative branch, provide clear benefits to the public, and be transparent.  When regulation fails these objectives, opportunity, innovation, and individual liberty suffer.  RTP is therefore dedicated to exploring regulatory policy in all its forms and how it affects the general public, innovators, businesses, and the economy.  Leading legal and policy experts further this discussion by contributing to short documentary videos, podcasts, policy papers, and live events.  You can connect with the project and learn more at our website, regproject.org.  That's R-E-G project dot org.  You can also follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn.  We hope that you will join our efforts and enrich the work with your own unique perspectives. ",
