And if we're not careful, we'll get caught up in our feelings and allow a story like this to upset us for the rest of the day.  The Ruach said, dig a little deeper.  And that's just what I did.  So when I researched this Mummer's Parade, right on encyclopedia.com, this is what I found out.  It says this tradition dates back to 400  B.C.,  and the Roman festival of Saturnalia.  That's right.  Most of us are familiar that Saturnalia is the roots of where we get the modern day Christmas holiday or festival.  The article goes on to say, this tradition is where Latin laborers marched in masks throughout the day And they engaged in satire and gift exchange.  And a big part of the celebration of this new solar year was with merrymaking.  In the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 7, verse 4, we are told the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.  As the children of Yahuwah, does this mean we can't have fun or be merry?  Of course not.  But the heart of a fool is not thinking of doing things that are pleasing to Yahuwah.  On the other hand, the heart of a fool is constantly looking to gratify the flesh, constantly living from one party to the next.  And that's exactly what Hasatan is doing with the people of the world.  Having them focus on one pagan celebration to the next.  Recently we had Christmas, then New Year's, and a part of this New Year's, this Mummer's Parade.  The next one will be Valentine's.  You see, Yasharal, these festivals, these worldly festivals are all about making fools of those in the world.  And Hasatan and his agents are laughing at these party goers as they get drunk on wine and alcohol and dress in drag.  It goes even deeper, Yashrawalu, in case you were wondering, like I did, where this word mummers comes from.  It comes from the Greek god, Momos.  That's right.  These people are participating in a parade named after a false Roman deity, Momos.  He is said to be the god of satire, mockery, and poetry.  And as you can see here, he's depicted as lifting a mask from his face, hence all the masks that are a part of this parade.  But I hope in this short video I've unmasked the truth of this celebration and who is behind it, none other than Hasatan and his agents.  Please realize, Yashar, when things like this happen, there's always a spiritual component behind it.  And all we have to do is dig a little deeper.  We are told in the scriptures to test everything.  And it is my hope and prayer that in these last days we'll be sober-minded and that more hearts will be turned back to both the written and living Torah.  Yah bless. ",
