One that you, like me, may have seen popping up in your Facebook feed in recent years.  And that is the weird wild world of Christian satire news.  Yes, if you're one of those lucky people who have already been exposed to this pop culture phenomenon, you know I'm talking about the Babylon Bee.  Now the Babylon Bee is basically a Christian version of the onion, and it's about what you expect when you hear someone tell you there's a Christian version of the onion.  No, it's not all about making thinly veiled passive-aggressive commentary on atheists or liberals, though articles such as six-year-old saying why don't we just give everything away for free surges the top of Democratic polls shows that it's not totally above sacrificing cleverness for the sake of lazy crowd-pleasing jabs.  From what I've seen, it looks more like it came from a room full of hip, relevancy-seeking youth pastors trying to be edgy and funny, often dipping into inside jokes about church life and Christian culture as much as anything, and of course it often falls flat the way you'd expect this same room full of youth pastors to.  Even when it takes a jab at God's not dead, it does so in obvious, unimaginative ways.  that immediately dashes any hopes you'd had for, well, seeing Christians make fun of God's not dead.  If you want to know more about the Babylon Bee in general, you can explore it yourself.  But today I wanted to focus on one of their articles I actually found reasonably funny, and discuss why it was funny and what it means about how Christians see themselves.  But before we do that, since we're on the topic of satire, I want to really quickly tell you about a book I recently received called The Misread Bible.  This isn't a paid promotion.  The author just sent me a copy and I thought it was cool, so I thought I'd tell you about it.  Basically, it's the Bible, but he, well, misreads it by changing passages.  It's pretty cool and often hilarious, and there's even an audiobook version.  Here's a sample. ",

            "text": "Nashville, Tennessee.  Describing the experience as tragic, local worship leader Axel Johnson found his congregation totally unable to worship as the church's primary fog machine malfunctioned right in the middle of the Sunday morning set.  \"'We barely got through our new song.  It was a real train wreck,'.  a visibly shaken Johnson told us while sipping a latte macchiato in the church cafe after  service.\".  Just as the song, an original mash-up between Hoobastank's The Reason and Gungor's Beautiful Things reached its climax, a loud pop emanated from the 1600-watt machine positioned just in front of the plexiglass pulpit.  The device sputtered to a halt and ceased pumping out 30,000 cubic feet of water-based fog per minute into the venue.  Onlookers said it totally and instantly killed their personal worship experience.  It was a serious downer, one parishioner recalled.  One moment I was caught up in the spirit, worshipping the living God of all creation before his throne, and the next I was brought plummeting back down to earth.  The mood was totally ruined.  The church has ordered a full inspection of the remaining five fog machines, as well as the laser light controllers, as a preventative measure.  We're not losing the Holy Spirit again.  Not on my watch anyway, Johnson declared.  We're a strong group on a life journey together.  We'll pick ourselves up and grow from this tragedy.  At publishing time, the church is discussing a possible name change from Legacy to The Gathering to help the flock move on. ",

            "text": "Now I'm definitely not saying this article is brilliant, and I can see how it might fall flat for some people.  But it took a lot of what I found to be reasonably funny jabs at megachurches, or hipster seeker friendly churches in general, and it did so pretty concisely using quick little bits of imagery.  If you've had any exposure to these kinds of institutions, little details such as a worship leader named Axel Johnson sipping a latte in the church cafe or the attempt to manufacture emotion with a mashup of syrup-soaked songs such as The Reason and Beautiful Things instantly paint a hilarious picture of what happens when a church tries to recreate its own version of relevant modern culture within an inward-looking church environment, instead producing this weird artificial subculture that only really exists part-time and most people just step in and out of.  and the name change from Legacy to The Gathering actually got a laugh from me, especially since I'd heard my former pastor slash boss attempt a tortured explanation for why he was rebranding our church as The Crossing.  So yeah.  But the focus throughout this piece was really on one main joke, which is about how this megachurch relied so heavily on carefully chosen song sets and garish effects to evoke a feeling of being connected to the Holy Spirit.  And from my experience in the church, I can see how this joke would resonate with a lot of Christians, especially those critical of the overly produced frivolity of megachurches.  A lot of Christians I grew up with would actually be very critical of churches like this, not only because they could, I don't know, feed a lot of people with the money they use to run 1600 watt fog machines, but because of the value they place on momentary emotional experiences and the lengths they go to to conjure them.  So I get how this works with a Christian audience.  But there's a problem here.  A big part of this joke is in phrasing things as if this fictional megachurch needed these trappings to bring the Holy Spirit into its auditorium, or have it move through the congregation or however your denomination likes to phrase it.  And once the church's production faltered, the Holy Spirit actually couldn't move within this church.  Logically, of course, such a thing should not stop the Holy Spirit, if you actually believe it exists, because if it did, it should have easily been able to enter the auditorium and communicate with Christians at will.  And fog machines and production values and even music shouldn't have been a factor at all.  So by saying that the Holy Spirit was blocked by a breakdown in these things, this article is very heavily implying that whatever experience this congregation interpreted as experiencing the Holy Spirit was just a wave of emotion generated by a carefully crafted church experience.  But if that's what experiencing the Holy Spirit was for this church, then couldn't that mean that that's all it is for Christians in general?  Or if not, doesn't the mere suggestion open the door for Christians to doubt the very emotional experiences that make God real to them and for some shape their understanding of who he is and possibly whether he exists?  To me, it looks like this article skates dangerously close to a joke about the fundamental idea of worship and even to the idea of Christians thinking they are connecting with God.  This might not seem like a big deal to a lot of people, but in some branches of Christianity, it definitely is.  Many evangelicals say they believe in God largely because they feel him in their heart and know him personally.  But if the feeling they think is God might even possibly be something else, that's something they don't even want to consider.  I sure didn't.  So why would a Christian publication even take such a sideways shot at something that defines their idea of communion with God?  Why did they even make this joke?  I guess we could just chalk it up to obliviousness and leave it at that.  But on a deeper level, I think this article represents a way that Christians simultaneously contain and indulge in doubts about their faith.  Basically, jokes like this take something that's funny about all of Christianity, and even shows a deep underlying problem with the religion, and deals with it by focusing the humor and implicit criticism onto a specific group of Christians.  This does a couple things for them.  First and most obviously, it's a way of processing an underlying doubt they have about their own faith.  When they simply can't deny that a specific absurdity exists anywhere within any part of Christianity, they can at least drown out their doubts by laughing really hard at how one specific group of Christians manifests this problem, then pretend it's just a quirk of that one group or fault of one denomination instead of something that seriously undermines their entire faith.  It's easy to just laugh at generalizations about how rigidly the Catholics follow ritual and pretend that Christianity at large doesn't at all.  It's easy to laugh at King James only-ists for believing in the internal unchanging value of every word in the King James Bible and pretend your own fundamentalist adherence to the Bible is off the hook just because it seems slightly less absurd by comparison.  It's easy to laugh at faith healers for claiming to instantly heal people when you yourself believe God heals people but load your idea of when and how with enough qualifiers to avoid confronting the fact that he doesn't.  It's easy to laugh at fire and brimstone preachers when you yourself believe non-Christians deserve eternal torture but are more polite about it.  And yes, it's easy to laugh at a megachurch for using fog machines to evoke the Holy Spirit when you rely on some form of music and meditation to do the same.  and the underlying principle is that needing either is equally silly.  And laughing at one other group of Christians for how they do what you do but in a more obvious way, or at least a way that's more obvious to you because it's slightly different from what you do and you bury the mechanics of how you do the same thing at the back of your mind, helps you pretend that your reliance on ritual, your fundamentalism, your belief in healing or hell, and the dependency of your relationship with God on emotions evoked by music don't exist, and that they don't undermine your faith.  In a sort of variation of the no true Scotsman fallacy, everything weird or silly about Christianity is just something wrong with specific people.  Usually other people, of course.  But there's a second part of this that I want to touch on really quickly.  And that is that many Christians actually want to laugh at their own faith.  They aren't a monolithic group of people who believe in the same way on the same level.  Many not only have their deep-seated doubts, but deep down actually think a lot of their religion is funny and are embarrassed for associating with it.  They want to laugh at it, but can't admit to themselves or others that it should be laughed at.  So turning the focus to a specific group not only helps them avoid doubts, but lets them release some pent-up irreverence that they keep bottled up for fear of what mocking their own religion reveals to them about their own religion.  But if you're a Christian who laughs at large groups of other Christians, the fact of the matter is that whatever you think is funny about them is probably funny about you, at least to some extent.  Whatever you think undermines their religious experience or their specific belief often undermines yours as well.  The sooner you can recognize this, and as a result introspect about the meaning of what you actually believe, the sooner you will be able to really assess what you believe.  Will this lead you to atheism?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  But I have to think, if you really honestly assess yourself and your beliefs, it will at least have to give you a small tug in that direction.  But then if you're truly confident in your faith, what's there to be afraid of?  Why should you need to avoid looking too closely at yourself by laughing at others?
