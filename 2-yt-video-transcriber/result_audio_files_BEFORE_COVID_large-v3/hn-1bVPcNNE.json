So his big divide in society is between the proletariat and the bourgeois.  These are basically different groups of economic class in society.  And he sees the groups themselves as having differences of interest, differences of aim.  So if you're a worker, you're a proletariat, your aim is to better your conditions, to gain more from your labor, to improve your lot in life effectively.  Whereas the bourgeois, the owners of capital, at least by the time that Marx is writing, are seeking to profit.  They're seeking enrichment.  And so long as that divergence exists, so long as it persists, it's going to bring the two groups into struggle.  And it's the struggle, it's the competition over the means of production.  that's basically the driving mechanism of Marx's entire system. ",

            "text": "Marx borrowed from the classical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo who analytically divided the economy into landowners, workers, and capitalists.  And for Marx, these were sociological categories.  So the workers were divided between the proletarians, the unskilled workers, and the bourgeoisie, the salary earners.  and then the landowners and the capitalists.  But the landowners had become less important by the time Marx wrote.  The capitalists had displaced the feudal aristocracy, and the next stage would be the proletarians overthrowing the bourgeoisie and the capitalists and establishing a socialist society.  Dictatorship is a negatively charged term.  But Marx's view seemed to be that it's just changing one dictatorship for another.  We now have the dictatorship of the capitalists.  We're going to replace that by the dictatorship of the proletarians, who are the majority in his view.  So it's a more majoritarian system. ",
