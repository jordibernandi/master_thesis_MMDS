            "text": "There's parking enforcement just pulled up, and I guess they're gonna write somebody a ticket.  Y'all gonna write her a ticket?  Is that what y'all are fixing to do?  No, sir.  No.  Do y'all write any kind of tickets here at all for people parking here?  For the commercial?  Yes, we do.  What about that truck right there?  It's a shared vehicle.  Yeah, it's not.  It's a personal vehicle.  I'm fixing that wrench on its hood.  I'm fixing to have lunch on his hood and he's going to come out here and tell me it's illegal and I'm going to tell him that's illegal.  We're going to have a conversation, but you guys are not writing him tickets and it is his own personal vehicle.  I know he puts his sheriff.  I think that's best on there today.  I have talked to the sheriff's office and they're going to be stopping parking there.  They haven't yet.  So, do you have any idea who I am?  Then I'll go ahead and check it out.  No, I don't know who you are, sir.  I'm a civil right activist, go by TX Shipdog.  I have a huge following.  We're very well known amongst the San Antonio government.  I would just ask you if you're supposed to write a ticket to that personal vehicle, just write in a ticket, and you guys will come out looking golden.  But if you don't, then you don't look very good at all.  I'll go ahead and check it out and get it, sir.  Thank you.  If you're in the registration, you'll find out who it comes back to.  I can get that information for you if you'd like.  I'm going to go have my lunch on this head.  Well, you enjoy it, sir.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  Is that one of the worship?  Yeah.  It says that no parking by the name.  I think so.  I think they're going to write some tickets.  I just came to have some lunch.  Have we met before?  No, sir.  We have not met before.  You're Charo, right?  Yes, sir.  How do you spell that, Charo?  C-H-A-R-O.  And 4754?  I think it's a little too late because they're going to start writing you a ticket.  And I got to finish my lunch.  That's probably going to take me about 20 minutes.  So after I finish my lunch, you can move it.  Deal?  Deal.  They thought it was a sheriff's vehicle.  And I said, no, it's not a sheriff's vehicle.  It's a personally owned vehicle.  So, any reason why you park here?  Like, does Bill Miller allow you to park here?  Any particular reason?  Because there's some signs right here.  They're pretty clear.  Have you seen any of my videos?  If you have, you're bound to know that I'm going to come out and get you one day.  So after all this is said and done, I wouldn't park anymore.  It makes you guys look bad, man, because they were fixing to write that girl a ticket and then not write you a ticket.  And it makes it makes your office look bad because it's kind of like, well, do they got special privileges or whatever?  And we know we both know that you don't.  So it's in a new parking lot.  If you're willing to give me a good answer on why you're doing it, I might get my viewers to pay your ticket.  They would love to just hear the truth from an officer one day.  There is a truth behind why you're parking here.  And if you just come out with the truth, I bet you my viewers would pay that ticket for you.  You're getting a parking ticket.  He's getting a parking ticket, and I'm having lunch on his hood.  He can't leave until I'm done with my lunch.  Wow.  Well, he's going to leave me, and I'm going to go, but.  They got parking up here, and I'm willing to bet, and I'm willing to bet, and I would help you out with this, too.  I'm not kidding.  I bet we could get the city of San Antonio to allow you to park there for free.  I'm almost for certain.  You're probably right.  Yeah.  It's a commercial, though.  The city of San Antonio makes about $200,000 a year off the citizens for this type of stuff.  So it doesn't look good for the sheriff's office if he's parked here.  And I need to correct that.  I'm a civil rights activist, and I correct this type of behavior.  I have my methods.  He wanted to move it before they wrote the ticket, but I'm having my lunch, so he can't move it.  I want the police to look good.  And this doesn't make him look good.  Did you want to try with that answer?  I need to throw it away.  I'm out here.  He wanted to move it before he got a ticket, but I wasn't done with my lunch.  Did they write a ticket?  I wasn't paying attention.  It's okay.  Did they write it?  It's okay.  They didn't write it or they did?  Because that's an issue for them if they didn't.  Okay.  So you're going to move it now or am I going to need to call the sheriff's office?  My next step is I'm going to call sheriff's office.  I'm going to call Javier directly.  I have his number.  The sheriff told me if I ever had a problem with his deputies to call him on his cell phone.  I'm fixing to call him and let him know that we're parked illegally.  I've asked you to move it.  You're refusing to move it.  So can you move it?  It's not a pissing contest you're going to win.  If you doubt that, I'll call him directly.  You're sadly mistaken.  I'll let you listen to the phone call.  Once you move in, I'm out of here.  I'll let you listen to the phone call.  Oh, that's fine.  I don't need to hear it.  Okay.  Hey, this is Jack Miller, the YouTube guy.  So your administration, one of your lieutenants told me that if I ever had an issue with one of his deputies, he didn't holler.  So I got a deputy out here, I couldn't ask.  But like one of your supervisors make a location, and I am at the Bill Miller's.  I think it's 100 block of Commerce Street downtown.  Commerce and Main.  Yes.  And he's here working off duty.  Oh.  Yeah.  So... And I'll be standing by down here.  I think he gets off at 4 o'clock.  But he was just written a ticket for parking illegally.  I had parking enforcement come out.  He's been already told once before, don't park here.  He did.  So I had parking enforcement come out.  They did write him a ticket.  And I just told him, go ahead and move it.  But I'll let the supervisor get the rest of the story from him.  You can watch my video.  But we're still here.  Yeah.  Yeah, no problem.  It's 210-540-1726.  Thank you.  All right.  So you're sending a supervisor out.  That's awesome.  Thank you.  Is that... Don't delete that photo.  There's a new law.  I get that photo.  So don't delete it.  If you delete it, it's another violation of the law.  Yeah, so a little bit of blue privilege and I think we got that corrected.  I don't think he's gonna be parking here anymore.  These are the signs, they're very clear.  If you're a armored car, you can park in front of this sign.  at certain times.  And then if you're no matter what you are, you can't park on this side where he was at.  And I suppose if you're looking at the signs, technically, other than between 9 a.m.  and 11 a.m.  and 1 and 3  p.m.,  you can actually park here.  Unless you're an armored car.  So anyhow.  All right, guys.  Yeah, I'm still out here.  I wish he would have, you know, chose to follow the law without being threatened with having a supervisor come out.  But we'll get the supervisor out here and we'll get it all straightened out. ",
