I went to New York City recently with Genetically Modified Skeptic, and we went to visit the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.  He'll be releasing a video on his channel about it soon, so keep a lookout for that.  But after that, we went around to cart witnesses on the streets of New York to talk to them about their beliefs.  This is a documentary-style film about what happened.  I hope you guys like it.  Before we get into it, I just want to mention that there are a few really good ways to show your support.  I consolidated all the ways on my website, TelltaleAtheist.com, so if you want to read blog articles I write, check out my retro game store, find out when I'm having meetups or conferences next, or any of that stuff, that's a pretty good central hub to find out.  But if you do go there, you'll find links to my Patreon, which is one of the best ways to support me, my merchandise store, which is also really good, and my retro game store.  You'll also find links to my Twitter and Facebook and all kinds of other stuff.  Links to all that stuff are all in the description, so check it out.  Also, give my retro game channel a look.  I just launched it recently.  I talk about all kinds of game-related subjects.  I think it's pretty interesting, but I'm probably biased.  Anyways, let's get into it. ",

Gonna tell them I'm a Jehovah's Witness to start off, and then I'm gonna reveal who I really am and see how they react.  Say, hey guys, like, I'm a witness myself.  I think that I should claim loose affiliation, not a direct I am currently.  I think that... they'll be more willing to talk about their doctrine and explain things more clearly if they don't realize that I am fully him.  So maybe I should just say, I have some family members who are Jehovah's Witness.  If their guard goes up, then they're going to shut down and not consent to talk to us.  Ready? ",
