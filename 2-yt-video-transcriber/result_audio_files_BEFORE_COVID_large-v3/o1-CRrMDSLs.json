Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record.  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.  She blocked evidence.  She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.  And she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way. ",

And I am proud of that work.  And I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform.  That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.  It is why, and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken, that I am an advocate for what we need to do to not only decriminalize but legalize marijuana in the United States. ",

There is no excuse for that.  And the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor, you owe them an apology. ",

And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision, to face the people I have faced, to say, I will not seek the death penalty.  That is my background.  That is my work.  I am proud of it.  I think you can judge people by when they are under fire, and it's not about some fancy opinion on a stage, but when they're in the position to actually make a decision, what do they do?  When I was in the position of having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted, I made a very difficult decision that was not popular to not seek the death penalty.  History shows that, and I am proud of those decisions. ",
