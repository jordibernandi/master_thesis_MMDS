            "text": "The European Union misused British tax money, we talk about Brussels' financial corruption and Clive Lewis wanting a referendum on the monarchy.  For the last few years and the last decade or so, we have been told about the gravy train in Brussels and with the European Union officials and what they actually do with the money that we give them.  So obviously, as you know, the way the European Union operates is primarily they have a budget that is contributed by all the member states and all the 28 countries that are part of this club and what they do is they use the tax receipts that they receive from the taxpayers from each nation and the governments give that money to Brussels and then Brussels decide how to spend that money back on the same people.  now you would think that just like any other government treasury for example you give your tax money.  they will spend it on services that actually matters to you not really because they have Priorities for themselves.  the money that you give to them all of us.  Not necessarily.  they wouldn't necessarily go towards things that they have been promising to spend on whether all these various European programs and projects that they have which is again Pointless, because we could do it ourselves as a country.  But no, they have created this gravy train.  So firstly, in Belgium there is this agreement for the diplomats and the political staffers and officials.  For them, they are exempt.  from paying taxes and VAT on most goods and services, including private expenses.  There is currently a situation where latest figures show that Belgium missed out in claiming around \u00a3500 million in VAT payments.  Now, they advertise these duty-free brands and products at the kind of, obviously, preferred prices for diplomats and officials.  This also includes people who work at the European Union, the actual European Court of Justice and all these other buildings.  They have these catalogues for luxury goods, whisky and really rare Cuban cigars.  There's a special edition of a cigar that a box of 20 of them is marked at \u00a3160.  The actual price and value of the same box goes between \u00a3500 to \u00a3750.  Now this is a massive discount.  They also get bottles of vintage wine and collectible gift boxes that are available for \u00a3200.  And obviously they get it for a lot cheaper.  This is getting absolutely ridiculous.  This also includes various other ridiculous things like perfume, aftershave, watches, sunglasses, but it doesn't stop here.  Now, we always knew about this, the gravy train, and they get all these discounts, the exemption, tax exemptions.  I don't know why.  The actual salary of an MVP is good enough.  They also get expenses on top of it, and then they get all this free stuff as well.  We have a Brexit party MEP who exposed in more detail what they actually get as MEPs and as officials in Brussels.  And trust me, it's not good. ",

            "text": "Did you know that MEPs can claim foreign language classes and private health care?  But best of all, not just for me, but for my whole family.  In addition, I am given \u00a34,000 every month for a local constituency office, which does not include staff salaries.  That's on top of that.  It only is for rent and office equipment, and no receipts required.  And when I asked how I could repay the unspent money back to the EU, I was told that there is no facility to repay the money.  Rest assured I'm keeping a tab and monies unspent will be given to a UK registered charity in the North West. ",

            "text": "Now you think this is bad.  As you know over the last few years the European Union go after big American tech firms that go to certain places like Ireland to be based there to pay less taxes because that's just how Ireland works.  The EU go over there, impose new taxes on them, give them penalties because you have to pay more taxes.  Fair, but it's not the job of the EU to do it.  It should be the job of the sovereign country to decide how their taxation works.  But that's a different argument.  The hypocrisy here is that the same people at the top of the European Union also use personal tax schemes to pay less money for themselves.  The hypocrisy is absolutely ridiculous.  At the same time, the European Union trade negotiators are more concerned about having access to UK waters.  Now, we know that Boris Johnson has clarified that After Brexit, at the end of this month, and then after transition, we will be a free and sovereign country.  You can't just randomly come here and have access to our waters and take our fish.  The UK fishing industry will be protected according to the government, but the EU, they're not budging.  The EU are now... going around telling Boris Johnson's government that if you don't give us full access to your waters, seriously, we are now going to ask for more money and more payments from you.  Boris has already said we're not giving any more money anyway and that's already going to be legally binding because we have to decide if we agree to pay anything.  we've said that and now the eu have come back and said well we are going to restrict access and block a financial industries in the city of london the access that they have to european markets.  right considering that the fact that the financial center in london it's the city of london canary wharf.  this is the hub not just for europe but for the whole world and for the west in general.  in america london is the hub for finance and so if you restrict access it's also going to be hitting europe.  and but when you look at the whole situation with the fishing this is the map of the actual coastal states uh the actual exclusive economic zones of the area.  for the uk.  the dark blue obviously belongs to the United Kingdom and these other neighbouring countries.  they go to Brussels.  they beg these officials to say can you please take our side and make the UK give up their own sovereignty just for us?  this is why Michel Barnier is changing tack because we thought the priorities of these trade talks are going to be focused somewhere else.  Different areas of goods and services, the products that are coming in from Europe and we send some products there.  But no, it's all going to be about fishing.  So let's see how this actually ends.  I don't think it's going to be good for the EU because if this continues, as far as we know, if the government goes with what they have said and promised in the election and in general what Boris has been saying, if the EU... Don't give up on this.  We are going to be leaving, walking away on WTO terms at the end of this year.  So it's win-win for the UK.  So hopefully we won't give up any of this.  And which means, fine, you could either give us a normal free trade agreement based on mutual, an actual mutual agreement, or... We don't need you.  We could go out on WSO terms.  But we'll keep you guys posted on this because I think we're going to be busy on this whole phishing stuff for a while.  Now, a separate note, we have obviously the Labour leadership elections and Clive Lewis is now one of the candidates.  As you know, Clive Lewis loves socialism and he hates Brexit.  He also apparently hates good haircuts.  And so this guy is now a candidate.  He doesn't really have a chance, but you never know. ",

            "text": "He's come out and said that he's a Republican.  He is against constitutional monarchy.  But my problem with people like him is that.  So he's come out and said we should have a referendum on a monarchy and we should... get rid of it.  now I know a lot of people even on the right because you know everything's very broad these days.  not everybody's pro royal family.  but the problem I have is that people like Clive Lewis are against the monarchy because they're against the family.  they just don't like well either the Queen or the whole family and the whole concept of why should there be one family in charge and They don't realize that the monarchy and the constitutional monarchy as a system has got nothing to do with the family or even the actual king or queen.  It's the crown that matters.  It's the crown that needs to be protected for the sake of our system.  The head of state is above party politics.  I don't want to have our head of state to be voted based on party politics.  That's not going to be good.  We'll see how this actually ends, because whether he likes it or not, at the moment, the majority of people in this country are still pro-monarchy.  Now, this could change in the next few years, in the next couple of decades, but at the moment, I don't know why he's going out there, considering he knows that a lot of the Labour working class voters they're not gonna be happy about this.  They are very patriotic, they love their queen, they love their flag, and it's like he wants to lose on purpose.  Now we'll see how Clive Lewis actually ends his campaign, how long he will survive, but we are going to be focusing on brexit and brexit day 31st of january and we have a surprise for you guys.  you guys have been asking for this for a few weeks now.  we now have new t-shirts.  we got the new brexit t-shirts uk independence day 31st of january 2020. you could find this.  i'll put the link in the description.  as always you could also find various other designs brexit t-shirts and other stuff on that link.  so yeah check out the merchandise page and considering we have the 31st of january coming up fast and we're going to have a lot of brexit victory parties across the country and we're all going to be wearing these t-shirts to celebrate our independence and if you enjoy the content obviously make sure that you subscribe if you haven't already and click on the bell next to it where we release videos every day at 5 45 p.m on my itc and i'll see you guys tomorrow with a new video.
