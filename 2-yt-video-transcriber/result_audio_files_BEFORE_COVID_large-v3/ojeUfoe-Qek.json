But there is a glimmer of hope for Jimmy Fallon, who has been the least political of all of the hosts, not wanting to drive away half of his audience.  In what has to be the funniest skit on late night TV in over two years, Jimmy Fallon's impression of Beta O'Rourke is almost indistinguishable of the fake Latino himself.  Here he is doing an impression of Beta's announcement that he's running for president.  I'm Beta O'Rourke and I'm excited.  That's it.  I'm just excited.  Oh yeah. ",

As you may recall, when he had Donald Trump on his show shortly before the 26th state election, liberals were absolutely furious because he was too nice to him.  And the rumor has it that that was the reason why the Emmys snubbed him that year, not even nominating him.  I'm having increasing suspicions that Beto O'Rourke may be playing a character and that his entire campaign is a spoof on a Democrat running for president. ",

He must have drawn inspiration from Stephen Colbert because his old show on Comedy Central was based around a parody of a crazy Republican.  Only Beto's putting a shoe on the other foot now.  For his latest bit, he's apologized for his white privilege after he joked a couple times on the campaign trail that his wife is raising their kids with a little bit of his help.  Not only will I not say that again, but I will be more thoughtful going forward in the way that I talk about our marriage and also the way in which I acknowledge the truth of the criticism that I have enjoyed white privilege.  In fact, Beta's antics are so strange that even MSNBC is telling him to stop. ",

It hasn't just happened once.  Oh, no, this is a trend, a trend that appears to have legs.  Feet go on the floor, sir, not on surfaces where people eat.  Why can't you be more like Mitt Romney?  He's so worried about spreading germs, he removes the candles from his birthday cake before he blows them out.

Last year, my favorite comedian Jay Leno, who was fired by NBC's Tonight Show despite still being number one after over 20 years, said that the tone of the late night comedy of the Trump era is depressing.  After all, it doesn't make much sense to fire someone if they're number one in the ratings and have been for decades unless they start to upset the liberal apple cart.  But you know what, Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, if what you're doing really makes you happy, you just keep it up.  Because us normal people have found our entertainment somewhere else.  Speaking of entertainment, what do you guys think of my new Trump Thug Life t-shirt?  Order yours from my online store at markdice.com or click the link in the description below.  And of course, like all of my shirts, it is available in a t-shirt, long sleeve, and a hoodie, and a whole bunch of different colors as well.  I've been holding on to this design for months, waiting for the perfect time for when President Trump pulls off a flawless victory.  And that time, of course, is now.
