First, Josh, my top patron for the past few years, would like you to know about JourneyFree.org, an organization that helps people recover from religious-based trauma.  Unlike the fake war on Christmas, people are actually harmed under authoritarian religious indoctrination and other such practices.  So if you're one of those who have been harmed, it might be worth checking out journeyfree.org.  But even if you're not, you might want to consider them for your future charitable donations.  Also, thank you very much to Techvania, who played the wounded veteran of the war on Christmas.  He has a great tech channel and is the guy to turn to for anything computer or gaming related.  He helped me out a great deal over the past few weeks by creating a program that allows God himself to interact with you in real time on live streams, to put it in God's words, without your face melting off like that Nazi in Indiana Jones.  Speaking of those live streams, they have officially begun on Twitch.  I have an excellent highlights video I'll upload to this channel before years end.  And for now, I'm probably going to archive the full streams on Dark Matter Archive.  Lastly, the future of this channel was in question due to COPPA, but I have consulted a lawyer who examined my content and he thinks that I'll be okay.  So I'm going to continue making animations, saying what I want to say, which means they'll probably be demonetized, which isn't just about the money, but it also lowers the chances I'll be recommended, which is why I greatly appreciate it when you share my videos and help them spread regardless of the algorithm.  And if you feel like becoming a patron or a Subscribestar supporter, that helps out a great deal too.  I'm also including any livestream donors in these credits because I greatly appreciate your support.  Thank you very much. ",
