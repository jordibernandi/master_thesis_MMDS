            "text": "And what if we pick the wrong religion?  Every week we're just making God madder and madder.  Testify!  When the Enlightenment philosopher and polymath, Denis Diderot, was confronted with Pascal's Wager, he succinctly replied, and Imam could reason just as well.  His point was that there are many proposed gods, and that Pascal's Wager can just as easily be applied to many of them.  Not all, and I'll explain why shortly, but certainly many.  Today, this criticism is known as the objection of inconsistent revelations, and when wielded appropriately, it exposes the wager for what it truly is, a complete and utter con.  The church within, which alone salvation is to be found, is not necessarily the Church of Rome, so says John Leslie Mackey, but perhaps that of the Anabaptists, or the Mormons, or the Muslim Sunnis, or the worshippers of Kali, or of Odin.  We are not, as Pascal claims, embarked to wager upon a two-sided coin, but rather a thousand-sided die.  I'm Stephen Woodford, thanks for joining me, and this is Inconsistent Revelations.  Pascal's wager is, not surprisingly, attributed to Blaise Pascal, and rightfully so, but it's worth noting that variations have existed for millennia.  For example, 400 years before Christianity was even a thing, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Protagoras was agnostic of the Olympian gods, but he continued to worship them nevertheless in case of their existence.  This seems a little odd, granted, but as Stephen Fry and others have noted, the Greeks believe that if the gods exist, they are capricious, unkind, malicious mostly, temperamental, envious, and mostly deeply unpleasant.  And so, Protagoras' worshipping, despite his agnosticism, makes sense.  Some argue, however, that he worshipped merely for show, to avoid the wrath of the Athenians.  Truth be told, this also might be the case.  In any case, facing death or exile, Protagoras sailed to Sicily.  But alas, his ship was wrecked and Poseidon claimed his prize.  An even earlier rendition of Pascal's Wager, and more precise, can be found in the Kalama Sutta, in which the Buddha urges followers to practice their faith in case of an afterlife, stating, \"...if there is a world after death, if there is the fruit of actions rightly and wrongly done, then this is the basis by which, with the breakup of the body, after death, I will reappear in a good destination, the heavenly  world.\".  But if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit of actions rightly and wrongly done, then here in the present life I look after myself with ease, free from hostility, free from ill will, free from  trouble.\".  Indeed, this rendition is in fact so similar to Pascal's Wager that it even boasts, like Pascal, that belief is beneficial no matter the truth.  And to name just one more example, in the Shia Hadith of al-Khafi, our Siddiq declares to an atheist, if it is the way that you say, and it is not true, then we as well as you are all saved.  However, if it is the way that we say, and it is true, we are saved, but you are destroyed.  So, to get back to Diderot, not only can an Imam reason the same way, but long before Pascal's time, an Imam did reason the same way.  Hence, we have the objection of inconsistent revelations.  Simply put, Pascal failed to justify the exclusion of other infinite gods, and consequently, a true wager would require, per god, two additional columns and two additional rows, and the result would be what I'd like to think Ian Hacken would term a monstrous matrix.  Now I say other infinite gods and not simply other gods for the same reason that Diderot said an imam and not a Babylonian.  Compared to the aforementioned wagers, what makes Pascal's unique is his powerful mathematical premises, and especially his almost monotonous emphasis of the nature of infinity.  To give a few examples, towards the beginning of his most substantive presentation, he says, a game is being played at the extremities of this infinite distance.  Then, after presenting a few premises, he states, If you gain, you gain all.  If you lose, you lose nothing.  Then, again, he states, Wherever the infinite is, and there is not an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no time to hesitate.  You must give all.  And as if this wasn't already enough emphasis, he concludes by saying, Our proposition is of infinite force.  His underlining point, as already covered within this series, is that the infinite consequences of heaven and hell necessarily eclipse any and all finite costs, since, in Pascal's words, the finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing.  But if we take his precise reasoning here and apply it to the question of why he ignores other gods, we can presume his response, which, for the record, is exactly what apologists do today.  Different gods threaten different consequences for not grovelling at their feet.  If you don't worship the Mesopotamian god of death, Nurgle, he will withdraw his protection, and in doing so enable demons to torment you.  But no matter what those demons do, no matter how much suffering they inflict, since they can only inflict a finite amount, this consequence becomes a pure nothing when contrasted against the infinite hell threatened by the Christian god, Yahweh.  Given this, the threat of the latter simply superdominates the threat of the former.  If men are capable of any truths, Pascal continues, this is one of them.  If we contrast any finite number, no matter how large, against the infinite, it does become a nothing.  You see, you thought I was going to make the same slip-up as I did in the last video, didn't you?  You are fake news.  Okay, let's get back on track.  Given the nature of infinity, we can discount all gods who deal in finites.  But we can't discount any god who deals in absolutes.  Only a Sith deals in absolutes.  And so while the monstrous matrix is now tamed, it nevertheless still delivers a fatal bite.  Since multiple gods threaten infinite consequences, Pascal's crucial premise of, if you lose, you lose nothing, is no longer valid, and hence the superdominance is now gone.  Even if we presume, for no good reason, that one of these Sith Gods exist, no matter which specific Sith God you wager on, if you lose, you lose everything.  Again, presuming that at least one of these Sith Gods exist, if you wager on Pascal's Yahweh, and it turns out that Yahweh doesn't exist, rather than losing nothing, as is the case in Pascal's Matrix, you lose everything.  Likewise, if you wager on Allah, and it turns out that, say, Osiris exists, then it's the eternal lake of fire for you, my friend.  Now since you stand to lose no matter what Sith God you bet on, Pascal's wager utterly crumbles.  It is revealed for what it is \u2013 a con.  And as a cherry on top, notice that we haven't even mentioned the fact that Christianity alone has over 33,000 denominations, and that many of them insist that followers of the other denominations are going straight to hell.  Indeed, the monstrous Matrix true form is significantly more grotesque than I've depicted here.  Wager, then, with all hesitation, as groveling at one potential warlord's feet may earn you the infinite wrath of another.  Aren't these beings just lovely?  How they judge us not by the content of our character, but by whether we hollow their name.  Anyhow, I am Stephen Woodford, and as always, thank you kindly for the view, and an extra special thank you to my wonderful patrons and those of you who have supported the channel via other means.  Wager, then, without hesitation, that he is.  And that is why I hired someone to do the French.  Don't judge me.  Anyway, debunked.  Click the link below to see a complete unpacking of this.
