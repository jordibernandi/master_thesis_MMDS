            "text": "Guys, I hope you're going to enjoy this video.  This is a real bunker that was installed almost eight years ago.  If you would like for you and your family to spend 30 days in a bunker on a challenge sponsored by Atlas Survival Shelters and Emergency Essentials, comment below, send an email to Ron at Atlas Survival Shelters.  If you are selected, you and your family will win a year's worth of survival food and supplies from Emergency Essentials.  Enjoy the video.  It's a good one.  So the bunker is under that table and there's one air pipe and it's galvanized steel.  It says, well pump, overpressure vent, do not obstruct.  So I guess I just pull this off, right?  Okay.  I won't have you in it.  You won't be in it.  Okay.  So this is, this is revealing a hidden bunker.  Wow, how cool is this?  It's almost like every guy's fantasy almost, isn't it?  Look at that.  Wow, ain't nobody would have found that, you know that?  Wow.  Check that out.  Hold on a second, pull it all the way back.  So that hatch is, that's an armor-plated hatch.  It's about eight years old.  It's got an automotive paint finish on it so it doesn't have one speck of rust on it.  Look at that paint.  And then it's in perfect shape.  And after you put your hatch in, you've got to pour concrete around it.  You want it hardened so somebody is really trying to dig you out.  They can't get to it.  So we're going to go ahead and open this thing up.  Hold on a second.  So he's gone ahead and he's unlocked his hatch.  Go ahead.  Take your foot off it.  So this is an actual bunker.  It's been in the ground.  It says zombie fallout hatch.  And he's got his stairs there.  And we're going to go down inside.  I know you can't really see right now, but I'm going to back it up and get a little better video.  Okay, so I'm just going to get some more footage of this hatch on this bunker here.  The guy had the hatch covered under a tarp.  and then a bunch of wood piled on top of it.  But I would have found it eventually because I would have recognized that this air pipe, which is, this is a military style air pipe.  See, the air actually has to go up here.  Okay, then it crosses over the pipe.  And like I said, this is galvanized steel right here.  And it's just not gonna rust on you guys.  Okay, so I am walking down a set of stairs.  I am in a bunker that has been in the ground for eight years.  And it's kind of weird because it still smells new in here.  And he's got the floor pulled up.  He's showing me the storage underneath the floor here.  And there's storage and literally stuff everywhere.  But the funny thing is it still smells new.  And you go into this master bedroom.  That's kind of neat.  It's got a fireplace in there.  It's kind of romantic.  And there's the air system running.  And you can hear how quiet it is.  Oh yeah, it's blowing.  But that's all the noise the air system makes.  And this is the VA-150.  This is a military-grade NBC air filtration system.  And this little filter right here, the carbon filter, I mean, that sucker's heavy.  It's got 60 pounds of carbon in it.  And that's what's required to filter out the radiation.  These little air systems, they have like four or five pounds of this.  They don't cut the trick really.  They may work for 24 hours or something, but they're not long term like a system like this.  But he's got it in a fireplace.  He's got chest of drawers blocking the escape tunnel.  Got a queen size bed in here.  So I'm sitting on his couch and give you guys an idea what's in here without giving away everything.  in his bunker.  He's got a TV, and good God, do you have enough supplies.  I guess you're prepared for doomsday.  Well, that's what they're for, but is it comfortable?  This couch is, let me, you know, the dining set, and this is the leather couch that, even to this day, we still use this leather couch, and it's, It's, I mean, everything's fine.  I mean, you've never had one ounce of mold or any problems with that?  None?  None.  None.  Well, that's good to hear because you get in a high humidity area, you've got to take care of them.  But I'm glad to see this.  I'm glad to see that everything smells so good.  And you've got little artificial plants in here, but the floors look good.  Everything looks fine, sounds fine, smells fine.  The air system's looking good.  Let me check the water filter right here.  Hey, you need to change your water filter.  Yeah, this right here?  Yeah.  You've got to change these every now and then, so I'm going to undo it.  Okay, so this is the grinder pump for an uphill flushing toilet.  You've had this for eight years.  Have you ever had any problem with the toilet?  None.  None?  So it works fine?  Yep.  Okay.  And this is the old stall bunker that had this kind of door that latches down.  And, of course, we changed it to the marine gray door.  But this was 3A Stills, the bulletproofs.  uh door but uh we've changed it and this is a shower.  he put linoleum in there.  did we do that or did you do that?  i didn't.  he did that.  i was gonna say that's pretty nice.  i like that shower works fine.  yep no problem hot water too.  so everything in the bunker is working fine.  It's like concrete.  It's hard as a rock.  But there's zero echo in a corrugated pipe shelter.  That's why they'll record in these things.  They'll get in the studios and they're made of corrugated pipe and they'll record in here.  So when you're laying in your bed, I'm going to lay in bed here.  Okay, so he's got a queen size bed here.  It's quite comfortable.  So laying in the bed.  This is what it feels like to be in the bunker.  In these corrugated pipe bunkers, because there's no echo, you can't hear the other people.  And with that air system running right there, which is really quiet, sounds like an air conditioner.  So I've proved the point that there's no echo.  I do like the fireplace.  Oh, I like these guys.  Oh, you know that this, there's doors on these rooms and there's a mirror in here.  So 55 gallon drums fit perfectly underneath the floor.  See, I got the floors lifted up.  All right, so yeah, we set them about an inch above the board so the floors will actually close.  And like I was telling you guys, this guy's got his bunker completely stuffed with stuff.  Okay, he's opening up the storage underneath.  How do you like all the storage in these bunkers?  There's a lot of storage.  There's a lot of storage.  And he's got all kinds of freeze-dried food.  Boy, you've got a bunch of... I love that cup of soup.  You just start eating that stuff.  That stuff's great.  All you've got to do is add water.  So everything you have, you've just got to add water to it, right?  Correct.  So you're not really cooking gourmet meals in these bunkers, guys.  You're just... You're just adding hot water and you've got a meal.  So anyway.  Guys, let me stop the video right here for just a minute to talk about the survival food that you are seeing stored in his kitchenette.  Those are number 10 coffee cans from Emergency Essentials.  If you ever want to get food and guarantee that it will last for at least 25 to 30 years, you want to go with number 10 cams from Emergency Essentials.  Now, they carry a couple brands.  Augustine Farms and Mountain House, both are great.  Matter of fact, This is a can from Mountain House right here.  It's rice and chicken canned in 1982.  Now I ate it when it was 32 years old and it tastes just like my mother's cooking.  So you rural preppers, when you're thinking about getting your survival food, start thinking about doing these number 10 cans and use emergency essentials.  I have tested everybody and I found that they are the best choice for getting either Mountain House or their Augustin Farms.  So keep that in mind.  um so that's the storage underneath the.  uh that's the storage underneath the uh.  yeah under the kitchenette the wood under these floors.  this is dried hemp.  this is not a yellow pine or anything like that.  so if somebody says well you're going to get mold on that wood this is living proof of an eight-year-old bunker that you haven't been here in how long?  Four months.  Four months, which is, you don't want to leave your bunker four months without checking on it because it's kind of like a sailboat.  You just want to make sure that it's all good and you check up on things.  um but we got the board out there.  but uh i'm just showing you what kind of shape the wood is in and underneath.  here he's got storage.  he's got extra microwaves refrigerators.  i mean he really prepped.  how cool is that?  well cool is that this guy's the real mccoy all right.  so this is the lock that goes to this bunker.  If you guys ever lose your keys, you're screwed because this is stainless steel.  You can't torch it.  And because it's locked from underneath, the only way to get into this bunker is to actually torch the lid off.  And that's going to cost you probably three, $4,000 to fix and replace.  So don't ever lose your keys.  So this is covering, this is covering the hatch.  I guess you're just going to flip it back over.  there you got it a real atlas shelter with a hidden hat.  that is so cool.  no one's gonna find that.  no one in million years would even think of looking there.  you know that i mean i never even noticed that i walked around here for five minutes.  So guys, I hope you enjoyed that video.  Like I told you, that was a real bunker that was installed eight years ago.  I disguised the guy's voice because I just don't want to give away who it is.  He was kind enough to let me take a tour of his bunker.  But what's even better, I talked him into letting us use his bunker for a 30-day challenge.  So if you and your family want to accept the challenge and spend 30 days in a bunker and see what it's really like to experience the end of the world as we know it, and win a year's worth of food and survival supplies from Emergency Essentials, make sure you sign up.  I can only select one family, and it will be very interesting.  So again, guys, I appreciate you watching my video.  See you on the next one. ",
