            "text": "You want to know something fucked up about the way YouTube works?  YouTube, it recommends videos based on profitability, basically, right?  And that means it needs to be advertiser-friendly.  Otherwise, they're not going to promote it.  They have no incentive to promote it because if they're not running ads on the video, what do they care if anybody sees it, right?  If your videos are getting demonetized, then there's a good chance nobody's going to see them.  Pretty much regardless of how many subscribers you have.  Because, you know, everybody complains about the notification system.  They don't send the videos to people.  You know, even if they're subscribed to you, everybody's complaining about that.  But there's a reason why back in December... I made like 17 videos, you know, in a single month.  And almost all of them had something to do with some kind of product, whether it was a movie, a video game, or some toy.  It's because the algorithm favors those types of videos.  I actually made a pretty decent amount of money off those videos.  They were really quick, low effort videos, but I still made a pretty decent amount of money.  And the reason for that is because they were centered around a product.  Now here's the thing, if you do like what Philip DeFranco does, where you cover a bunch of different news stories in one video, the algorithm, the advertising algorithm, doesn't know what kind of ads to run on that video because it doesn't know what the video is about.  And it can tell what the video is about.  If you notice, if you turn on the auto captions, Nowadays, it does a fairly good job of transcribing what people are saying, you know, like what the speaker in the video is saying.  So YouTube is aware of what you are making your video about.  You know, for the most part, they could tell like what you're saying and they could match like keywords to certain things.  So that, you know, the algorithm will look at a video.  It's like, oh, he's. ",
