            "text": "Hey everybody, John the editor here, obviously.  And before I get into this video, I'm going to give you a little caution as well as make a promise.  The caution is this is not going to be a happy video.  It's going to be a depressing video or make you angry.  But if you can make it all the way through this, and even if you want to just skip this, I promise the next video I upload will be cheerful, will make you laugh and smile.  I already know what I'm going to do it about.  It's a good topic.  You're going to like it.  This one, though, you might be a little mad by the end.  I'm going to talk about an item of popular mainstream rhetoric that we hear all the time.  This is, the future is female.  Now, like most political rhetoric that gets repeated over and over and over, we hear it so many times we stop thinking about what it means.  It becomes a noise.  It stops having an identifiable meaning to us.  And this, the future is female, has really taken a strong place in the mainstream.  It's so common now.  that the Star Wars franchise of movies, that thing that used to be the international juggernaut of all movies, which has gone so badly off the rails since they became social justice stupid, many of the producers of that series of movies wore t-shirts or had coffee mugs and stuff saying the Force is female.  That was even an unofficial part of the marketing.  which is just a variation of the future's female.  Now, the reason I point this out is that for most of my lifetime, the proponents of feminism have hammered the public with the claim that feminism was purely a movement seeking equality.  It was only about equality.  It was all about equality.  Equality was all that it was about.  And if you hadn't figured out that it was all about equality, you must be stupid because it's about equality.  And yet, now, suddenly, in the last few years, The future is female.  The future is female.  That seems like a reversal of the previous multi-decades long claim that feminism was all about equality.  when suddenly, no, the future is female.  That's the opposite of equality.  Some might even say supremacy.  And at the most surface level, at the most superficial level, you could say, well, feminism is clearly... Now that feminism has become more or less the state religion, they feel enough power and security in their claims that they can stop lying to the public and now proclaim their true purpose.  At the surface level, you could say that feminism was always a fraudulent... that is now powerful enough that they feel they don't have to deceive the public anymore.  But I think there's a deeper understanding that we can dig for.  And this is brought to my attention by a recent feminist propaganda campaign called Equality Can't Wait.  Now, this is something I talked about recently in a video of mine.  There's a group of celebrities and millionaires and billionaires and political figures, including Melinda Gates, the wife of Bill Gates, including Michelle Obama, including some actors from different TV shows, some comedians, Sarah Silverman, and so on, claiming that the equality that feminism is seeking is going to take 208 more years to accomplish, and no, we can't wait that long.  But then when you dig a little deeper, you realize that this campaign is organized and funded by the World Economic Forum.  And as soon as you say that, as soon as it's pointed out that the World Economic Forum is pushing this feminism, equality, can't wait campaign, you already sound like you're talking about squirrel brain conspiracies.  But if you go to the equality, can't wait website, and you click a couple of the links, one of the first links takes you to the World Economic Forum website, where the purpose of their project is explained in capital block lettering as Globalization 4.0.  We go in one single click from equality to Globalization 4.0, which reminds me of a famous or perhaps infamous interview given by a guy named Aaron Russo.  Aaron Russo is a film producer.  And in an interview in 2006, which I'll put a clip of in this video, Aaron Russo explains that when he was younger, he was friends with a member of the Rockefeller family, who explained to him that the Rockefellers funded early feminism to accomplish two goals.

            "text": "We were talking, and he started laughing.  He said, Aaron, what do you think women's liberation was about?  And he started to laugh.  He said, you're an idiot.  And I said, why am I an idiot?  He said, let me tell you what that was about.  We, the Rockefellers, funded that.  We funded women's lib.  And we're the ones who got all over the newspapers and television, the Rockefeller Foundation.  He says, and you want to know why?  He says, there were two primary reasons.  And one reason was we couldn't tax half the population before women's lived.  And the second reason was now we get the kids in school at an early age.  We can indoctrinate the kids how to think.  It breaks up the family.  The kids don't look at the state as the family. ",

            "text": "The first was to force women into the paid labor force, not to give them the opportunity to join the labor force, but to force them into the labor force so that all human activity could be taxed and controlled.  The second purpose, according to Rousseau, was to disrupt and break up the influence of the family, to smash the power of the individual and make everybody beholden to government power.  Well, now that the World Economic Forum is defining equality as globalism 4.0, it seems that that long-ago discredited interview by Aaron Russo has a lot more truth to it than any of us thought.  And so I would suggest that a deeper understanding than that surface deception level of the future is female.  would be that it's a catchier and more appealing paraphrasing of what Orwell said when he said, if you want a vision of the future, think of a boot stamping on a human face forever.  Thanks very much for watching, and as always, have a lovely day.  And my next video will be more cheerful than this.  I really promise. ",
