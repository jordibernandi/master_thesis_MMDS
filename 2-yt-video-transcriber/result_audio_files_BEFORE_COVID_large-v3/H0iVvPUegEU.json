            "text": "As you know, there were some very strange circumstances around Jeffrey Epstein's suicide.  I know it's come up a few times that Jeffrey Epstein, among all of the connections that he had with US politicians and celebrities and all of these huge figures, he also has ties to the British royal family and also Prince Andrew.  Has there been any movement on this case in the UK?  Is there any possibility that Prince Andrew is you know, may be prosecuted or that there may just be any sort of investigations into the British royal family? ",

            "text": "No, he can't be prosecuted here because our legal system is headed by his mother.  So you'll never get a criminal case of Elizabeth R. versus Andrew, who is, I think, our second son or third son.  Most people say our favorite son.  So He will never be prosecuted here.  He might be prosecuted in the United States, but he certainly should be in the United States answering the FBI's questions, if indeed the FBI have any questions.  My question about the FBI is why haven't they located Ghislaine Maxwell, who, it's abundantly clear, was effectively the pimp of Jeffrey Epstein.  If they're not looking for her, they're not going to be looking for Prince Andrew.  I have a particular interest in this case because I was the man in Parliament, under parliamentary privilege, who began the process, it was quite a short one, of bringing down her late father, Robert Maxwell, the Israel agent and British ambassador.  publisher who turned out to be the greatest British thief of the 20th century.  He stole hundreds of millions of pounds of his own employees pension money.  And I played a pretty significant role in in bringing him down.  His favourite child was Ghislaine Maxwell and indeed the yacht from which or on which, depending on your theory, he met his end, was called the Lady Ghislaine.  And because of his close relationship to intelligence, at the very least Israeli intelligence, but there may have been others, I've long suspected that the Ghislaine Maxwell-Jeffrey Epstein affair had its roots not in the unspeakable sexual depravity that they represent, but in the unspeakable depravity of the intelligence business.  It seems to me overwhelmingly likely that Maxwell and Epstein were luring people into this depravity in order to photograph and film and record them so as to exercise through blackmail that kind of power over them.  That seems to me at least the best working hypothesis.  And in a way, I'm surprised that not many more people in the United States are clamoring for that to be dealt with.  Of course, if that is the case, that would explain the lack of action on the part of the FBI and the justice authorities.  But Epstein and Maxwell were close friends of former presidents, of the United States, would be presidents of the United States, former and maybe would be prime ministers of Israel, as well as rich and powerful people from all over the world.  And it seems abundantly clear that when they entered the halls of Jeffrey Epstein, they were entering the gates, if not of hell, then than of the ante-rooms to hell. ",
