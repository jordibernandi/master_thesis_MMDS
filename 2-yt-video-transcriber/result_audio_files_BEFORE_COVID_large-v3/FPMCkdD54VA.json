Oh, shit!  Don't hit him!  Don't hit him!  Don't hit him!  Don't hit him!  Stop hitting her!  Stop hitting her!  Stop hitting her!  Stop hitting her!  Stop hitting her!  Stop hitting her!  Stop hitting her!  Stop hitting her!  He has the weapon right there!  He has the weapon right there!  Get him!  Get him!  He's using pepper spray!  Get him, get him, he's using pepper spray.  Oh man, I had to pour milk on my face because I got pepper sprayed right in the face.  The Trump supporters kept pushing the women and one of them was grabbing the tits of one of the girls in the protesting.  So I had to get right in there and as I got right in there and punched that guy right in the face, he sprayed me right in the face.  I got the full of it.  There's several dozen of us and a few fascist Trump supporters.  You can see them here with their flags.  We're pushing people and began pushing people at our nonviolent rally, right?  Because they can't stand that the people are rising up against this fascist regime.  They're here to provoke.  They claim we are blocking the walkway.  which is a patent lie.  There are plenty of places to walk by, as you can see.  So they were pushing, and then I had my arms locked around a woman who was with us, and some guy just pepper-sprayed me in the face.  I couldn't see shit.  The first thing I thought was, I can't see anything, so I'm vulnerable to getting clobbered, because they were starting to throw hands.  So immediately, I found my way to the water fountain, and somebody helped me out, got my glasses.  I'm feeling much better now.  We want people to come out every Saturday wherever you are.  Here in Los Angeles, it's going to be MacArthur Park, October 26th, 2 p.m Tell everybody you know this regime got to go.  I got it all on video.

Yeah, I'm going to take a look at that.  That's this video, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Is this good?  Can I be over here?  Hey, back up!  What did I say?  Back it up!  Hey, hey, it's not like that.  It's not like that.  Yeah, it is like that.  Use pepper straight up.  Hey, hey, take it.  Take it.  That guy doesn't listen too good.  Doesn't listen too good?  You little punk-ass instructions, man.  Okay.  I was with my brother and he got fucking attacked!  Hey, are you okay?  Hey, sir, are you okay?  Hey, get back.  Everybody get back.  Get back.  Everybody step back.  Oh, you did?  Are you alright?  Oh, no.  So, did you see anything?  Yes.  The whole thing?  The whole thing.  The whole thing, okay.  Can you just put that on pause? ",
