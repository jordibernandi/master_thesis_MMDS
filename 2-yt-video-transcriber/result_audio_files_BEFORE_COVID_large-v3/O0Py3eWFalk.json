            "text": "Praise the Lord, everybody.  So I just got out of school and I was taking some time to just look at some YouTube videos.  And, you know, I like to see what people are posting about me sometimes.  Just, you know, see what they're talking about.  A lot of people, you know, out there, they believe, oh, he's a false prophet.  And they start saying, no, I'm deceiving people.  Most of the time, you know, they take what I say out of context.  Obviously, there's the video about adultery and fornication.  They completely missed the part where I said fornication and adultery was a sin.  And I think a lot of times some of the stuff and I say this humbly, it's just too deep for them to get it.  So they hear what they want to hear.  A lot of times when people don't like you, They listen, you know, trying to catch something that they can use to justify why they feel the way they do about you.  Usually it's jealousy.  Usually I've said something that either convicted them or something that they didn't agree with.  And so what they do, you know, they try to attack the messenger and hopes to discredit the message, especially when they can't argue with what you're saying.  One of the things that we've talked about this a million times before is the Trinity thing.  You know, that's a little bit more understandable.  But why someone can say, oh, well, he's a false prophet because he doesn't believe like this.  But after doing my research and praying about it and I asked the Lord about it, it's not it's not a heaven or hell issue.  The heaven or hell issue, you must be born of the water and of the spirit, the Bible says in John 3, or you cannot enter the kingdom.  Nowhere will you find in the Bible where it says you're going to hell because you don't believe in the Trinity or oneness.  The problem is this people's pride and ego.  Everybody thinks that, you know, oh, they got it.  The Bible says great is the mystery of godliness, right?  Nobody fully understands and gets God.  So the issue that people have is, am I going to see three people in heaven?  Am I going to see one in heaven?  Is it three working as one, three in one?  Bottom line is you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit.  You have to be baptized or you cannot enter the kingdom.  Everything else you can debate about it.  You can argue about it.  I'm not.  I judge the fruit.  I test the spirit.  And one of the things that's the saddest thing to me is how.  Most of my attack doesn't even come from the world.  Now, I don't preach politically correct messages.  I preach about repentance.  I preach about hell.  You know, I preach about all of that stuff that a lot of preachers today aren't even talking about.  Right.  But it's the religious folks who still come for me.  And you know what?  I'm not surprised because they did it to Jesus.  I'm not surprised at all.  They did it to Jesus.  They did it to the apostles.  They didn't like them.  You know that they did.  If you actually read the New Testament, if you actually look at Jesus teaching, some of the stuff he was saying, man, was stepping on some people's toes.  You know, and the religious folks were really the ones coming for him.  It wasn't even, you know, just the Gentiles or the lost people.  It was people in the church.  So, you know, I kind of take it as an honor.  When that happens.  And then, of course, my relationships.  Yes, I've been divorced.  And the thing is, I'm not about to get on the Internet and talk bad about either one of my kids mothers, because quite frankly, it's none of your business.  You can test the fruit.  You can test the spirit.  You can see, you know, the hand of God in my life.  If you don't, it's pride, right?  You can see the fruit of my life.  You can see at the bare minimum, you can see that I love the Lord.  I'm pretty sure, you know what I'm saying?  You might, a lot of guys like to say, man, he has tremendous zeal, you know, but he's kind of off or whatever.  Everything that I post, everything that I preach, everything that I teach, unless I'm talking about basketball, I can back it up with the Bible.  You know how many people I've had like watch my stuff on the Internet and they came to places where I was preaching just to see and they came apologizing to me after the service because they said, man, I can feel that God is with you.  And I don't say this in arrogance.  I say because it's so sad that these people, they claim to be, you know, you know, spokespeople of God and things like that.  But they obviously don't have the spirit of God because their spirit should bear witness.  So anybody who's telling you the Lord, you know, told told them that I'm a false prophet.  Man, they need to repent because they're lying on God.  Anybody who told told them anybody who says the Holy Spirit showed them that I was a false prophet.  They're borderline blaspheming against the Holy Spirit because I know that's just.  it's not true.  I know what I have with the Lord.  You know, I see God's hand on my life all the way back to 12 years old.  You know, when I was going to commit suicide, the way that God has positioned me, everything that I went through getting out of the army.  It's like everything that he told me, everything that was prophesied to my life.  It happens.  It happens exactly like how he said it was going to happen.  You know, and so it's just like it.  just that's why, you know, people think that I'm arrogant.  No, I'm confident after everything that I've been through.  I know the Lord is with me.  I know that he's with me.  Nobody, nobody can make me feel like God is not with me or that God doesn't speak to me.  Everything that he showed me since before even President Trump became president, I don't call myself a prophet, but that I prophesied, it came true.  Every single thing.  Nobody can say, oh, Marcus prophesied something that wasn't true.  Whether you like it or not, what I prophesied, it came to pass.  The record is there.  But what I've learned about people is they will ignore all of that.  They will ignore the fact that I preach messages that are not politically correct.  They will ignore the fact that I preach messages.  If you ever come here, me preach is full, full of scripture, full of the word of God.  They will ignore the fact that people are being blessed.  People are being encouraged.  People are being saved.  People are being overcoming addiction, overcoming drugs.  You know, they ignore all of that stuff just because of their pride, because, you know, I don't like him.  And then, you know, I don't even like talking about this because, you know, then it sounds kind of arrogant.  But the other thing people talk about is how I look.  They just assume, oh, he's a young guy.  If I look like if I was some old chubby man, you know, then nobody would have a problem.  But because they feel I look a certain way.  Oh, he must be cheating.  Oh, he must be sleeping around.  Oh, you know, he must have got a divorce from from his wives because he was out there doing whatever.  Just assuming, assuming, assuming.  And what I always tell people, pray about it.  Everything I preach, everything I say, everything about me, go pray to God about it.  Would a false prophet tell you that?  I know that God will show you if you really pray, if you really humble yourself, if you really go to God with an open heart.  And so and then as far as the religious folks, right, who judge me all the time.  One thing the Lord told me a long time ago, he said, what I'm going to do in your life is going to make a lot of religious folks scratch their head.  That's exactly what God told me.  Because the problem with religious folks is they feel that God owes it to them to use them.  They feel like, oh, I'm so good.  I'm so holy.  I should be the one with Marcus Rises platform.  And what they thought and realized, it's all about the heart.  God, look at everybody in the Bible.  God used.  They were jacked up.  Look at David.  It's lusting after Bathsheba killed her husband, Abraham, two baby mamas.  Jonah was borderline racist and prejudiced.  You see what I'm saying?  But for whatever reason in the modern world, oh, I'm just, I'm so holy.  And so what the truth is, they get jealous.  That's why these people make little videos, right?  Because, oh, let me use Marcus Rogers name to get some views.  Right.  Let me.  it's really it's really just arrogance.  And that's what people fail to see.  If you ever met me in real life, you would see, man, I'm probably one of the most humble guys that you'll ever meet in your life.  Just because I preach with confidence and authority, it doesn't mean that I'm arrogant.  All right.  I have no reason to be arrogant.  I made a lot of mistakes in my life.  Yes, I fornicated.  Yes, I've committed adultery.  Yes, I've made terrible decisions.  I can blame some things.  I'm not having a father.  You know, others is just my own stupidity.  But the grace of God has covered me and I've accepted his grace.  I've accepted his love.  And and I started running after God like never before.  You know, I'm not.  I don't even really want to rush this video because I really want you to pray about it.  Well, and I asked the Lord, you know, is it OK for me to do this video?  You know, I just want it out there for the record.  So a lot of people, they look up things, for example, my GoFundMe.  I opened a GoFundMe years ago.  Right.  And people just don't know.  Every time I see them talking about it, they don't know what they're talking about.  So I'll talk about it.  Right.  There's this soldier.  He was Muslim.  He wanted to get baptized.  I baptized him afterwards.  Nothing to do with the baptism.  We went swimming with some other people.  He drowned.  I almost drowned.  And so, you know, it was a big old problem.  After that, and I will admit, like I said, the timing was bad.  I was talking to a pastor, a friend of mine.  He said, you know, maybe you should open a GoFundMe.  People will donate to your ministry.  at about, let me see, I had about 400,000 followers at the time.  So this is what I innocently thought.  I thought to myself, man, if I could just get every single person to donate one dollar, that'd be four hundred thousand dollars.  And everything that God showed me would happen could happen because everything takes money.  Right.  So then I can do this.  I can do this and then I can take care of my family.  I can do all these different things.  And so my heart was right about it.  And at the time, I didn't really see how people could take it wrong.  But I learned my lesson.  You know, they definitely took it wrong.  People saying he opened it for Ali.  That wasn't even true.  I went to the military about it.  And I said, hey, you know, maybe we can... Do a GoFundMe like after the fact.  And they were like, oh, no, you can't do one.  Everything has to go through the military.  And see, it's like stuff like that.  People just don't know what they were talking about.  It's because they don't like you.  They just want to believe whatever negative thing they hear about you.  And it's just just sad, man.  And but then what do you expect when these people don't really have the Holy Spirit?  Because if they had the Holy Spirit, then God would show them, you know, like if they were humble enough to see it.  So that's just one of those examples.  The whole thing with Ali.  Like I said, yes, I've been divorced.  And all I would say, all I would say about that matter is that I'm biblically OK.  Like all those people, if you really read the verses that people try to use to put this cross on people who get divorced, there's a verse in there where it talks about you're free and you're not under bondage anymore, right?  Everybody knows about the, uh, the adultery and things like that.  And I'm telling you, I'm biblically fine.  I know what the Bible says.  I'm not living in sin.  I'm not living in error.  And some of you are just misinterpreting, uh, you know, what you're reading, but Even so, you know, the fruit will speak for itself.  That's all.  The Bible says a tree is known by the fruit of berries.  And I think that's where I want to end the video, man.  I think it's so sad that you see someone who just loves the Lord.  Like really loves the Lord, willing to die for this thing.  And you're building something.  And it's not even the world that's trying to tear it down.  It's religious Christians, jealous Christians, Christians who don't have this sermon.  I guess you're not really a Christian if you don't have the Holy Spirit.  You know, well, I know you're not.  You know what I'm saying?  You may be in the process because I mean, I don't like saying such general statements because there are people who are trying to come to the Lord with the right heart and they're praying to receive the Holy Spirit and things like that.  And, you know, then they get it.  But you know what I'm saying?  God knows people's hearts, man.  I don't think there's anything else really.  There's a video I did about fornication and adultery and people.  just, you know, all I'm going to say is they just took a little part and made it mean what they want to mean.  Fornication and adultery.  It's a sin.  All right.  You got to repent.  Let me try to think if there's anything else.  We talked about the Trinity thing.  Fornication, adultery, video divorces.  My divorce is I'm not going to get on here and, you know, bad mouth my children's mother.  God knows he's the judge at the end of the day.  And obviously he's still with me keeping his promises.  And that's about it.  I just tell you, go pray about it and pray for me.  Pray for me.  Love you guys.  Be encouraged.  Be blessed in Jesus name. ",
