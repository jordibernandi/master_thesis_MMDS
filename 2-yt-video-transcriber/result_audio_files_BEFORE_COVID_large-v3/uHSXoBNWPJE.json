And to leave there and go to high school, it was the unknown for us.  We were extremely anxious to the point where we were feeling physically sick with fear.  But actually, she goes to school every morning with a beaming smile and comes home with a beaming smile and everything's been positive.  We just hope that, you know, the next few years are going to be crucial really because it's at the age where They start having crushes on one another and relationships and all those sorts of things.  So it won't be easy, but I think we just take one day at a time and just be there for pop. ",

You can't allow a child not to be themselves.  It's just not fair.  Why should she dress as a boy?  Why should she feel shame about who she is?  She feels a girl and she is a girl.  Thank you. ",
