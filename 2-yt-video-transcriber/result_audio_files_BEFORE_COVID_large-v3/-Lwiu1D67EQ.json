I do property development, so I build.  I've got my sports academy here.  I'm the president of WPU Africa, which is the World Boxing Union.  I started the All African Boxing Board of Control, so now there's a legal entity for African boxers to have professional boxing license to fight all over the world.  And amongst other things.
