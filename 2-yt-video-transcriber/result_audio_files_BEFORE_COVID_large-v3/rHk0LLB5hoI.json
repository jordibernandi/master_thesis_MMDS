And so that hearing, and by the time I spoke, and being one of the more junior ones on the committee, I was one of the last, I was so upset by the whole process that when I first spoke, I was like, you are not on trial.  I so admire her courage, because I'll tell you, there's something about what she did, and it was that great personal sacrifice that inspired so many people, women and men, because this is an issue that impacts men also, to come forward and tell their stories and have the courage to do it.  Here's the thing.  Here's the beauty of it.  You watching that.  and then being inspired by whatever made you upset about it, but also made you feel a sense of connection to it, and then you took that into a role of leadership.  When I see her next, I will tell her about Avery, right?  You inspire so many people who you may not even realize are being inspired.  That's what Dr.  Ford did for you, and that's what you're doing for so many people.  Okay, let's put these in the oven, come on.  And then we'll just time it.  Okay.
