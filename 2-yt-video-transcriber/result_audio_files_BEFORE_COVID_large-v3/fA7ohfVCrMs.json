Welcome back, Reluctant Preppers.  We have a first-time visitor today to talk about a topic we've never addressed before.  Although we've had many other CEOs and executives in mining, usually it's been in the gold and silver and other precious metal sectors, but also some other strategic materials.  This time we're going to be speaking with Nico Kakos, the CEO of Blue Sky Uranium Corp.  And we're going to talk about what the future lies ahead for the uranium mining industry and a picture of global demand, safety issues, and also opportunities and risks to that sector, but also what makes Blue Sky unique.  So, Nico, thank you for joining us this first time here on Reluctant Preppers. ",

We've been hearing a lot over the past decade, especially about the green economy and solar and thermal and other renewable energy sources.  And a lot of government subsidies have been flowing in that direction.  And in the same time, there's been concern about whether the future continues to remain strong for the nuclear power industry.  So could you bring us up to speed on what the latest trends are in that?  I guess I'll throw in one more thing as an article recently from Kitco talked about different jurisdictions around the world having very different outlooks for expansion or a lack thereof in the uranium demand picture.  and specifically pointing, I guess, to China and India as potential large sources of demand going forward.  So what do you see ahead for potential demand in the uranium industry? ",

            "text": "Well, these are all very good subjects, and the uranium industry has been in the last almost decade in a bear market right now, actually since Fukushima, the typhoon disaster there, the earthquake that happened.  You know, what's interesting to note with that disaster, touching a little bit on safety, that There was not a single person that was killed because of a nuclear fallout.  It was the earthquake that caused the damage, and it was the typhoon and the tidal wave that caused the damage.  But moving forward from that, we've seen the price of uranium in the last year make a nice 50% move.  That's not an insignificant move.  There's an outlook here over the next few years.  We're seeing a lot of new nuclear reactors going up around the world.  The key drivers, of course, are China and India.  But you're also seeing a lot of non-traditional places where nuclear reactors are being built.  There's proposals to have them built in Saudi Arabia.  United Arab Emirates, for example, a land that's full of oil, has got new nuclear reactors.  And a lot of the emerging markets around the world are building them.  And the reasons for that is that I think \u2013 the the nuclear reactors themselves are more cost effective now.  they're cheaper to build.  their safety record is is improved.  the.  the time frames for building these are a lot less.  there's not as and they're not.  there's not just simply not that huge amount of billions of dollars that used to be going into construction for them and nuclear fuel you know uranium as a fuel is uh you know through nuclear reactors is a very efficient form way of producing and generating uh secure and safe electricity as opposed to you you mentioned in your in your intro there um you know other green um sort of renewables like solar sure and and wind.  If it wasn't for the subsidies that go into those renewables, I don't think that they would be economic at this stage.  Who knows?  Maybe in the future there will be an economic source, but those do have, they're not economic today, they're not as efficient, and they do have a negative impact on the environment.  You look at the, I don't know, I've driven through you know, Nevada and Arizona, you see these fields and fields of windmills or solar panels, you know, they, you know, to produce a certain unit of energy, they have to occupy a huge land mass so that that has a big footprint, whereas nuclear fuel is probably arguably the most green, it's the most carbon neutral, has the smallest carbon footprint of all of them out there.  And an interesting tidbit I came across not that long ago was that the average human being needs the amount of energy that they need to carry them through the entire lifetime.  And when you measure it in nuclear fuel, it's half a barrel of oil filled with uranium.  That's all the energy you need for your life.  So it's a neat way to visualize how efficient uranium is and I think we're seeing that being recognized around the world and that's where there's demand now for uranium and that we're seeing that increase.

And even where we're active, we're active in Argentina in our company, a country that's got three nuclear reactors up and running right now and has commissioned and they're building more and they are very much.  you know they import all the uranium from I think Kazakhstan and from Canada but they have a strong desire to have a domestic supplier of uranium.  so in uranium while it's abundant, it's not that abundant, it's abundant enough to be in key locations so that it can provide that security for energy supply.

And vanadium is another hot metal today.  We've seen the price of uranium, vanadium, move from $3, $4 a pound a couple of years ago.  It touched $30 a pound.  It's now settled around $15 to $17 a pound.  It's a metal that is very much in demand, just like lithium is.  It's like a battery metal.  But I think the key driver behind that is the increased use of vanadium as a steel hardener to make steel even tougher.  And China has mandated an increased content of vanadium in their steel production to make a stronger, more robust steel.  And because of that, I feel that the price of vanadium is up to stay in these elevated prices for the longer term. ",

We own the entire land package.  And we just announced our first deposit in that area and our economic analysis.
