            "text": "shalom israel it's your boy new breed that's to the world over coming through with another video.  in this particular video i wanted to talk about the whole papa's chicken craze.  actually a few people asked me my opinion on.  you know why is the whole world going crazy over a sandwich?  my opinion is this utter madness but we're going to talk about it a little bit.  Ladies and gentlemen, when you walk in a narrow path, right, you understand that when a mass amount of people are doing one thing or going one direction, that you should go the opposite direction.  It don't matter what it is.  Even minute things like a damn chicken sandwich.  And you know, the thing about it, ladies and gentlemen, is you gotta use wisdom.  You gotta use knowledge, right?  Why is it that people are going crazy over a sandwich?  Why is it?  is the whole world talking about a chicken sandwich?  Ladies and gentlemen, the media understands that the more they promote, the more they advertise, the more people are going to want it.  Any advertising is good advertisement.  I got on WorldStarHipHop and I seen people acting like lunatics.  I'm talking about jumping through the damn drive-thru window about a sandwich.  Fighting Popeye's employees over a sandwich.  I mean video after video after video.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  And then it made me start thinking.  I started thinking a little bit deeper about the whole situation.  Why is the advertisements and the promotion of this sandwich so popular right now?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, they want people in the urban community and everyone else, but mostly, mostly the urban community.  because let's face it, ladies and gentlemen, in the urban community, Popeye's is cheap chicken, it's cheap food.  In the urban community, people love Popeye's chicken.  They always have.  And they're trying to promote this sandwich to the point where they want everybody to have it.  Now I heard that they sold out of it.  That could be an advertising ploy in itself.  So when it comes back, everybody runs and gets it.  The people who didn't wait in lines wrapped around a damn Popeye's to get the sandwich.  Now they can come back and get it.  That's a trick in itself.  So the question is, why is the whole world promoting this sandwich?  Why is advertisement spending billions of dollars in promotion?  Why are people going crazy over the sandwich?  Well, let's think about it.  Let's talk about it.  Because the people may be getting poisoned, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's just put it out there.  Allegedly.  Gotta cover my grounds.  But let's look at it.  Promoting it to the urban community.  Spending millions of dollars on advertisement.  The people are going absolutely nuts.  who ate the sandwich.  They're going nuts.  They're going back for seconds and thirds.  Jumping through the damn drive-thru window over a sandwich.  What is in this sandwich?  It used to be a time where ingredients were listed on menus.  Ingredients were listed on the packaging.  Oh no, not no more.  Because the people aren't interested in the ingredients.  Y'all think that you eating chicken.  Just because they say it's chicken, don't mean it's chicken.  It really reminds me of the movie Soylent Green.  For those who never seen that movie, look it up.  I'm not gonna get into details because I don't wanna be a spoiler.  And it's a quite old movie though.  But it's interesting.  That movie's very interesting and I can actually relate what's happening to that movie.  Is it mass poisoning going on in the urban community through a chicken sandwich?  What's next, ladies and gentlemen?  Watermelon milkshakes?  Watermelon milkshakes is the next step.  It's absolutely insane.  So when people are going one direction, when a broad mass amount of people are infatuated with one item, whether it be a food product, whatever it may be, Those narrow paths, those very few, those select few need to go the other direction.  And listen, I'm no health nut.  I'm no vegetarian.  I'm no vegan.  But I'd be damned if I go get that sandwich.  It's just something ain't right.  You gotta use wisdom now.  You have got to use wisdom.  Now... Never before have I seen anything like this.  So I said, you know, I looked at it as strange initially.  But now that I went through these videos and seen how people are reacting, man, this sandwich is causing a chemical imbalance, man.  But all in all, the message is to stay on the broad path, to stay on the narrow path, stay away from the broad path.  Because listen, they hitting us at all angles.  Remember in the Bible, and I'm paraphrasing, but the scriptures say, if the Most High didn't cut these days short, no flesh would even survive.  Meaning if the Messiah don't come back, if the Most High don't end this, if he don't intervene with what's taking place in this world, nobody's going to survive.  You got people doing experimentations on the people through the food.  You got the Brazilian rainforest burning, taking 20% of the oxygen.  You got the water with all sorts of chemicals.  You got the food with all sorts of preservatives.  You got the vegetation, the crops grown with Monsanto seeds.  If the most high don't cut these days short, no flesh will survive this.  So you cannot put your trust in anything that's being advertised and promoted on a mainstream level because, ladies and gentlemen, anything advertised, promoted on a mainstream level has an agenda.  So your question is, your question should be, what's the agenda?  So that's my thing, ladies and gentlemen.  With that being said, just had to come through and share my opinions on this.  About to hit the road.  I'd like to thank y'all for watching.  With that being said, shalom and peace. ",
