And I encourage you to check out all the sources that we list here for yourself.  And when I'm offering my opinion, I will issue a disclaimer.  Okay?  And I should say that at the time of this taping, there's emerging evidence that this was really a simple error from the Geek Squad employee who installed the video cameras.  And that was the only one.  That's the only one.  Everything else is 100% factual, I promise.  So let's go down this fact.  Okay, Jeffrey Epstein, billionaire who ran a child prostitution ring, connected to some of the most powerful people in the world, and he had an actual pedophile island.  Wow.  An island.  Yep.  Complete with pagan-looking temples full of mattresses.  I think we have B-roll of it here.  Oh, my gosh.  Caution here.  Disclaimer.  My opinion on its surface, that sounds pretty bad.  All right.  So the fifth fact I think everyone needs to know.  Epstein almost got away with it.  Think about this for a second.  For running a child prostitution ring and raping underage girls, he was sentenced to 18 months.  He didn't even serve that.  In a private wing of the Palm Beach County Stockade.  He was allowed to leave the jail on work release for up to 12 hours a day, six days a week.  The Florida attorney general, Alexander Costa, he was the one who cut the deal, and he said that it was because he had been told to back off, that Epstein was above his pay grade.  I think the exact quote is, I was told Epstein belonged to intelligence and to leave it alone.  The sheriff's office, they actually received $128,000 from Epstein's nonprofit to pay for extra services during his work release.  He was monitored by permit deputies, whose overtime, by the way, was paid by Epstein.  His cell door was left unlocked.  He also accepted male, female visitors in a separate office with the door closed.  Prison staff did not supervise. ",

He traded his older wife for a slightly younger model.  He traded in a 55-year-old wife for, I think, like a 35 or 37-year-old.  It's crappy but not perverse.  Clinton cheated on his wife with a 22-year-old intern, and it is well known that Bill Clinton really had a preference for incredibly young women. ",
