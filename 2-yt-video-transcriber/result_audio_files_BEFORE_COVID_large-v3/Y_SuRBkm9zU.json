            "text": "Hello everyone, my name is Jennifer Molesky and I hate modern feminism.  Jennifer, why do you hate modern feminism?  Do you think women should be raped?  I've gotten that before.  Not the cleverest of conclusions to draw from me not being a feminist.  Here's why.  I'm going to give you a few reasons why I hate feminism.  And I'm going to miss some.  I have like 20.  I'm only going to go through a few.  But if I miss some that you think, Naughty Jennifer, you should have said that, then please leave a comment in the comment section below.  All right, so why do I hate feminism?  Let's begin.  I hate that.  women claim that they want equality.  They want to be treated equal to men.  My big question, you know, there's sound effects on my computer.  I just don't know how to use them.  Okay.  My question that I ask women is which man, which man do you want to be compared to?  Which man do you want to be equal to?  Because it's probably not the short, fat, meek, quiet, unsure of himself guy is probably the guy that has more, not the guy that has less.  And that's what happens when you talk about equality.  You can't.  You cannot talk about equality with all the different types of people in the world, with all the different types of men, with all the different types of women.  Women that are watching this, if you and I are in a room, we're not going to be equal.  You're going to kick my ass in some things, and I'm going to kick your ass in some things.  It can't be equal.  And people are going to treat us differently, and that's okay.  We have as much equality as we're going to get because we have opportunity.  So if you want to be treated with respect, treat people with respect.  You want people to laugh, be funny.  You want people to think you're pretty, look pretty.  You want people to think you're tough, act tough.  If you want a better paying job, you ask for more money.  You get good at it and you ask for more money.  Or here's a better idea.  Actually, here's the best idea.  Look at the dumb shit women are choosing on average for their degrees.  They're not the money makers.  All right, women, you clever, clever ladies.  Just start choosing career fields that will make you more money.  All right.  We have every opportunity that a man has, but still, it's not enough.  Women want more.  Feminists are hypocrites and they're delusional.  They think they have it bad, compared to men especially, but they don't.  Here's an assignment.  When you leave the house, just listen to women that are your friends, your mom.  Your mom's fine.  I'm just saying, women, if you go out and listen to women, they say some atrocious shit about men.  And they laugh.  It's so funny.  It's so funny to bash men.  But if it were reversed, equality, remember, that's all they want.  If it were to be reversed and men were to say some of these things about women, holy shit, would there be a problem?  Whining, crying, complaining.  Oh, God, it's so subjugated.  But it's not.  It's not how it is.  Women are such hypocrites.  God, do you not see it?  It's not fair.  It's not equal.  It's not cool.  It's not even cool.  Like, I love men.  Guys, I love you.  I really like men.  I think you're funny and you're nice and you're chivalrous and you open doors and you smile.  And some of you are boring, you know, like in grocery store lines and whatnot, but it doesn't mean you're dicks and doesn't mean you have it better.  Okay, feminists are liars.  They lie to other women.  So here's one.  They say, we want more women in power.  Are you sure?  Or do you want all of your ideas and everything that you stand for and everything that you can get on board with in a mind that's packaged up in a body with tits and a vagina?  That's what you want.  Okay, here's another example.  I am conservative.  I don't think that abortion should be accessible.  or very easy.  I know that there's two genders.  There's a two.  There's two.  And if I think I'm a guy, if I cut my boobs off, I'm not a guy.  So all these things that I think, I would imagine.  And this is just... Okay, I would imagine that if I was running for Congress, I don't think a lot of women would, a lot of modern feminists would be on my side.  They wouldn't be like, oh, Jennifer, she's so great.  She's a woman.  Go Jennifer.  No.  No, because I don't think like them.  So no, yeah, it's not about being a woman.  It's about being a certain type of woman, which is fine.  That makes more sense to me that you would want someone that has a mind that's representative of yours.  Don't just go around telling fellow women that you love them and respect them.  Because they're a woman.  Because if they're a Trump supporter, they're probably not going to get that kind of love.  Or if they just think differently.  So don't lie.  Okay.  Now, I am many things, but I'm a free speech absolutist.  And the reason why I... I don't like the whole feminist movement being like, women in power, because women are less likely to be free speech absolutists.  And to me, that's a big problem. ",

            "text": "So here is free speech absolutism by race and gender.  So here, if you're white and you're male, 56%.  are free speech absolutists.  56 of white males are free speech absolutists.  only 47 of white women are free speech absolutists.  and again that is the difference between sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing when it comes to legislation.

            "text": "i don't care what is said but i want it heard.  i if i have an idea i think that we should have people in power that will at least go all right.  molesky.  What's your idea?  Instead of these sensitive... It hurts.  You shouldn't say that.  Silence that woman.  I don't think that that's a really good thing to have in Congress.  or in leadership.  So that's why, that's another reason I don't like the moderate.  Now, to be fair about individuals, heck yeah, there are women out there who are free speech absolutists, and I would vote for that woman.  But just to be like, like the people that would vote for Hillary just because she's a woman, that's so gross.  Think.  Just think.  Just for like 30 minutes, do some research.  Knowing things is super fun.  Another reason I hate feminists is because they're liars.  Again.  They say they have the backs of women.  And I think that's true for some.  But a lot of modern feminists, if given the choice of backing up and defending a natural-born woman and her rights and her... And a natural born man who thinks he's a woman, a lot of modern feminists will back up the dude.  Look at this guy beating the shit out of this woman.  What kind of a dude?  In what world would that be acceptable?  In what world would a feminist... In what world would a rational feminist say, yeah, that's okay because inclusivity... God, this woman is getting her ass handed to her.  Look at that blood.  It makes me like, I don't get sad often, but this makes me sad.  Look at that.  Women also hate, I'm sorry, feminists.  Sorry.  Modern feminists, a lot of modern feminists hate the objectification of women, yet they sponsor and create slut walks.  This is all about empowering women, and I've come the last couple of years just to support Amber, support the cause, and nobody should be slushed.  No matter what you wear, what you do.  where women have on practically no clothes as a very look at me gesture and then scream, don't look at me.  Put on some fucking clothes.  If you don't want to be objectified, then watch what you're wearing.  There's something called reverse stereotyping.  And it goes like this.  You decide what you want people to think of you.  when you do your hair, your nails, and you wear your clothing.  And that doesn't always match up.  Like, you might want to look wealthy, right?  So you buy an Armani suit or an Armani dress, and you have the labels, and you're well manicured.  But someone still might think you're a pleb.  Okay, you can't really control that.  But you do the best that you can do to be perceived in the way that you want to be perceived.  That's what people do.  It's almost innate in us.  And I've always said that the closest that we can get to art within ourselves is how we present ourselves to the world.  We can go being just a blank canvas and hardly noticed.  We can be loud.  But we have to understand that we're responsible for the artwork that we create and what people think of it.  So that's what I think about objectification.  If you don't want to be objectified yet, that's fine.  But men aren't just going around objectifying every woman.  They're going and objectifying women who are looking to be objectified.  Are you slut shaming?  Yes, I am.  If you're going to be a slut, fine.  But do not scold people for thinking you're a slut.  That's it.  Like I said, I have about 20 reasons that I wrote out, but those are just some of the main ones.  If you have any that really irk you, I would love if you left them in the comments so we could talk about it.  Yay!  I would love if you subscribe.  Tell a friend, hey, there's a girl and she's not a feminist.  Subscribe.  Or don't tell anybody.  You can keep me a secret.  I would prefer you not.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you so much and have a good day. ",
