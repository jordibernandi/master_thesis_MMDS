Normally, you wait for somebody to make a claim, like you're hanging out with your friends, and then somebody says that they think vaccines cause autism, karma's real, or they wanna see if you wanna pray with them or something.  They make a claim, and then sometimes we get in an argument with them about it, or we try to show that they're mistaken on it.  With street epistemology, it's a way of using questions to explore something that you think is true.  And I'm hoping that maybe you can pick a claim.

It could even be something that maybe you're wondering about, you're questioning, maybe even doubting.  Oh, I have to come up with one?  Ideally, it's something that you think is true or you're wondering about and you behave differently because you think it's true.  Like wearing a jersey because you think it's going to help your favorite team.  I think it's true.  We can even talk about social issues or politics.  I like your honesty.  Crap.  We could also do a little thought experiment to pass the time.  You want to do that?  Give me ideas.  Sometimes during the thought experiment, people think of the topic that they want to explore.  You want to do the thought experiment?  Sure.  Okay.  This could be useful even if we skip this part and we were examining your claim.  We could still do this later.  My question to you is that if you were to hold this container... Would you agree that the total number of pieces within must either be even or odd, and it can't simultaneously be both?  You agree?  Okay.  So if I guess even, and you guess odd, and we counted them up and we came up with an odd number like 33, you would agree that I would be wrong, I would be mistaken, you would be right, you would be correct?  Okay.  That's it?  That's it?  Yeah, that was a thought experiment.  Well, there's a little bit of a twist to it.  Hey, what's up?  Let's say this guy, here's a twist.
