So what we're dealing with here, sir, is absolutely, you guys are not doing anything wrong.  You guys are videotaping here, sending from a public location, filming what's in public view.  Absolutely, there's nothing wrong with that.  The issue that we seem to run into every now and then is that a lot of people don't understand that.  I mean, I'm going to keep the rule with you guys.  Somebody has a camera and they're filming someone that maybe doesn't feel comfortable being filmed.  What they don't understand is that, yeah, you're not doing anything wrong, but it makes them feel uncomfortable.  And then you take being uncomfortable up to maybe even feeling threatened.  So they're going to try to create some space between themselves and the camera.  Now, I understand that, and I believe that this individual put her hands on the camera, pushing it away, making contact with, was it your face, sir?  So... The intention wasn't to assault anyone.  It was to just create a little distance between them and the camera.  So we're here to help you guys.  We're here to do whatever it is you would like done.  Of course, to a certain extent, because now we've got to do what's illegal here.  So, yes, absolutely.  We can document your statement, exactly what happened.  We document the business statement, exactly what happened from their perspective, and it's on record.  So we have two ways to document this.  We have what we call is a brief summary, just explaining to us what happened and them as well.  And then you also have a crime report.  which would be documented, basically the same information that would go in that brief summary attached to an incident number.  But then if you want the crime report, it would go in an actual crime report, which would get assigned to a detective.  They would read it, basically exactly what I just told you, how they felt, you know, being uncomfortable with the camera in their face, not fully understanding that there was nothing illegal about it.  And then we let the judge decide. ",

Number one.  Number two, I've already created space by not entering their property.  They've created less space by walking up to me and putting hands on me.  Okay, so I want to make sure that this gets documented properly.  And if you're not going to do a citizen's report today, I want to make sure to do a crime report so that an investigator can get involved.  Because if you're not going to go that extra mile to do a citizen's arrest, which I asked for originally, then I need to make sure that somebody follows through. ",
