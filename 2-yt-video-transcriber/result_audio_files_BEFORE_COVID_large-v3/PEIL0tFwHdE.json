            "text": "Many conservatives saw the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump's 2016 victory as useful correctives.  It was time to push back, the argument went, against the overreach of unaccountable international bureaucracies such as the European Union and the UN.  Maybe even NATO has become obsolete.  But can we really go back to an age of sovereign nation states?  Not really.  For example, 10 million US flags are imported into the United States from China every year, and a tightly integrated global economy needs shared rules.  Although reforms of many international organizations are needed, Western democracies cannot disengage if they are to keep the world's authoritarians at bay.  Also, the age of sovereign nation states is mostly a myth.  Throughout its history, Europe was marked by efforts to reconcile diversity and unity through federalist projects such as the Holy Roman Empire or the Hanseatic League.  Those long predate the creation of the modern nation-state in the late 19th century.  Globalism is thus not a historic aberration.  Nationalism is.
