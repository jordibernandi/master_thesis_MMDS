            "text": "What's the difference between an atheist and an evangelical?  An atheist is honest about not following Jesus.  Fellas, I gotta tell ya, I'm getting tired of those jokes, and that's why I've called you here today.  America is gossiping about our relationship with Jesus.  They've already guessed that we're on a break.  How long before they find out we're not even on speaking terms?  Yes, Franklin, you talk about him.  Don't you ever.  And yes, Jerry, you talk to him.  When you need real estate or a pool boy, but none of us listen to him.  Frankly, I don't like to be interrupted when I'm talking for him.  But the whole relationship has gotten inconvenient.  The libs keep throwing his words about those pesky poor people back in our faces, and using the Bible to make people feel bad about themselves is our job.  Besides, it's tough to pull off white supremacy with such a suspiciously swarthy Savior.  Am I right?  Evangelicals shall breaketh up with Jesus, everyone.  In favor?  Yes!  Unanimous.  Okay, don't worry.  Let me handle him.  Jesus!  Oh, there you are.  I almost didn't recognize you.  Yes, it's been a while.  Just sit there next to Mike.  Huckabee.  Well, I'm glad you two are finally meeting.  Now, how do I start?  Jesus, it's not you.  It's us.  Because of you, and by us.  I mean your conservative American followers.  I see you're smirking at followers, Jesus.  Well, can you blame us?  We've just drifted apart.  Your hobby is preaching about healing and helping.  Ours is about homosexuality and abortion.  You're right, and you never even mentioned either topic.  Such an appalling oversight.  I mean, what kind of Christian are you?  Which is why we've started seeing someone else.  He says what we think.  You say what we mock.  Give everything to the poor.  Socialism is godless.  Thank you, Franklin.  Jesus, your whole bio is totally off message.  We hate refugees.  You were one.  Our new improved Christianity 2.0.  It's been in beta for centuries.  It's about getting, not giving.  Check out our clever slogan.  I'm so blessed.  which is just a polite way of telling hungry humans our diets are voluntary because our God plays favorites.  We've also corrected all your other careless suggestions too.  You're welcome.  For example, do unto others before they do unto.  you see more on brand and with all our judging divorcing retaliating praying in public and greet it just got super awkward to pretend we care about your social justice warrior claptrap in the gospels.  okay so we're going to have to make an official announcement.  why?  because nobody will notice a change by how we act.  We'll do one of those.  It was mutual.  We're still friends, fake news press releases.  You can keep the Middle East.  And as usual, we keep all the money we collected for you.  But when it comes to evangelicals and Christ, no collusion.  It was great fun.  But it was just one of those things. ",
