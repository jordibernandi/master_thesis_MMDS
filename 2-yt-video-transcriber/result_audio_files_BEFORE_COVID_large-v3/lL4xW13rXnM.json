            "text": "Here's a weird medical fact about bone marrow transplants and how they uniquely affect the black community.  Bone marrow is where leukocytes, white blood cells, are made.  So when you replace a person's bone marrow, you're essentially replacing their whole immune system.  For this reason, the donor marrow must be as genetically similar to the recipient as possible to prevent the new immune system from attacking the host body.  Since bone marrow transplants favor genetic similarity, The majority of successful marrow transplants are between donors and recipients of the same race or ethnicity.  This is where it becomes one of the lesser-known problems among the black community.  Compared to other races, black people awaiting marrow transplant have the lowest likelihood of being matched with a donor.  According to BlackBoneMarrow.com, an online charity devoted to finding marrow donors for black patients, Black patients have a 66% chance of getting matched to a donor, versus 97% for whites.  Blackbonemarrow.com attributes this to a lack of awareness for the need of donors in the black community, a common mistrust of the medical establishment among black people, and, most interestingly, the fact that the black race is more genetically diverse due to the way different populations of Africans distributed around the world throughout history and interbred with other races.  The average black American is genetically 17-18% white, And many blacks also have Native American ancestry.  This is why black patients need a larger pool of potential donors to try to pull matches from.  So if you're a healthy black individual, you might want to consider joining the Be The Match registry and donating some marrow. ",
