So here's Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina.  He's just come out of the Capitol building after the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.  He's looking very cool and adjusting his tie and smiling.  Behind him, a security guard or a Capitol Police officer is restraining a protester who's been screaming at him as he walked out of the Capitol to his ride.  Graham had been a big defender of Kavanaugh against the charges that he had sexually assaulted a woman in high school. ",

            "text": "That's why the lady who's standing behind him and screaming is so furious.  The memes that came out of this photo were actually pretty funny.  The internet went crazy with Lindsey Graham and photoshopped him over all sorts of things like burning houses, Joe Biden kissing the screaming feminist lady in the back.  Oh, there's one where they have Lindsey in front of the Hindenburg.  That's a good one.  People put music to it.  There was rap music.  There was country music.  You name it.  I think the reason this photo really captured the essence of the hearing was that Lindsey Graham is looking kind of smug and cool and collected.  And this woman behind him is supposed to look really hysterical.  And she is emblematic of how conservatives think about feminists looking hysterical and irrational and angry and ineffective because Graham is not paying her any attention.  It's unclear how much memes actually shape the outcome of political campaigns, but the Trump campaign clearly thinks that they work.  The Russians think they're effective.  Conservative groups are actually training their activists to do it better.  And I think we're just going to be seeing a lot more of this as the 2020 campaign ramps up going forward.  This is going to become a staple of political campaigns in the foreseeable future. ",
