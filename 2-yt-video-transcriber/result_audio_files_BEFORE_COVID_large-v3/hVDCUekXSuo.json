I'm not saying that's my opinion.  So those three things kind of are strong.  And so if you want to like pick one of those, I'd be happy to discuss one.  But I would say underneath all those is probably more of an epistemological angst that I have, which is I feel like oftentimes, you know, most, I shouldn't say most, but some theists come to the table with going like, well, I believe in God by faith and you should too.  And you say, well, that's not really logical because that's circular.  And I say, fair enough.  But then I do think that a lot of times atheists will say, well, if I give evidence for an invisible transcendent being, that evidence isn't going to necessarily fit into scientific parameters because it's for an invisible transcendent being.  So I guess the evidence has to be allowed to get to God.  And so I would agree, like how, if I'm going to prove to you that there's a being that's invisible that was capable of creating the world, I can't necessarily use, I can use science, but at the end of the day, there's going to have to be an element that this being is supernatural.

We might acknowledge that our particular universe, our particular instantiation of space-time had a beginning, but you already acknowledged for us that there was a singularity, and that singularity we don't know anything about before Planck time.  Therefore, for example... First law of thermodynamics is that matter is neither created nor destroyed in layman's terms.  Therefore, you know, energy could have... If something has to exist forever, why not energy?  Because at least we know that energy exists.  And we can imagine that perhaps there is a pool of energy that our particular instantiation of space-time came from.  But that doesn't mean that that's all the energy that exists in the cosmos.
