You gotta get permission to take pictures out here.  You gotta get permission to take pictures here in a public sign mall?  Yes.  What's up, everyone?  I'm here with Southeastern PA Community Watch.  We're here at the State Correctional Institution in Chester, PA, also known as SCI Chester.  Got a nice open entrance here.  I'm sorry, ma'am.  Go.  The light is green.  You're stopping.  You're causing a danger on the road, man.  The light is green.  Wow.  This is their premises.  is what they're saying.  The public sidewalk here is the premises.  Oh, my.  No filming on a public sidewalk, buddy.  Yeah, so like I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, we're here at SCI Chester, also known as State Correctional Institution, Chester, Pennsylvania.  We're in Delaware County.  All right, so... They force fucking prisoners around all day.  They think they can boss free people on sidewalks around.
