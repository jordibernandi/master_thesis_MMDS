            "text": "Our job tonight, as a country, sort of, or at least what everybody in the country is going to be doing tonight, is trying to figure out what it means that the report of special counsel Robert Mueller has finally been submitted.  So far tonight, we have no reason to believe Trump is going to be charged.  by rhetoric in the document itself and the Mueller report.  This was what all the questions around the president.  They've cleared him.  They just cleared him.  They've cleared the president.  Robert Mueller is backing the president up on that.  The special counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia.  It doesn't get any clearer than that.  Look, if I'm the Trump children and I'm having a party tonight, right?  Like, they won the white privilege regatta.  No, he will not be charged with obstruction or of collusion without ever having to sit down with the special counsel Mueller and answer his damn questions.  Bob Mueller does all this work, and then on obstruction, what's the most obvious happening in plain sight?  I mean, apparently he's not even allowed to give an opinion.  Are you saying he's not allowed to give an opinion, or did he choose not to?  I don't really know.  Robert Mueller, here he's the special counsel.  He's here to investigate two things, this collusion issue, this conspiracy issue, and obstruction of justice.  On one, he issues a prosecutorial judgment.  He comes to a legal conclusion.  And on the other one, he sidesteps.  Why?  Is that a cop-out?  Why dump this at 5 o'clock, close a business on a Friday?  That's when you dump stuff you're not proud of.  That's when you sneak something through the media.  This is four pages.  There's not a single full sentence in here.  that's quoted the Mueller report.  Every quote from the Mueller report itself is a partial sentence.  Now, some of them are, as just discussed, quite important partial sentences.  These guys are failing in their fundamental constitutional duty.  I mean, is it going to take Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to have to come and tweet something?  for them to get all worked up, defend democracy.  You cannot invest, there is not an African-American person in this country that could have been investigated for 22 months, had their family investigated for 22 months and come away scot-free.  They should be saying right now, I don't care what's in that report, We're going, you know, we're going to go to town and we're going to find out what the facts are.  It is unlikely there's going to be anything in that Mueller report that's going to satisfy me in terms of why these people weren't even brought in under oath.  Why was there never an interrogation of this president?  Donald Trump may just be a political version of Mr.  Magoo.  If this doesn't exonerate them on the obstruction question, then if you haven't resolved obstruction, how do you resolve collusion?  Because if you didn't get cooperation and they obstructed in the investigation, could you necessarily get to the bottom of the collusion question?  But the Democrats also now have to move on and really deal with hard issues.  We're now going to have to start talking about tax reform and climate change and other things because the Mueller situation, I think, has ended up a clear victory for the president. ",
