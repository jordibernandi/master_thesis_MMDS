            "text": "Now, Chairman Powell was pointedly asked whether the Fed is positioned appropriately, meaning does it have enough rate room to cut dramatically if needed if there were a sudden serious downturn in the economy?  His response, quote, We don't have that kind of room.  We're too close to zero rates.  Let's bring in two guys, both very experienced in markets and investing, and they are both Fed watchers, Euro Pacific Capital CEO and President Peter Schiff and Milken Institute chief economist Bill Lee.  Peter, I'll start with you.  That make you nervous that he he had to admit we're too close to zero to have enough if there were a bad downturn in the economy. ",

            "text": "Well, and it's the Fed's fault that we're down here.  But of course, whenever the Fed cuts interest rates in the face of recession, it's not helping the economy.  The recession is what's helping the economy because the recession is trying to restructure the bubble.  The Fed artificially manipulates the economy with cheap money.  And then when that cheap money results in a recession, the Fed comes to the rescue with more cheap money.  But all we're really doing is creating a bigger problem.  And, you know, the Fed chairman said that the U.S.  economy is in a good place.  Well, they always say that no matter how precariously the U.S.  economy is perched, you can always count on a Fed chairman to say everything is great. ",

            "text": "Actually, Liz, I take away a really positive spin from Chair Powell's testimony because he said the U.S.  economy is strong.  We have positive rates.  We're attracting capital from all over the world.  It's keeping the U.S.  economy much stronger than anywhere in the rest of the world, and I think that's the story.  Now, in terms of fear, you're right, but the fears are coming from the slowdown in Europe, the slowdown in China, and that drives more capital into the United States.  So the need for us to cut is really quite limited.  And remember, there's a lot of quantitative easing we can do between now and then to bolster the amount of liquidity and funding of investment that comes into the economy. ",

Any gain for the Dow, any gain for the Nasdaq and one point of gains for the S&P today would bring another trifecta of records.  Peter, let the good times roll.  is what what both the Fed and the president are saying.  But the president takes it a step further, saying cut rates go to negative.  Give me some of that. ",

            "text": "You know, ironically, the negative interest rates that Trump is longing for are actually hurting the European economy and helping to prop up our economy.  Yes, we are getting some capital moving into the U.S.  because it's fleeing the negative interest rates in the eurozone.  And so it's propping up our asset markets and artificially boosting consumer spending.  So that's making the U.S.  economy look better in the short run.  But ultimately, we're setting ourselves up for a big fall.  And remember, don't put much stock into what Powell says, because a year ago, Powell was saying that the Fed was going to keep increasing interest rates and keep shrinking its balance sheet.  It's done the opposite.  It's now cut interest rates three times, and the balance sheet is growing faster now than it was when they were officially doing quantitative easing. ",

CONGRESS, MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO FIND JOBS BY GETTING RID OF REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, BY ENABLING MORE INCENTIVES FOR private sector to hire.  I think Chair Polis actually said the onus is on you guys to fix the economy because monetary policy has done all it can and will continue to do even more if needed.
