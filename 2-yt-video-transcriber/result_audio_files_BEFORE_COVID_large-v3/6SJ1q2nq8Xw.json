            "text": "Oh, hello.  I didn't see you there.  I've just got back from watching Captain Marvel, which was a great film.  However!  I have some thoughts, particularly about how gay it was, and also how it refused to acknowledge how gay it was.  Normally, when I think of that about a film, I go back, I calm myself, I do some research, I script a video, I film, I edit.  Not tonight.  Tonight, I have thoughts that couldn't be contained within an A4 page or within my brain.  So, you know what, we're getting up.  This is a walking round.  First of all, we're gonna start with some facts.  Fact number one, Carol and Maria are in a relationship.  They are raising a child together.  That is factor number one, fight me.  So here's the thing, a lot of people have been talking about this movie as queer coding.  Queer coding is not quite what it is.  I would acknowledge there is some queer coding in this movie, so queer coding is the idea that you code characters with attributes stereotypical to a queer, to queerness, I guess.  And I would acknowledge the fact that she does, Carol does steal a leather jacket and a motorcycle, which is a real gay.  However, what I think we have a case of here, more than queer coding, is romance coding, right?  Romantic coding, that goes beyond.  It transcends sexuality.  It transcends gender.  Romance coding is outside of gender and sexuality.  If something is coded as romantic, it doesn't matter what gender you are because it is still coded as romantic.  And that is how Carol and Maria are coded.  Fact number two.  This adds a caveat to fact number one, because fact number one is not confirmed explicitly in the movie, but it's pretty damn clear in the subtext, in the implied text, it's all there.  What evidence do I have for that?  Let me tell you.  2A.  We've got another list.  We're breaking down the points here.  The next of kin slash personal effects element.  So here's the thing.  Carol is presumed dead.  She has crashed, as far as anyone knows, crashed the plane.  Even her dog tags have been destroyed.  But where do they send the remaining piece of the dog tag?  To Maria, of course, her next of kin.  Not to her father, not to her family, but to Maria.  Okay?  2B, amnesia storyline.  So here's the thing about amnesia storylines in films.  Normally the idea is that you get your memory jogged back and put back inside your head because you go and search out something that you can't bear to be without.  Something that a fundamental part of yourself is yearning for.  Like you have no memories and in a lot of cases philosophically the idea of like you have no self and yet you are still striving, yearning, burning to get towards that thing that means the most to you.  What is that thing I ask you?  Why?  it's Maria and the child they have been raising together.  C, the memories, this ties into this point, the memories, the amount of memories that Carol has with Maria, having fun together, laughing together, flying together, being in the Air Force together, together, together, together, as a family, as a couple, hmm?  Point D, Auntie Carol, I feel like this needs to be talked about again.  They are raising a child together.  I feel like we need to sit with that for a second and think about how that is quintessentially the most relationship codey thing to happen.  And E, and this I think is possibly the most persuasive.  So we're going to have to go into the other room.  Come, come, come, come, come.  Okay, so here's the thing.  Point E, the motherfucking scroll.  So here is the situation.  You've got scroll man number one.  Scroll number one, he's very sad.  He's like, oh no, I'm so sad.  You have to take me to the coordinates so I can get the tesseract.  And then, surprise, they're not coordinates, it's in orbit.  Double surprise, it's not the tesseract he wants.  It's this, ooh, lady scroll, and this, baby scroll, okay?  Because it turns out, ooh, he's got a family, right?  Or are you wrong?  Because, I mean, I'm very hyped up on gay Aya right now, but I do not remember in this scene him saying, hello wife, hello child.  It was just implied.  There was an implied relationship that happened here when they were reunited.  Keep this in mind.  So over here, we have Carol.  Carol.  She's sad because she don't remember anything.  And suddenly she's fine.  She's like, oh, well, you know, I'm trying to get somewhere.  I wonder what could it be about?  Probably not about my family, but surprise, here she meets her funky little friend.  It's Maria, right?  And the little baby girl.  who lives there as well, okay?  Can you see the parallels here, right?  So it's like, oh no, here is someone who I'm coming back to, returning to, who I was fighting to get back to, and it's implied that we're a family unit, why?  Because we are coded as a man and coded as a woman.  Here, we have two women, I'm fighting to get back to you, I literally haven't seen you in six years, And I remember you even after having, like, stuff sucked out of my brain and been made not to remember things by alien powers.  You are the person I come back to.  You and the child we have been raising together.  Right?  This, to me, this is absolute proof of the idea that both of these situations are so similar and so romantic coded, but you would have thought automatically, without being told, that this was a romantic family relationship and that this was a child they were raising together and therefore it made them a legitimate family.  And this, you're apparently made to think that they're just gal pals having friends, being fun, kind of like this child don't know what it's doing, it's just, it's apparently attached to this woman and has no interest in this woman who is also raising her.  Can you see how ridiculous this double standard is?  Okay, this is my deprive.  So, we're gonna go a little bit on a tangent here and talk about Don't Ask, Don't Tell.  Because I've also heard, you know what, we're done with this one, we're going back.  Here's the thing, don't ask, don't tell.  This was put in place in the 90s, right?  So don't ask, don't tell was basically the idea that you can be gay in the military, but don't tell anyone about it or you will get fired.  So this piece of legislation has led to some people on the internet that I have seen being like, whoa.  Even if Karen and Maria were in a relationship, can you really expect the filmmakers to talk about it when it's said in a time of don't ask and don't tell?  And I say, bullshittery to that, sir.  Here is why.  The audience can know things about characters that they wouldn't tell people in public.  right we can have a private scene between these two women who don't enact don't also tell in their own goddamn bedroom.  right we can have that and the audience can see it because the only secrets that we are going to be keeping from an audience are a sequence that we want to reveal or which are not relevant to the plot.  and here's the thing it is entirely relevant to the plot that Carol and Maria might have been a couple, right?  In the same way that we have this girl couple over here, do I need to take you back to the incredible drawing that I just did, right?  Can you imagine the emotional impact of having Maria say to Carol, not just that I missed you over these six years, but that I had to mourn you and nobody could know why I was mourning you.  That they would all think you were my kind of co-pilot, that you were my best friend, but I wouldn't be able to tell anyone that it was because you were my partner because I would still lose my job.  Can you fucking imagine the incredible pathos, the incredible heartbreak that that would have brought?  And it was so implicit within the text.  It was so there.  If Carol had been a man, this would not be a question.  If it had been a man who lost his memories, found his way back to the woman and child that he had helped raise, it would not even be a question that they were going to get together.  But because it is two women, apparently this is beyond the realms of possibility.  i also say it's important to be explicit about this because i get it some people might look at the scroll thing and be like oh and in the scroll thing if you're saying that they didn't explicitly say that they were together then are you saying it's a double standard that we're explicitly going to have to talk about the lesbians?  yes yes we are explicitly gonna have to talk about those events because otherwise no one would know they're there.  they'd be in the dark they'd be hiding they'd be.  oh which is Because we live in a heteronormative world, right?  So everyone is assumed to be straight.  So if we don't explicitly say that people are LGBT, nobody knows.  it's there, okay?  And here's the thing.  The MCU has so many goddamn films.  I don't even know how many films they have right now.  I can count them, can't even count them with my shoes on, right?  Because there's so many of them.  It's too many for my little digits.  And none of them, none of them have an explicitly LGBT character in it.  None of them.  Just think about that for a second.  The idea that you have this entire subsection of people, this entire identity, that we just haven't seen in one of the most successful franchises in film history.  Just like, just not there at all.  And then what we're given is like Valkyrie, who is a character who, by the way, is real queer in the comics, and that they filmed a scene for for that movie in which it would have been massively implied that she was queer as well because i think it was meant to be a woman coming out of her bedroom.  And yet, they didn't include it in the movie because apparently it wasn't relevant.  Thrilling.  So, what we have here is an opportunity to do something with a storyline where it's already built into the story.  They don't have to add anything to the storyline.  It is already there, and yet they do not.  And here's the thing I'm really worried about, right?  We're gonna have Endgame next, and I am so worried that Maria is just gonna be left relegated to the shadows, to this film.  It's going to be treated as a standalone.  She's going to come back.  She's never going to look for Maria.  She's never going to look for her daughter.  It's going to be brushed under the rug, completely forgotten about.  Or if it isn't, it's going to be absolutely treated like it was a gal pal friendship.  Aren't we great?  We were women in the Air Force together, which... It's gonna really annoy me basically.  And we only have a couple of weeks until Endgame comes out, so I have a couple of weeks to live in like flat hope before it just crashes like Carol did when she lost her goddamn memories.  So here's what I want to say.  If anyone from the MCU is watching this, make it gay, you goddamn cowards.  Over and out.  That was it.  That was the whole thing.  That was a rant, Craig.  Thank you very much for your service.  That's alright. ",
