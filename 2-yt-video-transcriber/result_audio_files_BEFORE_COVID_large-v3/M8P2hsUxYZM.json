            "text": "All right, everyone, the Epstein suicide case keeps getting weirder.  It's funny because the other day a HUD official under Trump's HUD, I guess, tweeted out Hillary in response to this.  And then there were people saying, well, Trump is spreading foul conspiracy theories about the Clintons being involved.  Look, Bill Clinton rode on Epstein's plane.  If you're speculating foul play, and I'm telling you the vast majority of Americans are right now, and not without good reason, they would be potentially involved.  I'm not saying that the Clintons killed Epstein off to hide, you know, Bill Clinton's various high crimes and misdemeanors, but it's a possibility.  And if you're not willing to beg the possibility there, I guess you're not interested in an investigation.  We've even got AOC coming out.  It's like a broken clock thing saying, well, we need answers.  Yeah, we do.  We don't know who is responsible, but I'm telling you this.  We can say this for certain.  The official story that we're getting makes no fucking goddamn sense whatsoever.  And when things don't make sense in that capacity, there's probably a reason.  I'm supposed to believe, I guess, this is the claim, I suppose.  What I was hearing is that the guards were sent away for routine maintenance and the cameras just happened to be shut off at the same time, and that during that very brief window he killed himself.  That would either be the ultimate case of malpractice within a prison, which is what they'll likely find.  They'll probably say, well, some warden who totally didn't get an email from someone on the Epstein flight list, or someone associated with him, more likely a second middleman, made the call and did it wrong, and now we fired him.  And just ignore the $5 million that gets dumped into his account a month later.  That's the sort of thing I would expect probably happen.  The average American is screaming foul play right now.  It seems that most people are saying that.  They just don't agree on whodunit.  Now, without an investigation, we don't know.  I would say there are certain people that are more likely than others.  Like, Trump is unlikely because there's literally no reason to believe that he continued to be associated with Epstein for, what, the last 15 fucking years?  There's no reason to believe he would have won Epstein dead, since it seems like a lot of the people that were claimed as... victimizing people under him were Democrats.  So it'd be great for Trump.  He wants Epstein to talk.  So I don't think it would be likely to be him.  It's more likely someone in Hollywood or on the other side of the political aisle.  Now, the Clintons are just a convenient joke because of Vince Foster and things like that.  Death happens to follow the Clintons around enough so that it's become a sort of joke.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that they were involved at all.  It could have been Spacey's people.  It could have been Bill Richardson's people.  How the fuck am I supposed to know?  But then there are some people, some hacks in the legacy media, saying it's a conspiracy theory to even question the official details.  Epstein killed himself for no reason.  He was just, he just had, he was guilty or he was sad because he was caught or something.  That doesn't make sense.  So, you know, you kill yourself.  He's a billionaire in prison.  He's already, apparently he claimed before that he had been assaulted, that the first thing wasn't a suicide attempt, it was assault.  If that's the case, another inmate may have offed him.  Which is, it is theoretically possible that that happened.  It's possible that it wasn't a hit at all, but I just, I don't know about that.  I think more likely somebody who, you know, here's my theory.  I don't think it's someone in the Epstein flight lists.  I think it's someone who's worried that Epstein, if he spoke, would implicate them.  I think it's someone who is friendly with Epstein, probably responsible here for middlemanning a warden to make this call and say, well, let him kill himself, basically.  Make sure that he knows that during that 10-minute period, there's no camera watching him if he wants to end his suffering, and then we'll see what happens.  I think it was basically, the potential is that somebody who is not currently implicated was worried about being implicated.  I would think that would be the group of people, because anyone else, why would the Clintons or Spaceys of the world want to off him when they're already implicated anyway?  The idea is that, of course, he's less likely to talk about them.  If there's blackmail tapes, the FBI already has them, so to speak, so there's nothing to be done about it.  Could have been retaliatory in nature.  It's possible.  And then, of course, there's always that vague chance that he actually did kill himself, and it's all one great coincidence.  But that's one hell of a coincidence, dudes.  That's one hell of a coincidence.  This is a major political... This is bigger than Watergate.  This is probably the biggest political scandal of this century.  Well, you know, of course, we're in the post-2000 era, so the last century and almost 20 years.  Yeah, it's the biggest political scandal in anything closely resembling modern U.S.  political history.  We have an individual who it is claimed was serving underage individuals to a plethora of the elite, basically the whole fucking elite within the country and then some.  People, foreign royals and nobles, bankers and CEOs, politicians within the US, we've got some names listed, it's already a laundry list, who's?  who's of Hollywood.  If a tiny fraction of these people that flew to his private island did anything unconscionable, it would still be a major, major political scandal, and now the person at the center of the case... who could otherwise have given testimony, maybe given up a list, and is dead.  Supposedly, he killed himself under what can only be termed the most mysterious of circumstances.  It's a weird case.  At the very least, it's weird as fuck.  Totally not spreading conspiracy theories here.  And the idea, by the way, the use of the term conspiracy theory for this, no, I think the term you mean is criminal conspiracy, like a cover-up.  Because it looks like someone's trying to cover something up by killing Epstein.  It's kind of a ballsy move to get involved and either allow him to kill himself or kill him when he's already the focus of the entire nation.  Apparently it was trending in foreign news sources too.  Dutch news sources had taken it up among others.  Not a really big surprise.  Like, Epstein catered to people around the world.  It's like, we're worried here about like, well, the Democratic Party or Trump or something.  Okay, that's the US political system.  We're also talking about like Prince Andrew and weird shit like that.  Let's say he didn't do anything wrong and the original claimant against Epstein was full of shit.  That doesn't mean that we don't have a massive list of extremely famous and wealthy and powerful, well-connected people that went to this private locale sort of away from society, away from the shuttering cameras, to hang out with a dude who now the Intel agencies themselves saying, yes, he trafficked minors for an extended period of time and had been doing that for several decades.  Again, I don't think that there's a blackmail motive because that particular move wouldn't make sense because it would implicate him as well.  But I mean, quite clearly, there were weird things going on on Little St.  James.  That's number one.  The worst part is he was using the people that he was victimizing as recruiters to victimize more people.  How many people are we talking about?  Hundreds?  We're talking about an extremely large number, and the clientele involved makes it look like the Hollywood Madam sort of thing.  Only that involved adult females, so it's like, you know, maybe one step away, less bad.  Epstein's dead.  And what people should have been able to do, in a perfect world, we would have been celebrating.  We would have said, oh, well, you know, basically the monster's killed himself.  He saved us a lot of money in prosecuting him.  Wonderful day.  Instead, what happened is because the legacy media has propagandized to people so effectively for so many years, people immediately, like within five minutes, it was a festival of people saying either Trump had him killed to cover up his crimes and then Rosenstein somehow helping Trump cover things up.  which is like the wackiest, that is literally a conspiracy theory.  Rosenstein and Trump fucking hate each other.  He was dragged up, trust me, against his will during that press conference by Barr.  He didn't want to be there.  The idea that he's covering for Trump is ludicrous.  uh... and then people saying it was the clinton's.  by the way there's a. there are other people involved.  it doesn't necessarily become the clinton's i understand.  it's funny uh... they're the natural you know sort of top billing of people you would suspect because they've been implicated before and potentially having people accidentally fall on a dozen bullets more or less like a vince foster case uh... that's a funny thing to say and it does and sort of sensible.  But there are so many people that potentially are implicated in this.  We're talking about half the political elite of the Western world.  You know, we don't even know everyone that's on these lists.  We don't even know everyone who's being investigated.  The number of suspects, therefore, is probably in the thousands.  When you really think about it.  And the idea, by the way, the FBI says we're investigating.  Yeah.  I trust your investigation, really.  Yeah, go at it.  The FBI could have been involved in offing him, for all I know.  How the fuck am I supposed to trust the intel agencies at this point when they habitually lie to the people of this country on a regular basis?  I'm sorry, I just can't put any trust or any stock in your investigation.  Now, if New York State is investigating from the angle of, well, there was some malpractice, something fucked up here, so we're investigating, that'd be a little better.  For Barr to get involved and say he's going to have people come in and investigate, maybe I trust that a little bit more.  But keep in mind, this is still the U.S.  government.  Should you trust government, especially in cases like this?  No, this looks like a JFK sort of situation.  Only, of course, different.  Like Lee Harvey Oswald getting off.  There's nothing mysterious there either.  It was just a routine mob hit, remember.  Or Saran Saran sort of stuff.  or Marilyn Monroe.  This is weird.  It's like, you know, it's sort of like a flashback to the 60s sort of intrigue, spy versus spy shit.  And then you've got Scarborough coming out and saying, well, this looks like a Russian hit to me.  What are you fucking talking about, dude?  Why would Russia want to kill Jeffrey Epstein?  No, Russia, trust me, Putin and people like that want Epstein alive so that he can implicate half of the political elite in this country in being involved with prostitution and drug running and weird shit like that.  That's what the Russians want.  They'd love it.  They'd sit there laughing.  Unfortunately, with Epstein dead, the main person at the center of the whole fucking investigation being gone, he can't give testimony anymore.  Jesus.  Talk about a fucking weird case.  Is this how it felt to any of you old enough to remember?  Is this how it felt like after RFK got shot or something like that?  Like what the fuck is going on?  Total confusion.  And the political hatchet jobs that are happening thereafter, like I guess there was a share blue list, which may or may not be true, like real, an internal circular towards their stalwarts or whatever they term them.  uh... to try to tell people to pretend to be conservatives and say like off the wall shit about trump and stuff like that.  and share blue does exist.  it is an active shilling project.  it does exist.  it is well funded.  it isn't a conspiracy to suggest that they conduct a various psychological warfare in a political sense their arm of the democratic party basically and they ship post.  they spread propaganda.  the republicans have similar groups as well.  If that internal circular is real, it shows that they're a little bit afraid of the Epstein case, which makes sense considering Bill Richardson was on the release literally 24 fucking hours before.  But I'm supposed to believe this.  24 hours before you get a release of certain names.  yet the release the uh... of the testimony involving this girl virginia with free again probably getting the name wrong.  this gets released.  less than twenty four hours later.  epstein's taken off suicide watch.  maintenance is done in this in that area so the guards go away and for like ten minutes the cameras turn off.  this is normal and he did.  he knew that this happened somehow from within his his isolated cell.  he knew the camera was off in.  the guards were gone so he could kill himself somehow.  we knew that.  Who told him?  I think that this was a case, I think there's a 99% chance.  he was told, hey, guards are going to be gone for the next 15 minutes, cameras will be off, do your thing.  I think that's what happened.  Basically, and if you don't do it, we're going to do it, and trust me, it's going to be a lot more painful.  Remember, we beat you up a couple weeks ago, we're going to do that every fucking day.  Just take your own fucking life.  That would be within the MO of some of these people.  Not that anyone's shedding any tears for Epstein being like beaten up or killed or anything.  But I mean, it would have been nice to have his testimony first.  It would have been nice if they could have gotten him.  You've got the most high profile prisoner in the whole country and you can't keep him from killing himself?  Yeah, some heads are definitely gonna roll, but I have a feeling that they've got a patsy already lined up.  Some guard, a warden, a computer programmer who accidentally left a glitch in the system that turned the cameras off at the wrong time.  Somebody, some low to mid-level individual will take the fall.  And they'll spend maybe a little time in jail or pay a fine.  And then when they get out, years and years later, we'll find out they're in the Cayman Islands that they mysteriously became extremely wealthy.  The insider trading sort of story.  They made millions of dollars because they got tip-offs from a dude in a trench coat in an alleyway that they were set up with months before.  Something like that'll happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's interesting how the Clintons are always associated with these cases too.  But then again, so is the rest of the holly weird elite and half the politicians in the country and apparently foreign royals as well.  It's a weird case.  There's no other way to put it.  Anyone who thinks it's a conspiracy theory to think that something fishy went on is fucking, you've got to be crapped.  You've got to be kidding me if you actually believe that.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
