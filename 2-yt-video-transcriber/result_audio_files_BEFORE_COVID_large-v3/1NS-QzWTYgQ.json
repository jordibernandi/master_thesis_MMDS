That is not an exaggeration.  There are now more junkies in San Francisco than there are high school students.  And so you won't be surprised to learn that the city has also become threatening and dangerous.  The rate of property crime in San Francisco is the highest of any big city in America.  More than five dozen cars are smashed and robbed every single day of the year.  It's a disaster.  But don't worry, the city's leaders have a plan to respond to this.  Of course, it's not more cops or better enforcement of the law.  That would be bigoted.  Instead, the city of San Francisco has decided to ban words that suggest San Francisco has a crime problem.  People aren't allowed to talk about crime.  Maybe they won't notice crime exists.  That's the thinking.  So last month, the city's Board of Supervisors decreed that there will be no more convicted felons in San Francisco.  Going forward, ex-cons are to be called, quote, justice-involved individuals.  Well, as it happens, the people they committed crimes against are also, quote, justice-involved individuals.  So, in other words, victim and criminal are now morally indistinguishable.  That's on purpose.  This is woke equality.  But there's a problem.  Back in Washington, leaders of the Democratic Party apparently haven't gotten a memo on this.
