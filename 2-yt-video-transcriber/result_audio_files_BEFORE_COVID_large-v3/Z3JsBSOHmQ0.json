            "text": "By the end of the lifespan of most people watching this video, the majority of capital cities in Europe will be governed in the mainspring by African and Arab nationals.  London, Paris, Vienna, Marseille, each has suffered in less than one generation an ethnocide so rapid and complete that were it presented before the Hague would likely meet the standard for genocide.  We speak of vanishing cultures as if such vanishing were a natural process for which no one were responsible, the customary sequence of time and progress that comes at last to all civilizations.  but only a tiny fraction of the mass settlement on European soil this past decade has been on organic development.  For the most part, the forced importation of a hostile and predatory fifth column has been a deliberate and strategic campaign against the express wishes of the citizenry.  A crisis brought about by the cataclysmic union of Islamo-Bolshevism, a barbaric death cult, and a fanatic, Soviet-styled war machine, each the other's equal in greed and militant orthodoxy.  This alliance works openly and unashamedly for the irreversible colonization of our continent.  As one conquers by rapine and violence, the other snaps at its heels, silencing critics and ridiculing victims.  so that now, through the mandatory assimilation of antithetical groups, the majority of Austrians under the age of 15 will be Muslim by the middle of the century.  This grand social reconstruction is not confined to Europe, but has also strong-armed its way into America Canada and Australia, who likewise suffer the indignity of forced communitarianism, bullied into abdicating their territory and handing over the customs and institutions achieved through centuries of nurturing effort, inheritance and sacrifice.  Despite openly documenting our contempt for this project, we have been written off as relics of the past, even as our pulse beats.  The demographics of Europe now are such that we will become an Islamic continent within the century.  The point of prevention has passed, the numbers are simply too high.  Even if every boat was stopped, and a total moratorium placed on all immigration, no difference would be made to the monumental transfer from European ownership to Arab.  Without even knowing it, Europe has found herself colonized.  The great resettlement process is complete, the consolidation process successfully underway.  This information isn't shared to frighten or distress, but because it remains the one urgent truth yet to penetrate the public consciousness. ",
