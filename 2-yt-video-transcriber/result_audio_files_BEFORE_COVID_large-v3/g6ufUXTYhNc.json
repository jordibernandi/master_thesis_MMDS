But because of the piercing that goes through his nose, we tried to do that with just the two pieces being drawn together with a magnet.  Tried it on ourselves, and it was incredibly painful.  So I knew that the best thing to do would be to create a prosthetic nose.  But as far as Doug's face goes, he's already got kind of a large nose.  Not in a bad way.  It fits his face fine.  But as soon as you start adding enough thickness to put that thing through his nose, then his lips look ridiculously thin.  So I knew that we would have to make his lips thicker too.  So it quickly became a nose prosthetic.  And then it became lip prosthetics just to balance everything out. ",

Gets all the little details and lines and pores and stuff.  And then that gets supported with plaster bandages and then removed from the face.  And then it's into that that the plaster goes.  And so this starts out as a liquid and gets brushed into all the details in the mold and then built up to an appropriate thickness and smoothed out.  And then when you pull it out, you've got an exact duplicate of that person's face.  And so then the sculpture is done out of clay.  This clay is built up to the specific thickness that we want the silicone to be.  And then a negative mold is made of that.  And then whenever the clay is cleaned off and the mold is put back on, there's a gap where that clay used to be.  And that's what gets filled with the liquid silicone, which turns into a prosthetic.

So trying to keep from nodding while they're trying to put the, you know, nodding off to sleep while they're trying to put that tattoo on me and the nose and the lips.  That was amazing.  when they, even in the test, when they did the nose and the lips, folks were coming up to look at it, you know, the other artists over there at the warehouse, and they were all saying they couldn't even tell even up close, that they were prosthetic nose and lips.  They looked so natural.  I mean, when they first put it on, it doesn't, but then of course they painted, airbrushed the face and so on, so it blends everything.  It was really cool to see the transformation. ",

And so to make something that hopefully nobody even notices, like if at the end people say, who is that weird guy that you got to play that part?  And they don't say, oh, who made the nose for that?  It's better to hear who played that guy rather than who made that nose.  Because if they say who made that nose, then obviously you kind of missed the mark.  Even if it looks good, it's probably not realistic enough.  Thank you. ",
