            "text": "Yeah, I'll be with y'all one second.  To the guy who commented on my last video saying that my video quality sucks, I got a new camera.  So from all of us here at Heavy Duty Country, f*** you.  You spend about every waking second of your life at the shooting range trying to become the next Chris Kyle.  But when you realize that you have worse vision than bubbles from the trailer park boys, you switch your pissed off attitude towards your girlfriend.  that's been on the couch for the past three hours watching Grey's Anatomy eating Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  Turn that crap off, babe.  Let's watch Breaking Bad.  Uh, no.  I'm watching Friends next.  You want the backhand again?  Time.  Ron, just do what men have been doing for thousands of years and punch the woman.  Punch her!  You're stalling.  Punch the woman!  Here comes the Toledo Express all aboard!  OK, but let's get real here.  What this really is about is having your girlfriend look like one of those Instagram models from the Guns, Girls, and Freedom Instagram.  Like, you want your girlfriend to look exactly like one of Dan Bilzerian's chicks.  Is it really large?  Does the Tin Man have a sheet metal cock?  Except you don't have any money, or HDH, or steroids, or white teeth.  But hey, you gotta work with what you got.  In the end, you just think, oh, am I really smaller than everyone else?  But Clive, could I ask you, is that then regarded as a handicap, or is that sort of like, look, it's small, but we can cope with it.  So what do we do?  Make your papa proud.  Here's how to get your girlfriend to participate in one of the most country activities out there.  Number one, the bait and switch.  Tell her you wanna spend more time with her and then pull the old bait and switch and head to the ranch where the deer blind is at.  It'll be a great opportunity for you to stare at her ass in those Lululemon yoga pants that she bought with your credit card.  And now it's maxed out.  So much for that fleshlight you were gonna buy.  By the way, what's the deal with Lululemon?  They make men's Lululemon stuff now?  Is that the uniform they hand out when you try out for being gay?  What's that?  oh it is okay.  hey no problem thank you.  anyways when you're at the range and you start shooting groupings tighter than your girlfriend's grip on your morning would you literally become a human dildo right in front of her eyes.  number two the manipulation.  women are good at a few things in life a few.  one of them is comparing themselves to other women and hopefully the other one is swallowing your gravy.  getting your girlfriend to go hunting with you is all about gentle Psychological manipulation.  It's a lot like trying anal on the first date.  Or the 50th.  Yeah.  We brought beers and rubbers.  And some lotion for your tits.  Number three, the barter system.  Make a trade with her.  Tell her to do something that you like and you'll do something that she's into.  This is common sense, guys.  Now, once you get your way, you back out of your end of the deal and tell her that she's really the one benefiting from this.  All right, babe, I just cooked you a nice steak dinner.  Now it's time for you to take on my big steak.  You know, babe, I just really don't want to do that anymore because I just feel like it's like super demeaning to women to do that to a guy.  Yeah, we should probably take a break.  Yeah.  By the way, no woman should be able to say that giving head is demeaning unless your mouth is the size of a lifesaver.  But I don't care.  I'm still going to try to get it in there.  I need y'all to realize that motivation is of the utmost importance.  when trying to get your woman to do something.  Jealousy is the biggest motivator in women.  Don't believe me?  Have your girl catch you looking at her friend's Instagram profile that has bigger tits than her and a nicer ass.  Two different things can happen here.  She'll either get her ass to the gym or she'll dump you and get her dad to buy her a boob job and then she'll your best friend.  But seriously though, subtly slip into the conversation with your woman that the dude to the east with the ranch has a girlfriend that goes hunting with him all the time.  And she wears one of those camo shirts that barely covers her nipples.  Come here, babe.  Look at what she's wearing.  What's that?  No, babe, I'm not checking out her ass.  I'm just showing you her outfit.  God dang.  That's really nice.  This is the perfect scenario.  She's too jealous of that other chick to remember that you're a doucher.  Good for you, brother.  good for you.  Sign your girl up for a deer release that has a tour guide and all the things that come along with that.  Women love free crap, even if it's something that's not even close to something that they need.  Like, do you really need to grab 500 different perfume samples when we're at the mall?  My truck smells like an Abercrombie & Fitch store after you're in it for five minutes.  It's a problem.  No one needs to deal with that.  Anyways, make sure there's a decent looking guy leading the hunt tour so it kind of grabs your chick's attention.  But make sure he's not better looking than you.  Otherwise, she'll be shooting off his hog instead of the hogs in that field over there.  Thank you for watching and subscribing.  You can grab some free stuff on my website that you'll need a credit card to pay for.  And I'll see you next week.  Yeah.  When the storm rolls in, I'm gonna be ready.  Side piece on my head in case it gets heavy.  Like a cowboy kicking down doors and taking names.  John Wayne. ",
