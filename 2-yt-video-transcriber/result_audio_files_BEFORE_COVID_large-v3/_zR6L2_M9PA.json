And so what we saw, and this is what made Brother Bernie's speech so historically significant.  We've never seen in the history of American politics presidential politics, this kind of thoroughgoing democratic.  It was radically democratic.  It allowed for those slash Stone called everyday people, those James Cleveland called ordinary people, to be center stage.  Not the elites, not stock market, not the powerful, but everyday people. ",
