I've been a fan of Rationality Rules since he started his channel.  When my channel was demonetized, he stepped up and pledged a few bucks per month to my Patreon, for which I was very thankful.  I don't hold any ill will towards him, I don't hate him, and up until fairly recently I thought he did solid work.  Then I started noticing odd moments in some of his videos that raised some red flags for me.  For example, he began to praise right-wing commentators before disagreeing with them.  Here's a few examples. ",

I think it's alarmist, ignorant, riddled with errors, and can easily be used to fuel anti-trans sentiment.  I think he was irresponsible to release that video without doing the proper research, and I 100% oppose it and hope he makes a correction video in the near future.

            "text": "weren't justified.  Fast forward to April 27th, and Faithless Forum arrives.  Some of the prominent atheist creators gather together, and reportedly, quite a few of them discussed RR's video.  I'm guessing that there were several chats over the course of the conference, and on May 3rd Steven released a tweet saying, quote, At this point I'm not sure why he didn't change the title and description of the video to reflect that he no longer stood behind his words.  This would have taken only a few minutes of his time, and would have gone a long way towards showing that he no longer stood behind his video.  But instead, he did nothing besides release that tweet, and the video continued being shared, talked about, and viewed, without anyone, besides those who might follow him on Twitter, realizing that his views had changed.  Even if you agree with RR's video, the fact that he said he had made significant mistakes and used ignorant language should make it clear to you that the right course of action would have been to take a few minutes to edit the title and description box to reflect this.  especially since his video is about a tiny minority group who already gets a lot of hate online and off.  On May 9th, the ACA, or the Atheist Community of Austin, released the following statement to their Facebook page and website.  Recently, the ACA Board of Directors was made aware that guest host co-host Stephen Woodford, YouTuber Rationality Rules, had made ignorant and transphobic videos and statements on his social media platforms in the weeks leading up to his appearance on ACA shows.  We would like to make it clear that we do not share or condone his opinions or attitudes, and that we fully and actively support equal rights for the LGBTQIA plus community.  We acknowledge that the ACA did a poor job showing our support by allowing Mr.  Woodford to make appearances on our shows without either addressing his controversial views on air or asking him to refrain from appearances until he released a clarifying statement on his channel.  We also failed to communicate our feelings and intentions in a timely manner to our volunteers and fans.  We sincerely apologize for the pain and anguish our failings have caused our viewers, volunteers, and our ACA family all over the world.  We love the trans community and are deeply distressed to have caused anyone harm.  We have let you down and we intend to do our best to earn back your trust.  The ACA is working quickly and diligently to ensure that this kind of mistake does not happen again.  We will be coordinating with hosts, co-hosts, and staff to communicate any potential issues with the guests well in advance of when they are set to appear on any ACA production.  End quote.  And this is huge because the ACA is respected in the atheist community.  and they're at least partially responsible for shows such as The Atheist Experience and Talk Heathen, which we'll get into in a minute.  First off though, I want to get in a few of my opinions about the ACA statement.  I don't for a second believe that the ACA didn't know about Stephen's trans athlete video before making his appearances on their shows.  Admittedly, I have no concrete evidence to back that up.  But I think it's ridiculous to think that someone didn't look at his most recent videos before inviting him out on their shows.  Hell, I used to run a rinky-dink amateur hour podcast, except for Shannon Q, who wasn't an amateur, and I would scope out the most recent videos on a guest page before having them on as a guest.  Now, maybe the board didn't know.  I guess that's a possibility, but I find even that hard to believe.  I would very much have liked to see him challenged on his views on those shows, but that opportunity is now gone.  While I don't necessarily have a problem with the ACA releasing the statement attempting to distance themselves from Steven, their hands are far from clean.  The very next day after the ACA denounced Steven, on May 10th, both Talk Heathen and The Atheist Experience released clips featuring rationality rules.  Hardly the sort of thing you'd expect if you're trying to distance yourself from someone.  I mean, denouncing someone and then making money off their appearances on your shows is a pretty shitty thing to do.  In response, RR released a video response with a pretty pretentious thumbnail that compares himself to Galileo and the ACA to the Inquisition.  But yeah, let's put that aside and look at the video.  I'm going to skip over the beginning where Steven basically says he enjoyed his time as a guest of the ACA, that it was a great honor to sit beside Matt Dillahunty and achieve the greatest all-time viewership in the history of the Atheist Experience show.  As always, the link will be in the description so you can go watch it for yourself. ",
