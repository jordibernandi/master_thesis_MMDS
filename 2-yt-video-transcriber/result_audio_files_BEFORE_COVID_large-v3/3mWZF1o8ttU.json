            "text": "How you doing?  I think this is the asshole that detained me.  Not that long ago.  I could be wrong.  It's hard to tell, right?  There's a lot of bald heads.  They got the same uniform.  You're going to be detained, honey.  Can I set my camera down?  Why am I the only person that has to follow these rules?  But I think he looks familiar.  And he's got his gun out.  If it's him, if it's the same guy, he's super sensitive about being recorded.  But like I said, I'm not even certain that it's him, and I don't know if there's a way for me to verify it.  It looks like he wants to shoot somebody, though.  So, I don't know, maybe it was a bogus call.  I don't know if they got a suspect or if they didn't.  Or if they're receiving a crime, for that matter.  Oh, they do have a suspect.  Okay, they have a suspect.  Hello, how are you?  Did you guys get the bad guys today?  What's his name?  I don't know if I believe you.  You're lying to me.  He's trying to send me to a privately owned.  He's calling him a detective.  Okay, so this guy is putting the gloves on.  Was that call founded?  Was there actually a guy out here with the machete?  If you don't mind me asking, was there a guy out here with a machete?  Deputy Abraham, was there a guy out here with a machete?  Well, it's a bad day for Deputy Abraham.  For one, he doesn't know how to answer questions, and for two, I just accessed the mistaken bacon server.  Bitches got the street shut down.  Good morning.  Yeah, what trash can?  Why would I go back there?  Well, that's too bad.  Look, everybody else is around here.  You don't get to make freedom of the press.  Does that mean we get extra special rules for the press?  and I need to be inside of what I'm recording.  So I can't just go stand by a trash can because he said to go by a trash can.  Go ahead, beam by a gas.  Go ahead and arrest me.  What about those people?  What about those people?  Don't touch me.  Move, bitch.  Get out the way.  You're going to be detained, honey.  Can I set my camera down?  Why am I the only person that has to follow these rules?  What about these kids and those people?  You're the only person that hasn't listened to me.  Oh, really?  I'm the only person you're giving these special instructions to?  Have you ever heard of the First Amendment free press?  You need everybody else to stand back where I asked them to and you didn't stand back where I asked them to.  Okay, there's absolutely no reason for you to tell me I have to go all the way back there.  How do you know I wasn't passing through like everybody else?  These motor vehicles, how come I can't just pass through?  I'm not allowed to go to Century Boulevard?  Why am I not allowed to go to Century Boulevard?  I didn't say you couldn't go to Century Boulevard.  You told me I had to go back.  I did tell you I had to go back.  But all these motor vehicles... You're not in conflict.  All these motor vehicles are allowed to go through, but I'm not allowed?  Is it because I'm on a bicycle?  I didn't say that you couldn't go through.  I said you couldn't go through on this side of the street.  That's not what you said.  You told me to go to that trash can over there.  I told you to go back for me.  You told me to go by that trash can, sir.  Come on.  thing here which I can't tell.  It's a camera.  Why are you taking that off?  If you have any hidden weapons.  Why would I have a hidden weapon?  What reason do you have to suspect that I have a weapon?  Don't you have something better to do?  Actually, I do.  Unfortunately, you're interfering with my business.  All you have to do is let me keep going on my way.  I asked you to do that.  You didn't do it.  You asked me to go to the dumpster.  that's not even in the right direction.  I have nothing illegal, nothing sharp.  I haven't done anything illegal, sir.  I've seen this guy yesterday, but I wasn't certain he was the guy who detained me.  This guy Abraham.  I would say he's a tyrant.  He detained me for no reason.  An hour later, he was recording me with his own camera after he turned all mine off.  He wouldn't let me out of the back of the car until I agreed it was my fault that he detained me.  This kind of behavior recently came to light in the LA County jail.  What's your first name, partner?  Gabriel.  Gabriel.  What's your last name?  Carrillo.  Two R's and two L's?  Yes, sir.  where they're beating the shit out of visitors that come to the place.  And they ask them, who beat you up?  How did you get so beat up?  Did somebody hit you?  What happened?  I have no idea, sir.  You have no idea?  No.  So you don't know how all this blood and all these cuts got on your face?  And the visitors, fearing for their life, say, oh, I don't know what happened.  I didn't see.  I don't know who hit me.  That is not an isolated incident.  When I was in the county jail, I watched two people nearly be beat to death before I was even processed all the way in.  And that's what they did.  They separated us all.  What are you looking at?  Come on.  Was that an accident?  You have a nice day.  People think bikes don't have a right to the road.  I have the right to all of it.  You're lucky.  I share it with you. ",
