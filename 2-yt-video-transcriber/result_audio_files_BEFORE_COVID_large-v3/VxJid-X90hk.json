            "text": "Hello YouTube.  Today I've got some great news for you.  As I'm sure you know, I've been doing my BSc in Astrophysics and Geology lately.  Well, a few years ago I satisfied the major in Geology, and now today I've got some great news for you.  As of today, I'm an Astrophysicist.  I've completed all the course subjects that are required to satisfy an Astrophysics minor, and so I'm in a position to either walk away with an Astrophysics minor, or press on to get a double major in Astrophysics and Geology.  Wish me luck for the next semester. ",
