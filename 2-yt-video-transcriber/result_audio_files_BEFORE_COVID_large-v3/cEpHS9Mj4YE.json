            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  I'm going to cut straight to the chase here.  Trump's personal attorney slash international man of mystery slash greasy goblin.  Rudy Giuliani is the smoking gun in this impeachment inquiry.  After reading the transcript memo, the summary from Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, I think that all impeachment roads lead right through.  Rudy Coludi, a nickname I very much wish I could say I came up with, but all of Twitter beat me to it.  Rudy Coludi is the human blue dress of 2019.  And all jokes about old, crusty, dried-up stains aside, I think Rudy Giuliani will ultimately end the Trump administration.  Let me explain.  Rudy Giuliani is Donald Trump's personal attorney.  He took that spot that Michael Cohen warmed up for him for years.  So when Michael Cohen passed the baton of spectacular disborrowable lawyering to Rudy Giuliani, it was in personal capacity only.  Rudy Giuliani is not a federal employee.  He was not confirmed by the Senate to any post in the Trump administration and he does not act in any official capacity on behalf of the American people.  And yet his name is tossed back and forth between Trump and Zelensky as though he's some sort of American ambassador or secretary of state.  Listen to how Zelensky brings up Rudy Giuliani to show that he wants to be in good graces with Trump.  I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr.  Giuliani just recently, and we are hoping very much that Mr.  Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.  Now, in their infinite incompetence, the White House sent over talking points to presumably Republican members of Congress, but somehow CC'd Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats on it.  In these talking points, the White House outlined myths and facts about the phone calls.  And it literally reads like a who-are-you-gonna-believe, me or your lying eyes.  We're supposed to gloss over the fact that Trump instructs Zelensky to work with Giuliani and instead we're to pay attention that Zelensky brought up Giuliani's name first.  Like it matters.  Spoiler alert, it doesn't.  Who was the first to say, hey, so about that Giuliani?  fella is irrelevant.  It's the meat of the conversation that we as Americans shouldn't have to choke down.  The fact that Trump insists that Zelensky keep Giuliani abreast of developments in an investigation of Trump's political rival, Joe Biden, is enraging.  Again, keep in mind that Rudy Giuliani is a private citizen, not given any authority by the American people.  Here's Trump.  Mr.  Giuliani is a highly respected man.  He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you.  I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General.  Rudy very much knows what's happening, and he is a very capable guy.  If you could speak to him, that would be great.  Not to mention the fact that it has been reported that the entire phone call was based on the precondition that Donald Trump would get the opportunity to talk to Zelensky about investigating Joe Biden.  It was clear that President Donald Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case.  said Siri Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine's parliament, who now acts as an advisor to Zelensky.  This issue was raised many times.  I know that Ukrainian officials understood.  This, my friends, is the smoking gun I'm talking about, and a key to this impeachment inquiry.  Remember these four letters, F-A-R-A, because I believe we'll be hearing them a lot to come.  It's our federal law known as Foreign Agents Registration Act, and it's been around for nearly 80 years.  FARA requires individuals doing political or advocacy work on behalf of foreign governments and entities in the U.S.  to register with the Department of Justice and to disclose their relationship activities, receipts, and disbursements in support of their activities.  In other words, American law requires public registration from people who want to work with foreign entities.  Ukraine is a foreign entity.  Rudy Giuliani does not appear to be registered as a foreign agent.  Keep in mind that the database is public.  There are roughly 450 registered foreign agents right now.  I searched it several times and Rudy Kaloudi didn't show up.  Rudy Giuliani appears to be in direct violation of federal law, and the American, for now, president is complicit in this violation.  Trump wishes to benefit from Giuliani's lawbreaking by having Giuliani go outside of the regulations that bind federal employees and act on Trump's personal behalf as it concerns his campaigning.  The fact that this is gross and flagrantly out in open view doesn't make it less against the law.  Now, I'm not the only person ringing alarm bells about Rudy Giuliani.  Seven Democratic senators have inquired with the Department of Justice earlier in September about Giuliani's apparent non-registration under FARA.  They outlined half a dozen open violations of the act, such as Giuliani going to Armenia, Bahrain, Albania, and Poland as a Trump proxy.  the Department of Justice ignored the letter.  So as of September 25th, once the transcript got released, they renewed their request for review of Giuliani's compliance with the law.  Because again, the database is fully public and Giuliani's name is nowhere in it.  This stalling from the DOJ is also likely to be brought up during the impeachment hearings.  In the end, I do believe that as more facts come out, Rudy Giuliani will be the card that gets yanked, causing the whole rotten House of Trump cards to topple.  But in the meantime, please.  I beg you, please keep inviting Giuliani on the news, talk shows, and ask him questions and watch him spill all the beans.  He is an incompetent buffoon, a blowhard who gets blinded by studio lights and goes into some sort of verbal diarrhea trance from which we can begin to put together the true picture.  of what's happening at the White House.  I mean, if he be the only one who brings us to the other end of this Trump administration, so be it.  I'm ready. ",
