So she testified trying to get this guy convicted on why she got a guy arrested for no crime, no violence, no threats, got him arrested for a misdemeanor with a possible $1,000 fine if he was convicted, and then got his bail raised to $500,000, a half a million dollars on a charge with a $1,000 fine.  Unbelievable.  I did a case.  I'll try to put a link in the description to the first video.  But here she is. ",
