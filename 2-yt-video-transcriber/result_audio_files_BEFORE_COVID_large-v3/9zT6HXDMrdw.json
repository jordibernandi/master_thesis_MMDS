            "text": "The way you know you're born again, one of the things it gives you is both your mind is illumined and your heart is moved and spiritual truth that you might have actually heard before but didn't make sense to your mind or it certainly didn't touch your heart, now it does.  So, for example, let's start with the heart.  I cannot tell you how, after years and years of ministry, when somebody... who's come to church all their lives, starts to say, something has happened.  I knew these biblical texts all my life, but now they just seem almost like somebody turned the lights on.  Or I've read this, or I heard this first, but now suddenly it's just hitting me.  I don't know why I never saw this before.  I don't know why I never saw this before.  But more than that, what they usually mean is, I always knew God loved me, but I'm actually starting to sense that.  It's starting to actually become real.  It's starting to convict me.  It's starting to feed me.  Now, here we are in the realm of St.  Augustine, and St.  Augustine would say the mark of a truly born again, a truly regenerated Christian, was the loves of your heart are being reordered.  What it means is it's one thing to say, oh, I believe that God loves me, and it's just up here, that's all.  Meanwhile, the main thing that's driving you is to get this person's love, this man or this woman, or the main thing that's driving you is to have a successful career, to have everyone love you because you've got status and money.  And no matter what you try, you say, I'm a Christian?  Of course I'm a Christian.  I go to church and I believe God loves me.  But the love of fame and accolades, the love of romance and maybe sex is much more real to you than God's love.  God's love is in the abstract.  God's love is in the abstract.  Or another way to put it is, have you ever tried to watch something on a screen and it listened to something at the same time?  Whatever's up there on the screen always wins, you know?  And what happens is career and maybe something else in your life, something in your life is on video.  And until the new birth, even if you go to church, God's love and his holiness and just God is on audio.  And you say, oh, of course, I've always believed that.  Then the lights come on, or maybe you say the sound comes on, and suddenly God goes on video.  And when God's love in Christ becomes more real to your heart than the fame and status that you get in a career, or even more real to your heart than your family's love, your loves get reordered.  It creates changes. ",
