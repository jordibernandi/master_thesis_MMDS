            "text": "Another Democrat politician is headed to prison and is now making a desperate move to beg President Trump for a pardon.  It's interesting.  We've been following a large number of arrests of various Democrat politicians and associates.  Ohio seems to be one of the main states where all of this federal activity is going on.  Clayton Luckey, was charged with Brian Higgins, Joey Williams, and Roshan Winburn, all pictured here alongside Clayton Luckey.  The indictments against all four of these men were unsealed back in April.  Then there was another very big update just in the last couple of weeks when another Democrat official, the ex-mayor of Trotwood, was also indicted.  alongside two other individuals on federal fraud charges.  So Clayton Luckey is just one of the Democrat officials that feds have busted for corruption.  Now former Democrat state lawmaker Clayton Luckey says that he will seek a pardon from President Trump after his corruption conviction.  former Democrat state representative sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to mail fraud, says he did nothing wrong and will seek a presidential pardon.  Clayton Luckey, who is black, says pardoning him would be a good way for Republican President Trump to show he cares about the minority community.  Luckey was sentenced in November to four months in prison after a judge rejected a probation recommendation.  Luckey was convicted of offering his firm as a front for another company to win work intended for disadvantaged businesses and submitted false invoices for thousands of dollars to the city of Dayton.  So this is a totally bizarre justification coming from Clayton Luckey as to why he should be pardoned.  The convicted Dayton area Democrat is trying to pressure President Trump into pardoning him because he says that it would show that the president cares about the minority community as Luckey is black.  But even though Clayton Luckey is black himself, He was charged for ripping off other black and minority business owners.  They explain further in this previous article detailing the charges where federal authorities allege city of Dayton employee Roshan Winburn accepted bribes from people and companies who he certified as minority and disadvantaged businesses without the proper review of their qualifications and leaked confidential information to companies about upcoming demolition contracts.  Also local businessman and former state lawmaker Clayton Luckey is accused of committing fraud by allowing his company, a minority-owned firm, as a front to help another firm win work intended for disadvantaged businesses.  Minority contracting fraud, this article notes, is not a new or rare problem.  In December, one of the city of Dayton's demolition contractors, Evans Landscaping, was convicted in federal court in Cincinnati of using a front company to get work from the city of Cincinnati that was meant for disadvantaged businesses.  The city of Dayton has goals for contracts that are meant to try to ensure small disadvantaged and minority owned businesses are included on projects.  So even though this Democrat official was charged for hurting minority owned businesses, he is somehow trying to argue that it would help minorities if he doesn't go to prison for it.  Former state representative Clayton Luckey, who is headed to prison after pleading guilty to a federal mail fraud charge, says he did nothing wrong and will ask President Donald Trump for a pardon.  A quote from Clayton Luckey reads, President Trump, I need a pardon.  Bottom line, if you care about the minority community, this would be a good example to show a pardon.  They also note how authorities have been going after a ton of other Democrats for corruption in the same area.  Lucky is one of seven people indicted in a federal public corruption probe and the first to be sentenced.  During two news conferences announcing the indictments, an acting FBI special agent in charge of the Cincinnati office said that authorities were investigating, quote, a culture of corruption.  Dayton area politics.  The plea agreement from July revealed how Luckey netted $2,000 from a scheme to defraud the city of Dayton.  He used its disadvantaged business program to help a non-disadvantaged demolition contractor fraudulently complete city contracts between June 2016 and and January 2017.  Quote, He went on to say, quote, That was back in July, and since then, more individuals have been charged in the area for corruption.  Luckey, a Democrat, served 10 years on the Dayton School Board and 7 years in the Ohio House.  In 2012, investigators found that Luckey diverted roughly $130,000 from his campaign account for personal use while serving in the Ohio House.  So lucky this Dayton Democrat has already went to prison for corruption.  In early 2013, he pleaded guilty to six counts of election falsification, one count of money laundering, one count of grand theft and one misdemeanor count of filing a false ethics statement.  Luckey was sentenced to three years in state prison and released in March of 2016.  Luckey also said in this recent interview last week that he might run again for his former statehouse seat.  He resigned from that office before being sent to prison in 2013 on multiple felony convictions, Luckey contends that his state and federal felonies do not preclude him from holding elected office.  On November 15th, Lucky was sentenced to four months in prison, four months of home confinement, and three years of supervised release.  He was convicted of one felony count of mail fraud in a scheme with an unnamed company to defraud the city of Dayton using its disadvantaged business contracting program.  Luckey said he was the victim of a sting and that federal prosecutors investigating public corruption in the Dayton region went after him because he is black.  He pleaded guilty because he didn't believe a black man could get a fair trial, he said, and he thought he would get probation.  I pled to that because that was their story, Lucky said.  When you go to court, it's who has the best story.  Now Lucky is using a similar excuse for his previous conviction.  He said a similar calculation led him to plead guilty in Franklin County Common Pleas Court in 2013 to eight felony counts and one misdemeanor related to illegally diverting up to $130,000 in campaign contributions.  Spending that did not appear to be campaign related included ATM withdrawals at casinos, payment on a home equity line of credit, and purchases at various retailers.  Luckey has also said that he disagrees with attorneys' comments about a culture of corruption in the area.  Luckey responded saying, \"...to have a culture of corruption, you have to have things that have already been happening...\".  not when they come and fictitiously try to make things happen.  Please leave a comment and tell me what you think about anything going on in this case, this Dayton Democrat trying to pressure President Trump into pardoning him.  Will President Trump respond to this request?  What do you think his answer will be if he does?  And again, also interesting.  This seems like it is part of a much wider corruption probe, maybe more arrests to come in the same state as well.
