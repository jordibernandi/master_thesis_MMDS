            "text": "Years ago, I did a spoof recruitment poster for PCSOs.  In it, I described some of their duties as wandering about the streets waving gormously at people like you're on the set of Heartbeat or Trumpton, shelling out tickets to the timid and the weak.  having to run around the custody suite with a 12-foot length of toilet paper stuffed up your arse and lit at one end.  Alright, that last one was a bit of artistic license, but it certainly sounds like the sort of thing a PCSO would do to win favour with the proper coppers, especially someone like PCSO Lusick, who attempted to physically prevent me from leaving the scene of his desperate attempts to give himself an erection.  Despite this, I still maintain that most PCSOs are well-meaning people who don't see themselves as trainee police officers.  Unfortunately, the rest of them, just like Lusick, see PCSO work as a chance to cause as much drama as possible in the hope they'll be noticed at the next police recruitment drive.  They don't seem to accept that the service regards them as cheap labour and that they're deliberately kitted out and misinformed in such a way that they give the public the mistaken belief that they have all the powers of a warranted officer when they don't.  PCSOs are in essence glorified security guards who have no powers of arrest and don't be fooled by the misconception that they can detain you for up to 30 minutes for whatever they want.  They can't.  Detention is arrest, and as I've already stated, PCSOs don't have any powers of arrest.  But the legislator has done everything they can to afford them powers of arrest by proxy, which gives the desired impression that if you don't do whatever they tell you to, they will then summons up someone who can.  To that end, the police cannot resist the urge to pop up like genies from a bottle whenever a PCSO summons them.  And in almost every case, as with mine, they're then likely to involve themselves with a rugby scum of a lawsuit for assault, battery and false imprisonment.  Just to dispel some of the myths about PCSOs, let me point out the following facts about them.  They do not have powers to insist you provide your name and address, except in very narrow cases where they intend to issue you with a penalty notice.  It's not PCSOs or the police's job to find out who people are.  This is not occupied France circa 1943 and anyone who is walking around on foot or riding a pushbike is not required to provide their details or ID upon request.  PCSOs do not carry warrant cards, they carry designation cards, but they are required to show those cards whenever requested.  Any failure to do so is a disciplinary matter and could also potentially void any penalty notice they subsequently issue.  PCSOs. ",
