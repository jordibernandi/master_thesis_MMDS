            "text": "Will Mitch McConnell finish his term?  We shall see.  This was in the comments, I think.  yesterday I read that.  I was like, that's a good question.  Because we keep talking about will Trump finish?  I think he will.  The tarot said no.  Every time somebody draws cards on him finishing his turn, it always comes up no.  I think he just personally will because, you know, the devil is hard to kill.  So, will McConnell finish his turn?  And there is a card in here that reminds me of him.  If I draw it, I think I will lose it, but I probably won't.  because I'm expecting it now.  Will he finish his term?  13, good old lucky number 13.  It's actually my favorite number is 13.  I've never been superstitious.  The only two things I can say superstition-wise is if your left hand itches that means you got money coming and don't put your purse on the floor or you'll always be broke.  that's my only two so the six of pentacles.  so there's a few ways to read that.  so we'll leave it there and see what crosses it.  and this is I can't.  This is the one, too.  Damn it, you.  This is not right.  I can't even do it.  Lord, have mercy.  What the hell?  I can't.  Now my eyes is all watered.  I can't even see Jesus Christ.  Lord, have all the mercy.  I can't do it right now.  I mean, it don't look like it, but it reminds me of him.  I just can't do it right now.  Lord, have mercy.  And it's on the hardship card on top of that.  Okay, gather yourself.  Jesus, I have glasses flying everywhere.  Lord have mercy, I can't do it.  Ugh.  Mm-mm-mm.  How we get it together?  Take a break.  Pause.  Wait a minute.  Oh, Lord.  I can't drink no water.  I'm going to choke to death on camera.  Lord have mercy.  I can't even do it now.  My eyes are itching and burning.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Lord, I took the rings off and everything.  Lord, he's coming undone.  So, there is the Six of Pentacles.  It's not even that funny.  It is funny to me, so whatever.  There you go.  six of pentacles.  collect yourself six of pentacles.  now this could be seen as the okay.  wait a minute because I'm trying to explain something now.  so let me explain it right.  okay so I swear to god.  okay Just read it yourself.  Here you go.  I can't.  Lord.  Jesus.  Lord, have all the mercy.  Okay.  You just have to give.  I can't do it.  Okay.  The Six of Pentacles, as I was saying, while I was so rudely interrupted.  The Six of Pentacles is a card of darkness.  Okay, so here we go.  Six of Pentacles is a card of either sharing, submission, or begging.  So you can share time, money, information.  Or you can beg.  Okay.  for time, money, information, or you could submit to whatever will of the person it is that has the most power.  So when I say we'll see what else, I'm not even going to look at it.  We'll see what else comes up to see how we should read that.  Here you got the hardship.  So I think submission is more of his card and not sharing.  Because there's nothing to share with the hardship card, because that's like you have little to nothing.  So there is no sharing.  And then, the sun.  Which, I guess the deck chooses the reading yet again.  Not the outburst it was trying to bring me.  But so far, this is like the card of illumination.  It could be joy, though.  You know, happiness.  And there's an eclipse.  Mind you, these aren't vampires.  They don't like the sun.  This is an angel.  But it's an eclipse.  And so the sun's dampening or darkening around him.  I don't know if he's going to finish his term.  Justice.  If there's any justice, I think that's the devil on the bottom, too.  Sure is.  So if there's any justice, then he won't, but we'll see what surrounds the justice and we'll see what surrounds the sun here.  All of this surrounds him in the hardship.  The knave of swords.  This is the page of swords.  That's the disappointing news around the dark and sun.  Like, there you go.  Justice.  And then the page of cuts.  so overflowing emotions.  you have new emotions.  you have emotional news.  this is sometimes usually a card.  if you were expecting a baby or something like that it could come through here.  but emotional news and justice.  so i think what's happening is it's either you are going to submit what we want um as far as time, money, information, mostly probably information, submit the things that we need you to cooperate on or get out.  And so there may be a call for his impeachment as well, especially to step down from speaker or what do you call it?  Senate majority leader.  So fear the work, of course, because losing your job is a fear for anybody, right?  And the hopes is the hermit.  So Don't pay attention to what I'm doing.  And mind you, this is the same card, same guy as that hardship card, if I can get it to focus.  But there is a want and a need and a desire for people to sort of stop looking at me, stop looking at what I'm doing.  I'm trying to get away with something.  Environment, time, fate, inevitability.  It marches on and you cannot change it.  Eight of swords.  Powerless.  Exactly.  That's what I just said.  Powerless fate.  You cannot change it.  Powerless.  Hangman.  This is your word of warning.  The new outlook.  Someone is going to really flip your world literally upside down.  So, there may be a call for him to step down.  This is your word of solace.  There's a three of cups.  This is a... This would be your internal partnerships or sort of.  you have like the three of Pentacles could sometimes be read in political readings as dark secret money.  This is like dark secret alliances.  So he knows people in high places that he may not lose his job, but they are going to call for him to step down.  And so I'll walk over that all over.  your greed and your lust for power and more things, your dirty dealings, your crooked behavior.  This couldn't be any more clear.  They're going to ask for him to step down.  I don't know for sure.  If I had to just say based on this, would he finish his term?  The answer is no.  But this is his solace.  So he can take comfort in the fact that he has people in high places.  But the tides are going to be against him, especially since he has a whole other year to try to hold on to that job.  What about Elaine?  Oh, geez.  These people.  You know, I work in a store, and I have this conversation a lot with people, and they say how their card was hacked.  And this was recent.  It actually just happened to someone in my family.  Their card was hacked, and somebody across the world was buying this and this and this with their credit card and all this.  And I just think, what kind of job could you have if you put your real skills to work?  And not skills of stealing, but you know, you understand computers and how they work.  And Mitch McConnell and all of these people and Donald Trump, the good they could do with their influence, because I was talking to somebody else about talents.  and Talent is not just singing, acting, and dancing, and drawing.  There's so many other things to talent.  For one, the person I was talking to, sewing.  I don't know how to sew.  I wish I knew how to sew.  There is a knack for it.  Some people can pick it up and just do it upon looking at somebody else.  do it.  Somebody has to be taught, you know, so forth and so forth.  So some people have a knack for it.  Some people have a knack for oration.  They can speak with the best of them.  Donald Trump has that talent.  This, you know, he says stupid stuff, but he still has the gift of gap.  People still listen to him and they find him entertaining.  Just because we don't doesn't mean there's still not a talent.  So, you know, Mitch McConnell, I don't know what his talent is other than, you know, disgusting me.  But these people could do so much good in the world.  They just did some good in the world, for God's sake.  So Elaine Chao, will she be called to step out, step down?  Interesting.  Five of Cups.  That looks sort of like a person looking at their handiwork after they've done something awful.  You know, like if you killed this person and killed their skull, I'm like, yeah, I did that.  So the Five of Cups, and this does not depict... the cups falling on the ground like most five of cups.  This is a person holding a skull, so I think my interpretation was actually right.  Like they've done something dastardly and they're looking at their handiwork.  Maybe they are content with it, maybe they're not.  But the cups are all in place, but it's usually a part of regret and sorrow because you're crying over spilled milk.  The world... She is a transport secretary, so it has something to do with her job.  So her and her regret does have something to do with her job.  I think here's the thing.  You don't regret what you've done.  You regret that you were caught.  So let's not get that twisted.  Chariots.  Transport.  We're not going through this again.  Lord.  Lord.  Five of Pentacles.  We'll call that Mitch McConnell for right now.  How about that?  But there's some hardship.  Tower.  Oh, wow.  So she's going to be called into question, too.  So both of them might be sitting in the soup kitchen for too long because they might both lose their job.  Hangman for her, too.  Around the Mitch McConnell card.  Fear.  King of Swords.  Hmm, wonder who or what that is.  King of Pentacles is in your hopes, so you hope that Trump can save you, or maybe you are fearful that he won't.  Maybe that's why he shows up both places.  I thought it was him, but we didn't know.  So environment, you've got the darkened sun too, or illumination on your deeds, and you do have the knave of swords.  You see me pull them at random, here they go.  confirmation that what you have been doing behind the scenes is coming out in the light.  this is your word of warning.  literally don't be a fool.  but all these new projects that you've taken on that's also your word of warning your word of solace.  the hermit you have um the hermit is isolation.  it's um A card of not just isolation, but it could be... Never mind.  I failed Mitch McConnell.  Maybe because we just did his and these two popped up for him as well.  But he's somehow in your corner.  Or going to be beneficial to your corner, I should say.  And then the Harvest card.  So you've planted seeds to secure your future, but you are going to be called... out and into question.  your exit is not as clear as McConnell but there is a tower around the transportation card so you may be coming to an abrupt end as well.  wouldn't that be nice happy.  fourth so McConnell is going to be asked to step down or they're going to call on him to resign along with Elaine Cho.  I'll stick to that. ",
