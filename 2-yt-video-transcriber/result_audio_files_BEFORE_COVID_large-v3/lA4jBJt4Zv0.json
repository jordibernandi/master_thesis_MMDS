            "text": "This video is sponsored by Skillshare.  In middle school we used to play this game called set em out where if you did or said something stupid or embarrassing someone would say, set that out.  You had to hold out your hands and let them slap you.  Yeah it's a dumb game but we were 12.  Looking back, it was actually a pernicious game that attempted to enforce a certain standard of social behavior with literal violence.  So those of us with ideas and interests that seemed a little outside of the norm often had to keep our mouths shut.  I've always been on the fence about identifying as a nerd.  I mean, I have a lot of nerdy qualities.  Got a bunch of these things everywhere.  I've been playing World of Warcraft for 10 years.  And to this day, I'm perfectly willing to have an hour-long conversation with you about the philosophy of the Matrix.  But I also lack a lot of the qualities that are stereotypically associated with nerds.  Like, I don't really have social anxiety, really.  Although I'm fairly reserved in person, I'm definitely not an introvert, and I love things like sports and fitness.  Honestly, the concept of being a nerd these days is so blurry that it may not even be much of a thing anymore.  Nerdiness used to be about earnest devotion to esoteric and obscure inclinations.  But these days, many things that are associated with nerds have reached the mainstream.  Almost all of the highest grossing films of all time are sci-fi or fantasy movies.  Some of the most high profile public figures are people with careers in science and technology.  And it seems like every other week I find a video of some famous celebrity playing Dungeons and Dragons.  Now there are some nerdy subcultures that have yet to break out into the front lines of pop culture, but whereas nerds in the past were often ostracized because of their peculiar tastes, these days you can't really justify turning your nose up at a kid for dressing up like a giant fox when you just got done watching an anime about a kid possessed by a giant fox.  All of this ambivalence about being a nerd was amplified for me as a young black kid who grew up in lower income neighborhoods.  I think being cool and popular is a concern for kids of all races, but for black kids, especially black boys, it was kind of do or die.  I'm T1J.  Follow me.  Real quick, I'd like to give a big shout out to my patrons.  None of these videos would be possible without the support I get on Patreon from you amazing folks, including people like Dan Tower, Daniel R. Murphy, and Corey Schimpf.  If you head to my Patreon page, you'll see that I've set up a new goal.  I want to try to move back to making two videos a month, but I'll definitely need some production help to do that if I want the quality of the videos to not suffer.  That includes more equipment, space, and human effort, all of which cost money.  So if you're interested in that, consider supporting.  So when I think of black men that I admired growing up, it was people like Denzel Washington, Michael Jordan, and Eddie Murphy.  Dudes who were hip and talented and fashionable and seemed to have it all.  Rarely was I exposed to black personalities who were celebrated specifically because of their intellect or unique interests.  In black media back then, the male protagonists were always cool and confident and street smart.  Definitely not nerds.  Even in non-black media, black characters were often added as a source of practical wisdom or shrewd humor.  When we did experience nerdy black characters, they were always the butt of every joke.  The fact that they were nerds was unambiguously a character flaw.  Of course, there were nerdy white characters who were made fun of as well, but there's such a higher variety of white characters to choose from that you could easily find just as many characters any nerd could be proud of.  You ever notice how one of the main differences between the Jurassic World movies and the Jurassic Park movies is that they replaced all the nerds?  I love this movie.  The good guy's a nerd, the bad guy's a nerd, this guy?  There are just no black movies with this many nerds in it.  Jurassic Park's interesting because it actually has a black nerd in it, Chief Engineer Ray Arnold, played by Samuel L. Jackson.  He's neurotic and sometimes antisocial, but he's shown to be highly intelligent and invested in his work, and it's not played as a negative thing.  But it's probably not a mistake that the role was given to Jackson, an actor known by this point for playing characters who are pretty unambiguously not nerds.  If it was Urkel at that computer instead of Sam Jackson, it probably would have had less impact.  There are other complex examples as well, like the character Dwayne Wayne in the great sitcom A Different World.  He's kind of a nerd.  He's a math whiz who got a perfect SAT score and he wears these dorky glasses.  But beyond that, he's confident and handsome and popular and he sits in chairs backwards.  So, you know, he's cool.  By the way, a while back, I tweeted about A Different World and got like no response, which leads me to believe that a lot of y'all white folks have not watched this amazing show.  Go watch it.  Fuck Pam and Jim, Dwayne and Whitley for life.  It's a great show.  I love it.  But nevertheless, as a black kid in the 90s, it was never a compliment to be compared to Ray Arnold or Dwayne Wayne, much less Carlton Banks or Steve Urkel.  Both the middle school and high school I went to were made up of 90% black people, so I don't have much of a reference for what it was like in other kinds of schools.  In TV and movies, they always talked about the different cliques that hang out together in school, like the jocks, the goths, the stoners, etc.  One of the cliques is almost always the nerds or the geeks.  And even though the nerds are stereotypically bullied by the jocks and generally socially inept, they still seem either unwilling or unable to alter their lifestyles and dispositions.  At my schools, though, this just wasn't really a thing.  We had cliques and friend groups, but being a willing nerd was just not conceivable for the most part.  Not everyone tried to be popular per se, but most everyone at least tried to be cool and fit in.  Not everyone succeeded, but they tried.  Things that were considered socially deviant were usually not displayed or talked about openly.  There were no goths or stoners or geeks at my schools.  There were of course people who displayed those characteristics and participated in those activities, but it was never on full display.  It wasn't really a part of people's public identity.  Being a black kid at a black school, at least in my experience, required a certain level of social competence, regardless of your specific interests.  And there were kids who struggled to do it, and they were usually ostracized for it.  The difference is, they didn't usually have a clique to turn to after.  There were just individuals branded as just a little too weird.  I think a lot of this again goes back to popular media.  Media that targets black people historically never celebrated typically nerdy things.  When I was in school, all the little boys emulated rappers and comedians and athletes because that's all we saw.  That was our definition of cool.  And it was cool.  I still love Bone Thugs in Harmony and the movie Friday, just like I did back then.  But I also liked Magic the Gathering and Geometry.  Just didn't bring those up as much.  And I think a lot of us had unique interests like that, but there was just no social space back then to fully explore and share them.  Just didn't seem correct for a black kid.  But maybe there's a reason for that.  A 2007 New York Times article described nerdiness as a state of being hyper-white, literally defining it in direct contrast to behaviors and traits that are typically associated with Black Americans.  The idea being that a lot of what makes white people seem trendy and popular in America are often things that they appropriate from Black people.  According to that aforementioned article, by cultivating an identity perceived as white to the point of excess, nerds deny themselves the aura of normality that is usually one of the perks of being white.  So this all seems glib and it's obviously messy and generalized, but I think we all kind of get it intuitively, at least in America.  That's why there's so many movies about super square white people learning how to be cool from some black person who serendipitously entered their lives.  In pop culture, Uncool is often defined as the absence of blackness.  When black comedians back in the day did bits about white people, they were always basically hyper white, and they were usually goofy and out of touch, and often directly compared to black people who were depicted as more savvy and assertive.  I want to tell you the truth.  You're just not cutting it.  Tom, what are you saying?  Steve Harvey's voicing two separate characters here, but they have the same voice and personality.  It's just his stand-in voice for all white people.  And I think I internalized that as a kid.  Because at a black school, things that were considered nerdy and uncool were not just things that were unique and obscure.  obscure, but also simply things that were associated with white people.  Things like Dungeons and Dragons, sure, but also things that in any other context would probably be cool, like being a fan of rock music.  I can't find the clip, but I remember watching this black comedian with friends back in the day that was making fun of different types of rock music, and one of the bits was clearly parodying Nirvana, which I knew because I discovered Nirvana in high school and they quickly became my favorite band.  Specifically, they were making fun of how Kurt Cobain's verses were always mellow and dreary, while the choruses were usually screaming.  And it was funny, but I kind of wanted to tell my friends, yeah, the sludgy sound of grunge is designed to mirror the ugliness and depravity of the real world, while the loud sections reflect the angst and anger the artist feels.  towards it, but I decided against it because I didn't really feel like getting my hands slapped.  The funny thing is, in hindsight, the comedian was clearly familiar enough with Nirvana to parody a song well enough for me to recognize it.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were a fan themselves.  For many black kids back then, being a nerd was just not an option, at least not in public, because it would mean betraying our own blackness.  In fact, a common thing that happens to nerdy black kids is a questioning of their blackness.  They get accused of acting white, or wanting to be white, or are called Oreos, black on the outside but white on the inside.  The plight of the black nerd was confusing and frustrating in a wholly unique way.  Because for black people, being a nerd isn't about wanting to be white.  In fact, most black people I know who identify as nerds still do things like listen to black music and use black slang and follow black trends.  They usually have a lot of pride in their upbringing and background.  But when society and pop culture defines nerdiness as the lack of blackness, that puts black nerds in a very awkward spot.  Now these days, prototypical black nerds are much more prominent in society and media than before.  Black people and black culture are of course as diverse and varied as any other group of humans, and we're finally starting to see that not only reflected, but also celebrated.  I don't think it's because of any specific reverence to Black people, though.  I think it's more due to the increased acceptance of traditionally nerdy interests in general.  And because it's now easier to find public figures and influential characters who don't fit the one-dimensional stereotypical mold of what it means to be Black, I think that encourages more young people to embrace their unique interests and share them with the world without fear.  That's why I often feel awkward calling myself a nerd.  I spent so much time resisting the classification, and by the time I became willing to accept it, it seemed to have begun losing its meaning.  We're all unique, and we all like different things.  And there's really no existing profile of what it means to be or not be a nerd anymore.  When people say, I'm a nerd, I really think they're holding on to outdated definitions.  You might think, well, I love video games and anime, so I guess I'm a nerd.  But fucking everybody plays video games and watches anime.  Some people cling onto the nerd idea in a sort of contrarian way, because it seems better to be different than to conform to the masses.  But what those people need to realize is that we're all different.  You and I might have a couple interests in common, but we also probably diverge on other things.  According to a recent Reddit thread, high school cliques in America still exist, but have become so varied and contain a lot of overlap.  The brainy kids might be fashionable and hip, while the jocks might be hardcore gamers who get straight A's.  And they also might not.  And don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of pressure for young black kids to be cool.  But I think what's cool is no longer based on the stereotypical ideas of blackness that I grew up with.  I'm sure there are still problems and bad ideas out there, but the trend seems to be that people are becoming more open to behaviors and media that may have in the past gotten you shoved into a locker.  So I hope that trend continues.  That's just me though.  What do you think?  Thank you for watching and thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video.
