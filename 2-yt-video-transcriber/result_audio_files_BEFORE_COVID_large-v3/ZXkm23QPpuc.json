            "text": "Gentlemen, excellent to be back with you on MGTOW Money.  Today's topic, three ways women screw you at work.  Before we get to that, thanks to the ongoing support from the Patreon investors in this channel.  And thank you to those men who bought me a cup of coffee based upon the last video via Bitcoin, PayPal.  Guys, thank you.  I sincerely appreciate it as well as I do sincerely appreciate most of the comments that you left me.  By the way, this is important.  Check out today's photos.  This is from a women's march that was throughout the United States a couple of weeks ago.  And I'll explain in a few moments at the end here about why those photos are important.  So again, check out the photos.  Also, a commenter had mentioned an excellent book.  I should have mentioned this book in the past.  It is outstanding.  See the video description today of this excellent book, The Millionaire Fast Lane by M.J.  DeMarco.  He's the real deal.  He actually made a ton of money.  And needless to say, he's got some great actionable ideas in this book.  All right, on to this.  You men are being screwed.  You hear me?  And specifically, you're being screwed by women.  Now, let me provide some context because this is important.  I'm speaking as a man who worked in a corporate environment for well over 20 years.  I'm further speaking as a man who worked in a very small business.  up to I spent several years working for companies that had tens of thousands of employees.  Furthermore, I speak as someone who worked in various cities throughout the United States.  So therefore, I do think that I have some degree of experience to speak about this.  Women are screwing you over.  And this applies not only to those men that are in a corporate environment, but also to men that are in any type of workplace.  Because inevitably, regardless of the type of workplace, you do have women around.  If nothing else, you probably have a receptionist that's a woman.  Again, of course, I'm assuming that you're not working by yourself or something like that.  All right, so here's how women are screwing you.  And here's some ideas on how to deal with it.  One, women are going to be promoted over you.  So despite all factors being equal, despite everything being just the same between you and a woman, you can be virtually assured that a woman will be promoted over you.  Well, you say, well, that's not fair.  You're right.  It's not fair.  But welcome to 2019.  That is the way of the world, men.  I speak from personal experience without going into all the details, but I have seen with my own eyes and happened to me furthermore.  where women will get promoted under circumstances just to make sure that they have a job.  So, for example, if your company has some sort of downsizing layoff,  etc.,  and there's a promotion involved, they actually will promote that person despite their incompetence, etc.  Two, speaking of layoffs.  women are going to be the last ones that a company lays off.  they are a quote unquote.  if you will protected class because of their oh that's right their sex.  companies today are very sensitive to any type of potential lawsuit.  They are very concerned of women potentially saying, hey, I was laid off only because I was a woman.  It's becoming increasingly difficult for women to be laid off, even if huge layoffs throughout large organizations.  Again, speaking from my own experience, based upon what I've seen, regardless of how talented or untalented a woman is I can tell you for a fact if it comes down to between you and a woman you are gone my friend.  next women sleeping their way to the top.  you know there's a cliche about.  women have risen to the top just because of their relations with the man above them.  Again, that's not a cliche.  I speak from fact.  I speak from what I've observed.  I speak from speaking to other men at other companies, etc.  This is far more common than you can possibly ever imagine.  Furthermore, this also aids... in their ability to stay within that protected class that I was just talking about.  As you can imagine, if you are a supervisor of a woman and she is providing you some sort of favors, if you will, on the side, you, of course, are going to put a bubble around her, a protection, and make sure that she is protected.  Again, I speak from experience here, men.  When it comes down to between who are we going to get rid of, who are we going to let go, who are you going to promote,  etc.,  I can virtually guarantee you, you are going to be the loser.  Lastly, most importantly, men, today, as you may or may not be aware, especially in large companies, the HR department, what's called the human resources department, is loaded.  It is 9 out of 10%.  women.  Now, why is this important?  That HR department in many opportunities is going to be your first point that when you're trying to get your foot into any sort of company, they are going to be your first point of contact.  They are going to be the filter that you're going to have to go through before you even have a chance to get an interview, multiple interviews, et cetera, depending upon the organization.  Again, going back to what I said before, All things being equal, we have two candidates, one woman, one man, all things being equal.  Who do you think is going to get the interview?  Who do you think is going to have the best shot to get through that female HR person ultimately to get that potential job?  All right, men.  So how do you deal with this type of thing?  Here's a few ideas for you to overcome these types of obstacles.  Listen up carefully.  One, get into a job where you are very valuable, where you've got some sort of unique skill, talent, knowledge, whatever.  In other words, you have some particular knowledge of a particular programming code, for example, with computers, or you're an outstanding salesperson and you've built up a tremendous track record.  Some way that you can set yourself apart.  You don't want to be generic and You want to be a specialist.  You want to be different.  You want to be the guy, the go-to person on some particular subject matter within the company where they feel like, hey, we can't get rid of this guy.  Two, you want to avoid the HR department, especially again, when you're looking to first get your foot in the door, if at all possible.  Older men, you already know what I'm talking about.  But if you're a younger man and you've got really no contacts, and I didn't have any contacts, ideally try to work through your friends, your family, etc.  If it does come down to it where you don't have any choice, ideally, in my opinion, my experience, work through an HR department, but only do so with a company that is fast growing.  In other words, they are on a serious hiring spree.  They are hiring lots and lots of people.  you will see the odds more in your favor getting your foot in the door to a fast-growing company in that particular case.  Lastly, always watch your back with women at your workplace.  Again, I don't care what kind of company it is.  See my prior video that I did with some very specific ideas on this.  But let me just say this clearly.  It takes one single accusation.  And that's all that I said.  Accusation men, you will be gone.  You will be history in minutes.  You will be out of a job.  They will say sayonara and you'll never be heard from again.  They won't think twice.  Finishing.  Back to the photos, man.  Again, take a look.  You notice anything unusual about those photos?  You probably don't because as you can see, there's women in the cucks.  I mean, the men that are with them.  But do you, the reason why I bring this up is these men and women that you see in these photos are the same people that are in your workplace.  You see them all the time, those same types of people.  And this is where you're not getting it.  They have.  I hate you.  I've mentioned this before.  Do you really think you've got any chance of doing anything great in your work and really doing something unless you're setting yourself apart?  Men, your best opportunity... To walk off the plantation, if that really is truly your goal, is to start accumulating FU money today, right now, following the actionable steps that I've laid out in over 160 videos on this channel.
