            "text": "We're at George Washington University, right in the heart of  D.C.,  defending innocent life.  Looks like they just put up a My Body, My Choice sign in the window.  So we got a little bit of opposition forming across the street.  Well, the right to life.  A man and a woman can talk about it.  Insults are an argument.  Have you ever been raped?  No.  You know, your argument is against abortion, right?  Which I understand where you're coming from.  You know, you think that you're protecting life or the unborn child has rights.  Even up to the point of conception.  But for a woman who is poor or unable to take care of that child and decides not to get an abortion, obviously she's not going to be able to take care of it.  It's going to have a worse life, right?  It could... So does quality of life determine whether or not somebody should be able to live or not?  Well, I think some would argue, yeah.  I'm asking you, how would you argue?  Yes.  The quality of life.  So who determines the quality of life?  I think that if you have a family structure that's supporting you, that you're going to... I don't mean to interrupt you guys.  This is my only issue.  You guys can not block the sidewalk, okay?  But I'm saying, which of you men are going to adopt those children so they have a better life?  Well, I mean, there are, regardless of whether we personally would do something, the fact is that there are plenty of couples willing to adopt.  That's not an issue.  I don't have to actually do something to support a principle that I believe.  The women who die because they cannot carry the child because they are 14 and cannot safely deliver it, is that murder?  Does that fall of self-life matter more than a living person?  They're both living people.  Then why does one matter more than the other?  Because you're the one who's saying a woman is more important than the baby.  Yes.  So you're the one who's saying one is more important than the other.  The baby is not a baby yet.  The baby is not a baby yet?  Nope.  It is a ball of cells.  It is a zygote.  It is an embryo.  So you don't think that people should have sex before marriage?  Okay, so this is where this really comes from.  Oh, it's a religious thing.  Okay, that makes sense.  Beautiful country, we have a thing called separation of church and state.  Your views on God do not control my life and they never will.  Do not dictate what a person can or can't do.  Are you aware that the Satanic Temple calls abortion one of their rights?  Hail Satan!  Not everybody is a Christian.  Are you a Satanist?  You know what?  They're better than you are.  I've worked with them before, actually.  I've talked with the Church of Satan.  They're very nice people.  And they actually take care of their people and are better advocates for human life than you are.  I have worked with them in the past.  Yes.  To separate church and state from people like you.  What the f*** is that?  Hold on.  Hold on.  You mean second trimester abortion?  Stop sparing and stop hailing Satan.  It's not going to get us there.  St.  Michael!  Ray Frost!  Mary Most Pure!  Ray Frost! ",
