And that is a painful process.  In Stephen Hassan's book, Combating Cult Mind Control, he refers to this as unfreezing and freezing, where you take someone's personality and you treat it like a block of ice.  And you unfreeze it so that it's malleable.  And you shape it into something that you want.  And then you refreeze it in that form.  And so that's what happens as a missionary, as a young missionary.  Your personality is taken.  It's broken down.  it's reshaped to be in the image of Mormonism, of the Mormon ideal, and then that reshaping is a painful process.  Now, from the eyes of a Mormon, that is actually, you know, from their perspective, they understand that process too, except for they think that is a sacred, beautiful experience of surrendering your will to Jesus Christ, that kind of thing.  But in actual fact, your personality is being eroded.  Your authentic identity is being replaced by a cult identity. ",
