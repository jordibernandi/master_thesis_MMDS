            "text": "So at first we had Hurricane Irma and two weeks later we had Hurricane Maria.  We were all okay, God protected us, but yeah, the island was very in bad shape, was in a really bad shape.  And my grandma received a call from my aunt.  like, telling her, like, hey, you should come live with us, just for a few months until, like, everything got back to normal.  And, like, we said yes.  We decided to stay and live here and finish school with LUOA my senior year.  My professors emailed me presenting themselves and that if I needed help with anything, I could reach out to them.  So anytime I have a doubt with an assignment, I talked to them.  I didn't understand the instructions.  And they answered really fast.  And I can understand and finish my assignments.  LUA has helped me with organization.  And I have my own agenda, like sending emails, being more active.  That definitely has helped me. ",
