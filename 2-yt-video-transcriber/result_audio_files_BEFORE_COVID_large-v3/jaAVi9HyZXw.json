It's a complex theory, but there's a few tools that were developed to analyze narrative materials.  And the summary of it all is basically that there's the Greco-Roman timeline, which is the backbone to history timeline.  Pretty much that was developed around the 15th to 16th centuries.  Following that, the next two major studies were Egyptian studies and Indian studies that came out of that and into the Near East and Asiatic studies spawning out of there.  But pretty much it's based off of this Greek-Roman timeline.  And it's really heavily based around the Byzantine structure and pretty much when you analyze the information that we have, there are parallels throughout these different segments of these kingdoms that are eerily similar.  Statistically, it's almost impossible that this would happen over and over again unless somebody had an original document and had made copies of it and sent it out.

The claims people make about, oh, especially like biblical archaeology and stuff like that.  People come up with all kinds of stuff to make things.  And that's where you get some of the crazy stuff.
