So let me be very clear.  I made no apologies to anybody that when I was a young man, before I was elected to anything, I opposed the war in Vietnam.  And I know what that war did to my generation.  And when I was a member of the House, I helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq because I knew that Cheney and Bush and these other folks were lying about weapons of mass destruction. ",

And as a senator, I'm proud that I helped for the first time in 45 years to utilize the War Powers Act to get the United States out of an unauthorized war in Yemen.  Unfortunately, after passing in the House and the Senate, Trump vetoed that legislation.  And I'll tell you something, that right now, I'm going to do everything that I can to prevent a war with Iran.  Because if you think the war in Iraq was a disaster, my guess is that the war in Iran would be even worse.  So let's work together and prevent that war.  If people want to criticize me for that, go for it.  That's okay.  I don't apologize to anybody.  Thank you. ",
