            "text": "Okay, let's touch briefly on the JQ, which to me is ridiculous to phrase something as the JQ as if there's a question that needs to be answered.  But let me just tell you my stance.  I'm pro-Israel completely, absolutely pro-Jewish.  have just great personal experiences with Jews.  I see them as an absolute non-problem in the world, exactly the opposite.  They contribute disproportionately.  They're brilliant, as you know, their IQ scores, cultural, et cetera, et cetera.  Why are people obsessed?  Is it just this thing of antisemitism that we cannot rid this earth of?  What is the deal?  Now, I recognize that Jews are disproportionately on the left and the far left, 78% of Jews voted for Barack Obama and 71% voted for Hillary Clinton.  Is it just that?  Is it just that they are more vocal and represented in media?  Why do people scapegoat them so much? ",

            "text": "You'd have to ask them, of course.  But it is undeniable that Jews have been disproportionately represented in those ideological movements that have been used to undermine the legitimacy of any kind of white racial consciousness.  You can go all the way back to Franz Boas and his... He and his disciples were going into all the sociology and the anthropology departments all throughout the United States, teaching this egalitarian message.  Now, I think there is a strain among certainly secular Jews to believe that they will be safest and that they will be least likely to attract attention in non-homogeneous societies.  that we have to concede that Jews have a certain clannishness about them.  They maintain their separateness, whether religious or ethnic, and intermarriage.  And this kind of cohesion is less noticeable and less likely to attract unpleasant attention if it isn't a society in which there is a mixture of all different kinds of people where everything goes.  And so I think that is one of the reasons why Jews have encouraged the creation of multicultural, multiracial states because they will feel safer in such states.  In fact, there have been a number of Jews who have made that quite explicit.  But this is not to say that, and again, I should not try to speak for those who take that attitude towards Jews, but there is, as you point out, a preponderance of Jewish leftism and a preponderance of the Jewish firepower that has gone into delegitimizing someone who would take my position.  the strongest critics the fiercest most determined and the ones who seem to require the least sleep are are jews.  now they're not explicitly jews but uh people notice this and they don't like it.  now as far as the way as far as the way jews have organized israel.  israel is in some respects so the ideal ethno state it.  it started with an idea an idea that jews had they deserved a homeland.

If that 25% were French Gentiles and a few Asians, it would be a completely different 25%.  But Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state.  And I find it fascinating that American politicians... who will endorse the Jewishness of Israel would be the first to turn right around and say that someone like me is basically a Nazi because I want a European America.

I think more and more Jews are recognizing that to the extent that they promote these kind of anti-white ideologies, if they say, well, whoops, I'm a minority too.  This rising tide of African or Hispanic color is not going to say, hey, you're a white buddy.  I think more and more Jews are recognizing this.  And Jews are well represented in the ranks of people who understand the biology of race and IQ, for example.  Jews are going to be overrepresented in every intellectual endeavor because of their high IQ.  And American Renaissance has always had the Jewish participants and collaborators and men who consider themselves absolutely part of the West.  and the idea that somehow because jews in the aggregate have promoted some of these uh what you could call anti-white ideologies that all jews are the enemy of the white race.  i think that's just crazy.  we need all the allies we can get and some of them are going to be very going to be excellent you know.
