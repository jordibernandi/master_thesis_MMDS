DC still loves me though.  That's my number one thing.  Okay, it looks like we have an officer a couple of officers on site and Apparently I can't stand in grass and get the cops called.  I love advocating for abortion.  My uterus loves advocating for abortion.  How am I infringing on your fucking free speech?  Are we stopping you from talking?  I can't hear y'all.  When I say plant, you say parenthood.  Plant.  Parenthood.  Plant.  Parenthood.  When I say aborted, You say fetuses.  Aborted.  Fetuses.  Aborted.  Fetuses.  I had an abortion.  Shout out to Planned Parenthood.  For all the women out there, I am so sorry that you have decided to succumb to the system of patriarchy.  Your mothers betrayed you.
