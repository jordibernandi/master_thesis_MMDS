            "text": "So Karl Marx is a German philosopher and economist.  He lives from 1818 to 1883.  Spent most of his youth in Germany where he studied almost on the trajectory to become a university professor, but he was also a political radical, so he was always fleeing governments that were trying to chase off threats to their own interests.  system of power.  So he migrates across Europe and eventually settles in London, England, which is kind of his point of refuge.  It's also where he does most of his writing.  So across his career, he's primarily a pamphleteer interested in the condition of the working man.  So he's a labor radical that's trying to devise and a system of political thought to basically better the condition of the working man.  And this leads him to becoming a founding figure in the modern communist movement.  Partners up with Frederick Engels, who's a fellow radical revolutionary from Germany that also migrates to England.  Engels basically becomes his patron.  He's from a wealthier family that has a manufacturing factory in Manchester.  So he's able to use that as kind of a subsidy for Marx as the intellectual driver.  And then over the course of his career, he produces several major works of labor theory, anti-capitalist theory, basic theory of socialism.  So the two best known are the Communist Manifesto which is in 1848.  It's a co-authored work with Engels that basically tries to lay out a groundwork for executing a revolutionary socialist ascendant.  And then his more academic-y intellectual work is Capital or Das Kapital, which is published in German in 1867.  And this becomes more of the theoretical framework for the Marxist system. ",

The problem is the accumulation of wealth by certain rich people in the factories.  And he said the wealth is going to continue to go into the hands of a few people and they're gonna get rich and richer at the expense of the poor people.  So he proposed taking away the means of production away from the capitalists and workers of the world are then going to own everything, so we're gonna throw off our chains, the slavery of this relationship with the capitalists.  That was kind of this romantic message that a lot of people thought, wow, That's great.  No more slavery.  I mean, I don't have to be having a boss anymore.  We can be all working together.  We can be cooperating.  And it's this very appealing, seductive message that you can look around the world and say, oh, there's certain problems.  Now I know the solution.  Isn't this going to be great? ",

The expropriated would expropriate the expropriators and so on.  So there would be this shift in history. ",
