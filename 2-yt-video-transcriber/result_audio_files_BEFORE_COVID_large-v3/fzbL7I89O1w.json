            "text": "I'm Glinda Hetape Marcelo.  I'm from Iloilo, but I've been residing in Bangkok working for 20 or more years.  I don't know if it's destiny or God's will maybe brought me here because I've been mentioning this with somebody else.  I don't think this is just a coincidence.  I've been here for a month now and I don't know what the problem is.  Maybe this is the reason why God is so good.  Normally I'm a YouTube viewer and of course being a Christian for longest time I've been watching Christian related things and then this video of God culture regarding Ophir for that matter under Solomon's gold series and I have heard of that from from from this video about the filipinos.  being an old fw for 20 years you would say maybe that i've been enculturated of the country that i've been in But I don't think that happened to me.  The fervent love of country had grown so much in me because I missed Philippines so much.  And when I first heard what had been said in God Culture that Philippines is of fear, oh my God, I really cried.  I cried rivers.  I told myself, is this the hope that my country is going to?  have the one that God promised for the Filipinos?  and it just elevated my interest in God's culture.  My experience today in this conference.  It's rather humbling.  I don't know why.  I thought I am excited coming here because at last I'm going to have a face to see behind God's culture.  But it's really humbling.  Actually, I'm very talkative, but I'm just so quiet all alone.  And maybe God, Yehua, is touching my heart of what my real purpose is.  Because all through these years that I've been a Christian, Actually I don't know what really God's will for my life.  And I think God has been speaking to me all this day, all through this day.  So I think I know what I would like to do with it.  My Christian views, I don't think they have changed.  Actually, God culture has enhanced my relationship with God, with Jesus, but only in a perspective of being a Filipino.  You know, we Filipinos outside of the country working always feel that we are not enough.  And this gives us God culture's videos and YouTube gives us a dignity that only God can give.  And this is what I felt.  I felt that I am somebody.  I am somebody with God's purpose.  Pinoys, I think this is our time.  And this is our time also to be closer to Him.  to know exactly what we have to do and what God would want us to do.  I thought that I really exactly know what I have to do.  With the work that I have done in Bangkok, with the experiences I had, it's the best that I can contribute to what we are as a race, a culture, country, and as a Christian.  I have heard it by myself, and I was really surprised.  Although, I don't know, I felt that deep inside I know about this.  No one had, it has never been discussed, but I don't know, when I heard it, I know that it's true right away.  It really touched my heart.  And, you know, I can't tell or say that I am kind of an intellectual which doesn't believe in things easily.  But this one, the culture video that I have watched the first time really touched my heart and I know that this is the truth.  So if you are watching me, I'm a Filipino.  And God is asking us to do this.  This is our responsibility, our duty.  So I would hope that you would give the God Culture videos a chance and watch them so you would know who you are too.  Maybe more of the revelations.  I would like to see more of revelations because that's the prophecy.  That is what we are.  That is our goal.  That is the direction that we have to take.  And we would never ever know what we should be in this prophecy if we don't know a little about it.  We are Pinoys.  We are here on earth for a reason. ",
