            "text": "This week, Meghan McCain broke down and cried on The View.  Now, it wasn't even really clear what she was crying about.  It appeared to be her fear of Ilhan Omar and, I mean, rising anti-Semitism, but somehow she was putting that on Ilhan Omar.  Now, before I even get to that clip, I want to show you a clip that really is not being shared around too much, and that's the clip before Meghan McCain had her breakdown, and I think it's Part of the reason that Meghan McCain was triggered and began crying because Sonny Hostin completely eliminated any idea that Ilhan Omar is anti-Semitic.  So let me play this clip and then I think you'll have a better idea of what exactly the argument is and why Meghan McCain had nowhere else to go but use her tears.  Watch. ",

            "text": "So the comment she said was, so for me, I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.  And I want to ask, why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the NRA, of fossil fuel industries, or big pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobby that is influencing policy?  That's what she said.  And people say that that is anti-Semitic.  When we had Barry Weiss on as an expert in what is anti-Semitic and what isn't, I asked her, is it okay to talk about Israel's policies and not be called anti-Semitic?  And she said yes.  She said where it crosses the line is when you say that Israel does not have the right to exist.  that that is when it crosses the line.  Now, Omar has never suggested that Israel does not have the right to exist.  So, to me, it seems to me that Republicans are trying to use this as a wedge issue.  And I think that, you know, this selective outrage is kind of Crazy, because I don't think that the Republicans have moral high ground here.  It seems like Democrats are upset too, though.  I think that Kevin McCarthy has used these anti-Semitic tropes.  I think that Jim Jordan just recently tweeted this.  Against Tom Steyer.  And remember that Ilhan Omar in the West Virginia Republican Party just had this huge poster superimposed with her face with 9-11 terrorists.  And I haven't heard any outrage about that coming from the Republican Party.  So, and all that to say is that this selective outrage, and I will tell you, I take this very personally as a woman of color who has, you know, been the subject of so much bigotry.  And what a lot of people don't know is that my grandfather is Jewish.  He is a Sephardic Jew.  And so I have... You know, my family members have received a lot of bigotry.  So, you know, I've experienced firsthand in my family anti-Semitism and bigotry for being black.  And so I just, this whole, you know, thing, I think it's just a distraction. ",

I mean, she is such a child.  It's embarrassing.  The fact that she's still on this panel.  I mean, on this show.  Look... You will notice, if you watch the show, if you watch these clips, it's very rare for the audience to applause Meghan McCabe.  Everybody watching knows she is a trust fund baby.  They all know she's crazy.  They all know that she doesn't really understand anything.  They all know that she is only on this show.  She is only a host on The View because her father was a senator and her mother is a multimillionaire.  Meghan McCain has been handed everything.  She has no talent, no skill, no knowledge.  There is no reason why she should be on this show except for the fact that she is privileged and was born into wealth and her father was a senator.  That is the only reason at all.  for her for anybody to know who she is.  but one more comment before i go to megan mccain crying.  um i want to uh.  so sonny hostin here talks about how uh.  barry weiss who was on the show uh earlier on in the week said how.  uh yes you can be critical of israel but uh as soon as you are you know anti-zionist as soon as you believe that no israel doesn't have a right to exist then you are anti-semitic.  That's not true.  That's just, that's complete crap.  Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism.  It's simply, so... The more that this whole situation is unfolding between Israel and Palestine, the more and more people are recognizing that a one-state solution with human rights is the only answer here.  That Palestinians and the Jewish people have to be able to live in peace together in a one state.  I mean, when you have the Israeli government continuing with their settlements, encroaching on Palestinian land over and over and over, I mean, at this point, they have taken over essentially almost all of the Palestinian land.  So you have to get to a point now where you understand, look, this doesn't make any sense.  We have to be able to live together, live humanely in a one state.  It can happen.  Clearly, it's going to take a lot of time to be able to get people to soften up or something like that in the region.  But that is ultimately what needs to happen.  That's how you have peace in Palestine.  in Israel and with the Palestinian people, because there is no two-state solution here anymore, not with the way the right-wing Israeli government has been acting.  Now, let me go to Meghan McCain crying.  So you may have already seen this clip.  I'm going to play it again.  And I'm also going to play some reactions or play a reaction to this as well as some Twitter reactions.  So there's lots to enjoy here.  But this clip is a little ridiculous.  So feel free to fast forward if you can't take it.  But here it is. ",

            "text": "All right.  So you got a little taste there of what I was talking about in terms of the applause.  Sonny Hostin gets an applause.  Meghan McCain got no applause.  But anyways, so a few things here.  First of all, this comment from Meghan McCain... I verge on being a Zionist.  You only verge on being a Zionist?  So you don't think that Israel should... You don't think that the Jewish people should have their own state?  But you verge on thinking that?  I don't think she knows what Zionism is.  So it's, I mean, that comment was kind of weird.  I didn't really understand the way she phrased it.  Maybe she just, I don't know, phrased it incorrectly.  But the way she phrased it, it sounded like she didn't know what Zionism was.  Clearly, she is a Zionist.  I don't know where the debate here is.  So she also says she's scared it would be politicized.  She is politicizing it by not recognizing that the hate crimes that she is so scared of have risen not because of Ilhan Omar, but because of the fucking president and his dog whistling to white nationalism, to neo-Nazis.  I mean, how is this not obvious?  Like, this... Ilhan Omar... Before anyone knew who Ilhan Omar was... She, Ilhan Omar was a state rep in Minnesota.  Before anyone knew who Ilhan Omar was, before she won her seat in Congress, hate crimes were already rising.  Anti-Semitism was already rising.  It has nothing at all to do with Ilhan Omar.  So that, again, this selective outrage is, it shows you how fraudulent Meghan McCain's tears are.  Now, I want to show some responses here.  So this is from a reaction from Glenn Greenwald saying it took the U.S.  240 years to elect its first black Muslim woman to Congress.  And it took 11 weeks before someone went on national TV to literally cry about how scared she made them.  But she's friends with Joe Lieberman, so it's personal for her.  This from Sean King.  She finds Ilhan Omar very scary in the same way that barbecue Becky was terrified of black men barbecuing in the park.  We've crossed over into peak white fragile ridiculousness at the point in which a non-Jewish white woman is saying she finds this very scary.  That comment from Sean King is my favorite because it really properly frames it.  There is no reason here at all to be crying on national TV over Ilhan Omar.  It's just as ridiculous as Barbecue Becky and a number of the other white women that have called the police on black men or whatever.  I mean, so the case that Sean King's talking about, if you're not aware of it, there is this meme of Barbecue Becky.  This is a lady that called the cops on... on black people barbecuing in the park.  This is what the problem is.  You have white people scared of somebody that looks different that is also Muslim being in government.  That's all this is about.  That's why Meghan McCain was crying.  She doesn't even realize that's the reason, but that is clearly the reason.  Now, let me show you one more reaction.  This is Mehdi Hassan on MSNBC with Chris Hayes.  And I think he also makes some fantastic points here. ",

This resolution they're putting forward now on Thursday says really important things about the rise in the number of anti-Semitic attacks, the outrageous statements about Jews, discrimination, hate.  Ilhan Omar has nothing to do with any of that.  She's not expressed any hate, animus or discrimination.  And, you know, she's been on the receiving end of the hate.  She is a Republican.  party in West Virginia saying she's a terrorist.  You have an advisor to the president going on Fox and calling her filth.  So the idea that she should be targeted by a resolution is absurd.  And I would say one thing here, everything she said about Israel, she's pretty much said about Saudi Arabia.  So if she's an anti-Semite, she must be an Islamophobe as well. ",

            "text": "She has been hard at Saudi Arabia from the beginning, which is worth noting.  And that poster there was in the West Virginia Capitol the other day, put up by the Republican Party.  So Mehdi Hassan here makes some great points.  And one of the points is a point I made earlier in the week on another video about Ilhan Omar.  And that's the idea that Ilhan Omar has been very critical of Saudi Arabia.  So does that make her Islamophobic, even though she's Muslim?  Of course not.  That would be ridiculous.  So why would be... critiquing or criticizing the Israeli government and what they're doing, why would that be anti-Semitic?  It wouldn't be.  And it also completely refutes this idea from Meghan McCain and Barry Weiss and others that claim Ilhan Omar is only focusing on Israel and nobody else.  No, if you actually look at what Ilhan Omar talks about, she's very engaged in human rights around the world.  She is clear about that.  Just because you don't have the ability to do your own research and figure that out doesn't make her anti-Semitic for focusing or for discussing Israel when she has a focus that is worldwide.  So again, I hope we can put this stupid debate to rest this week.  I've done multiple videos on this.  It is clear that Ilhan Omar has not been anti-Semitic.  She is simply pointing out an issue that very few politicians in Washington are willing to speak up on. ",
