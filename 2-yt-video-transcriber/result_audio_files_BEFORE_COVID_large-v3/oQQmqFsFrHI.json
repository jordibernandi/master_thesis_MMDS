            "text": "Hello and welcome to my channel.  Viced Rhino here.  Today I'm going to be doing something a little different.  I'm going to go through the Bible and look at several of the examples of human sacrifice that take place in the Old Testament.  One of the justifications that Christians often use for things like the Amalekite genocide is that these were terrible people that did things like human sacrifice and they sacrificed their children to Baal.  So let's just see how the ancient Hebrews compare to these horrible baby killers.  Let's start with the obvious story that everybody knows about, Abraham being told to sacrifice Isaac as a burnt offering to the Lord.  This is a story that's usually brought up to show how devoted you must be to God, which is kind of disgusting in and of itself.  You're supposed to be so devoted to God that if he tells you to kill your children, you don't think twice about it, you just obey.  And this is meant to be a good story about how loyalty and devotion are rewarded and God will make everything okay in the end?  And people will say that ultimately God did not require a human sacrifice.  He provided a ram instead.  It was just a test of his faith.  So the all-knowing creator of the universe needed to test Abraham to find out if he had enough faith or loyalty or devotion or whatever other characteristic the story has been used to demonstrate.  Now, if God were actually all-knowing, why would he need to test people's faith at all?  He knows the outcome of the test in advance, doesn't he?  There's a reason teachers in high school don't test their students on things like basic shapes like squares and circles.  They know that their students already know them, so to test the students' knowledge on these things that they already know that the students know would be a complete waste of time.  But let's take a deeper dive into this, shall we?  Why would Abraham react the way he did?  There are plenty of times in the Bible where the main characters make it known that they're not happy with God's commands or have questions about why they must do what God tells them.  Moses, when speaking directly to God, was full of questions about why he should speak to Pharaoh.  How is he to speak when he's got a speech impediment?  Moses even changed God's mind.  God insisted that Moses be the one to speak, but when Moses insisted back that he don't talk good, God finally relented and allowed Aaron to speak for Moses.  Why did Abraham not at least ask God why it had to be his son?  It is entirely possible that this is because human sacrifice was a normal part of ancient Hebrew society, so being asked to sacrifice your firstborn was not anything out of the ordinary.  And when we do some more reading through the Pentateuch, we find that there is supporting evidence for this view.  In Exodus 22-29, it states that you shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses the firstborn of your sons you shall give to me.  This by itself looks rather damning to me, but an argument could be made that they're just being given in service to God rather than being sacrificed.  Devote the firstborn to the Lord, as it were.  But then we go to Leviticus 27, 29, where it says that no one devoted who is to be devoted for destruction from mankind shall be ransomed.  He shall surely be put to death.  So it looks like there may well have been a time in Hebrew history where the firstborn sons were offered as a sacrifice to God.  Kind of like what the Amalekites did with their babies.  But this is by no means an airtight case.  It relies heavily on translation and context.  that can be iffy at times.  So let's go look at something a little more obvious and less subject to interpretation.  If we go to the book of Judges, chapter 11, we find the story of Jephthah.  Jephthah was the son of Gilead and a prostitute.  Now, his father being named Gilead could mean that he was just any man from the land of Gilead rather than actually a guy named Gilead, but it's not really that clear.  Jephthah's true-born brothers threw him out of the house because his mother was a prostitute.  Interestingly, the Bible does not suggest that Gilead did anything wrong by sleeping with a prostitute, it's just that his other sons didn't want the competition for the inheritance.  So Jephthah moved out of the land of Gilead into Tob.  Then when the Ammonites attacked Israel, in some weird and unexplained plot twist, the elders of Gilead went to beg Jephthah to be their leader.  The elders at this point make Jephthah the leader of Gilead, and the wording makes it look like he's their political leader as well as military leader.  And there's no explanation as to why they were so desperate for specifically Jephthah to lead them.  Jephthah then attempted peace negotiations with the Ammonite king, which basically involved him pointing out that it had been 300 years since Israel did anything to the Ammonites, therefore Israel had done nothing wrong to the currently living Ammonites, which kind of kills the idea that it was okay for the Israelites to exact revenge on the Amalekites 400 years after the Amalekites attacked them.  And after these negotiations failed, Jephthah made a vow to God to sacrifice whatever comes out from the doors of his house to meet him when he returns from the Ammonites.  Now, there are a few problems with this vow, not the least of which is the fact that Jephthah had to have known that it would be a person coming out of his house and likely would be someone that was important to him.  He lived with his wife and daughter.  Now, they may have had servants, which might be what Jephthah was considering when he made the vow, but that doesn't really make the story any better.  My point here is that no matter who it was, it would have been a human being coming out of the house to meet him.  He knew that, and even if you could make an argument that an animal would come out to meet him when he came home and that's what he thought would happen, God still would have known that it would be a person.  So this all-knowing, all-powerful God was willing to allow Jephthah to promise him a human sacrifice.  If God didn't want human sacrifices, he could have intervened.  He could have said, hey, Jephthah, that's a bit extreme.  How about you just give me a larger than normal animal sacrifice when you get back?  Or he could have had Jephthah lose his battle with the Ammonites and use that as a lesson.  Don't promise human sacrifices to God.  He doesn't want them and he won't reward you for offering them.  He didn't have to accept the vow.  He didn't have to let Jephthah win in battle, but he did.  So when Jephthah got home, his daughter ran out to meet him, and Jephthah acted as though he was surprised by the fact that one of his loved ones would be anxiously awaiting his return from war and would run out to meet him as soon as they saw him.  Hell, my kids run out to meet me if I get home from work early.  I know that if I were to go somewhere extremely dangerous for several months, When I got home, I wouldn't be able to stop them from running out to meet me and jumping all over me.  I would survive war only to be smothered to death by kid hugs.  And since I'm actually rather fond of my kids, I would never promise to kill whatever comes out of my house first when I get home in exchange for winning the war, because I know that there is a very good chance it will be one of my kids.  But alas, Jephthah is either an idiot or he didn't love his family because his daughter came to meet him.  Then he gave her two months to go into the mountains and cry about the fact that she never got laid and proceeded to sacrifice her to God.  And God never once popped up to say, hey, maybe don't do the human sacrifice thing.  Next up is King David, the man after God's own heart.  David took over as king after Saul turned out to not be genocidal enough for God's liking.  Saul took the king of the Amalekites alive rather than killing him and took some of the animals as plunder.  Because he didn't kill the king or the animals, God stated that he regretted making Saul king because Saul didn't follow his commands properly.  I actually feel a little bit bad for Saul in this story.  I mean, not really because he did carry out most of the genocide, but ultimately Saul was actually trying to please God.  He just had some trouble with the specifics of some of the commands.  Like when he waited seven days for Samuel, God's prophet, to perform a sacrifice.  Samuel didn't show up when he was supposed to, so Saul performed the sacrifice himself because the Philistines were mustering and about to attack, and Saul didn't want to go into battle without seeking the favor of the Lord.  Samuel rebuked him for this, and this is when God started looking for David.  The mercy shown to the Amalekite king was the straw that broke the camel's back, as it were.  Now, of course, being a monarchy, God can't just take someone off the throne and make them not be king anymore.  So instead of just removing Saul from power and appointing David at that point, God instead decided to send an evil spirit to torment Saul.  Eventually, after a long time of being tormented by this spirit, which is probably just a misunderstanding of some form of mental illness on the part of the authors of the story, the Philistines attack again.  Saul consults with a medium, who is actually able to put him into contact with the now-dead prophet Samuel, because mediums actually have the ability to speak to the dead, apparently, and Samuel tells him that he'll lose the battle and die.  Then, depending on whether you're reading in 1 Samuel or 2 Samuel, Saul either kills himself by falling on his sword, or is killed by an Amalekite who found him after the battle.  So now David is king.  At one point during David's reign, there is a famine for three years.  When David asks God about this, he said it's because of the guilt on Saul's house because Saul killed a bunch of Gibeonites.  David then asked the Gibeonites what they want, and they asked for seven of Saul's sons so they can hang them before the Lord.  David then handed them over, and they hanged them before the Lord, and God ended the famine.  So now we have human sacrifice in order to affect the weather.  Next up comes Josiah.  An unnamed man in 1 Kings chapter 13 shows up at the altar at Bethel and says, Now that's pretty damning all by itself, but out of context that could just be some crazy guy pretending to make prophecies.  So now we need to fast forward a bit to 2 Kings chapter 23.  Now, strictly speaking, this prophecy from 1 Kings was fulfilled when Josiah took the bones of already dead men and burned them on the altar at Bethel, but that's in the middle of the story.  Josiah was actually a bit of a turning point in Hebrew culture.  Up until him, the Hebrews had no problem with the worshipping of other gods.  They worshipped gods like Asherah and Molech right alongside Yahweh.  And Yahweh didn't really act as though he had a problem with this.  Well, I mean, sometimes he did, sometimes he didn't.  But Josiah found a scroll of the law while he was renovating the temple, which is thought by some to have been the book of Deuteronomy.  And after reading through it, he decided that no other gods should be worshipped except for Yahweh.  So he went on a rampage, defiling idols and kicking out priests and all that.  He only seemed to be kicking out the priests.  That is until we get to verse 20, which says, And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there on the altars and burned human bones on them.  Then he returned to Jerusalem.  He doesn't just kill them, he sacrifices them.  Now, other translations don't specify sacrifice.  They'll say things like slaughter or slay.  So I looked up the Hebrew word that's used here.  The word is zavach.  Zavach.  Zavach.  Zavach.  Zavach.  Strong's age 2076.  Zavach.  Zavach.  I'm bad at pronouncing Hebrew, y'all.  It can mean slaughter for sacrifice, slaughter for eating, or slaughter in divine judgment.  It appears in the Bible a total of 134 times, and in the King James Version is translated as sacrifice 85 times, offer 39 times, and kill or slay 10 times.  So 93% of the time it's translated to mean a sacrifice or offer.  And in this context, it looks very much like sacrifice would be the appropriate translation, especially since the second half of the verse makes it clear that he burnt their bones on the altar.  And now this brings us to the final human sacrifice, which is a story that makes no sense when considering the belief in the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three aspects of a single entity.  Really, this is just a device that's used to get out of the fact that Christianity is essentially a polytheistic religion with three gods.  The three gods play three different roles, just like separate gods would, with the Father being the judge, the Holy Ghost being the communicator, and the Son being the human incarnation of the Father, sort of.  It's a bit of a complicated mess, especially since the concept of the Trinity doesn't actually show up in the Bible anywhere.  But some Christian sources have it as the Father being the planner, the Son is the accomplisher, and the Holy Ghost is the applier of salvation to believers.  So the Father sent a subservient copy of himself, the Holy Spirit, to impregnate a teenager with a different subservient copy of himself.  This copy then grew up and started his ministry in a bunch of contradictory ways, and then became the ultimate human sacrifice by being crucified to cover our collective sins.  There are a lot of problems with the Jesus story that I'm not covering here.  I mean, there's so many problems that I have a 34-minute video dedicated to just reading through and pointing out the problems in the Christmas story, and a three-part series for a total runtime of 2 hours and 45 minutes doing the same with the crucifixion and resurrection stories.  And I know I missed several of the problems in both stories, and I didn't go into as much detail as I could have for several of the problems that I did cover.  But this video is on human sacrifice, so I'm not going to worry myself over much with the Bible contradictions here.  Now try to imagine this.  Some new preacher starts claiming that he is the son of the one true God.  He makes such a ruckus that he ends up getting the death penalty, and rather than just something like a lethal injection, it's decided that he will be brutally tortured and then nailed to a cross.  If we saw something like this today, there would be global outrage.  There would be petitions for his release before he could be executed.  Countries would threaten sanctions against whatever nation did this.  Well, ideally they would.  Realistically, crucifixion is actually still practiced in some countries.  but they tend to be countries with oil, so it's largely ignored.  And usually in modern crucifixion, the person being crucified is executed first and the body is hung as a warning.  Usually, but not always.  My point is that most modern people who profess to be Christian would be appalled if somebody today were treated as Jesus was, and would probably do everything that they could to prevent it.  Now, if this person were just a person, then it would be absolutely atrocious to allow him to be sacrificed in such a manner.  But if this person were actually an omnipotent, omniscient being with eternal existence, then it's not even really a sacrifice.  Me going to work on a daily basis is a bigger sacrifice than that.  I sacrifice time with my children for the sake of money.  The time with my children is something that I can never get back.  It is gone forever.  But I have to do it because we enjoy doing things like eating and living in a house.  If my and my children's existence was eternal, however, then one weekend of being dead is not a big deal, even if it is extremely painful, because it would be such a minuscule percentage of my overall existence as to be effectively nothing.  But let's just get down to the nitty-gritty.  Most Christians today, if you ask them without giving context, would agree that human sacrifice is immoral.  But these same people, when you point it out in the Bible, will come up with excuses as to why it was okay in those scenarios.  Christianity itself is a religion based on human sacrifice where the people who practice the religion regularly go through a ritual of symbolically consuming the flesh and blood of the ultimate human sacrifice.  None of these examples, not a single one, is something that we should expect from an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving God.  He designed the system.  God the Father is the planner, remember?  He planned everything out.  His plan is supposed to be perfect, but on multiple occasions, his plan required human sacrifice.  How could a perfect plan from a perfect God involve something so barbaric that almost everyone today would universally condemn it if they didn't know it was from the Bible?  Tell the story of Josiah to any Christian, but leave out the part where it's a Bible story, and I would be willing to bet that most would say it is immoral.  Just tell a vague story about a king of a theocracy going through his kingdom destroying symbols of gods that he didn't believe in, and sacrificing the priests of those gods to his god.  Now why would God's plan need to include things that go against the moral code that he supposedly wrote on our hearts?  That's it for this video.  Today's comment of the day comes to us from DE who says, I'm not giving it its own video because it's just not worth it.  He spends almost four minutes just saying that we don't know the mechanism for body plan changes and we don't know how the immune system could turn into a different system like the digestive system.  To answer the first, it's through mutations in the homeobox genes of developing embryos.  To answer the second, it's a complete straw man.  Now, if you want to know how the immune system originally evolved, yes, that's something that we don't know for certain.  But Dr.  Tuor acts at the end of his video as though it's not being studied.  It is.  It is believed to have originated with the emergence of the recombination activating gene transposon and two separate whole genome duplication events.  I feel like a synthetic organic chemist like Dr.  Tour should have been able to find that out on his own.  Anyway, I did enjoy reading through DE's circle jerk with the person who put the video together, but ultimately that particular video is just not worth its own dedicated response video.
