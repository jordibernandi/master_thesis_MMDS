To the hopefully let, the confusion of face, and the few Akwaaf that are listening and learning.  To you I say Shalom.  This is your brother Malcolm from the branch of GMS here in Chicago.  And this video is called, What Do All These Regime Changes Have To Do?  Or Salakia, What Do All These Regime Change Wars Have In Common?  By Kim Iverson.  I discovered her channel a couple days back and I've been watching.  She's got a lot of really good information and really good videos.  It just popped up in my feed, you know, because of the content that you watch, you know, and That's one good thing about YouTube.  It tries to, uh, the algorithm in the machine, it, you know, it puts up something along the same category.  So this is how I discovered, uh, this woman who, uh, if I'm not mistaken, even though her last name is Iverson, I think she may be of Moabite descent.  Alright, there's definitely some, uh, some bloodline mixtures which has confused her face because I'm not sure if she's an Edomite or if she's Moab.  Um, But she claims Moabite or Asian descent.  But nevertheless, let's let her information roll out.  And I'm going to bring out some scriptures.  And then I'm just going to let her finish out.  Because she's just basically going to tell on Esau.

So they talk about, you know, back in the day, the U.S.  was backed, the dollar was backed by gold, an actual pile of gold that was stored in Fort Knox.  And during Nixon's presidency, he decided to get rid of that and say, okay, we're not going to back the U.S.  dollar anymore using actual physical gold.  We're going to move to a different system. ",

And this is important to know.  We struck a deal with Saudi Arabia that we would provide for them weapons, And we would provide for them security, military security, in exchange for them to buy and sell, make sure that the buying and selling of oil was done in American dollars.

Everybody in the world who didn't have an oil reserve of their own would be required, which is the vast majority of the world, would be required to buy and sell oil using the American dollar, which means that these nations needed to get their hands on the American dollar.  That made the dollar high demand.  It made the dollar very, very valuable.  Like I said, that's a whole different story that we're going to get into later of what happens if the dollar is devalued.  I'm sure you can imagine, but that is a different topic for another day that I don't want to explore right now.  I just want to get into connecting these regime change war dots.  So in essence, the deal was the U.S.  would agree to military sales and defense of Saudi Arabia, it says here, in return for all oil trade being dominated, being a done in US dollars.  So, the relationship between oil and currency gives the dollar its value, and that is the essential thing to know.  One by one, certain nations started to say, we don't like this deal, and we don't want to have to acquire American dollars, which costs maybe a lot out of our currency because they have to do an exchange, and maybe the exchange rate is really ridiculous for a particular nation, and it's causing them to spend a lot more on the oil than they normally would because they first have to take their currency, turn it into U.S.  dollars, and then they can buy oil, and that can be very, very expensive for a nation.

All right, and then you got the stronger nations that were sitting dormant, that wasn't really going against America.  Now all those weaker nations are joining to those stronger nations.

Now, some of these nations came up with the solution of using the Chinese yen.  Some of them came up with the solution of creating their own currency that would be backed by actual gold again in order to buy and sell oil.  Some of them That was pretty much the two options there.  I mean, I think some maybe have said that they would.  they would try to use the euro and that would be maybe something that they could possibly do.
