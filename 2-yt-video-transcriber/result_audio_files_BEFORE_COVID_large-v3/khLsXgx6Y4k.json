            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles and I've got a quick one for you tonight because tomorrow morning I will have a longer one because I've been doing some digging.  I need a little bit more digging before I put it up and then I'll put it all together and hopefully have it uploaded tomorrow morning.  But I want to get this one done by midnight.  So here we go.  This is 52% approval rating for our POTUS.  Yay POTUS!  93% in Republican Party and that is a record.  Yeehaw!  A record.  So, and yes, it is pretty amazing because 93% of the press is really bad.  And yes, we the people are smart.  That's why we put him in, right?  So I wanted to share that with you.  And then I also wanted to show you, I went to the SCOTUS, this is the Supreme Court of the United States website, and there's lots of stuff that you can see here.  It's a very interesting site.  You can actually see the transcripts of the arguments or listen to the audio of the arguments.  And it has the calendar and everything else.  But I wanted to show you this.  This is the press releases.  And here they have.  on November 8th was when they sent out a press release regarding Justice Ginsburg, that she had fallen and broken her ribs.  And then on the 21st, they sent one out saying that, you know, she had the cancer surgery.  for the lungs.  And there's no other press releases.  Now don't you think that if she was going to be in that closed door meeting and she'd been gone for so long that they would have put a press release out for that?  I kind of think they would have.  I don't know.  Why didn't they?  Very good question.  And I wanted to point that out to you.  Just remember that there are reasons why The left would want her to stay in as long as possible, and one of them is this citizenship dispute, because that's the census question that asks, are you a citizen, which I don't think should be a problem in any census of any country.  It shouldn't be a problem to ask if somebody's a citizen.  But of course, here, yes, it is.  Oh.  Anyway, and then, of course, there's this article.  Now, this article is by the AP, so it does have a left-wing leaning, remember that.  But look at this.  At least 20 abortion cases are steps from the U.S.  Supreme Court, and it does have one down here for Indiana, because we had Governor Mike Pence, when he was the governor of Indiana, he signed this into law, and it requires women to get an ultrasound, which I think only makes sense, and wait 18 hours.  Again, I think it makes sense.  not to make such a large decision when you might be in a heightened emotional state.  Waiting 18 hours should not be a big deal.  And then it would stop abortions for just choosing the sex, which meant more girls would die.  And if there was any fetal anomaly.  By the way, the reason the left doesn't want ultrasounds is because 80%, and I think that statistic is right, 80% of the women who are planning on abortion and who get an ultrasound will no longer go through with the abortion.  That's why they don't want women to have that.  Okay, and the last one I wanted to share with you, and this doesn't have to do with the Supreme Court, but it may make its way there.  Who knows?  But anyway, this is for the election fraud hearing that's in North Carolina.  If you're a praying person, keep that in prayers because on Monday, which is tomorrow, most of you will probably be seeing this.  on Monday, the state board will convene in Raleigh And so that's when they're going to actually hear the testimony.  They've been compiling the witnesses.  They have 60 people listed for the witnesses.  It is like major.  So keep that in prayers because it could have ramifications throughout other states.  So That's what I wanted to share with you.  I know it's short, but remember to click that subscribe button.  I'm looking for 60,000 subscribers by my birthday, which I think is in about 53 days.  So it would really be a great birthday present for me if you would just click that subscribe button.  And don't forget to keep your eye out for the video tomorrow because it's going to have some good stuff in it.  So I want to thank you for stopping by and I'll see you all later. ",
