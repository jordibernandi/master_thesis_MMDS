I want you guys to get your pencil and paper.  I want you to write this down.  I want you to write this down.  This is what I heard.  If prophecy does not line up with reality, then you found a prophecy in the Bible that has been altered.  I'm going to say it again.  If prophecy, according to the Bible, does not line up with reality, Then you have found an altered prophecy.  Oh, you better come on out of here.  The Most High told me that the plan is simple.  He gave me, go there.  Book me up.  104 again.  I've been praying, you guys.  I've been seeking the Most High.  i've been seeking the mosaic because i know the enemy is alive and well.  now when they took the slave bible you notice they specifically said they took the book of jeremiah.  they took out all the old testament.  they specifically told you jeremiah.  now when they took those books out the mosaic told me last night that they altered prophecy hello mosaic cia saudi intelligence.  We got the Holy Spirit.  We're going to get to the nitty gritty of all of this.  I wonder why you guys are just sitting back and watching this.  But now I know.  When you guys removed all those pieces of the Bible out of the Bible, you altered prophecy.  Especially in the book of Jeremiah.  You took prophecy and pointed it towards Africa.  Yeah.  and redirected it from the Americas, says the Holy Spirit.  Brothers and sisters, they altered prophecy.  The book of Enoch 104 and verse number 10.  And I know this mystery that sinners will alter and pervert the words of righteousness in many ways.  And we'll speak wicked words.  I want to stop right there. ",

Who told me it was the prophecies?  The Most High.  Why?  The Mosiah said, if prophecy does not line up with your narrow reality, then you see a spot or a place in the Bible that they altered.  In Isaiah 46 and 10, the Mosiah said, he declares the end from the beginning.  Ancient times, things are not yet done.  Then he said to me, they altered prophecy, which is beginning to make sense to me.  So he got all these brothers.  eyes on Africa.  Not realizing that the same people they calling Edomites and saying they're their enemy took parts out of the Bible and then later on put them back.  Boy, Holy Spirit is bad.  You ain't going to get away with nothing from the Mosiah.  So how long has the Apocrypha been out?  This wonderful little book?  When did they remove?  If they took out Jeremiah and all of the Old Testament, we know they took this out in the 1700s.  When it came back, do you think it came back the same?  Do you think it came back right?  Now, let's deal with this reality.  First, I will show you the title of that book, Deceit and Seduction.  What would they change?  They altered and perverted the words, brothers and sisters.  See that?  See that?  This is reality.  See that?  This is reality.  The word Indies is a long version of the word Indy, which means blacks.  This is reality.  This is reality.  When Bible prophecy does not line up with reality, then we found an altered prophecy.  So in this same verse, in verse 10, he tells us they're going to alter and pervert the words of righteousness.  In verse 10, he comes back and says he's going to give us books outside of the Bible so that we can rejoice over.  Books outside of the Bible because they remove prophecy.  They alter prophecy.  Bible prophecy concerning the ten tribes of the house of Israel.  So what did Mosiah do?  He had people like this Jewish man Manasseh in Israel.  The hope of Israel.  Indians are Jews.  Indians are Jews.  Books.  Books.  Then he said we will be given books outside of the Bible to create what?  Joy.  Joy.  This is page 23.  The belief that the Americans were of the 10 lost tribes of Israel held the upper hand for centuries in the face of mystery of the Indians' origin.  It was necessary to find a biblical or at least ancient authority for their presence.  And through the 19th century, and through the 19th century, Most people knew enormous amounts about the Bible and the people therein, and virtually nothing about other cultural schemes.  Consequently, they could easily find parallels between the strange customs of the Hebrews and similar ones in America.  Books would be given.  Go get this book, brothers and sisters, Indians Are Jews, an introduction by Lynn Glazer.  You see this?  We know we Jews.  Here's another one.  The Conquest of America by Tit Van Totoroff.  We will be giving books.  Let's read some of what he had to say.  This is page 210, The Conquest of America.  Durand does not withstand the tension of such doubts for long.  And at the period when he is writing his history, in 1580, in 1580, in 1580 and 81, He has made his decision.  The Aztecs are none other than one of the lost tribes of the House of Israel.  The first chapter of his history opens up with this assertion.  Because of their nature, we can almost affirm that they are Jews and Hebrew people.  The Conquest of America by Tedan Todorov.  Tell them the world.  We're the Jews.  Not in Africa.  Few of the Hebrews are the tribes of Israel.  In where?  In where?  Guys, get this book.  Get this book once again.  When Bible prophecy does not line up with reality, the Messiah promised in Enoch 104 and 12 that he would give us books to bring forth joy.  Where the tribes at?  In America.  No, Africa.  In America.  No, Africa.  Another good one.  Before the Mayflower.  A history of what?  A history of what?  Black America.  By Leron Bennett Jr.  What America?  Black America.  I get fired up, boy, with all these ignorant Israelites.  And they all know about this one.  There's a Jewish man that came over here and seen with his own two eyes The people practicing the Torah!  Wake up!  Wake up!  How many witnesses did I give?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!  Eight witnesses!  Once again, if Bible prophecy does not line up with reality, then you have found an altered prophecy.  I'm going to name this video, Altered Prophecies.  I know the CIA and the Mossad and the Saudi intelligence saying right now, how did that Negro find that out?  You changed the directions of the prophecies.  Come right here, says the Holy Spirit.  You altered and changed Bible prophecy.  Took all them books out.  Gave the slaves a little peace.  And then you guys sat down in a think tank with binoculars and Satan on how to alter Bible prophecy.  And now you busted.  You busted.  Hello, you busted.  In 1933, they had a book burning.  They were rewriting history.  They was getting rid of all of the identity of the blacks on the continent of Europe.  They were burning Bibles.  Hear me talk.  The reason they were burning Bibles was because they had to rewrite history.  And then they started altering Bible prophecy according to just like Enoch said they would.  So now they got everybody looking on the continent of Africa, which is not even our land, which is total ignorance.  And then they got us talking about only Judah was scattered.  But how in the hell we end up in Barbados?  How we end up over there in Guinea? ",

They are a devil and they are a liar.  And I'm looking them in their eyes as I tell them this.  Because when you go and you read your Bible, we can't say that the words of God are lies.  But they did alter Bible prophecy.  We have account after account after account after account of the historians telling the world that the people living in America are the children of Israel.
