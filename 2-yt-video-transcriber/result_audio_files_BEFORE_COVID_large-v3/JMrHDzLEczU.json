So acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney went on Fox News Sunday the other day with Chris Wallace and said some things that just aren't getting the amount of attention that I think they deserve.  Several minutes into the interview, Wallace asked Mulvaney about Donald Trump's seeming contempt and disregard for Congress's authority as an oversight power.  asking for clarity on Donald Trump's stupid statement during his State of the Union address about investigations and legislation.  Here's a reminder of the moment from his speech. ",

Mick Mulvaney hopes you'll believe that despite Donald Trump's constant cries of witch hunt, that he actually respects the rule of law and the co-equal authority of oversight, which has been outlined in Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.  You conservatives out there remember the Constitution, right?  Anyway, watch Slicky Mick here.  try desperately to square all of Donald Trump's attacks with his agreeing with the concept of their oversight. ",

All that talk from Republicans for all those years about how stubborn, lazy, averse to compromise, and arrogant Obama was just dissolved right before your very eyes and ears.  Because Tea Party Deanbat Mick Mulvaney just admitted that he and his Republican pals never actually cared about passing laws.  All they cared about was stopping Barack Obama.  Mulvaney, who was there for six of Obama's eight years and his Republican obstructionist pals, spent all their time lying about their purpose and their motivations.  But now we're supposed to trust them that their intentions are good and pure and patriotically grounded.  No thanks, dipshit.  I don't believe you.  Nor should anyone who actually cares about this country.  If for no other reason than the fact that you lied your way into the office that you sit in, which is only now feet from the man who you so loyally serve, who grew his own political capital by promulgating racist birther conspiracy theories about the same president you just admitted you spent six years in Congress doing nothing but denying legislative wins to.
