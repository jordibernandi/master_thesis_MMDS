This is war.  Yeah, it's war, crazy-ass white people.  And what are you looking at, you hockey puck?  Who you trying to get crazy with,  S.A.?  Don't you know I'm loco?  You ain't loco.  You're nothing but a squirt bottle spitting on everybody in sight.  Oh, we'll see about that, Mr.  Poopypants.  I'll send the bill for my dry cleaning, you freaking spit machine.
