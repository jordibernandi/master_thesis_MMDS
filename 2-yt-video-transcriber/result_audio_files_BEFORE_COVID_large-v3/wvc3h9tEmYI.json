You're right about that.  come on mama.  okay hold on there.  i didn't know that.  i don't know which officer it is.  now i'm going to cvs.  why the white lady?  she's still over there in her car.  The mama done pulled up.  My gosh.  Thank God for the owner of this restaurant.  In Seasons, y'all come on down.  But if you black, just do not look at white people.  I can't believe it.  I cannot believe it.  They surrounded the boy.  His mother had to come.  I just tried to go to CVS.  And the white lady is over there in her car.  Unbelievable.  She's hiding in the white car underneath the CVS.  She said the boy looked at her suspiciously.  And they called all these police on the boy.  This is the restaurant owner, you guys, of the In Seasons Cafe.  She's awesome.  She says she's not going to leave that baby.

I never went Facebook live but this was something that I had to do because I didn't know what was going to happen with the boy.  But anyway, he went to go eat.  It's done.  They surrounded the young man in Royal Oak, Michigan for looking suspicious.  at the Caucasian lady and she is over there hiding in her car.  They held him for like 25 minutes saying, what was he doing over here?  And now finally they let him go.  Because the white lady called the police on the young man trying to come to eat in Royal Oak, Michigan.  Because she said he looked at her suspicious and all of these police officers pulled up.  But it's over now because his mama came from wherever she came.  And we just wanted to go Facebook Live so you guys can know what was going on.  And we did not want no more crazy stuff.  That's it.  I'm out.  He's in the restaurant.  I'm going to CVS.  And I was out here.  The young man is in the restaurant eating.  I'm going to go to CVS, Royal Oak, Michigan.  They pulled him over because he was walking into a restaurant and because a white lady said that he looked at her suspiciously.  And I begin to film because this is crazy.  Not today.  They all pulled up on him.  This is the restaurant owner or she works here for... The in-season restaurant, now you guys, you got to come here because she's awesome.  She didn't went off on the police.  She told them, I can't believe you did that.  She did not leave the young man out here.  And that's it.  And the white lady that called the police was over there underneath the CVS sign.  She didn't get out of her car, but I think she was hoping that he got arrested for something.  They thought he had a warrant, so the mama going to get the badge number for these guys.  And this was awesome.  And it's over.  That's it.  Everybody have a good day.  Pray and stay safe. ",

            "text": "As you saw in the video, the police were standing there talking with him.  Now, anyone that has some sort of common sense and a lot of you do who have common sense, you would think that a 911 operator will say, ma'am, a guy staring at you like, where is he at?  Oh, he's across the street.  He's staring at me like, Okay.  Is he going by your car?  Is he doing anything to you?  No.  Well, if he tries to do anything, call us.  That's what something that maybe you would think they will respond, but they have this particular code.  Okay.  Anytime it is a black man, they're coming out.  They don't matter how ridiculous it is, they're coming out.  And as you saw, they had more and more of them showing up.  For what?  For nothing at all.  Now, what made a small difference with some of this was the business owner that was there, that was the white woman.  Now she know that how the race soldiers get down and she was making sure that this brother wasn't shot because they look for any reason to kill a black man.  We know there's plenty of white supremacists on the police departments of America.  We know this.  Now, once they got to the point where they let the brother go, there was a second portion of the video that we need to talk about where the police is arguing with the white woman.  Now his main thing, if you were the one to read between the lines is what are you doing?  Getting involved in this situation with us and this black man, we were trying to figure out a way to arrest him or rough him up or kill him.  And you sitting up here being off code and we don't like that.  That's really what that whole thing was about with those cops because they don't expect nobody white to intervene like that.  Now, I wish more white people were that way, like that woman.  But unfortunately, the woman in the video is the minority.  She's not the majority.  Because if she were the majority, we wouldn't have race problems or white supremacy or anything like that.  We wouldn't.  But that's the bad portion of it.  Now the female was sitting across the street.  The only thing I, I'm like, ah, sister, then she did not go across the street and show that woman's face.  When you guys are recording, you got to get their pictures on camera so everyone can find out number one, who they are.  they usually gonna find out if they have some sort of employment or something, right?  You gotta find out who they are.  If you can't find out their name, get their license plate, get everything that you can when you catching them like this, because that's the only way that you can teach them a lesson to not do these sort of things.  Because when they call 911, they're trying to call in the murder of a black man.  That's why.  It is utterly ridiculous.  And people all over the world see these videos and say, I don't understand how y'all live that way, but you understand why.  they put a travel advisory to United States as well.  And then Trump want to get mad about it, but it should be a travel advisory.  That's not normal, especially you black to be walking down the street and you getting the police called on you.  And then this same type of deal with this Caucasian female pool has gotten black men lynched.  Oh, he scares me.  And then they, here come a white mob lynching a black man just cause she said that.  see times may change, but they don't change.  The same things happen every single day.  And we as black people have to get more and more angry about things like this.  And the reason why we got to get angry is because it's not normal to accept that treatment.  It's not normal to say, well man, just the way it is.  No, it's not just the way it is.  That's not normal.  And this is why you guys hear me talking about Africa so much because you don't deal with those problems over there.  Somebody calling the police on you for walking down the street or staring.  He could have been staring past her.  I've even done that.  I stare at certain things behind and I ain't paying attention to you, but Oh, he's black man.  He's, you know what I'm saying?  It's not normal at all.  Now the brother, like I said, they didn't kill him, but the fact is it's still an offense.  because that had been a Caucasian male that had been staring at her.  She wouldn't had to issue a problem.  She wouldn't call nobody.  But as a black man, you know, I guess we're staring while black, they come up with everything.  No, just call it existing while black.  You ain't got to call out every single thing is wild black.  They don't like us to exist.  This is why they do what they do.  They have a, they full of hate.  when it comes to us.  Well, leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think about this particular story out of Royal Oak, Michigan.
