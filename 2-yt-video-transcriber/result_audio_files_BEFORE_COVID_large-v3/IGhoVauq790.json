            "text": "Hello, Lou here.  Hey, what an awesome gathering that was.  moved by it.  Now, as you know, we called for the fast.  17,000 of you signed up, and I believe many, many more around the world are entering into this Jesus fast, this extended fast, that I believe is part of shifting us into a whole new era of Jesus the evangelist, Jesus the missionary, finishing the task.  I want to encourage you as a father to Many of you never fasted, maybe a long fast before, an extended fast.  I want to first, I want to just encourage you.  This fast, I believe, will be epic.  I want you to look to the reward.  The Bible says when you fast, there is a reward for those who fast rightly.  In humility, you fast.  You should look to the reward.  What is it that you're looking to?  What is it that you desire from God?  a dream that shows you who you are, what your scroll is.  This is what you should expect during this fast.  I have found that in fasting, if I have a clear objective, it gives me faith to go through the burdensome, the burden of fasting.  I remember the first time I did a three-day fast.  Heaven came so close.  I felt his presence and it.  I remember another fast.  We were praying that God would move in power and deliver people from demons.  So for 10 days, I fasted with my friend.  And on the 10th day, we started seeing demons being driven out over a whole season.  And I realized, wow, there's a breakthrough with fasting.  I want you to have expectation for a breakthrough.  That's what's going to sustain you when it seems like, oh, I can't do this.  Keep the reward.  Keep the vision of believe that God will give you an encounter during this fast.  Jesus said, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word.  of donuts that I just had before I start my fast in a couple of days.  God love you.  I want you to find a friend that you can actually fast with.  You see, two is better than one.  If one falls, the other will lift him up.  Over the years, I've always had a friend to run with and fast fast.  how long count the days?  don't do that.  get caught up in heaven's swirl.  get caught up in prayer spend lots of time in the bible spend lots of time in prayer meetings.  this is how you'll sustain your your prayers and Listen, if you happen to maybe fall, maybe you're doing a juice fast and you just kind of blow it, then don't condemn yourself.  Just get back up and go again.  I do encourage you set your goal at a specific time.  Maybe you'll go 10 days, maybe 21 days.  Some of you will go 40 days.  Maybe you'll break it up.  One 10 days on juice, 10 days, no television.  10 days, 20 days, just water or a Daniel fast, I would encourage you to do part of it with water.  Water is the fasting man's best friend.  You feel the weakness and all you can do is cry to God.  And in that, it's posture, God will visit you.  So I believe that in this fast, he's going to give you extraordinary grace.  Remember, you're fasting with thousands around the world.  Your names are being recorded in heaven, the shifting of history into a new Jesus movement.  And so you keep that alive.  You pray, God, give me dreams.  I remember 1996, in a 40-day season of fasting, voice, by dreams.  It changed my whole world.  And now we're doing what we're doing right now.  because of that fast.  I'll tell you, God will reward your fasting.  Every fast you enter in with faith.  Derrick Prince, who wrote that book, Shaping His Truth Through Prayer and Fasting, says every fast that you do in faith will be blessed by God.  I'm living in the.  You're loved by God.  You'll never be loved more even before fasting.  You're not earning anything.  You're just entering into Jesus fast.  Now, Lord, I pray right now.  Just pray and believe with me.  I'm going to pray for the grace of fasting.  Lord, I pray for the grace of fasting to these thousands.  Maybe the first fast they've ever done.  Maybe others who have fasted many times lose a fresh grace and counter them by like Moses in his fast.  Lord, I pray that God, you would call them into destinies.  I pray that Jesus, the evangelist would rise in their lives, signs and wonders and the gifts of the spirit like they've never known.  Grace, grace, grace.  Now, come on, just reach out to. ",
