            "text": "The Book of Sirach, Chapter 6 Don't be a friend one day and an enemy the next, because a bad reputation will bring disgrace and insults.  That is what happens to two-faced sinners.  Don't let your passions get out of control, or else they will drain you of your strength.  Your leaves will be devoured, your fruit will be destroyed, and you will be left like a withered tree.  Uncontrollable passions can destroy a person who has them, and make him the laughing stock of his enemies.  Pleasant conversation wins many friends, and kind words win many friendly greetings.  You might be well liked by a lot of people, but let only one out of a thousand be your trusted friend.  When you make a friend, begin by testing him.  Don't be too quick to trust him.  Some are friends only when they benefit from you, but they won't stand by you in times of trouble.  Some friends turn into enemies and make the details of your quarrel public to embarrass you.  Some friends sit at your table, but they won't stand by you in times of trouble.  When you are prosperous, they try to be like you and treat your workers like their own servants.  But if you suffer financial losses, they turn against you and hide from you.  Stay away from your enemies and beware of your friends.  A faithful friend is a sturdy shelter.  Whoever finds one has found a treasure.  A faithful friend is priceless.  Nothing else is as valuable.  A faithful friend is a life-saving medicine.  Those who fear Yah will find one.  Those who fear Yah will make lasting friendships.  They will treat their companions as well as they treat themselves.  My child, if you choose self-discipline from the time you are young, then, when you have gray hair, you will find wisdom.  Try to be as self-disciplined as a farmer.  He begins by plowing fields and planting seeds, but has to wait for a good harvest.  When you cultivate self-discipline, you will have to work only a little while before you eat what your work has produced.  Self-discipline seems very harsh to those who are undisciplined.  Fools find it too demanding.  It's a burden too heavy for them to bear.  They won't hesitate to get rid of it.  Wisdom is like its name, if not easy for many people to use.  Listen, my child, and accept my opinion.  Don't reject my advice.  Put your feet into wisdom's chains and your neck into its harness.  Put your shoulders under wisdom.  Carry it and don't resent its restrictions.  Go after wisdom wholeheartedly and follow its ways with all your strength.  Look for it, track it down, and it will be revealed to you.  When you get it, don't let go of it.  In the end, you will find the comfort wisdom gives and it will become a source of joy for you.  Then its chains will protect you and its harness will be like a beautiful long robe.  Its yoke will be a gold necklace and its ropes will be a purple threads.  You will wear it like a beautiful robe and put it on like a splendid crown.  If you are willing, my child, you can gain self-discipline and if you apply yourself, you can become clever.  If you love to listen, you can become knowledgeable and if you pay attention, you can become wise.  Stay in the company of respected leaders.  If one of them is wise, stick to that person.  Be willing to listen to every discussion coming from devout people.  And don't let any wise proverb escape you.  If you see a sensible person, then get up early to visit him.  Your feet should wear out his doorstep.  Reflect on Yah's teachings and think about his commandments all the time.  He will enlighten you and grant you your prayer for wisdom. ",
