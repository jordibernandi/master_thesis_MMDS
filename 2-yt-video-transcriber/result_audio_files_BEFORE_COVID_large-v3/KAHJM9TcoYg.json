That is, unless he's arguing for religion.  On this topic, I find him staggeringly poor.

The aim of the game is to debunk fallacious arguments while preventing your opponents from doing the same, by, say, stealing or discarding their cards.  It's genuinely really fun to play, and my hope is that you like it enough to back the idea on Kickstarter.  The arguments are real, and so too are the fallacies that they commit, and so not only is this game thoroughly enjoyable, it's also a fantastic learning tool.

So the basic idea, and I'm going to try and boil this down so that it makes some sense.  The basic Aristotelian argument for the existence of an unmoved mover is the idea that there are a bunch of, every object around you has actual and potential, right?  It has an actuality and it has potential.  So if you have a candle and it's made of wax, it has the potential to be a pool of wax, but that potential is not fulfilled unless something acts upon it.  The only thing that can act upon an object and make it fulfill its potential is either another object that has its own potential or something that is pure actuality.  It does not have any potential.  It's just actual.  It just exists.  So the idea in the Aristotelian argument for God is that If you don't want an infinite regress of causes, if you don't want an infinite regress of things that have actuality and potential, and then something has to actualize it, and something has to actualize it, and something has to actualize it, you have to come to the unactualized actualizer.  A thing that just is, a thing that just exists, and as Aquinas says, this is what we call God.  This thing that exists and has the capacity to actualize the potential of other objects.  And so this is his argument for the existence of God, that otherwise you get an infinite regress, and there need not be an infinite regress of causes. ",

That would be an example of change, or I move my hand through space and so forth.  That's an example of change.  Aristotle argues that on analysis, change always involves the actualization of a potential, something going from potential to actual.  My hand's potentially over there, now it's actually over there.  Water's potentially lukewarm, then it becomes actually lukewarm.  Whenever something goes from potential to actual, there's always something already actual that makes that happen.  And if that already actual thing goes from potential to actual, there's something already actual making that happen.  So we've got one thing being changed by another being changed by another, or one thing being actualized by another being actualized by another, and so forth.  And Aristotle concludes that we would have a vicious regress if there weren't something at the bottom level, you might say, that actualizes everything else without having to be actualized because it's already, as he puts it, purely actual.  It's moving other things or changing other things without itself being moved or changed.  It's a, what I call in the book, a purely actual actualizer or an unchanging changer or an unmoving mover. ",

Now it is not possible that the same thing should be at once in actuality and potentiality in the same respect, but only in different respects, for what is actually hot cannot simultaneously be potentially hot, but it is simultaneously potentially cold.  It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e.  that it should move itself.  Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another.  If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must need to be put in motion by another, and then by another again.  Now, there's a fair amount of confusion around this premise, and it's generally agreed that it's not needed for the argument, which is presumably why proponents, including Ben and Fraser, don't include it.  Given this, I'll keep my thoughts brief.  Some see Aquinas as simply describing the law of non-contradiction, which states that contradictory propositions cannot both be true.  others see him as asserting that an object cannot change itself.  But then the question becomes, what exactly is an object?  If, for example, a steel rod that's heated on one end counts as an object, then objects can actualise or change themselves, because if the rod was left alone, the hot end would warm up the cold end.  Hence, this is a false premise.  But again, Ben and Fazer don't employ it, so I'll move on.  Premise 4.  But this cannot go on to infinity, because then there would be no first mover and, consequently, no other mover, seeing that subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the first mover, as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand.

            "text": "To quote Ben, facts don't care about your feelings, and I don't care about what we want, I care about what's true.  Now, unlike Ben and Fazer, Aquinas does provide an argument, that being that if the deterministic chain were to go on forever, there would be no first mover and consequently no other mover, but this simply doesn't stand to reason, and this is primarily because it's based on outdated and flawed Aristotelian physics.  If there is no first mover, which is to say, if cause and effect is infinite, we have an answer that accurately accounts for our observations and, most critically, one that doesn't require us to make an unfounded assumption that violates everything we know.  Or to put this all another way, given all the evidence we have for movers absolutely requiring a mover, do we have sufficient reason to believe that there's a mover that doesn't require a mover?  No.  As weird as it might seem, as unintuitive as it might seem, the evidence indicates that everything is contingent on something, and this is further bolstered by the fact that the law of conservation of energy has never been violated, even by quantum mechanics.  Instead of thinking of a ladder-like chain of events, think of a long circular chain of events, one in which every cog is turned by another cog, and hence there being no need for a cog that turns itself.  Now, just in case you're thinking, what about the Big Bang?  Doesn't that prove an absolute beginning?  The answer is definitely no.  I won't explain why here, as it would take too long, but I'll leave a link below to a video in which I do.  And finally, here's Aquinas' conclusion.  Therefore, it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other, and everyone understands this to be God. ",

            "text": "Do you know how New Ages label inanimate, unconscious, mysterious things God?  Well, it seems that Aquinas beat them to it.  Now, to his credit, Aquinas didn't propose that this argument proves the existence of his very specific Christian God.  For that, he offered additional flawed arguments.  But my point being here is that even if this argument was valid and sound, even if it proved the existence of an unmoved mover or an unactualised actualiser, that's literally all it would prove.  It wouldn't prove that there's only one unactualised actualiser, that it still exists, or that it's conscious, and it definitely wouldn't prove that it inspired a 600-year-old man to build a boat in order to survive a worldwide flood, etc.  Now to be fair, Ben evidently offers additional arguments as to why he attributes such qualities to this unactualised actualiser, and Fazer spends premises 19 to 49 doing the same.  But these are, really, additional arguments, and so I'm going to tackle them in a subsequent video.  So, to recap, the objections I've brought up in this video are as follows.  Premise 2 commits a black swan fallacy, since it's based on incomplete knowledge.  Premise 3 either states the law of non-contradiction, or it's simply a false premise.  Premise 4 is an argument by assertion, and in Ben's case, it's also an appeal to emotion fallacy.  And the conclusion is a special pleading of the second premise.  What's more, even if the argument was sound, all it would prove is an unactualised actualiser, and that's literally it.  Anyhow, thank you kindly for the view, and I want to remind you that you're going to die.  please do check out the debunked Kickstarter.  For those of you unaware of how Kickstarter works, if the project is funded within 30 days, it'll become a reality, but if it's not, it unfortunately won't.  One could say that the cards have the potential to be made, but only if they're actualised by apes such as you.  As always, an extra special thank you to my wonderful Patrons, and to those of you who have supported the channel via merchandise and PayPal.  Until next time, my fellow apes.  Until next time. ",
