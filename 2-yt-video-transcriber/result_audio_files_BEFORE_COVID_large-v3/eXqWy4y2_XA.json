            "text": "Batman and Robin, save me!  Where are we going, Batman?  We're going to stop the forces of George Soros, Robin.  Shut up, bat-ass!  Robin, according to our bat monitors, it seems as if Antifa is running amok Gotham.  Holy smokes, Batman!  At first I thought it was the Penguin, But it turns out to be none other than Mr.  George Soros.  You know, they have the same physique.  Well, now he's back and he's sent his henchmen and Tifa for the group that throws around acidic milkshakes at citizens.  Those dogs!  Come on, quick!  To the Bat Uber, Robin!  Alfred, going to Freedom Plaza.  If something goes down, just grab your bad Constitution and explain the First Amendment.  right, the right of difference of opinion.  Ah, difference of opinion?  Does that mean that we can have our ideas and they can have their ideas and nobody needs to die?  Precisely, Robin.  Is this Freedom Plaza back there?  This is Freedom Plaza, Robin.  How are you, sir?  We're here covering the story.  I'm not a sir.  Oh, sorry.  I couldn't tell because of the musical.  My bad.  How are you today, sir?  You are a sir, right?  Okay.  Are you the Joker?  Yeah!  No, I'm a trained anti-fascist warrior.  Have you ever met Michael Moore before?  And didn't you once go to Capitol Hill during the voice yards of the Marine Recruiter?  They keep pushing against me.  It's very rude to push against Batman.  I'm just standing here.  Why, why, why?  It's the street.  Batman can stay anywhere he wants in the street.  I'm not bothering anybody.  I'm just, I'm doing an interview with this guy.  It's easier to, he's going to be able to hear you better over there.  All right, well, this is Gotham, and I run this city.  This is blocked off.  Let's go.  Move back.  Yo!  Hey!  Oh, shit.  Batman, they're pushing through the police line.  Where are we going, Batman?  We're going to stop the forces of George Soros, Robin.  Beepin' lizards.  That's a lot of Antifa.  They're taking to the streets.  Gotham is in complete chaos, everyone.  Holy corpio, Batman.  Oh, shit.  Holy freedom of the press, Batman.  The forces of the law are here.  We saved the day.  Seems they dislike the police officers.  They do dislike the officers, Robin.  But they have to respect the law.  Good job, you guys.  Thank you, sir.  Why don't you have the Adam Mask plastic mask on, too?  Jeez!  What's wrong with Batman's outfit?  Wait, are these guys part of the... No, these are some guys.  These are right-wing cosplayers.  Listen, Batman is here to save the day.  Look at that mullet.  That sure is a big mullet, Robin.  Batman saves the day and he protects the citizens of Gotham.  Batman protects the citizens of Gotham.  Says who?  Says Batman.  The people that made Batman in charge of protecting Gotham was the corrupt Gotham cops, the corrupt mayor, the mob running the city.  I don't know who the fuck this guy is, but just getting the Batman story straight.  Holy Batman lore.  I'm Batman.  I watch Batman and I think we're slandering Batman.  He probably knows we're slandering him.  Wait a minute.  How long did he grow that mustache?  He seems very angry indeed, Robin.  Batman's a fucking ANCAP.  Excuse me?  You heard me.  Batman sucks.  Superman is vastly better.  Superman is the story of an immigrant who came to his country and just tries to make the world a better place.  Batman saves the day.  Does he?  No, he just beats people up.  He has punitive justice, not reformative justice.  So you'd rather take a side with a penguin?  I think he may have not had his vitamins today, Robin.  Is there a problem, sir?  Is there a problem?  Is there a problem?  I'm just walking in the street.  Help!  Batman and Robin!  Save me!  Save me, Batman!  Go underneath.  Go underneath.  Woo-hoo!  Batman and Robin have been saved.  Woo!  They've been saved.  Wait, we heard you got into a scuffle with Batman and Robin earlier.  Batman isn't shit.  I pulled a Batarang on him and he didn't do nothing.  I've heard they don't like Robin.  They didn't like Batman and Robin.  I don't know why.  Gee willikers.  Well, Robin.  I mean, Kyle.  We're not Batman and Robin, right?  I haven't seen Batman and Robin all day.  I haven't seen them at all.  Where could they be?  I don't even know where you get the costume.  I might be Robin.  Maybe I might be Batman then. ",
