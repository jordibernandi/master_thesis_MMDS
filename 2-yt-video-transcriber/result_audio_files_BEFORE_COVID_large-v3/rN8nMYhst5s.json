Rand Paul presented tissue paper avoidance of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that added hundreds of billions of dollars to our deficit.  And now he stands up at the last minute after 15 years of blood, sweat, and tears from the 9-11 community to say that Rand It's all over now.  Now we're going to balance the budget on the backs of the 9-11 first responder community.  Brett, this is about what kind of society we have.  At some point, we have to stand up for the people who have always stood up for us.  And at this moment in time, maybe cannot stand up for themselves due to their illnesses and their injuries.  And what Rand Paul did today on the Senate was outrageous.  He is a guy that put us in hundreds of billions of dollars of debt.  He was the 51st vote on that cut.  And now he's going to tell us that a billion dollars a year over 10 years is just too much for us to handle.  You know, there's some things that they have no trouble putting on the credit card.  But somehow when it comes to the 9-11 first responder community, the cops, the firefighters, the construction workers, the volunteers, the survivors, all of a sudden, man, we've got to go through this.  This program has already been running for five years.  No fraud.  It was testified when we went in front of Congress.  The special paymaster testified.  No fraud, no waste, no abuse.  Mike Lee, we met in his office five years ago.  He looked us in the eye.  He looked Ray Pfeiffer in the eye, who unfortunately is no longer with us, and said he was going to look into it.  He is the reason that we've had to go back again.  for this new one, and now he wants to put another cap on it.  that's going to make John Feal and all these other tenacious yet ill first responders drag themselves back to Washington to put their hats in their hands and beg for something that this country should have done 14 years ago.  It's an abomination. ",

I've spent my entire Senate career putting forward pay-fors for any time spending has expanded.  As soon ago as two weeks ago, I put forward a pay-for for the border funding.  I put forward a pay-for for the disaster funding.  I do this on every new bit of funding.  So he's really not informed, and his name-calling just sort of exposes him as a left-winger, part of the left-wing mob that really isn't using his brain and is willing to call people names.  And it's really kind of disgusting because, see, he pretended for years when he was on his comedy show to be somebody who could see both sides and see through the BS on both sides.  Well, now he is the BS, the BS meters through the roof when you see him calling people names, calling people an abomination, when I'm asking something very reasonable.  that an amendment be included to consider whether we should pay for this for taking money somewhere else in the budget.  It doesn't actually reduce the deficit.  It just keeps the deficit from getting bigger.  It's a very reasonable thing.  I've done it dozens and dozens of times, including on the tax bill.  The left-wing mob says, oh, but you're for tax cuts, but you're not for doing anything to offset the tax cuts.  There's something called PAYGO, and I was the leader in trying to keep that in the tax bill.  It was in the tax bill when we passed it and was later taken out of the tax bill over my objections.

In a subsequent bill, They went ahead and got rid of the PAYGO rules in some big, enormous spending bill.  I objected to it, and I forced an amendment vote on it, and only nine people voted with me.

            "text": "That is complete and utter horseshit from Rand Paul.  So this reminds me of when the Democrats voted to authorize the war in Iraq.  And then they turned around and said, no, no, no, no, no.  I wasn't for the war.  I was just giving Bush the authorization to decide that maybe we should or shouldn't go to war.  I didn't know that when I voted for it that that meant we were definitely going to go to war.  I just voted for the war to give him the choice and the option that maybe we should or shouldn't go to war.  That's an actual argument that people have made as to where they try to wiggle out of their responsibility for voting for the Iraq war.  Now this is exactly what Rand Paul is doing here.  Because, you know what?  He knew damn well what was going to happen.  He knew damn well what was going to happen.  Because every time they've done these massive tax cut bills in the past for corporations and for the rich, they didn't pay for it.  It directly hit the debt and the deficit.  100%.  Now here's the other point, and here's how you know he's lying.  Rand Paul argued at the time.  He didn't say, oh, no, no, no, we have to pay for it, this is crazy.  He didn't say that.  What he said was, it's okay because it actually won't add to the debt and the deficit.  That's what he said, repeatedly.  He didn't say, this will add to the debt and the deficit, and we need to make sure that that it doesn't do that.  He didn't say that.  What he said was, oh, all the people on the left are liars when they say that this is going to add to the debt and the deficit.  I think it will not add to the debt and the deficit.  Now, why did he say that?  Because that's the standard far-right-wing economic approach, where they think when you do trickle-down economics, when you do deregulation, when you cut taxes for the rich and when you cut taxes for corporations... Oh, that will actually increase revenue to the government.  because when you cut taxes, the private sector will expand so much that even though these corporations and these rich people are paying a lower percentage tax rate, that will be net more money overall than if you just had a higher tax rate.  This is Art Laffer 101.  And this is what Rand Paul, even to this day, Rand Paul believes that.  Because he went on in that same clip, and you didn't see it there, but he went on to claim, this has been reducing the deficit. ",

But when it comes to, you value your beloved tax cuts above something being deficit neutral.  Because you knew when you voted for this tax cut package, you knew what was going to happen.  You knew that ultimately your party wouldn't care if it added to the debt and the deficit.  because you value looking after the rich and corporations way more than you value making sure the deficit doesn't go up.  And the history of the Republican Party shows that, certainly the history of the Republican Party in the modern era, from Reagan and onward. ",
