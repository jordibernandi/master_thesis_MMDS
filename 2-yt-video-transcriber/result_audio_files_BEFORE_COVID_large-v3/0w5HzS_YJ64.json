So this study, Oral Implications of the Vegan Diet, the study revealed greater incidence of demineralization and white spots in the vegan subjects compared to omnivorous ones.  localized at the neck of the teeth and on the vestibular surfaces of dental elements.  This study, assessment of the influence of vegetarian diet on the occurrence of erosive and abrasive cavities in hard-toothed tissues.  More frequent consumption of some sour products and more commonly used horizontal brushing method were observed, with slightly higher occurrence of non-carious cavities in vegetarian diets.  This is role of dietary habits and diet in caries occurrence and severity among urban adolescent school children.  Caries is just another word for cavities.  and this study shows when food habits are considered.  parents should advise the children on the ill effects of frequent consumption of carbonated drinks on their health and also the effect of frequent consumption of confectionery on their teeth and what diet is high in sugar a vegan diet.  this study shows dental erosion in subjects living on a raw food diet.  Nevertheless, the results showed that a raw food diet bears an increased risk of dental erosion compared to conventional nutrition, and the median intake of fruit was 62% in total, corresponding to an average consumption of 9.5 kilograms of fruit per week.  So very clear evidence, and especially anecdotal evidence, I'm sure if you go on any vegan forum or vegetarian forum, these people are going to have tooth and dental problems.  And when we observed anthropological skeletons of societies that did not prepare their grains properly, they suffered from dental cavities, and especially with the lack of certain animal foods in the diet.

Right, Gabby?  but it could have been like one of those things as like I've researched so much and found out a lot since becoming vegan, right Gabby?

I have no idea where she read this, but my understanding of collated minerals and vitamins, there's nothing that indicates that to my knowledge.  And the main issue here is that she is correlating calcium intake to overall oral health and possibly even bone health.  But we know that what really affects the health of the teeth and the bones is the vitamin D3 and K2 intake in the diet.  And the only way to obtain vitamins D3 and K2 are from high quality animal foods.  because these vitamins, vitamins D3 and K2, stimulate the body to produce hormones that increase the absorption of calcium in the kidneys, which results in more calcium in the tooth and bone.  This study actually shows the opposite.  These results suggest that the addition of CPP, which is a form of casein protein, animal protein, the addition of that to fortified milk could increase calcium absorption by growing rats.  This study is literally showing the opposite of what she's claiming in regards to the animal protein.  Now, if we look at other studies on dairy intake, these data suggested that high intake of maternal cheese during pregnancy may reduce the risk of childhood dental caries.  This study showed that milk had a neutral association with caries and that the consumption of sugar beverages, even fruit juice, increased carries risk.  This study shows that there is no conclusive evidence that we should modify our currently high level of consumption of cow's milk, indicating that what she said about osteoporosis in countries that drink more milk is just incorrect.  Another study showing that high calcium intake promotes bone health.  Additionally, there's an explanation here as to why there might have been some conflicting data on the higher calcium consumption in countries, and that's because In observational studies, the weakness of the methods available for estimating long-term calcium intake aren't that great.  And what that means is that they only have questionnaires or nothing to really measure the calcium intake in the diet.  And here's one more study on dairy.  Our results show that there is a need for early creation of dietary habit of daily consumption of dairy products in children and adolescents.  What really bothers me is these vegans make these outrageous claims and about 10 seconds on Google will show the literal opposite. ",

Unfortunately, this is across the board for everyone.  Most people don't understand that plant-based sources of calcium are not really available to the human digestive system, but the overarching thing here is something I've talked about in several of my past videos, that the calcium RDA is way too high.

It's very clear that her breast milk was not nutritious and it was not providing the vitamins and minerals that her child needed to develop.  Babies have incredibly good instincts.  They know what foods they like, they know what foods they don't like.  Feeding a baby sugar is not something you would have had access to in nature.  But if you're feeding your baby breast milk and they don't like it, but they like sugar, how does that make any sense from a natural perspective?  It's very clear there's something wrong. ",

So one thing I did want to bring up is how Monami was breastfed and how her mother didn't have to brush her teeth.  And if you look at Monami's teeth, they're essentially perfect.  demonstrating the importance of animal vitamins and how animal vitamins played a huge role in Monami Frost developing properly.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about her daughter.  And it's a little bit hypocritical that animal foods contributed to her health and possibly the vitamin stores from previous animal foods she was including in her diet were why she was even able to have a pregnancy in the first place.  So what are you going to do?  This really is unfortunate.  I hate to see these children being impacted But that being said, you know, there's a lot of things going on in the world right now that are much worse than this.  I can only really just help so much.  So thank you guys for watching.  If you guys would like to support the channel, please subscribe, like, and share the video.  If you guys want to know what type of nutrient-dense animal foods I consume every day, there are a couple of them on my Amazon shop.  And my Patreon does have some exclusive videos that you guys might be interested in checking out.  If you guys do want to check out my toothpaste product, it's a tooth powder.  It's on my website, frank-tefano.com.  Hey, maybe if she was using this tooth powder to brush her daughter's teeth, things might have been a little bit different.  Who knows?  But anyway, if you guys want to see any other videos in the future, if you guys want to reach out to me for one-on-one consultations, you can reach out to me via email, frankatefano at gmail.com or through the contact form on my website.
