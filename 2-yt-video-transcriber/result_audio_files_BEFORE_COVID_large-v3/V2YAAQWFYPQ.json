            "text": "Why are so many Japanese children becoming hikikomoris?  Hello everyone, this is Mr.  Obvious, and today on BBC.com.  Not to be confused with the other BBC.  Here on the BBC News, okay.  Hikikomori.  I guess you probably know the word as NEET.  Not in employment, education, or training.  It means people have dropped out of society.  People who no longer see value in pursuing the system as it is.  So why are so many Japanese children refusing to go to school?  I believe I may have the answer.  Society is no longer worth participating in for a lot of young people these days.  Society which has become increasingly overworked, overburdened, and overstrained.  It would seem that the march of technological progress far exceeds humanity's ability to cope with them.  So here I have this article from the Silicon Republic.  Are we in the danger of working ourselves to death?  Here's the thing.  This article talks about Japan.  In fact, death by overworking is so common in Japan that they have their own word for it.  Kiroshi.  A white paper on Kiroshi found that as many as one in five employees are at risk of death from overworking.  So what could possibly lead the Japanese people, Japanese children, to be dropping out of society?  We already know.  Many of you have probably already heard of the phenomena happening in Japan of herbivore men.  Men who decide to not participate in finding a mate, do not try to find a wife, and do not try to find employment and live as a productive member of society.  First it was adults dropping out, then it was young adults dropping out, and now... Japanese children are dropping out.  Could it be that society has simply become not worth it?

So let's take a look at this article.  It's a rather long article so I'm going to basically summarize it and go through the main points. ",
