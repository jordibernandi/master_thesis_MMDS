            "text": "To be continued... You ever notice how modern evangelical Protestants think they just have the best religion in the whole wide world?  Well, of course you have.  And of course they think that, because everybody thinks their religion is the best, right?  It's kind of like your kid or your junk.  You could have the absolutely nastiest, ugliest, most useless one that's ever existed, but you'll always think it's the coolest one ever, just because it's yours.  So yeah, no great surprise there.  but I want to zero in on a big reason why this branch of Christianity thinks it's just so awesomely unique.  It's kind of set apart from other religions, to some extent in its own mind and to some in reality, by its rejection of ritual, legalism, and all the other dry procedural stuff that makes religion seem obsolete.  It's a paradigm shift summed up by the nauseating phrase, it's not a religion, it's a relationship with God.  But while those words make us want to barf every time we hear them, there does seem to be something nice, even profound, at the core of this idea.  And that is that instead of expecting you to do stuff, especially pointless ritual like counting rosary beads or pointing a carpet at Mecca, it says all you have to do is accept Jesus into your heart and have a relationship with him.  God offers salvation as a free gift.  So if you'll but accept it, you'll join him in heaven forever.  It's as simple as that.  And of course it would be, because what's the point of a workspace religion when God wants you in his presence if only you'll join him?  So Christians dump all religion's baggage, strip the ritual script from their prayers, and say, just approach God like he's your dad.  This feels warm and fuzzy because it mimics the best of our relationships and connectedness with other people.  But the fact is, it's really not that great, especially when presented to children, and I would argue that if anything, works-based religion is a kinder and far better option.  To get into why, and to show how mimicking human relationships turns Christianity into a stressful cluster, let's look at a few things that we might take for granted about our relationships and communication with other people.  First, the mechanics of how you start and maintain at least a basic relationship with another person are pretty straightforward.  You can see the person you wish to talk to and generally, at least in familiar situations with people you know, you can figure out when and how it's appropriate to approach them in conversation.  Once you start speaking, there's no question.  you're talking to them.  you know how to direct yourself toward them through positioning, enunciation, and eye contact, and verbal and nonverbal assurances from them make it clear that they recognize and are responding to what you said.  There's no question in your mind that you and another person are speaking, and from there, you'll usually experience natural human emotional reactions, starting on a basic level and growing with familiarity, that come from making conversational connections with other humans and being in their presence.  And over time, this gives you a sense that you have various forms of relationship with different people.  If a relationship ever does start to slip away or become strained, you'll see clear signs of it and be able to follow up for assurances of what's happening one way or the other.  And of course, failing to maintain a relationship with another human won't, you know, send you to hell.  Now it's important to understand that, while this set of skills is relatively simple, it still must be learned through repeated early childhood interactions.  It's far more instinctive for some children, and adults, than others, and for some, such as those who are on the spectrum are just slightly socially awkward, it can be harder to grasp the nuance of social interaction and relational connectedness.  If I can be real for a moment, I've struggled with this greatly over the course of my life.  and while I've gotten more comfortable in my skin over time, I can present very comfortably in front of a hundred people, yet still feel lost and anxious trying to navigate the basics of a meet and greet afterward.  That's the way it is for a lot of people.  And this is in human conversations, with beings we can see and from whom we get concrete cues to help us navigate our interactions, be assured that the other person connects with us on some level, and get a sense of what kind of relationship is developing.  So if kids still need to learn these social skills in real settings with tangible feedback, and if doing so can be awkward, even traumatically so for some of them, let's take a moment to appreciate what Christians are asking their children to do.  By telling them to establish a relationship with God, they're expecting them to conjure an idea of the being they need to interact with in their own heads.  Of course, this is guided by instruction from the Bible and from adults in their lives, but still the task is on them to distill these stories and abstractions into the idea of a personality, one they must generate and hold in their minds while convincing themselves to feel that it's a real thing that's actually with them.  Then they need to start having a relationship with it.  But how does a person do this?  Well, usually you talk to that person.  Great.  But how do you talk to a being you're picturing in your head who, while ostensibly everywhere, still has a presence that comes and goes and gets stronger and weaker and must be conjured?  And how do you really feel that you're properly directing your conversation to this being?  Modern Christians often just speak into the air, or maybe whisper or think their thoughts to God because, you know, he can read your mind and all that.  So I guess that teaching can more or less assure you that he'll technically hear the words you're uttering.  But still, this idea runs against all your intuition of how you interact with someone else.  And training yourself to talk while you're just sitting by yourself without feeling like it's just weird, and to be legitimately convinced that this is a meaningful exercise actually directed towards someone, is a big thing to ask of a kid.  And that's before we even approach the hard stuff.  How do you hear God talking back?  How do you get any feeling of reassurance that he's there with you, hears you, and that there is any form of back and forth communication happening?  And how can you feel this feedback so convincingly and so tangibly that it actually becomes an emotional reality for you and that you thus? ",
