I do think that she was being a little too friendly with Tristan and that there was some touching, but nothing substantial.  I do believe that they kissed and that was it, but who knows?

I want to give you the opportunity to tell you the truth, but I want you to tell it through the lens of what your part has been.  Because that's the only part you can change.

We're not thinking about whose house or where it's at.  We're just, you know, we're all having fun.  We're in the moment.  The group of girls that I'm with are like, you know, we're going to go to a house.  On the way out, they're saying it's Tristan's house.  I'm like, cool.  That's okay.  Feels like a safe environment.  I'd rather it be his house than a random stranger.  He didn't even personally invite me there.  It wasn't like, come see me.  It was like, oh, I'm hopping in the car.  I'm coming with y'all.  Y'all are going here?  Cool.  I know him even better.  We pull up.  We walk in.  Not once was I aware of anyone's phone.  or told them to take away a phone.  I was not paying, I don't care.  I don't have anything to hide.  So when it comes to the phones being taken away, I have no clue.  who told them to take away the phone, anything.

By the way, you are the reason my family broke up.  First of all, this is one of the most ignorant statements I ever heard coming from the Kardashians.  Because it wasn't not too long ago where Tristan was videotaped making out with a girl.  I'm sorry, girls.  Not hearing it through the grapevine.  Oh, and not to mention leaving a hotel room, or it's kind of, I'm not sure which one, with the girl as well.  So for them to say this was Jordan's fault is ridiculous, I believe they're lynching this girl to distract the foolishness and the stupidity off themselves, even though it takes two.  But the main corporate restriction, who isn't being lynched, and the word on the street is still freaking cheating.  So I think that Khloe needs to admit that she made a mistake, and once again, that she rushed into something.  as i said in the video i will leave the link below once again and stop pointing the finger and blaming someone else.  as i was saying.  she rushed into the situation and once again and blew up in her face.  that's all i have for now.  tell me your thoughts below.
