And so I said, cool.  But I also have a question.  Why is it always transgender, transgender females who are always winning and breaking these records?  Why isn't it men?  So here, we have this article from Pick News that says, 10 transgender athletes explain why it's fair to compete.  So first up, we have Rachel McKinnon, a two-time world champion trans cyclist.  She's been competing against women.  Let's go to the next person.  Transgender triathlete Chris Mosier.  He is a transgender man, meaning he was born a female, transitioned to man.  He has won absolutely nothing.  So that's one for women.  Zero for men.  Transgender fighter, MMA fighter, Fallon Fox, who has a record of six and one, including most of the wins by TKO knockouts in the first round.  On the other side, we have a transgender man, meaning born a female, transition to man, Pat Manuel, who made history in 2008 when he became the first transgender man to professionally box.  What's his record?  1-0.  He's only had one fight.  Who did he fight?  A fighter who was 0-7.  Never won a fight.  Laurel Hubbard, who has won a few gold medals and beaten competitions as well as competed in the Commonwealth Games.  She's broken records. ",

And he has won the high school state wrestling championship in 2017, 2018.  So this is the first transgender man who's won something at a high level.  Only problem is he's competing against women while on testosterone.  So we have a biological female on testosterone competing against women and annihilated the competition.  Even when they make their own articles.  have their best examples of biological female competing against biological males, they never win anything.  They never compete at the highest level.  They never show out in a real way.  But notice that all the biological males who transition and compete against females are breaking record.
