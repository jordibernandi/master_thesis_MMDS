She was at the CTA Red Line Station on 69th Street.  She's going to be hit by a train.  I'm not going to show her getting hit.  So, what happened is that she dropped her cell phone.  So, she get down to pick up her cell phone and the platform was way too high for her to get up.  So, you can see her about to try to get up.  And it looks as if she's seen a train coming, grabbed whatever she had in hand, and she's trying to run to get back on the platform.  There was like little stairs down there.  So it looks like she was trying to run to get her, to go up the stairs.  And she didn't make it.  I'm not gonna show what initially happened.  So, unfortunately, she did not make it.  She did pass.  The story's gonna read that it's unclear how the video leaked.  In it Smith is seen looking down at the tracks after dropping her phone.  She appeared to have talked to a passenger in a red shirt then jumped down.  Another passenger in a white shirt carrying a red bag pointed down the platform where security guard and dog were standing.  The video shows Smith starting to move quickly towards the train.  Martin said there was a ladder there.  she was trying to reach but didn't make it in time.  So someone says her sister says my sister cried out for help.  Martin said.  No matter what her choice was she cried out for help and he walked right past her nonchalantly.  He was turned off from a life, a human life.  He never reached her hand.  The guard works for the CTA contracts called AGB Investigation Services, who had no comment on the incident.  CTA said that it is investigating to determine how the video was leaked.  Now, Smith, who was a mother of three, an author and insurance agent, her family said.  Now, what's even more sad is that not even a week later, her niece, who is Akilah Anderson, who is 22, she was shot actually on the 4th of July, actually on the 5th in the morning, about 3 a.m.  on Friday in the 4200 block of South Wales in Fuller Park neighborhood.

They suffered a sad tragedy after they lost Phelan Smith on the CTA bus line last week.  Akilah's mother.  Now, Akilah's mother, who is Brandy Martin.  This is a Facebook page here.  You can see everybody is saying, I'm sorry, my condolences.  She posted, they killed my baby.  So as you guys can see, this is Akilah Anderson here.  She was only 22 years old.  They're saying that somebody just walked up to her and shot her.  You can tell that she's very fun-loving.  Had a lot of friends.  This is pictures from her Facebook page here.

So this is the story out of Chicago happening this week.  So this is the memorial page they have up for Keila Anderson, June 5th, 1997.  Wow, she was just born a few days ago.
