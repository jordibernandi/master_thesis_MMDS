Since just like yesterday, I packed my bags, hopped on the plane, and in a few minutes, I was in Ghana.  Today, I'm leaving.  My trip to Ghana has been a defining moment in my life.  The end of a phase.  a decade, and the birth of another.  I met amazing people here and created beautiful memories to long cherish.  Hard as I wish this never ended, it has.  A reminder again that time is not ours to control, but to make the most of when we can.  I'm glad I made the most of this time.  No regrets.  Today, I embark on the journey back home to live and share that which I think I have found.  That is myself.  Thank you, Ghana.  The show of love and support has been overwhelming.  You gave me so much more than I anticipated.  And I'm grateful for that.  You're a remarkable part of my story.  I will miss you.  Thank you.  I can't say that enough.  I love you.  See you again soon. ",

I know it's going to be different for the road trip from a bus trip.  because the bus looks obviously it's a bus.  it's more cozy there's air conditioner here and it's organized.  it's not like the one we took from Lagos so I look forward to it.  I'm excited to get past Tugu.  at least I'm going to cross over to Tugu today.  so I'm excited.  so it's 10 hours drive from Accra to Lagos.  it's about 9.30 something AM so It's going to be a whole day on the road, but it's worth a try.  Let me just experience it for the second time, driving through West Africa by road.  So yeah, that's it.  And then they give food when you travel with them.  Here is rice and water.  So we have food to eat on the way.  So let's travel, guys.  So this is rice and stew and meat.  So let me eat guys.  Guys, peaceful is not the only answer. ",
