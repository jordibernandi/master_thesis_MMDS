Peter, thank you so much for being with us.  Let's start off simply here.  Why do you think Hong Kong, in your opinion, has become an emphasis in these trade talks? ",

But, you know, what really bothers me about the United States criticizing China and Hong Kong?  If you look at the index of economic freedom that the Heritage Foundation puts out every year, Hong Kong ranks number one.  Today, it's the freest economy in the world.  The United States ranks 12th on that list.  So, you know, I'm more concerned about the freedom of our own people.  So rather than worrying about the freest people in the world, how about if our leaders try to find a way to make Americans more free? ",

We have to make a deal where we do much better.  So does that sound like he's even trying to make a deal with that type of mentality?  Like, how can he expect to hammer out a phase one when he is blatantly saying that he doesn't want a fair deal? ",

I mean, Trump just wants the stock market to go up.  And as long as the stock market has gone up, he couldn't care less about a deal with China.  Maybe if the stock market really started to tank, then he might feel some type of pressure to actually deliver a deal.  But as long as he can make the market go up by talking about the prospects of a deal, then that's all Trump wants. ",

And going into year end, we generally have the Santa rally and a seasonally strong time of year for equities.  But will another escalation cause the market to crash?  How should traders position for this when there is so much uncertainty in the near term?  I mean, it seems like this should be causing markets to go down.

And so the markets are rising.  Just remember, for a while, people were worried about rate hikes.  Nobody is worried about rate hikes.  The Fed has taken all rate hikes off the table.  The Fed has made it clear that the only direction that rates can go is down.  They're either going to stay the same or they're going to go down.  And QE4 is now on autopilot in perpetuity.  So that's what the markets want.  They know that they're never going to have another rate hike and they're going to have money printing as far as the eye can see.  And so that's what's driving stocks.  And I guess that's going to continue to drive stocks until something causes that to change.  And something is going to happen because the U.S.  is headed for a worse economic disaster than the one we had in 2008.  And there's no way this is good for stocks. ",

Third quarter print on average, equities across the board are averaging 2.3% downwards.  And now we're going to 4Q and with tariffs on board, with consumer spending expected to be much, much slower, much more constricted this year.

And in fact, in a way, the bad news is good news again because it keeps the Fed in play, even though they've basically assured the markets that they're not going to do anything to hurt the markets.  But as far as the consumer is concerned, look, people keep talking about how the consumer has never been in better shape when the opposite is true.  The consumer is completely levered up.  He's got record amounts of debt.  And the only reason he can spend is because the Fed is keeping rates low enough so that credit continues to flow despite the lack of legitimate savings to finance it.  So this whole house of cards is going to come tumbling down.  And the consumer is going to be right in the center of that. ",

I mean, retail earnings have been kind of up and down, depending on what you're looking at, department stores down, Target and Best Buy kind of moving up.  But what are we going to see here as we head into the key holiday shopping season?  Yet what you're talking about is a lot of concern in the economy.  I mean, are we still going to see people spend that money come this week? ",

And certainly, the brick and mortar companies, the vast majority of them, continue to struggle.  I mean, look what's going on with the vacancy rates and leases and the earnings on most of those companies.  So a lot of Americans are doing what they can to squeeze every penny out of the dollars they're borrowing.  And so they're shopping online and looking for the best deal.  And I guess that's going to continue.  But remember, a lot of the stuff that we're buying, probably almost all the stuff that we're buying is imported.  We're not making it.  It's made in other countries.  So we're buying it on a national credit card as well as an individual credit card.  So whatever we spend just means larger trade deficits.  And that means the U.S.  economy is in an even more precarious position following holiday shopping than before. ",

Central banks around the world have been on a gold buying spree, pushing it to three-year highs.  So why are central banks now stockpiling and hoarding gold?

It doesn't mean it's going to start tomorrow.  Of course, it could.  But whether it starts next month, next year or sometime in the next several years, they need to have gold.  I mean, gold ownership is going to be key to preserving confidence in your currency.  And you have to back your currency by something real, not by somebody else's paper.  And so that's gold.  And I think what Poland is doing is a trend that we're seeing where it's not just that you want to own gold, but you want to own possession of your own gold.  You don't want to trust a third party with your gold. ",
