            "text": "Hey there!  It's ya girl, Zee, from transvoicelessons.com.  And in this short video, I'm gonna teach you how to feminize a cough.  Now, first off, you have to understand that the human brain interacts with sound in three dimensions.  Time, amplitude, and frequency.  In fact, every sound that you've ever heard in your entire life can be perfectly recreated with some values of time, amplitude, or frequency.  Now, when your brain hears a sound, it quickly decomposes and deconstructs that sound into a few key events.  The attack, the decay, the sustain, and the release.  We call this an envelope, okay?  Now, each sound has a slightly different behavior throughout all of these variables.  but your brain weighs the attack of a sound much heavier, which means it's much more important than the rest of the sound, okay?  And you can feminize your coughs very easily by simply replacing the attack on your coughs with a short burst of high pitch, like so.  And then you just put that in front of a cough.  Do you hear it?  Yeah, it doesn't matter how I cough.  If the attack of it sounds cute and feminine, then the rest of the cough will be rendered in a way that sounds cute and feminine to the ear because the brain weighs the attack of a sound so heavily, okay?  So here's a simple way that you can start doing this.  First, let's just take a very high-pitched kind of sound and just go eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Now, then do that and then cough very gently after it, eh.  And then slowly work on decreasing the time between the two so that the sounds are one.  Now that was a bit over exaggerated, of course, right?  Like I'm not going to be coughing like that in person, but even with just the softest amount of alteration to the attack of a cough, you can quickly reprogram the person's brain who hears you into understanding that your cough is feminine and cute and wonderful.  Okay.  I hope this helps you all.  If you have any questions, please just let me know down in the comments.
