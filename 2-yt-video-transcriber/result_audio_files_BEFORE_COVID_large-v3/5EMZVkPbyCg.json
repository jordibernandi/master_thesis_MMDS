            "text": "Anyone familiar with Jack knows how much he enjoys life and loves to have a good time.  It's difficult to find a picture of him where he isn't smiling.  Here's one of his first.  And this one where he's practicing his Billy Graham pose as a young Bible school student.  He's always ready for a good laugh and not afraid to provide one at his own expense.  It's just the way he is.  And it's this self-effacing, down-to-earth, real people quality that has drawn so many to his ministry and to Christ.  His work began when he was just 17, and his parents announced they were traveling to the mission fields of Belgium.  One can only imagine his feelings as they turned to leave and he realized he'd have to make it completely on his own.  He'd already gained quite a reputation as a musician, so those initial years of his work found him performing on his accordion with the likes of Billy Graham, George Beverly Shea, Cliff Barrows, Leonard Thompson, and at Youth for Christ meetings.  These early years in Bible college laid the foundation for another enduring Vanempie trademark, his amazing memory. ",

            "text": "He'd prepared himself well.  He had scripture committed to memory.  He had his music.  What else could a dedicated young minister ask for?  of course, a wife.  And so typical of the Lord, he provided just the right woman to blend perfectly with a man.  Throughout the years, they've shared it all, the music, the ministry, and the cats.  For up to 40 weeks per year, 12 years in a row, it was life on the road in church crusades as ambassadors for Christ.  This was followed by area-wide city crusades.  television specials, radio, and now weekly television programs.  All the time standing shoulder to shoulder with Jack, Rexella has provided the perfect blend of helpmate, homemaker, confidant, and truest friend.  The two are inseparable and as single-minded in their dedication to the Lord as two people can be.  As Dr.  Van Impey has said, I wouldn't be in the ministry today without her.  And to be sure, the ministry would have taken on a much different look without Rexella, area-wide crusades in the state's top 260.  Many of these were broadcast as nationwide television specials from places like Carnegie Hall, the stage of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, the Waikiki Shell in Honolulu, the Los Angeles Convention Center, and many others.  This U.S.  crusade circuit was interrupted from time to time with a worldwide outreach that began in South America and took the Vanipis to 50 countries.  The early 70s saw the start of a radio outreach that within several years was being translated into 83 languages around the globe.  During this flurry of Christian evangelism, some 10 million people had attended the Van Eppie's mass crusades, with 600,000 being saved or restored to Christ.  Then it all abruptly stopped.  The Lord had shown Jack that it was time to speak out about a disease growing in the body of Christ, a disease which threatened to tear it apart.  In his book, Heart Disease in Christ's Body, and in a courageous keynote address to his peers at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention, Dr.  Vanipi exposed the senseless discrimination and separatist attitudes which had infiltrated Christianity.  This lone voice speaking out for true Christian unity and fellowship with all of God's people would forever have as its centerpiece Christ's unfathomable love for all. ",
