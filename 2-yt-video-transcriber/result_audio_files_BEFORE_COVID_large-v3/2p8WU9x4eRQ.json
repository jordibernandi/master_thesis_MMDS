            "text": "Thank you.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  You take a picture of me, Matt.  Hmm?  You can stare at the camera.  Something.  Ribs or what?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Hm?  What?  That's doing nothing to me.  You took the pictures of what?  Hm?  You got us taking cameras from pictures.  You're taking pictures of what?  Of what?  Whatever we can see.  No, you got us trying to leave right now.  Do what you have to do.  Call the cops.  What do you mean, to leave?  No, I'm on public street.  But you don't know, you're taking pictures of our building.  You're on public street, dude.  So what?  Don't take pictures of our building.  Hey, don't fucking touch me, dude.  I'm on a public street, don't fucking touch me.  Don't call the cops if you have a problem.  Don't take pictures of my shit.  I'll take pictures of whatever the fuck I want to take pictures of, dude.  Bro, stop taking pictures of me, dawg.  Don't fucking touch me, dude.  Stop taking fucking pictures.  That's battery right there.  I'm not touching you.  You just touched my camera.  I didn't touch you.  You touched my camera.  Get away from my property.  I don't have to.  This is public sidewalk right here.  But you're taking pictures of our building.  You know what we do?  I don't even know what you do.  But do you know what we do, though?  I don't give a shit.  what you have to say to me.  Do you know what we do?  You have a problem.  Call the cops.  Why are you being like this, though?  I didn't come up to you and start touching you and trying to intimidate you.  I didn't touch you.  You just touched my camera.  I just told you to get away from my property.  You don't have no authority over me.  No, you don't.  Because.  This is our building.  What authority do you have over me on the public fucking street?  This is our building.  What authority do you?  This is our building.  I don't fucking care.  You need to fucking care.  Or what?  Fuck you cursing us.  What authority do you have over another man on the street?  This is our fucking building.  I don't care.  This is our fucking building.  Okay.  You don't be taking no fucking pictures, bro.  Or what?  Simple as that.  Or what?  Simple as that.  What, you're going to attack me or something?  Do you need to lose your job?  Nobody said that.  shit, bro.  You want to lose your job?  Then get the fuck out of my face.  I won't lose my job.  Who the fuck are you cursing at?  Don't call the cops, dude.  Think you somebody sweet and special?  Shit, just leave me alone.  I didn't come up to you.  You think you're somebody special?  You're the one trying to tell a grown man what the fuck to do on the sidewalk.  First of all, you're up here taking pictures in my building.  I know.  I'm done talking to you.  You fucking idiot.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'll get better pictures from the side lot.  What?  I'll get better pictures from the fucking side lot.  What makes you guys think you can tell grown men what to do on the sidewalk?  We don't have to answer you.  No, you can ask.  We don't have to answer.  Sorry, I just hear noise when you talk.  You want to bet on that?  You want to put some money on that?  The cops are going to come and they're going to drive away.  I'm not even going to give them my license.  They're going to tell you guys to leave us alone.  How much money do you want to bet?  A hundred bucks, dude.  Put your money where your mouth is.  I'm telling you right now.  On camera, a hundred bucks.  What a pussy, dude.  You can't put your money where your mouth is?  You bounce.  You're on the job, right?  You should probably be doing something.  Instead of harassing people on the sidewalk.  Did the city pay you to patrol the sidewalk?  Who fucking cares, dude?  Well, go care inside.  I don't fucking care what you think.  Hey, get away from him, dude.  I'm just like, this is my fault.  I shouldn't have gone like that.  You got to do your thing.  I'm going to try to do my job.  Later.  Later.  Okay.  Let's go, bro.  Let's go.  See ya.  See ya.  This is sad.  You guys need to learn the law.  Really.  They're going to drive away.  We're not even going to give them our IDs.  They're going to tell you guys to leave us alone.  One thing, you're going to hit the like button on some gay videos, man.  This guy got a laugh out of it.  I have a sense of humor, guys.  It's healthy.  Shit.  That guy on the left is the only guy who's been cool.  With the slick hair.  Hey, what's your name?  You're the only guy who's been cool.  Let me say hi to you.  David.  Okay.  Hey, just so you know, you're allowed to take pictures of whatever the fuck goes on the sidewalk.  So let your buddies, let them know.  Doesn't matter.  The law doesn't matter.  I mean, it doesn't care about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When the cops come, you guys are going to just burn them?  You think the cops could trespass where your eyes go?  Same thing with the camera.  It doesn't matter if the building is private or not.  If you don't want people to see it, put a wall up.  Oh, he's making too much sense and logic out here.  Better get my buddy inside so I still see.  Very observant.  That is a metal tube he's holding.  You should go for detective.  Very good.  They are shining the light up here.  Yeah, that's funny.  Great, now these guys think that they're right.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no, the cops are coming.  I better run.  Oh, shit, it's a helicopter.  I better run.  Damn, dude.  I have to say, it looks pretty cool with the shadow.  The tree shadow's moving all around.  Look at that.  It looks badass.  It must have nothing better to do.  Here comes the heroes!  They're on their way, don't trip!  They'll be here shortly!  Because it's Dunbar and there's a helicopter, I probably won't give the top the sound treatment.  I'll just tell them, hey, we're just taking pictures.  Because they probably never had this happen.  Obviously.  I'm not dumb enough to shine a flashlight on a police helicopter.  Oh, I don't know.  There's some kind of... There's a log inside, I'm pretty sure.  Because he's low enough that he might actually get blinded.  But... Woo!  That's funny.  Woo!  Here they come!  I wonder how many dollars in gas they're wasting.  What?  No, they're making a waste of all their gas with the Dr.  Burns.  This guy's stupid or what?  Next time you need help, they're not even going to come, dude.  They can fall 9-1-1 this way.  That's what you're doing.  And you guys are the ones with all the weapons.  What are you scared of?  Here they come.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  They're flying in.  Call 3.  They're coming.  Call 3.  That's funny, dude.  What did they tell them is going on?  I would call Cerritos PD just to say, hey, where are the photographers over here?  What's going on?  But I don't know what the hell.  They might round that corner any second.  Bloomfield, that's where they are.  Let's see if we can talk him into it.  How you doing?  Sorry?  Can we take like five minutes for the pictures?  We're taking pictures.  It's kind of newsworthy.  It's got a cool camera.  Can we just take a few pictures and then we're gone?  Until I finish my report.  What's that?  I'll give you until I finish my report.  Okay.  Oh, gotcha, gotcha.  All right.  He said he's going to write it for me.  All right.  Damn it!  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yes, sir. ",
