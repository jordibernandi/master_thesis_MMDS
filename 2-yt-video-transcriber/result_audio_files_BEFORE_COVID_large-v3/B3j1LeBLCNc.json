            "text": "Hello everybody.  Welcome to The Political Vigilante.  My name is Graham Elwood and you're watching The Political Vigilante.  So I've been talking about this as soon as the Jeffrey Epstein case came out and they revealed his black book and he has wired homes of his to videotape and record in his planes that he has kept evidence.  Right.  And former victims of his who have come forward and said that he told them, oh, I need I keep a ledger of all these people because I'm going to need this.  I'm going to need to get out of jail free card.  And I've been saying they're going to try to have him killed.  The minute his bail was denied, I go, they're either going to just sweep his case away like they did in 2008 and give him a slap on the wrist.  But since this case, they're kind of not letting it go.  And because you're hearing Trump, you're hearing Clinton, you're hearing Prince, I think it's Prince William.  You're hearing someone from the royal family.  You're hearing Alan Dershowitz.  You're hearing all these high profile people.  So when they talk about the royal family, they talk about that woman, Maxwell, who was his like madam.  She's part of the royal family.  So these are very, very powerful people.  And I said, they're going to try to have him killed if he's in prison.  Oh, this just happened.  Jeffrey Epstein found injured in New York City jail after possible suicide attempts.  Semiconscious with marks on his neck, investigators are trying to piece together what actually happened.  This literally just went down earlier.  This is Wednesday, July 24th.  Epstein may have tried to hang himself, while a third source cautioned that the injuries were not serious.  in question.  if Epstein might be as a way to try to get a transfer.  And they've even implicated that there was this convicted cop, Taglioni, who was convicted of a cocaine ring and killing people, that he might have... So either... Epstein is faking this to get transferred or is an actual hit on him?  Like we don't trust, obviously Epstein is a horrible human being and a filthy liar and whatever else.  But do we put it past anybody to try to have him killed?  Of course not.  He has evidence, hard evidence of all these powerful people, right?  All of these powerful people.  Bill Clinton ditched Secret Service on multiple Lolita Express flights.  Ditched Secret Service.  Bill Clinton released a statement a couple weeks ago when Epstein first said, I've only was on four of his flights.  That's not true.  There's flight logs that he was on 26.  So already Bill Clinton's lying, which, you know, he just does that 10 times before breakfast.  But he ditched the Secret Service several times.  This goes so wide, people have no idea.  Why do you think Trump's doing all this racism stuff?  Trump's trying to distract.  They're all trying to distract.  The Mueller report comes out.  Mueller just does that thing.  that came out where Mueller was like, it's outside of my purview, and he's like fumbling around.  What page of the report that I wrote was that on?  All a distraction because this is the real story.  layer upon layer to protect the boss.  This is a story, this came out on the 14th.  And then on the 15th, stacks of cash, dozens of diamonds, fake passports found in Epstein's safe.  Fake Saudi passport, diamonds, layer upon layer.  He had several women that were recruiters that would go outside of schools and typically get underage girls and a modeling agency.  Yeah.  When these stories came out, everyone's like, what else does he wear?  Are there hard drives with video footage?  He kept a ledger of everything.  There's crazy evidence.  He's going to.  they got to kill him before he makes a deal because that's what happened.  This isn't going to go away.  So he's going to make a, try to make a deal and then they're going to, I mean, they got to kill him before he makes this deal, before this evidence comes out.  I hope all the evidence comes out.  I hope everybody, but they're going to either, I'm telling you, I find this very, I said it, I told you, I said, when they denied his bail, and he offered up a half a million dollars.  He goes, I'll give you $500 million if you'll just let me stay in my $75 million mansion in New York City.  The judge denied him bail because all this stuff, they said he was a flight risk, and rightfully so.  District Judge Richard Berman said he will announce a decision.  Yeah.  So that came, this was the 15th.  they found this evidence.  On the 18th they said nope.  They said nope.  He's a flight risk.  They denied his bail.  That's when they got worried, the ruling class, the ruling elites, these pedophile billionaires.  Human trafficking is a multi-billion dollar industry.  It's not just one guy.  There is a network, and he recruited these girls for himself and his wealthy buddies.  That means a lot of people had to know about it.  This right here, layer upon layer to protect the boss in this story, there was a butler that would clean up after these and would always have $2,000 in cash on him to pay these girls off.  There was his assistant that would get him masseuses and one time he got mad at her because she brought a 23 year old.  That was too old for him.  All these people have known about this guy for a long time.  And you knew about this and you did nothing?  His butler?  Oh, he's no longer alive, by the way.  He passed away.  Weird.  Weird.  Really weird.  Pay close attention, folks.  Because they're going to try to kill him or shut this up.  And every day there's going to be some new crazy distraction.  If they got hard evidence about Trump, you better believe we're going into Iran that day.  And Trump and the Clintons will get together and say, we got to attack Iran.  Watch.  Just watch.  Thanks for watching, everybody.  Pay close attention because, Epstein, they're going to try to kill him.  I do not see this guy standing trial.  They're going to try to kill him.  They're going to kill him.  They already tried.  Thanks for watching the show.  Please support it at rockfin.com.  slash grandmelwood, R-O-K-F-I-N.  The link is in the show notes below.
