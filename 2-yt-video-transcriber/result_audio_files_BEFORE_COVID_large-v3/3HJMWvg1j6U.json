            "text": "Breaking news out of Israel.  Israel is set for snap elections after Netanyahu fails to form government for the first time in history.  There's a lot to explain here in this prophetic update.  Let's start with the first thing for American audiences.  What does it mean for Netanyahu to fail to form government for the first time?  Of course, if you're not in a parliamentary system, you don't understand what this would mean.  In America, you elect a president, you elect congressmen, and they just go into office.  Under the parliamentary system, you have to have a majority to form government.  And because Israel has so many parties, just take a look at this.  Here's a half a pie of... 120 seats in parliament.  you've got to get obviously over 60 to have a majority and you can see there's about 12 different parties here that are represented ranging from the right to the ultra right such as the united torah and the left like labor and then ultra left and then it goes all the way.  i guess it's off the chart left when it's arab.  and so you've got so many parties that they never.  no party ever forms the majority.  so in order to form government what they have to do is create a coalition.  so we're used to this in Australia.  they're used to it in Israel and for the first time the winners couldn't agree with each other and they give quite a few different reasons for this and we're going to explore this because it definitely has prophetic implication.  first let's look at the prophetic patterns.  this is quite amazing.  it's been seven weeks since the election and seventy seven members of the Knesset voted to dissolve parliament.  so they never form parliament because they have internal friction.  now what is it about?  there's a couple of different explanations given.  first is Avigdor Lieberman a former ally of Netanyahu opposed a controversial military draft bill.  So they call it military recruitment, you might call it conscription.  Basically the ultra-orthodox parties and the ultra-orthodox men prefer to do nothing but study commentaries on the Torah.  That's what they want to do all day.  And most of the men in Israel are secular and they go into the military.  And so this is where the conflict is happening.  The ultra-Orthodox don't want to go into the military.  And because Avigdor Lieberman is a secularist, He does not believe that this is fair.  And a lot of people in Israel doesn't believe it's fair.  So this is giving us an important picture about Israel that many Christians don't realize.  is Israel, the Jewish state, is not that Jewish.  It's not the state of the ancient biblical time.  And they're not living under Mosaic law.  They're not operating a Sanhedrin court.  They don't follow the Bible.  So a small percentage of people would follow the Sabbath in the strictest way that the Bible says and especially as the rabbis say.  So Avigdor Lieberman is a very interesting opponent to this.  Because Netanyahu has won based on the support of the ultra-Orthodox parties.  And what they want is exemption from the military draft.  Lieberman is saying, no, this is a secular state and we don't want a religious state.  We don't want these religious exemptions.  And Lieberman accused Netanyahu of selling out to the interests of the religious right.  We're natural partners for a right-wing government, he said, of the Likud leader ahead of Wednesday's vote.  But we won't be partners in a religious law government.  And the religious law, the application of the religious law is called the Halakha.  When you take the word of God and you apply it to every facet of life, the Jewish word for that is the Halakha, their religious law.  And this is very important prophetically because you have to have Halakha to build the third temple.  You have to have Halakha to have the persecution of the Messianic Jews and the Christians that are described in the book of Revelation.  So it's very interesting that these things are basically being delayed.  If you understand prophecy you will see that these things are delaying it and it's creating a very long year.  This is what I've said about 2019 is.  it's going to be a long year especially for the Jews and it looks like especially for Netanyahu and even for Jared Kushner.  Interesting patterns of seven, 77 votes to dissolve the government seven weeks after the election.  And by Israeli rules, they have to give at least three months of campaigning.  So it's 100 days away before the next election.  And Israel is now in a state of uncertainty.  The number 7, I describe the meaning of it in The Divine Code, a prophetic encyclopedia of numbers.  So you get a lot of things about Donald Trump in 7 and what the Bible says about the Messiah in 7.  Very interesting indeed about this.  Now, the best article that I found is actually on ABC about this.  This has a lot of explanation and alternative to what you just heard.  Not only is there infighting among Netanyahu's allies and disagreement over the proposed bills, there's disagreement over bills to protect Netanyahu from prosecution.  Now, this might be the other issue.  rather than concede the task of forming government to one of his rivals which is what normally would happen.  if you don't allow the government to dissolve and take an election then the opposition leader could become prime minister and form his version of the government.  but obviously the Likud party didn't want that and so they just voted last minute before midnight to dissolve parliament altogether.  so it's a political move.  Netanyahu said I didn't spare any effort to avoid unnecessary elections but he's obviously blaming a Viktor Lieberman.  And this re-election that's going to happen in 100 days is going to cost millions and millions of dollars.  So it's unnecessary, it's wasteful, he says, because the people had their say.  All right, let's see what the opposition leader Benny Gantz says.  He angrily accused Netanyahu of self-preservation.  He says Netanyahu opted for three crazy months of a new campaign and millions of wasted dollars over new elections because he is legally incapacitated by looming indictments.  There is no other reason, Gantz said.  The country now plunges into a new election campaign that will last at least three months under Israeli law.  And the tentative date is set for September 17.  This is very hopeful for me because the number 17 is the number of victory.  So because of that, if that was one clue, I would say that Netanyahu will win again.  although he might have the same problem again of forming government.  And 17 is also going to be the election day for Donald Trump's second term, but it's going to be 17 of Hezbon, 17 on the Hebrew calendar.  Okay, so that's the next November election.  Very interesting.  Both of them are very linked.  Both of them have these patterns of 7s and 17 following them.  The campaign looks to complicate Netanyahu's precarious legal standing.  Israel's Attorney General has recommended pressing criminal charges against him in three separate corruption cases, pending a hearing scheduled for October.  Even if Netanyahu wins, it's unlikely he'll be able to form a government.  All right, and the political uncertainty could spell trouble for the White House.  Mid-East peace efforts, and we'll come back to that.  Obviously, that's one of the big prophetic signs that we're looking for is a peace deal in the Middle East.  Now, I've said over many videos that it's going to be a long year.  The reason is... One of the prophetic codes is the Book of Psalms.  The Book of Psalms seems to correspond year after year from 1900 onwards.  It just seems to correspond to its matching psalm.  So Psalm 119 corresponds to 2019.  And Psalm 119 is an especially Jewish psalm.  It's got this pattern of 22 stanzas.  There are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet.  Jacob, or the namesake of the nation of Israel, was the 22nd person from Adam.  And each of the stanzas that start with a Hebrew aleph bet, like this, aleph bet, gimel, dalet, he.  Okay, all of these are repeated eight times in each stanza, forming 176 verses.  And... I said that this Psalm, if it's prophetic of 2019, tells us at least a couple of things. ",
