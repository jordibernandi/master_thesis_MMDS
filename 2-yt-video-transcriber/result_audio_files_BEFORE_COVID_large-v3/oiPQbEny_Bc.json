In Tulsa, where we've been doing it, we've got it to the point where when people call in, the officers just drive by and they know who we are, and we're on our way.  They don't even make contact.  Why?  Well, it's a Second Amendment audit.  The barrel's short in length.  Mm-hmm.  And with the... foregrip, that makes it a pistol.  So, yeah, with the grip, the special grip that it has on there.  This one?  No, no, the one that would be at the farthest up highest, the buttstock, what you would call a buttstock, that makes it a pistol with a shortened barrel.  Okay.  So if you had a buttstock like yours on there without the strap, that would make it a rifle.  So with the buttstock that I have it on it there, it is designed to be held with one hand.
