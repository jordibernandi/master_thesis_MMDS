Now I'm adding this clip in after I finish the video because I thought it was important to point out that this was a very very difficult video to make and I dare say it's going to be quite difficult for some people to watch.  Now I get asked frequently in my comment section and in direct messages, am I an atheist?  So I thought in today's video, I would attempt to answer this question through the medium of interpretive dance.  Actually no, I've come across a video which is pretty disgusting, so I thought I would use this video to illustrate why I don't subscribe to any religion in particular.  Now before anybody gets all bent out of shape, I know that not all religious people are homophobic pieces of crap, but this guy is.  Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of Playing a Blinder with me, the Creaky Blinder.  Now I fully expect a little bit of backlash from this video, but I'm gonna make it anyway, because I would rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I'm not.  So before you judge me and fly down to the comments section to abuse me, watch the whole video and then form your opinion from there.  I'm not saying that all religious people are like this, but this guy is one of the reasons why I have issues with religion.  when I say this guy it sounds like I'm blaming him in particular.  I mean people like this guy because what I don't like about it?  if you want to believe in something that's absolutely fine.  believe in whatever you want.  just do not try to force your belief onto me or other people and most certainly don't mock and judge people for what they believe in while you're trying to push your belief onto them.  Unless, of course, we're talking about flat earthers, then please feel free to mock and push your beliefs onto them as much as you want to because they are 100% wrong.  So before we make a start on the video, don't forget to subscribe and turn on bell notifications so that you know when I'm putting out these videos.  But anyway, let's get on with it. ",

So he believes in something called hard preaching, which is preaching outdated biblical verses which could be seen as offensive.  And from everything I've read about him so far, Yeah, offensive is a very accurate term.  So he bullies people for the way they think and act.  He makes false accusations about people.  He uses childish terms like sissy to describe people and claims it as biblical language.  He attacks other preachers that won't preach against homosexuality, abortion or other religions.  He attacks other people's religions.  He attacks other Christians if they don't believe in the Bible exactly the way he does.  He mocks anyone that disagrees with or questions him.  And he claims... He claims that Hollywood actors like Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio are all... because some of them could be considered to look slightly effeminate, although I would call it good-looking.  And he... This is absolutely disgusting.
