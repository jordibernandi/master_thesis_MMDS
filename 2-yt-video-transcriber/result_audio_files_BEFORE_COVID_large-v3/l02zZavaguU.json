Basically, it takes some time, but I think first you allow little bits of deception into the way you think about the world.  And over time, as you sit in front of the camera day after day, you don't realize, but with each morning, as you more and more adapt the talking points that come from higher up, you slowly lose the part of yourself that noticed that there was a difference, that you then create a different version of yourself.  There's the version of yourself that's on camera.  That's the person who reads what's in the prompter.  And then there's the version of yourself that's decent and kind and honest in your personal dealings.  And increasingly, you view the person you are on camera in this studio as not you, but the you that's on Fox News, the you that's doing a job, that you that made compromises along the way to be this person, that understands that there's trade-offs between the money, that ultimately you view yourself as being a good person who makes some compromises, not a compromised person who occasionally does some good.  And over time, As you repeatedly violate the basic tenets of who you are as a person, as you repeatedly undermine your sense of right and wrong, you get further and further away from even being able to hear the difference to the point where you could say literally anything, where you can sit in front of a camera.
