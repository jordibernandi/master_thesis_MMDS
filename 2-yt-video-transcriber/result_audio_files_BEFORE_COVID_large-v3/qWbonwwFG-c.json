When handling foreign affairs, we might all be in imminent danger.  But as long as he gets reelected, who cares?  This is just a rough draft.  We can punch this up.  Who can schmooze like the Don?  Hate fake news like the Don?  When they charge individuals who's number one?  And guess what?  Now he's running in 2020.  Go out and vote for the Don.  His crimes are fine.  The laws are jokes.  His lies are all true.  And the truth is a hoax. ",

Yes, that Don.  In 2016, he relied on his daddy in Russia to help him pull through.  But this time he vows it's America first, and that's why he's relying on you.  He's especially lousy at procreating.  May we present our own fake president?  Tell me, who could ignore this publicity whore?  Sure, he's shady, unfit, and polite, full of shit.  Just a gangster, a crook, and a con.  Even so, pound for pound, he's the best guy around.  If you don't count his blatant disregard for national security or his textbook narcissistic personality disorder, multiple allegations of sexual harassment, propensity for thinly veiled racist and misogynistic behavior, not to mention the fact that he just got impeached for abuse of power and obstructing Congress.
