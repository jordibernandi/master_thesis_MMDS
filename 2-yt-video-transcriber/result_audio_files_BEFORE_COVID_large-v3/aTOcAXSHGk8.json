I think if one is sort of reading the tea leaves of how people are positioning, it seems more than likely that she was the source of these allegations, anonymous allegations as they were when they were printed.  that somebody had pressured her to basically go easy on SNC-Lavalin.  So it would be unlikely if you were moved to resign your Cabinet seat over that.  It's hard to see how you then come back into Cabinet on any kind of deal, but we shall see.  But what I think everyone wants is to hear her side of the story.  We've been getting selective versions of it line by line from the Prime Minister on days that it suits him.  But we're obviously not going to get anything close to an understanding of the story until we hear from her. ",

Again, if you're trying to sort of work back the logic of this, you're not going to lose somebody of that stature in the government.  I mean, this is a very unusually central person in any government.  and unusually close to the Prime Minister.  So he wouldn't be going unless, I think, unless they anticipated some rather bad news to come.  And if you look at the kinds of things he said in his resignation letter where he talked about defending his reputation, he talked about people had accused him of being the person who had pressured her when I actually haven't seen his name being used specifically.  And when he talks about his relationship with Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Attorney General, as having been close and supportive, You put all that together, it sounds like they're anticipating that Xi would say something about him having pressured her.  I don't know that for a fact, but just surmising from that.  And that is, I guess, the sort of thing that they didn't think they could survive in public relations terms.  He denies it, of course, and nobody can say for sure.  But it obviously wouldn't look good on the government, and that must have been part of the calculation. ",
