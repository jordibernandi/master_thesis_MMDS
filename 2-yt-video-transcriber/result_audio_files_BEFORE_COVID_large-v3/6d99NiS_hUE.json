            "text": "Shalom.  This week we are reading the Torah portion of Ki Tisa, when you take a census of the children of Israel, the ninth Torah portion in the book of Shemot, Exodus, beginning with verse 11 of chapter 30.  The Parsha begins with G-d's relating to Moshe a number of commandments that are connected to the tabernacle.  The half-shackle census which serves as a contribution by all of Israel to the Holy Temple, whose funds are used to purchase the communal offerings.  The copper laver, which is the first sacred vessel that will be used every day by the kohanim officiating in the Holy Temple, every morning, to sanctify themselves from its water.  The anointment oil used to sanctify the items that G-d has commanded for the Temple.  Incense offering.  The designation of Betzalel and Oliav.  as the head craftsman and the eternal covenant of the Sabbath.  When Hashem is finished speaking with Moshe on Mount Sinai, He gives Moshe the two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of G-d.  And then, the remaining three chapters, the majority of our Torah portion, deal entirely with the fiasco of the golden calf.  The people's mistake, Aaron's role, G-d's anger, Moshe's prayer, his reaction and confrontation, the aftermath and punishment, the success of Moshe's prayer and intervention on behalf of his people Israel, his very amazing encounter with G-d, Moshe's second ascent and the second tablets, 13 attributes of mercy, G-d's promise that His covenant with Israel is sealed, and the new radiance of Moshe.  And of course this is the Torah portion that testifies to Moshe's great unparalleled level of humility and selflessness, as he told G-d, if you forgive their sin, but if not, erase me now from your book that you have written.  This is a man who not only is very close to G-d, but who loved his people more than life itself.  When Moshe prayed on behalf of his people, G-d had to ask his leave, his permission to punish the people in 32 verse 10, and now desist from Me, let My anger flare up against them, and I shall annihilate them, and I shall make you a great nation.  And Moshe did not grant permission.  All this takes place 40 days after the Sinai revelation.  It's the 16th day of Tammuz.  All this time Moshe has been on Mount Sinai, not eating, not drinking, not sleeping, but receiving the commandments that we've been reading in the Torah portions of Yitro and Mishpatim and Terumah and Tetzaveh, and being taught all of their details, and now, 40 days later, under the influence of the group known as the mixed multitude who accompanied Israel out of Egypt, now the golden calf is created.  Moshe breaks the tablets before the eyes of Israel, and the shock nation is jolted into awareness.  As the sages teach, one of the major objectives of this test which Israel failed, was to provide an opportunity for national teshuvah, repentance.  It was to teach them, and to show the world, a new concept.  Israel repents and teaches that an entire nation can repent united as one man.  Moshe pleads with G-d to turn aside from his anger over the golden calf episode, and on Yom Kippur G-d replied to Moshe, I have forgiven, even of you as you have spoken.  But the episode of the golden calf is more than a perplexing enigma.  It is one of the most difficult sections in all of Torah.  The story, as outlined in our parasha, defies our understanding.  It simply can't be neatly defined, dismissed, minimalized or contained.  It describes a spiritual failure, a disaster of incomprehensible proportions.  Indeed, our sages teach that the severity of the sin was so far-reaching and inclusive and destructive that it remains the root source of perpetual misfortune throughout time, sending out concentric shock waves with consequences that literally resonate forever.  Every generation, say our sages, is somehow affected by this sin to some extent and suffers from its consequences.  All anguish and misfortune have their root in the golden calf.  And that is to say as well, not only that each generation continues to suffer as a result of this grievous incident, but that every generation, in its way, bears responsibility to be part of the tikkun, to participate in the fixing of this error.  But what was the nature of this horrendous blunder, its basis, its manifestation, how did it come to be and how are we to understand it?  How could it have happened so soon after the sign of revelation, when all the nation heard the voice of the living G-d declare, I am Hashem your G-d who has taken you out of the land of Egypt from the house of slavery, you shall have no other G-ds in My presence, you shall not make yourself a carved image nor any likeness of that which is in the heavens above, or on the earth below or in the waters beneath the earth, you shall not prostrate yourself to them nor worship them.  Indeed the nation is still standing at the foot of Mount Sinai.  So what is this?  Some sort of bizarre optical illusion?  Or mass hysteria?  Some case of mistaken identity?  According to the deepest understanding and close examination and understanding of the verses, the creation and worship of the golden calf was not an act of actual intentional idolatry initiated by Israel, as if the children of Israel actually thought that this thing which was just now created was G-d.  This unfortunate and terrible incident was about something else, something more subtle.  We read, as chapter 32 opens, the people saw that Moshe had delayed in descending the mountain, and the people gathered around Aaron and said to him, rise up, make for us gods that will go before us, for this man Moses who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what became of him.  This verse alludes to us that it was not Am Yisrael, the people of Israel, but the Am, the people.  It was the initiative and instigation of the Erev Rav, the mixed multitude in their midst, who demanded G-d's Elohim as a substitute for Moshe.  The mixed multitude took advantage of Israel's feeling of vulnerability to trip them up.  Moshe was late according to all calculations, doubt began to creep in, he wasn't back yet, maybe he wasn't coming back, maybe he's dead.  And they caused Israel to panic, to go into a tailspin of utter panic, because the man, Moses, who brought us out of Egypt, we don't know what became of him.  Wait, the man, Moshe, who brought them out of Egypt?  Indeed was it Moses who brought Israel out of Egypt, or was it G-d?  Why is this statement associating the exodus from Egypt with Moshe rather than with Hashem Himself, when Moshe was no more than an instrument, Hashem's agent?  And of the created kaf, they said, these are your G-ds who brought you up?  This is the one who brought you out?  This thing that you just created has the same relationship with G-d as Moshe?  This is the secret of what they were looking for.  A replacement for Moshe.  So this calf was somehow a reborn Moses, a reborn intermediary.  Israel was swept under this illusion.  After everything they had been through and witnessed, they quickly fell back into old patterns and assumptions that G-d needs an intermediary.  Emunah, belief in Hashem who has no form, who is endless, takes a great deal of spiritual maturity.  They weren't there yet.  The children of Israel pined for an intermediary who would stand in for Moshe.  It wasn't a god they were looking for, they needed a substitute, something, an object, a point upon which to fixate, to take Moshe's place.  If they truly understood who Moshe was, how could they ever think that some object could take his place?  The true nature of this sin, on a deep level, was giving in to vulnerability, which led to the sin of subjectivity.  They wanted Aaron to make a Moses for them that they could not lose, they were panic-stricken, and felt vulnerable and without a link to G-d, the same G-d whose greatness they perceived forty days earlier.  They thought that their relationship with G-d was linked to Moshe, and they came to the erroneous conclusion that if Moshe is gone, they must make a new one for themselves.  They totally misunderstood who Moshe was and what their relationship with him was all about.  As if all Moshe was to them was a channel or a talisman, some sort of icon.  And this was their sin, because these ideas are diametrically opposed to the fundamental Torah ideas of G-d, man, and the relationship between G-d and man, and man and G-d, which had been made so clear to them at Sinai with the warning, words, I am Hashem your G-d.  This is a complex teaching.  I have found the teachings and commentary of the great Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch on this parasha to be invaluable in their timeless insight, and this message today is greatly inspired by his words.  Yes, they were still at Sinai, where just a little over a month ago they heard G-d proclaim, I am Hashem your G-d, and you shall have no other G-ds before Me.  They clearly didn't understand what this means.  So open up your heart in the deepest way.  This is a fundamental difference between the Jewish view and the heathen view of man's relationship with G-d, and this is the recurring tragedy in every generation of golden calf mentality.  Man thinks he can make G-ds for himself, that he can raise up a man or an idea or an image or an institution or power as his highest ideal.  He chooses to worship this object and then he can think that G-d would invest it with G-dliness.  He actually thinks that this is normal, that man should make G-ds for himself.  He thinks in order to ensure his future that he should elevate things of his own making to represent the highest idea he can form of G-d, to show his homage, to win his grace, to show his dependence on him.  These delusions have dominated the non-Jewish world from time immemorial.  But man accomplishes nothing through the creation of his own gods, gods of his own comfort zone.  Man cannot make gods for himself, he doesn't need to make gods for himself.  By representing God in a corporeal form, he has not brought God closer to himself, he has degraded the very idea of the reality of God.  But on the contrary, by teaching himself to become a spiritual and moral being, and by striving to live according to the will of G-d, he brings himself closer to G-d in every aspect of his life.  That's the goal of a life based on Torah.  Man strives to assure himself of G-d's protection and guidance, but his challenge and task is not to have influence over G-d, but to control himself.  He doesn't achieve nearness to G-d by petty and myopic and foolish attempts to manipulate Divine forces.  That's the heathen way.  His efforts should be concerned with what sort of man he wants to be, what his deeds will be like, what kind of person he is becoming.  He will influence his fate only by living his life in harmony with G-d's will.  There is no procedure through which G-d could or would become submissive to one's own will.  The same thing is true regarding the korbanot.  the offerings brought to the altar in the Holy Temple.  Torah teaches us that offerings to the one G-d are brought in obedience to His laws, and the bringer submits himself, recognizes, acknowledges, gives appreciation that there is something greater and higher than man, the Creator of man, who beckons and invites man to strive to rise higher.  But heathen offerings are brought to a G-d made by man, and the bringing of such heathen offerings is an act of conjuring.  The heathen conjures the master of his fate into his service.  With this offering he thinks he can overcome the anger of his G-d.  defining the nature of the sin of the golden calf with one word.  The sin of subjectivity.  Subjectivity is defined as the quality of being based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes or opinions.  That was the real sin, and in the Torah's eyes, any subjectivity is heathenism and idolatry.  People can make anything into an idol, even a truly great and worthy and humble leader, for this man Moshe who brought us out of the land of Egypt, this heathen subjectivism resulting in the delusion that the Divine will can be forced or influenced.  This was their motivation when they told Aaron to make for them G-d's, because they saw in Moshe not an instrument of G-d who had been chosen by Hashem, but a human being who became G-d-like.  They panicked without Moshe because they thought that it was he who could influence the will of G-d.  For them it was not G-d who brought them out of Egypt by means of Moshe, but Moshe who brought them out by making G-d do it.  They didn't understand that it was the Torah that Moshe gave them, which is their link to G-d.  They thought it was the demigod nature of Moshe which was their link to G-d, the link to their connection.  They thought it was his presence which gave them divine protection.  Their panic was based on their delusion that everything was Moshe's initiative and not G-d.  They thought that even if Moshe is G-d, they could exercise some influence on G-d by means of some object they would put in his place.  This is not the way of the Torah, because the most fundamental Torah truth is that man has free access to G-d directly, without the necessity of any intermediary, and that the one and only condition for connecting with G-d is acting with obedience to Him.  Thus the calf is called Eger Masecha.  Masecha is translated as molten.  It was poured out according to their needs, according to their expectations, according to their subjectivity.  They wanted a replacement for Moshe.  But their relationship with Moshe would never be the same, because it was from this point that they can no longer look at him, they can no longer look at his face, because their misunderstanding Their understanding of Him was so blemished that from now on His true essence is held back from them by means of Moshe's mask, and the same word applied to the calf as molten, masecha, masecha also means mask.  Perhaps because they masked G-d in their minds with Moshe and allowed His physicality to cause a division, Moshe must now be careful not to be the cause of separation between the people and G-d.  All of this brings us back, in the most wondrous way, to the kior nechoshet, the copper laver at the very beginning of our parasha, the instrument of the waters of purity.  There is a deep understanding of the commandment for the Kohen to begin each day by sanctifying his hands and feet from the waters of the laver.  The hands and feet are the points that connect him to this world.  The Kohen in the Temple must wash, he must begin again, to wash himself of all preconceived notions, to cleanse himself of yesterday, of who he was yesterday and everything he thought he knew about who G-d is yesterday, and to begin anew, all over again, in serving G-d and everything he does Now.  the kohen serving in the Temple, the priest is responsible for representing Hashem's will, and it is He who brings the Divine Light into the world through the Temple service.  But the same holds true for everyone.  We all need to restart our conception of G-d every day.  In fact, if it is necessary for the kohen who is in the holy place and constantly reminded of Hashem's presence, if it is necessary for him to be reminded not to fall into patterns or assumptions, how much more so is it vital for every person to be reminded that we must never fall prey to the subtle creeping paralysis of subjectivism.  Beginning the new day by washing at the laver, called by the Torah sanctification, teaches us that we must be on guard against any preconceived notions about G-d.  Our conception of G-dliness has to be renewed each day as we literally cleanse ourselves of everything that we thought we knew yesterday.  In this manner, the unassuming and modest service of the priest in the Holy Temple, of sanctifying his hands and feet at the waters of the lever, is a benchmark for us all in our own avodat Hashem, our service of G-d, as we strive each day to grow closer to G-d, not by bringing G-d down to us on our terms, by shaping Him according to our demands, by forming Him according to our needs like a golden calf, But by bringing ourselves closer to Him, by changing, growing, advancing in our spiritual knowledge, and constantly realizing that the goal of all knowledge is to know that we don't know, and we don't know anything about Hashem.  rising to spiritual maturity, not fashioning G-d according to our needs but striving to bring ourselves closer to G-d on His terms, this is the lesson of the golden calf for every generation, and our portion in the ongoing fixing of this case of mistaken identity.
