            "text": "All right, what's up my brothers from another mother?  Today's video is a topic request from a gentleman and I quote, who married a woman that is dumber than a box of rocks.  Before we hop into that, I want to shout out to the channel sponsor over here, the Tactical Soap Company.  You guys know that Scott's been supporting the creation of content on my channel for a while now.  There's a link pinned in the description.  if you want to grab it and try it out.  The best deal by far is a five for the price of four.  If you check out with coupon code COOPER, you'll get 10% off.  It's pheromone-infused soap.  The stuff works.  It's awesome.  You're showering anyways.  You might as well support the creation of the work on the channel.  All right, let's hop straight into it.  We'll minimize this over here.  All right, he opens by saying, excuse me, before I say anything, I realize I'm the top 2% of men in North America.  So he has a very high opinion of himself in the opening, but my wife is driving him insane.  I married a very hot woman who is dumb as a box of rocks.  I'm 38, she's 22.  I'm a successful business person who makes 800K last year.  and has consistently made more than 250 in the last nine years.  six foot three 223 sorry 228 pounds.  i'm in the best shape of my life dude.  if you're six foot three and 228 you are jacked.  you are a big dude.  uh if if you're ripped like i'm guessing if you're saying you're in the top two percent you got abs and everything.  so V taper, everything going on.  Well done.  At 38, I met my current wife at a business context through her father.  Oh, I hope you're not, you didn't marry a friend's daughter or something like that.  Anyway, let's say that if I had not met her, she'd still be in high school.  I wrote all her papers and helped her to cheat to get through chemistry, math, and basic biology.  Hold on a second.  Again, I don't read a lot of these before I go through these requests, guys, so I'm just going to back up here for a second.  She's 22 right now as you married her.  I'm guessing you've known her for a while, so you did her homework for her in high school for chemistry, math, and basic biology, if I'm getting that correctly.  I graduated from University of London with a degree in economics and computer science.  I work for one of the largest cryptocurrency companies in the world, and I think my profession will yield very good things to come.  Here's the issue.  My wife is stunning.  She's 5'3\", a buck-oh-five, fit and young.  She's got the tightest, best pee I've ever had, and she's generally submissive.  Her father is Muslim and raised her to be submissive to him, and that's transferred to me.  The issue is she's dumb as a box of rocks.  I took her to a work Christmas party and probably bailed her out eight to nine times when she got in over her heads trying to impress my work colleagues.  She has a confirmed IQ of 71.  Oh, dude.  Yeah, she's not too bright, eh?  Now, there's good and bad parts to this.  All right.  Well, today's lesson, gentlemen, is this is what happens when you date and marry a younger woman who has a very low IQ.  Maybe that'll be the title for the video.  Anyway.  Now, there's a good and bad part to this.  She really allows me to make any and all life decisions, which car to buy, when to upgrade my motorcycle, which house to buy.  She recognizes that she's not a smart woman.  I have complete freedom as a man.  I can go out the occasional Friday night without being asked questions, even if I don't get home till 9 a.m.  the next day.  I had some minor surgery, torn meniscus, and she waited on me hand and foot through my recovery.  You could not have asked for a more attentive woman.  She seems to drive great pleasure sexually and emotionally from making me happy.  I'm happy in the relationship and always accept when she interacts in public.  She's an embarrassing idiot.  She once got locked in a vitamin shop bathroom, but the lock was on her side.  When I got to the door, I assumed it was stuck, so I got the manager unlocked, a perfectly working door, and gently swung it open.  Yeah, okay.  My sense is that I should stop complaining and just deal with it because of what I've seen on the marketplace.  There's nothing else that approaches her.  FYI, she did sign a very restrictive prenup a year ahead of the marriage, and we've got two updated postnuptials.  So should we get divorced down the road?  I'm in good shape.  Okay.  As a condition of marriage, she had her tubes tied.  I have two kids from a prior marriage that she's wonderful with, but no desire for a third.  Thoughts?  What can I say, dude?  Like, I almost wondering if you're trolling me here, first of all, but trolls don't usually spend a hundred bucks to make a video request.  Well, this won't be a very long response.  I don't think so.  First of all, before I respond, guys, there's a comment section.  Let's allow the community to chime in on this guy's magnificent problem of having a hot young wife that isn't too bright, that has the tightest pee he's ever had.  So, well, Here's how I'll open with my feedback, first of all.  Somebody once said to me, you can have it all, you just can't have it all at the same time with the same person.  And I think that holds true in this scenario.  I know that guys like to go shopping for the unicorn.  And, you know, obviously men prefer younger women.  We know from, you know, the sexual marketplace graphs and the wall and all the talks we've done on that, either on my channel or through Redman Group, that most men find women most attractive in their early 20s.  It's usually by about after 25 that they start to lose interest in women as they age and they return their adoration, if you will, for the younger, more beautiful women.  So she's right where you want the most attractive woman to be.  Obviously, she's visually attractive.  She's a smoke show from what I gather.  But you're not going to have her solve anything like cold fusion or do basic high school math, chemistry or biology, apparently, because you had to do that shit for her to graduate from high school.  Otherwise, she would have still been in high school.  She's submissive to you.  She obviously looks at you as the head of the household.  You have a prenup and you have postnuptials being signed.  You already have your kids out of the way.  You obviously don't want any more kids and she was okay with you not having any more kids, so she had her tubes tied.  What do you want me to say, dude?  Sounds like you, you know, be careful what you ask for because you're going to get it.  And you got it.  You got what you were looking for, a smoke show of a wife that complied with your rules.  You're a very high income earner.  You're a tall, handsome dude with, you know, his body right and together.  I'm not really sure that you have a problem.  The problem is you have a dumb wife.  And can you fix stupid?  Not really.  know can you put her in some montessori class to up her intelligence level or maybe improve her skills?  maybe i don't know but i'm sure you may.  i mean i'm pretty sure you knew when you were doing her homework her biology chemistry and whatever courses you had to help her with to finish high school.  you knew she was dumb then.  So, again, you got what you're looking for.  You got the smoke show of a wife, but she's not too bright.  And you're, I don't know, like you hoping she's going to be smarter as time passes sort of thing.  I mean, if the marriage doesn't work out, seems like it's pretty low risk because she can't get pregnant.  So you're not going to go through the divorce machine with family law and custody fights.  You're not going to be alienated from kids that you'll never see.  You have a pre and postnup, and she worships you.  I mean, whenever it's needed, she worships you.  She helps you out.  She's a compliment to your life.  It's just.  you can't expect to bring arm candy to a high-value cryptocurrency event or a Christmas party and expect her to engage in intelligent conversation.  So just be aware of that limitation.  I'm a big car guy.  I haven't talked about cars that much on my channel, but it's like me going out and buying a Prius and expecting it to deliver McLaren type performance.  It just isn't.  It's going to give me Prius type fuel economy.  On the flip side, a McLaren won't give me Prius-type fuel economy.  A McLaren will give me supercar-type performance with shitty fuel economy.  So again, you can have it all.  You just can't have it all at the same time or you can't have it all in the same person.  That being said, it sounds like she lets you do whatever you want.  So if you need a plus one to an event that has a head screwed on her shoulders, I don't know, maybe find somebody in your workplace that can help you out with something like that.  Maybe that's a potential option.  I don't know.  I'm not really sure how you want me to solve this problem.  It sounds like a problem that most men, especially in their late 30s or 40s that are out in the sexual marketplace dealing with overly entitled wall smash women that like to push them around and try to turn them into plow horses would love to exchange positions with you.  Yeah, I don't have a lot to offer you.  Again, I almost wonder if you're a troll at the same time.  So guys, I'm going to wrap it up on that note.  This one's a little bit funny, to be honest with you.  I haven't seen one like this in a while.  I've done probably close to 100 of these reach requests now or these sponsored requests.  And this is the first time I've had a guy complaining that his hot wife is dumb.  So, yeah, there you have it.  Guys, leave your comments below.  Smash the like button.  Oh, by the way, YouTube keeps telling me to remind you guys to subscribe to the channel and hit the notification bell.  Apparently, the subscription button itself doesn't cover that, so you have to hit the bell to make sure that you get notifications.  uh in your feed and i'm just going to minimize this and i'll show you real quick how to make these types of requests.  and on the request tab you just basically fill out this form over here.  it's a paypal donation and then you request whatever topic is that you want?  if you want to join my men's community fellows It's over on entrepreneursandcars.com forward slash community.  And you scroll down.  There's two options.  There's basic membership for $25 a month.  You get access to lots of premium content.  And if you want to do one-on-one coaching, if you have anything you're stuck on, you're trying to get over one-itis, you're trying to understand the sexual marketplace, you're trying to do better with women or business, I coach at that tier.  Thanks for sponsoring today's video.  We'll see you guys in the next one.  Peace.  Thank you. ",
