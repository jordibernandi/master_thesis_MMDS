That is the Eisenhower Expressway.  290 runs through the, starts over, well, it runs in through the west side and then downtown to the loop.  Downtown's nicknamed the loop now.  We got a gentleman over here.  He looks like he made a wrong turn.  I think he missed the exit over here.  See we got an officer here.  He's not gonna be expecting me to come up with a camera.  You don't expect me to go up with a camera.  this gentleman look at he did he.  I think he tried to miss a turn and went over there and uh Well, as you can see, he might have been trying to take the other on ramp, which is this down here.  That's 290.  I don't think he made it.  So he might have blew a 1.89.  He blew a gymnastics score.  Oh, he hit the rough brood surface sign.  I mean, he might have been going for the rough brood. ",

Now, usually in society, when you approach somebody you don't know, a stranger, and you ask for their help, you're polite about it, you're nice, you're cordial.  Of course, that could have been the case, right?  His partner is, but Squint's here, he's upset about something.  He's just going to be a jerk because he thinks he can't.  And then before going to his car, he's going to give me directives.  He's going to tell me what I can and can't do because that's always what it is.  He cannot just leave without telling me what to do. ",

We're the officers on scene responding to a crash.  That's all we got.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm the media on scene responding to a crash.  That's all I got.  So what did you do?  You just came here and this is how it was?  Yeah.  Well, the plates are still in the car.  I don't want to help you out any.  But anyways, yeah, no, I was just... It looked like an odd scene, so I figured I'd... Investigate.  I'm an investigative reporter with Disorderly Product News.  You see it right there?  That's me.  Very official.  Official?  I said very official.  Oh, was it?  Were you being condescending?  Take it how you want it, man.  What's your name, rank, and star number, sir?  Can you read?  No, I can't.  Rule 37, CPD policies and directives.  You are required to give your name, rank, and star.  No, here's the thing.  What's your name, rank, and star number?  What's your name, rank, and star number?  Tough guy.  No, no.  Listen, you want to talk?  I was more than hospitable with you.  You want to make fun of me?  What's your name, rank, and star number?  That's right.  You get back in your car.  I'll stay right here.  That's what you get for opening your mouth.  Next time, be a little bit more respectful to people, and you won't be walking back like an idiot.  That's what I do.  I send them back to their car.  They want to act like a tough guy.  You must have lost your mind.  I'm not the one.  It's 2020.  It's 2020.  They'll realize once this goes up.  They'll realize exactly what this is once this goes up.  And he'll know then.  But it's always too late.  It's always too late once they already go up.  It's always too late.  Now, you can see I was more than hospitable with this man.  He said, I pointed to my hat.  It's a disorderly product news.  I have a winter hat on.  He goes very, very, whatever.  Just being a jerk.  Just like they always are.  Jerks.  Jerks.  Nothing but jerks.  I just walked down the public easement, I'm taking a picture of the car that's crashed into the sign, and these two come out, and what do you know about this crash?  I know it's crashed into a wall, that's what I know.  What do you know?  What do I look like, though?  Who am I?  What am I?  I know everything about the crash, but I'm not telling you any of it.  How about that?  I know everything.  I saw it all.  In fact, I was driving the car.  How about that?  I was driving the car.  But I'm not telling you that.  I was driving the car drunk.  I was drunker than a skunk and I had two... What do you think about that?  That's what was really going on.  Jerk.  What a jerk. ",
