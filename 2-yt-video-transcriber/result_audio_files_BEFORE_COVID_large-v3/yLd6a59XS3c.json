            "text": "Hey everybody, today I want to talk to you about protecting your home against a physical attack by someone trying to break in, a home invasion, okay?  I haven't discussed these things in other videos.  This is a different video, so please hear me out.  These things are going to substantially increase the protection of your home and yourself if you're inside.  Okay.  We're going to start from very basic to some stuff that's not quite so basic, but everyone can do.  Okay.  Number one, on your doors, where the door closes, the actual door handle closes and it latches in that little strike plate.  Okay.  Where you turn the lock and it's locked.  I'm not talking about a deadbolt.  I'm just talking about the main door handle.  When it closes, it goes in and it latches in that little brass plate.  Those plates, all of them, have extremely short screws, all right?  So when someone kicks that door or they put their shoulder into that door, those screws are what give way and cause that door to bust open.  Those little screws are too short.  When it gets hit with that much force, those screws literally pop out and the door kicks open.  You need to remove those screws and put in two inch long screws.  Very important, two inches.  Get two inch long screws and screw those in to that plate.  Remove the two little brass ones, put in these other ones, all right?  That's number one.  Then you do the same thing on the door hinges at the top and the bottom, okay?  Those things right there will considerably considerably beef up the holding power, staying power of that door.  Now, a lot of people don't know that.  It's a hardcore fact.  It's just the way it is.  You can Google it and find out if you want.  That will substantially increase the staying power of that door, the holding power.  Okay.  Number two, I'm telling you what's best to do for your home.  If you can't afford it, I'm very sorry.  There are people that can't afford it.  So I'm just addressing everybody about these topics in general.  Number two, I would strongly recommend that you remove any wooden door that you have as your outside doors and put in solid core metal clad doors.  They run anywhere from $80 to $200.  Depends what you want to pay, how fancy you want them to be.  You can buy them from any of the home improvement stores, okay?  A solid core, wooden core, but it's metal clad.  In other words, it's all wrapped in steel.  Those doors cannot be broken into through the door itself physically.  So that being the case, you have your screws that you put in and the hinges and the plate where door closes and locks, and you have a steel clad door, that door is gonna be very difficult to open by comparison to any other door.  Your normal wood doors, especially the fancy ones that are for looks on people's homes, frequently they will have, oh, sections of the door where the wood is inlaid to the door.  in other words there's these sections of wood that go across doors.  they're decorative but they're very thin.  they're not thick like the door itself is.  those plates can be.  those wooden areas can be kicked through very easily or broken through easily and then someone can reach in and open the door.  so if you have a solid core door not a hollow core solid core door steel clad you're going to be styling.  Now, next, there is a company called On Guard.  They make a plate.  It's called the security door brace.  Now, if you have that steel door there, you get this brace.  There's a plate that goes on the bottom of the, at the bottom of the door on the floor next to the threshold.  You screw this plate down into the floor.  Then there is a brace that brackets right into the this plate.  It's about, I'm guessing, eight to 10 inches wide at the base of your door.  Oh, probably three or four inches tall, probably four inches tall, I would imagine.  And it's about an inch thick.  When this plate is utilized or implemented at the base of your door, the biggest men, the biggest, strongest, baddest guys cannot kick that door open.  It will not open.  Now, there are many videos on YouTube from On Guard about people trying to kick a door open that has this plate at the base of it.  They can't do it.  The door will open and slam right back shut.  it will not open, okay?  So they're not gonna be able to kick it in.  Those things right there will greatly enhance the security of your home.  All right, now let's move on to the windows.  Windows are the most vulnerable spot for breaking in a house, it's so easy.  You know as well as I do, a brick, a bat, a towel, an arm, shoulder, fist.  It's going to break the windows.  All right.  So to protect your windows, again, and these people aren't paying me.  I'm not putting links.  I don't get anything from Tony about this.  I'm telling you this to try to help you because that's what this channel is about.  Now, the same company, On Guard, makes a product what they call burglar guard.  it is a film a protective film that goes on the outside of your windows when it's properly applied whether you do the do-it-yourself kit that they offer or you have someone come and do it for you.  when it's properly applied you can hit the windows with a baseball bat.  okay with a crowbar with a sledgehammer The window will spider web and crack everywhere, right?  But they will not go through the window.  It's not that they can't.  After several hits, they'll break a hole in it, whatever the diameter or size is of the item that they're hitting the window strike in the window with.  They'll start to get a tear, but it is very, very difficult to get this thing opened up, the film opened up, shredded up, and be able to go through that window.  It is very difficult.  You've got to watch the videos.  Someone trying to do this is going to bring a lot of attention to themselves.  If someone is standing outside your house with a baseball bat trying to bust your windows in, more than likely, especially if you live in a housing tract, someone's going to see that.  Hopefully they will call the police.  If you're in the house when they try to do this, let's say it's a home invasion at night or early morning hours, it gives you plenty of time.  to handle the situation yourself, to call the police and then do what you choose to do to handle the situation of someone trying to break into your home through a window that they're not gonna be able to bust in through.  So these things are very important.  Now, that covers your door and your windows.  My recommendation, these are just my opinions, is that you get this film and you put it on all ground level windows on your home, not just your front windows or your side window or whatever.  You put them on all the windows, at least at the ground level of your home, so someone can not easily break into your home.  They will have a very difficult time doing it.  You only put the film on one side.  Whether you can put it on both sides or not, I don't know, maybe you can, but it's gonna cost you twice as much.  It's not done that way in the videos.  They just put it on one side.  It's amazing.  Okay.  Now I had made a video earlier, a few videos back where I talked about security cams and I had wireless cameras.  Okay.  Everybody flame me about my wireless camera because it's wireless and they can be hacked and yada, yada, yada.  I know this.  Okay.  I know that I was wrong for suggesting that I guess, because when I got these cameras that I have around our house, They're $250 a camera.  They were donated to us.  I did not have to pay for them myself.  They were donated to us.  I had them.  I still have them and I use them.  I understand everybody's apprehension about them being wireless.  I've seen the horror stories in the videos.  It was all brought to my attention.  So if you don't want to do that, get wired cameras.  Great.  Get wired cameras and put them outside your home and inside your home at the outside, at least of your home, get some wired cameras.  They'll come with a base system that you put in your house that records all activity while those cameras are on.  So you'll still have the information to give to the cops if you choose to, if someone was to break in your home or attempt it.  Okay.  On those systems, if you have the money, just saying, if there was a grid down situation where the power went out, those cameras aren't going to work.  I don't care what the naysayers say, because I've looked into this extensively.  You can easily put up a solar system with a battery backup that will, a battery system for the solar, that will run and power those cameras.  If you have the money to do that, that's what I suggest.  So that if the power's out, your cameras still work.  Okay.  Lastly, I would strongly suggest that you get motion sensor lights put on all four corners of your home, all the way around your home, or however your house is laid out.  I would put them, if you can afford them, in the trees, and I would put them around the eaves of your home.  All right?  Motion sensor.  And I would set them, like I do mine here as a recommendation, I would set them for 15 feet out if you can.  That means if someone gets within 15 feet of your house, the sensor will be triggered and the lights will come on.  Most burglars, home invasion people, do not want to mess around when the lights come on and they can easily be seen, all right?  So that covers a really decent amount of security for your home.  that would make it so much safer to be in and to be away from and still have the home protected when you're not there.  Okay.  So I just wanted to share those things to help you.  No, I'm not putting links down below.  So please don't ask.  Don't ask me for links.  Okay.  I'm not saying that to be mean.  I'm telling you the name of the company.  The name of the product is called OnGuard.  O-N-G-A-R-D.  Okay.  OnGuard.  There's videos all over YouTube and they're on the internet so you can find these products.  Okay.  What else?  All right.  I want to say one other thing.  My channel was initially created and has been created.  Now I'm going to probably lose subscribers over this, but I'm going to say it anyway.  You guys need to be aware.  I'm always straight up front with you guys.  I have created this channel to help people.  I want to help people.  However, from day one, I intended creating this channel to have an added income to help support my family.  OK, this channel will be monetized.  Just telling you that doesn't mean anything to you.  That just means that occasionally there's going to be a commercial that kicks on.  Now, you guys that use YouTube all the time, you know, every time you start a video, just about a commercial comes on.  Wait three seconds.  Click.  You know, that's up to you.  But I do intend to monetize my channel to try to help support my family as an added income.  Also, I've been really apprehensive about doing this because, you know, you just don't like copying other people.  And I'm not trying to do that.  But I really wasn't aware of it.  And my friend, Zombie Farmer, has put, what do they call it, a Patreon account.  link on his channel.  He did that so that if anything goes wrong, that Google is to take his channel down because Google doesn't like his content.  All right.  Or Google's trying to stop something.  He will have his videos on Patreon and people who use Patreon can watch his videos.  That's one of the smartest things I've heard.  And though I don't like copying someone, I'm letting you know that I'm intending to do that myself.  I will put all my videos in time, it's not happening today, but all my videos I'm going to put on Patreon because I know for a fact that there's things that I do, like showing the guns and some of the topics I talk about, YouTube won't like.  And if they were to take my channel down or to remove some of my videos, I want them to still be available to you guys to view, should you choose to support my channel by using Patreon, okay?  That is just something I'll go into further later, but I want you to know that I'm giving that very strong consideration.  The links is because if I monetize the channel, YouTube won't allow us to have links down below when we monetize our channel.  Like I said, this channel is 100% here to help other people.  But it is also something that I'm trying to build to help support my family.  So now you know it.  I'm not going to be begging you for money.  I'm not going to be hitting you up all the time.  Oh, support my channel, support my channel.  I'm not going to do that.  There'll be a link there.  Should you choose to do it, you'll know why it's there.  And that's totally up to you guys.  Okay.  Long video.  I'm sorry.  You guys have an awesome weekend.  Thank you for watching.  Thank you for subscribing.  This will probably, actually, I said long weekend, this will probably go up on Monday.  But I hope you guys do have a great day.  Like, share, subscribe.  I would really appreciate it.  Again, as every video, thank you, thank you, thank you to my subscribers.  Thank you for the kind words.  Thank you for spending your valuable time watching my videos.  I really appreciate it.  And I hope I hope you guys find value in some of these videos for yourself.  I hope they're of a benefit to you.  All right, you guys take care.  We'll talk to you later.  Bye. ",
