            "text": "Your whole life has been a big series of big beginnings with little results.  You start something and you give up.  You start something else and you give up.  And now you've come to the realization that time is running out.  And you have to face the fact that you're getting older.  And you'll never get to see what you could have become.  Because you were never willing to pay the price.  The price of resilience.  The truth is, everyone wants to succeed but so few do.  Now the question is, why do so few succeed?  During the course of life, life is filled with ups and downs.  We live in a culture where people don't want to accept that there will be good seasons and bad seasons.  There will be summertime and there will be wintertime.  And in life, some summers will be longer and better than others.  And some winters will be longer and colder than others.  But that's just life.  Ecclesiastics 3 says, There is a time for everything.  A season for every activity under the heavens.  A time to be born and a time to die.  A time to plant and a time to uproot.  Now the reason why people don't succeed is because they don't understand this concept.  And they make a permanent decision during a temporary season.  Don't make a permanent decision based on a temporary season.  In every endeavor there will come a time where giving up looks like the only option.  When the problem looks unsolvable.  When the mountain seems unmovable.  And the enemy seems unstoppable.  And defeat looks like the only outcome.  Heaven is telling you these words today.  Never, never, never.  give up.  Galatians 6 verse 9 says, And let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we will reap.  If we do not give up to attain the success, to attain the goal you so desperately desire, you need to recognize that you're in a fight.  You will need to attack and keep attacking.  And anything that stands in your way needs to know that you are not going to give up until you win.  And that there is only one victory in this situation.  And that victory is you.  The problem with this generation... Is that anytime we receive any resistance or adversity, we quit.  This book, this Bible does not encourage giving up.  We need to remember Philippians 4.13.  I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.  Over and over again, we see men and women of God who demonstrated resilience in the face of insurmountable odds.  This book tells us of a generation that had never seen rain.  And one man who was given a dream by God had to face 120 years of people laughing at him whilst he built an ark.  120 years he worked on one ark while everyone around him thought he was crazy.  I am sure people would ask him, why don't you just give up?  But do you know why he didn't give up?  It's because he had resilience.  We all need resilience.  Just imagine working on a dream that no one else believes in for 120 years.  120 years!  And you have the audacity to give up after six months.  Resilience is Job literally walking through hell on earth and saying the Lord gave and the Lord taketh away.  Blessed be the name of the Lord.  Jeremiah 29 verse 11.  For I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord.  Plans to prosper you and not to harm you.  Plans to give you a future and a hope.  And some of you are just like Job, and you're going through hell right now.  Whether it may be in your marriage, whether it may be in your dreams, in your job, in your business, or in your family, or wherever it may be.  Never give up.  Never give up.  In the words of Winston Churchill, if you're walking through hell, keep going.  For a lot of you right now, life has pushed your back against the wall.  You can't give up.  You can't give in.  You have to be resilient.  You have two choices, stand up and fight or live with the regret and the what ifs.  Not everything worth having in life will be handed to you.  You will have to fight.  You will have to fight.  You have to fight in the rain.  You have to fight when you're tired.  You have to fight when you don't feel like it.  You have to fight when you have no one else in your corner.  You have to keep going, regardless of the odds, regardless of what life throws at you.  You have to keep fighting.  You have come too far to give up now.  God has taken you through too much to leave you high and dry now.  When you're sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired.  And those that believe in you have left you.  And they don't believe in you anymore.  When they have lost hope in you.  When they've lost faith in you.  Stay resilient.  Stay resilient.  When David went to fight Goliath, everyone around him had given up.  What if he gave up too?  What would have become of Israel?  David did not give up because he knew God was on his side.  And just how God was on his side, God is on your side.  The same force that was behind David's slingshot, it's the same force that's propelling you today.  God is for you, and if God be for you, who can be against you.  With God all things are possible.  Do you have the resilience to stand when there is nothing else left to stand up?  Do you have the resilience to stand in the storm, to make your mind up come hell or high water?  will stand?  will you say I will not give up when people are laughing at your dreams and your goals?  will you give up?  will you give up on what God has planned for you because of other people?  will you or will you stand as an individual and be resilient and say I am a child of God I will get through this.  this will not stop me.  greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  Resilience is a passion that will burn brighter than any defeat.  Resilience is a vehicle that will carry you through rejection, that will carry you through defeat, that will carry you through dark times.  Resilience is a light that will burn brighter than any darkness.  Resilience is a force that cannot be stopped.  Nothing wants to stand in the way of a resilient individual.  Resilience says in all things I am more than a conqueror through Him who loved me.  Resilience says I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.  Resilience says I will not grow weary in doing good, for in due season I will reap if I do not give up.  If you're in Christ Jesus, you're a new creature.  There are no losers in Christ.  There are no losers in Christ.  There are no losers in Christ.  This age-old quote stands true today.  You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice.  And the truth is, God sometimes allows certain situations to happen in your life to unlock strength inside you. ",

            "text": "Now here's what else you must do in the summer.  Like a father, you must look out for your enemies.  And believe me, we're going to have some.  But remember, like a father who would guard carefully his family, I'm asking you to stand guard.  I'm asking you to stand at the door.  I'm asking you, whatever threatens you, threaten it back.  Whatever pushes against you, push it back.  Whatever wants to overwhelm you like a father, stand up, take control, and do battle with your enemies wherever you find it.  Now here's one more.  We must also deal with the enemies within ourselves.  Yes, we've got enemies on the outside, but some of the enemies are not way off in some distant country.  Some of the enemies are a lot closer than that.  They are within.  And I wanna give you a list of some of the things to watch out for when you get back home called enemies within yourself.  Here's the first one, indifference.  Whatever you do, practice not being casual.  You've got to shake off sometimes the lethargy that would say, oh, well, maybe it's not gonna work for me, or I'll just go along and see what happens.  I'm asking you, whatever you do, the intensity that you've gathered up here during this extravaganza, I want you to take this same intensity home with you.  Don't be casual.  Casualness creates casualties.  Go home with a renewed intensity.  Don't let indifference take over.  Here's the next one, indecision.  Someone's mentioned it a couple of times on this stage.  They've had to deal with it.  You've got to deal with it.  Indecision is called the thief of opportunity.  Make decisions even if it's a wrong decision.  Do the very best you can, make a decision and go with it.  If it doesn't work out because it was a wrong decision, I'm telling you that gives you experience now to make a better decision.  Here's the next one, doubt.  We've all got to deal with the enemy of doubt.  Cynicism has a unique way of crowding in on all of us.  Being cynical about the government, being cynical about banks and money, being cynical about society, being cynical about the past, cynical about the future.  I'm asking you don't let that disease grab you by the throat and ruin your chances to do well. ",

No matter how much blood, sweat and tears you have put into it.  I am here today to tell you one thing.  Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.  You will win if you do not give up.  Your marriage is worth fighting for.  Your dreams are worth fighting for.  You're worth fighting for.  Your salvation is worth fighting for.  Resilience.  You have to be resilient.  Watch.  Stand fast in the faith.  Be brave and be strong.  In the name of Jesus Christ. ",
