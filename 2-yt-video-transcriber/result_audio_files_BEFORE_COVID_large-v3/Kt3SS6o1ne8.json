            "text": "are we called in the Bible stiff-necked, hard-hearted, and what?  What is that again?  Man, that's a hell of a name to give a people.  They are stiff-necked, hard-hearted, and rebellious.  If that's the characteristic that distinguishes the people of God, stiff-necked, hard-hearted, rebellious, and a guide comes Mahdi comes Messiah comes to guide the people that are lost and they're stiff-necked hard-hearted and rebellious.  the question is will the stiff-necked hard-hearted and rebellious people lose those characteristics to become obedient to the guide that they might save their own lives?  Or will they still be stiff-necked, hard-hearted, and rebellious?  Brothers and sisters, we have several strikes against us.  That's why they didn't see too many people making it.  If you look in the book of Revelations, it doesn't tell you that a lot of people made it.  The messenger of Allah, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad wrote, for the sad prophecy of the loss of my people, I write these words because the scripture saw 144,000 making it.  That's a very small number of people.  What happened to the rest of them?  They were stiff-necked, hard-hearted, and rebellious, and they chose death by their disobedience rather than life by their obedience.  Now what are some of these strikes that are against us?  First of all, rebellion is now a part of the nature of us.  Ah, wait, what did you mean?  The Quran says we are Muslims by nature.  Yes, that's true.  But something has been added to the nature.  Rebellion.  How did you get to be rebellious?  Our father was a rebel.  What?  What do you mean, Brother Farrakhan?  I think we ought to be able to face some truth tonight.  The honorable Elijah Muhammad says that there are 24 major scientists, or scientists rather, that do the work of guiding and developing civilization.  12 major and 12 minor.  These 24 are written of in the book of Revelations as the 24 elders.  The 12 major scientists, one from among the 12, the messenger teaches, is the supreme being.  The honorable Elijah Muhammad said one of the 12 told the others he wanted to make a people close to nature that could conquer the jungle life.  withstand it, overcome it.  But this had to be put before the other 11 for approval.  And the other 11 disapproved.  And he, being one of that high circle of gods, rejected their disapproval of his idea.  What did he do?  He rebelled.  What's that got to do with me?  That's our father.  He's a rebel.  Not only a rebel, but a rebel against God and the holy wise scientists.  Are you listening?  So the scientists told Shabazz, You can't make your man here.  You have to take your family and go.  In lesson number one, why isn't the devil settled on the best part of the planet Earth?  Because the Earth belongs to the original black man.  and knowing that the devil was wicked, he put him out in the worst part of the Earth.  and kept the best part preserved for himself.  So whenever you rebel, the punishment is, first of all, exile.  Put them out.  So since we had room on the earth for the rebel, we put Shabazz out.  Out from where?  That critical area.  where the black man chose as the best part of the planet for him to settle and start new civilization.  The rich Nile Delta.  All in that area called the Garden of Eden.  That's where the original man first started when this planet was found in its new orbit after the explosion of moon from earth 66 trillion years ago as the honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us.  So Shabazz was not permitted to stay in that area.  so he took his family into the jungle of East Asia which we now call Africa.  To make a people close to nature.  And the Honorable Elijah Muhammad said this is the origin of kinky hair.  Because we didn't have kinky hair prior to that.  The hair on our head was like the hair on our eyebrows.  The hair on your eyebrows straight, the hair on your head is not the same as the hair on your eyebrows.  But the hair of every other people is the same as their eyebrows.  Your eyebrows straight, your hair something different.  Wouldn't you like the hair on your head to be as straight as the hair on your eyebrows?  That's why you're so busy frying it.  That's why you're so busy pulling it.  because your nature tells you that the kink i mean you know with with i'm black and i'm proud.  we got to learn to be proud of kinks because most of your family of other black people on earth jet black.  They didn't have no broad nose and thick lips and kinky hair.  They were dark-skinned people, jet black.  But they had straight hair, a thinner lip, a thinner nose.  But we are marked as a different kind of black person.  And we were rejected and despised not only from the circle of the gods, but we were despised and rejected by all the other dark people of the earth.  This is why today black people with kinky hair and broad nose and thick lips are rejected in every society.  I want you to hear me well tonight.  Why are we rejected?  Because the essence of beauty is in obedience and submission to God.  And the essence of ugliness is when you rebel against God.  And when you rebel against God in your rebellion, you are marked with a certain mark of your rebellion which is the disfigurement of your internal self which manifests in the disfigurement of your external self.  And this is why when you look at our people, wherever we are found on the earth, you find us either disfiguring ourselves physically because we are disfigured on the inside because of rebellion.  We visit our brothers and sisters in Africa and in the isles of the Pacific.  and in the jungles of the Amazon and wherever you find our people in savagery you find them disfiguring themselves.  and in their disfiguring themselves it is a sign of something within that is disfigured and the disfiguring within the ugliness within is caused by rebellion against God.  And because the darker people of the earth who had not rebelled looked at us with disdain, dislike, even hatred, we are styled in the Bible as the despised and the rejected.  We are called in the Bible the prodigal son who left the brothers who were at home in obedience to the father.  This prodigal son went out.  We've been gone 50,000 years.  That's a long time to be in rebellion.  Are you with me?  We are the oldest rebel on the earth.  How old is Christianity according to student enrollment?  What is the birth record of said nation of Islam?  And what is the birth record of Christianity and Buddhism?  If Buddhism is 35,000 years old, And Christianity according to the writing is 551 years and that 551 is taken from the time that the Christians were let out of Europe by Columbus.  then if our father rebelled 50,000 years ago, then we are the oldest rebel on the earth.  We couldn't talk like this years ago because we had had so much mud thrown on us, we couldn't accept it.  But you can face the whole truth today.  Yes, sir.  You all right?  Yes.  As you probably have heard me say in other tapes, you had nothing to do with the making of the devil.  Yaqub was no kinky-headed, broad-nosed, thick-lipped man.  He was born 20 miles outside of the holy city of Mecca in Arabia.  You haven't been there in a long time, brother.  Our people down in the jungle.  So where did Yaqub get his 59,999 rebels from?  He got them from out of the original people who were still left in Arabia.  And from that you get the making of another rebel, the Caucasian devils.  Over here in the Western Hemisphere, you have the Native American called the Red Indian, whom the Honorable Elijah Muhammad said was exiled, look at the word, exiled into this part of the earth over 16,000 years ago for his rebellion and breaking the law of Islam.  So the Western Hemisphere was a prison house for all the rebels.  Y'all all right?  Yes.  We're just talking now on the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and how many strikes are against us to make it.  And if you're going to make it today, you've got to deny your father Shabbat.  Yes, sir.  And you have to accept your new father.  Yes, sir.  You have to come out of the death of the rebellion of Shabazz into the life of submission of Master Farad Muhammad.  I want you to hear me because I don't know when I'll be back again.  And a very difficult time is coming up where you need guidance to get through.  And if you trust the guide and trust the guidance and then go inside yourself to fight against your rebellion.  You have rebelled from day one.  You are not an easy people to lead, teach, or guide because each one of you has your own way that you want to put over God's way.  You will even try to corrupt God's house to make God's house a reflection of you and your rebellion rather than obedience to the will and the law of God.  Yes.  I know it hurts.  But I really don't give a damn tonight.  I really don't care who it hurts.  Because if it hurts you, it's because you are exactly the person I'm describing tonight.  That's why you're in the hell that you're in.  Because you're easily led in the wrong direction, but hard as hell to lead in the right direction.  Look at your condition.  Male and female are destroyed people because you're rebellious.  Even when you say you submit, you lie.  You're always trying to find a way out of submission to do your own thing and put God's name on it.  The children of Shabazz, that's who we're dealing with.  A 50,000 year old rebel that says he's lost and wants to go home.  And the guide has come, but the fool refuses.  to follow the guidance. ",
