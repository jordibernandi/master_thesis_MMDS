            "text": "So we did long distance laser tests to see how refraction works on the air and we discovered that it bends the light upwards instead of downwards.  So we have proved with the experiments that the atmosphere can bend the light upwards which means that the sunlight can be bent in the opposite direction like I showed in this experiment.  And that will make the Flutter model important, because you assume that when the apparent sun is above the horizon line, the real sun is already below it.  But our experiments prove the opposite.  The apparent sun that you claim it's above the real sun during sunset or sunrise, now it would be below the real sun.  And that means your entire model is debunked. ",

            "text": "I don't see how.  All you did was show that light can bend upwards, not that it always does.  See, atmospheric refraction varies depending on temperature gradient, air pressure, humidity, In general, if the ground or water, I suppose, is warmer than the air above it, then yeah, light will bend upwards.  But if the ground is colder than the air above it, then light will bend downwards.  Though I am glad that some flat earthers are actually acknowledging that atmospheric refraction is a thing.  So we have that, at least.  Anyhow, that's it for this section of their video, and I'm pretty sure I hit the 10 minute mark.  So, uh, thank you for watching.  Video's over.  Goodbye. ",
