Number two, there needs to be a clearly defined timeline where we can bring our troops back.  And number three, we need to have our friends and allies with us in the mission.  If those three things were in place, then I would consider military action.  The attack that killed General Soleimani was disproportionate to anything that came before, and we did not even consult our allies ahead of time.
