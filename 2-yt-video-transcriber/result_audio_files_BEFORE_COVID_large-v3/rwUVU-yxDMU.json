This is Chad Catron calling from Milton.  Um, yeah, no, he won't be in today.  Um, I can see if he might answer his cell phone, but I know he's out for the rest of the day.  You want to give me his personal number?  No, I was going to see if he, um, will answer it.  Oh, um.  Give me one second.  I just had some people walk in, so I'm going to put you on a brief hold chat.  Okay.  Would you like me to see if he's available on his cell phone?  Yeah, like are you going to patch me through to him, or what are you doing?  Yeah, I'll transfer you through to him if he's available.  Yeah, perfect.  How's the baby doing?  Doing pretty well.  Good.  Two more months.  Oh, yeah.  It's getting there.  He'll go by quick, huh?  Yes, it has.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, will you put me through to him?  Okay, thank you.  This is Milton.  Milton.  I'm here, what's up?  Are you out playing hooky today or what?  Nope.  Oh, I was told you weren't in the office today.  Hey, I had a, are you dealing with business then?  or are we good?  Good to have a conversation?  Well, I don't know, am I live?  Are you live?  You're definitely not live.  I have, it's all Bonner County planning director stuff that I have questions about.  Okay.  I wanted to know where we're at on the investigation, the status on my investigation of my alleged building permit violation.  Where we at on that?  Because I know we've been under investigation now for like seven, eight months.  And so I'm trying to figure out what it is, where I stand.  Is it still an alleged violation, or have I been acquitted?  I haven't been acquitted? ",
