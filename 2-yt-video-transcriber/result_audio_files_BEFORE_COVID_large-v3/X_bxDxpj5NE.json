            "text": "Poland is the latest country to pull its gold out of foreign banks.  The National Bank of Poland wants to take back, essentially repatriate, 100 tons of gold from the bank.  What's 100 tons of gold look like?  Have you ever wondered?  Anyway, it's 100 tons of gold from the Bank of England, and they're telling England, we want it back.  We don't trust you.  The reason?  See, it wants to limit its geopolitical risk.  But you think, what is more geopolitically safe than the UK, right?  The UK, my gosh.  Well, maybe not.  Apparently, there is a reason for concern for many countries.  To answer this, we are joined now by Peter Schiff, who is the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, and he's good enough to join us.  My goodness, you know, here we are talking about Great Britain.  Aren't they the perfect place to store gold?  Why would countries be telling the UK, we don't trust you to hold our gold anymore?  What's going on, Peter? ",

            "text": "Well, you remember way back when the UK dumped all their gold.  I think they sold all their gold when it was under $300 an ounce.  And of course, the appreciation in pounds has been a lot greater than it has been in U.S.  dollars.  So, you know, if Britain gets desperate and they don't have any of their own gold, uh... you know they may try to see some of the ball that they do have which you know i i i make sense that uh... the polls and want to get their goal back.  just in case you know one of the good things about mold is that it you know you don't have any counterparty.  risk is not somebody else's liability but what a risk you take is storing it with a third party because what they don't give it to you when you need it.  so i think it's not that foreign central banks are wanting more gold because they're preparing for a post dollar world where gold is going to be the primary reserve asset backing up currencies, not dollars.  But not only do foreign governments want more gold, but they want that gold in their own possession.  They want to make sure they have it when they need it. ",

But I'm also thinking that the UK recently has done a couple of things that make me think.  Look, you could love Venezuela, think they're communist, think they're wonderful, hate them, whatever, right?  But recently the UK told Venezuela, you cannot have your hands on your own gold.  Now, whether it's Venezuela or a country maybe that I love or don't like, should any country have the right to tell another country, you put your gold here, but we're just going to keep it because we don't like your politics?

But now you run the risk of people not wanting to store their gold with you if you're going to come up with excuses not to give it back.  And so I think it makes sense because I don't know why anybody has their gold stored in the United States.  I mean, I think that's probably one of the most dangerous places to keep it.  I think maybe it's safer in the UK than the US.  But a lot of countries have their gold here with us.  And, you know, they should really be trying to get it back.  Remember, the Germans tried to get it back.  I forget how many years ago.  And they weren't successful.  I think they had to abort the attempt.  So that tells you. ",

            "text": "Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of political risk here because I do think that we're headed for a major currency crisis.  I think the dollar is going to collapse.  And so that's going to take down the U.S.  economy.  Our entire way of life has been built on the privilege of issuing the world's reserve currency.  And when the dollar loses that status, I mean, all hell is going to break loose here in the U.S.  And, you know, I don't know what is going to happen.  But, you know, we could take desperate measures.  And, of course, we could have socialists in control of the U.S.  economy.  if the socialists have the White House and they have both chambers of Congress.  So who knows?  I mean, they could declare some kind of national emergency.  You know, the U.S.  has a history of confiscating gold.  in the 1930s.  We defaulted on our obligations to pay gold.  You know, once upon a time, we told the world, if you had $35, we would give you an ounce of gold.  That was an IOU.  It was like a commitment, like a bond.  And then we defaulted.  So we've done desperate things in the past when our backs were to the wall.  So if we have real economic chaos here, you know, the U.S.  might just nationalize or seize any gold that it has custody of.  So I would want to take that chance if I was a foreign government. ",
