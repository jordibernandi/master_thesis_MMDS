And he never wanted to go back to that.  And so Washington as well realized that.  And so they wanted a central government that would at least be able to have taxing power and the power to do those very things. ",

The bank bill, it's going to pass fairly quickly in the Senate, but it's going to meet resistance in the House of Representatives.  But it will eventually be passed there by a vote of 39 to 20 and then submitted to President George Washington, who's going to have to decide whether or not to sign this bill to create a national bank.
