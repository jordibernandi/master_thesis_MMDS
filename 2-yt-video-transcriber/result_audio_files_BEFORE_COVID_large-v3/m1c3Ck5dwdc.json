            "text": "what's up everybody?  it's your girl back for another video.  so this video was requested and a subscriber wanted to know is it okay at any time for a woman to go through her man's phone her husband boyfriend partner etc.  now this is a great topic.  this is something i feel very strongly about.  It's a sad state of affairs, in my opinion, that this is the kind of stuff that, you know, adult couples are dealing with today.  This is the kind of like.  I've been married.  We'll celebrate our 12th year wedding anniversary this September, and this is just something that's never come up in my marriage.  This is not the kind of crap my husband and I deal with or worry about.  In fact, all the women in my family, I can say, that are married, this is not the kind of stuff we do.  This doesn't even come up in our marriages.  Any woman that needs to go through her husband, boyfriend, partner, someone she's dating exclusively's phone, that's an insecure, immature woman that needs to ask herself right now, if you're watching this, why am I in this relationship?  Why am I looking through his phone?  Is there trust issues?  A lot of times it's not even trust issues with the man.  I've seen the woman out doing things and breaking, you know, the trust, and she'll project her insecurities onto her boyfriend, husband.  you know and I've had friends in the past acquaintances co-workers etc.  that have talked about going through their man's phone like it's like normal like this is the new norm women going through their man's phone and women stalking their man's Facebook Twitter account Instagram.  that's that's becoming a new normal.  I had one acquaintance in the past.  She was in an exclusive relationship.  Her and the guy moved in together, and she would stalk his Facebook account and get pissed off that he didn't change his relationship status to it was still single.  He didn't put in a relationship.  And she would get so upset about that but would never confront him about it.  She would go and look at every picture he liked on Instagram and just stalk everything that he did.  And I used to ask all the time, why are you with this man?  You can't change a person you're with.  You have to accept them for who they are.  And if there's things you cannot accept, move on.  Haven't you ever heard this, plenty fish in the sea?  Move on and find someone who has, you know, the same beliefs as you, the same values as you, is more compatible with you.  You know, you've got to have enough respect with yourself and love yourself enough to be able to do that.  But... Again, it all boils down to insecurities and immaturity.  You know, a lot of women today are just straight up insecure and immature.  And it's wrong to go through your man's phone at any time.  It makes you look bad.  And I can't believe that in this day and age, this is the kind of crap women do.  This is grown women, you know, a grown, respectable woman.  woman that's secure with herself will not feel the need to go through a man's phone.  I've been married.  My husband and I will celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary this September.  And I can tell y'all now all the years we've been together, never even thought about looking through his phone.  Never pick up his phone.  Don't look through it.  It can be sitting right next to me all day, beeping and dinging and I won't look at it.  You know, it just doesn't cross my mind.  That's not the kind of shit we do to one another.  You know, none of the women in my family, you know, in my family, we value marriage.  We're more conservative in our beliefs.  All the women in my family are strong, secure, respectable women, and they don't do those kind of things.  Doesn't even come up in the conversation.  Like, I'm always just stunned when I hear women all over social media.  I'll hear them commenting and, you know, just talking about, oh, I went through my man's phone.  You know, he's talking to this girl or he doesn't talk about me enough on his social media.  He never shows pictures of me.  Like, it's just really sad that, you know, this is the kind of crap adults do.  or dealing with.  But if you're a woman and you're watching this and you're going through your man's phone and stalking his social media accounts, you know, you need to get a little security with yourself and you need to ask yourself, why am I with this person?  I need to leave this person.  I need to find someone that's more compatible with me in my views, my beliefs.  You know, you can't change them.  You can't sit there and nag them to death to change.  You know, you're an adult.  You have the right to do what you want, but leave the relationship.  And if you're a man and you're dealing with a woman, a girlfriend, whatever, a wife that is going through your phone and your emails and you're snooping, leave her and run for your life.  Okay, that is my advice.  Run for your life.  Drop her like a bad habit.  She is a bad habit.  Drop her.  Get away from her.  Bad news.  That's not the kind of shit I would want to be dealing with in a relationship as an adult.  When I think of people doing this, I think of teenagers.  I think of 18-year-old girls, immature adolescent girls.  I think about when I was in high school and, you know, middle school.  I don't think about... adult women raising children, taking care of a household and a career and juggling.  I don't think about that.  Okay.  Just real sad state of affairs these days that this is the kind of crap people are doing one another.  But thank you for the request.  Great topic.  100% wrong.  And give me a like if you like the video and I'll see y'all back on my next one.  Bye. ",
