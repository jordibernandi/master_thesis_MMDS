And whatever damage Mrs May has done to the Conservative Party and their vote in the country, believe me, she could never, ever agree to that.  And I think it's actually, to be honest with you, in Labour's interests now for there not to be... any form of deal, treaty going through Parliament, and to see the Conservatives suffer at the ballot box.  Having said that, I think Labour perhaps underestimate what could happen to their vote.  Because, you know, the five million people... who voted Brexit out there, who then voted for Jeremy Corbyn in that 2017 election.  And there is this mythology that goes on through the media that somehow Brexit is a right-wing ideology.  You know, far from it.

And they're forever actually publishing in black and white on social media the very rules and laws of the EU which would make it impossible for Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell to run the kind of economy that they are pledged to run.  for example on public ownership of railways it is now extremely difficult and will shortly under the lisbon treaty be illegal to bring your railways into public ownership, because all goods and services must be offered across the European Union in a competitive tendering process.  It's there in black and white, but people don't want to read details and facts, Lisa. ",

And on one hand, they're telling you how supportive they are of Corbyn's policies and how wonderful they are.  And then they're telling you how much we should be in the EU.  And I think how can you maintain such contradictory opinions at the same time?  But just to say on the second referendum, yes, it would be devastating to have to choose between Theresa May's deal.  and remain.  But the debate, I think, in a second referendum, if we had a different choice to that, would be extremely interesting because all the developments that have taken place, for example, the PESCO and the fast-moving development of the EU army or Francesco Mogherini acting like an EU foreign minister, Everything that's coming out, we would have so much more ammunition.  And I think they would be diminished because we've already seen that their fear campaign was based on smoke and mirrors. ",

I think Nigel Farage said on the morning of the 24th, we kicked the first brick out the wall.  That indeed we did.  We've set something in motion and we've certainly inspired a lot of the European Eurosceptics.  And also we've got inspired debate across Europe.  I just wish that a few Remainers would stop being glued to the BBC and following and believing everything they see on there.  Open their minds and look across the board, across the channel at what's happening with a more open mind. ",
