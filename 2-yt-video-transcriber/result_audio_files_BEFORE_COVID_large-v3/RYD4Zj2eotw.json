These same people will then also say, we need to ban AR-15s because in the hands of criminals, they're dangerous killing machines.  I never really understood this logic because it doesn't make any sense.  Because what they're saying is an AR-15 in the hands of a criminal is a killing machine, but in the hands of a law-abiding citizen, it's useless?  Well, apparently the wife and mother in this story didn't get that memo. ",
