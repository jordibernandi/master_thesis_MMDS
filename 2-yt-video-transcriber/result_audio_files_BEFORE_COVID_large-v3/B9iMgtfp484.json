            "text": "Hi, my name is Tom.  Welcome back to my channel and to another episode of What the Theory, my ongoing series in which I aim to provide some accessible introductions to key theories in cultural studies and the wider humanities.  Today, we're going to be taking a look at Roland Barthes' seminal 1967 essay, The Death of the Author.  we'll be considering its implications for how we read, whether that involves actually reading or watching, listening, playing, cultural texts and how we interpret them.  As always, if you have any questions, suggestions as we go along, then please do feel free to pop those below.  and, if you're new around here and this seems like your kind of thing, then please do consider subscribing and hitting that notifications button.  For now, however, let's crack on with the death of the author.  What the theory?  The Death of the Author is a 1967 essay by the massively influential cultural and literary theorist Roland Barthes.  It is incredibly short, just seven pages long in the version reproduced in Barthes' anthology Image Music Text.  and Yet, despite this short length, it has gained quite the reputation.  A great deal of that notoriety, I would argue, stems from that very provocative title.  Where other texts or treatises may tend towards language which is either highly technical or obscure, there's something undoubtedly appealing about the pronouncement of the death of the author.  Nevertheless, beneath that murderous title lies a far more measured piece of writing and the use that we can find from Roland Barthes' ideas here lie as much in its theoretical incisiveness and precision as in the strength of the language.  Today, then, as well as introducing some of the key ideas from Barth's essay, I also want to try and look beyond that title in order to draw out some of the subtle elements of Barth's argument.  In a similar mode, one of the reasons the death of the author is so often referred to in the present day is because it marks a seminal moment in the development of what we now call theory.  is often considered the moment where literary scholars abandoned approaches which we might group together as structuralism and embraced post-structuralism.  As we go along today, however, what I would like to do is slightly refute this popular notion that the death of the author represents some massive violent break from all previous scholarship.  because rather than some kind of manifesto in the door moment, I think we can more accurately frame it as a sort of subtle bridge from one school of thought to another.  So, to frame today's video not entirely in sort of Marxist terminology, today's video is about viewing the death of the author as reform rather than as revolution.  But first, some context.  Of all the theoretical approaches to analysing literature and culture flying around in the 1960s , the most dominant ones can be grouped together as what we refer to as structuralism.  To summarise very briefly and in very broad strokes, structuralism seeks to consider how the meaning that we derive from individual cultural texts might be reliant upon much wider cultural codes and ideas.  The notion of genre, for example, is a highly structuralist one.  It asks us to consider how different cultural texts might be grouped together and how they might draw upon similar narrative ideas, tropes, devices, character traits, etc.  A structuralist analysis of a comedy, for example, might seek to consider how the meaning that we derive from that comedy might not only be reliant upon elements within that text itself but also upon our wider knowledge of comedy as a form.  Roland Barthes himself had been a key proponent of such approaches and his book Mythologies is full of numerous engaging and really insightful examples of a structuralist approach to cultural analysis.  Where many previous schools of thought had focused on the analysis of cultural text as individual self-contained objects then, structuralism invited scholars to take a step back and to consider the wider cultural codes and meaningful systems of which that cultural text was a part.  And, against this theoretical backdrop, Barthes found himself asking whether, if the meaning that we derive from any individual cultural text is so reliant upon wider cultural codes and sign systems, we should really give that much credit to any individual author at all.  So, in The Death of the Author, Barthes Barthes seeks to critique the significance that we so often instinctively find ourselves ascribing to an individual author of an individual cultural text, and he does so from multiple angles.  However, to bring out the sort of subtleties of Barthes' argument, I really want to start today by focusing on how he develops this notion of the importance of cultural context.  Barthes writes that a text is not a line of words releasing a single theological meaning, the message of the author-god, but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash.
