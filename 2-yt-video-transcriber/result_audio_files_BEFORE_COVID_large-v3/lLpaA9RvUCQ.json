            "text": "all right good morning good evening good afternoon ladies and gentlemen citizens of youtube.  this is pastor dowell.  you know it's um it's very stir disturbing in this country and i'm going to uh read something which i know that people really truly just don't care too much about anyway.  um but i need for you to listen to me for a second so i can try to educate us all and watch this.  we live in a country where your religious preference has no bearing on you being a private citizen.  However, you have never in your life, in your life, watched people respond in such a negative way until you actually come to the truth.  Now think about this for a second.  You know the level of truth that you believe in your end based on the level of attack that is levied against you.  that starts first and foremost with your family and your friends, your colleagues, your acquaintances and associates.  Some people don't care what you believe because in this country you can worship a tree, a rock, a skunk, a dog, a statue, a mouse, food, who cares?  You know, you follow me?  But some people who believe that their opinion is so valid, and they believe it's so valid, that they will go to the point of slandering you based on your religious preferences on what you believe.  And again, if I said I wanted to say it a thousand times, I'm going to say it a thousand and one, that in this country right here, the hypocrisy is amazing because Nobody wants to sit down and have conversation.  Nobody wants what they believe to be challenged by the very book that they say they believe.  Nobody wants to actually have dialogue.  Everybody wants to argue and they want to fuss and fight and debate to the point to where everybody is screaming and hollering and shouting.  And nobody's really truly listening to one another.  Now, before I get into this news story right here, I had to lay that down for a second to show you the way human beings are.  But I want to read you.  Of course, you know how many times I got, like you can tell, this thing has been thumped pretty hard over the years.  I even got some paint spilled on it one time I was reading it.  But anyway, I'm going to read you the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, that's Congress, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances.  Okay.  In other words, basically, if this goes to the highest level of Congress, that they can't show any dishonor and disrespect based on your religious belief system, then that trickles all the way down to the lowest peasant in the United States of America.  And I said all that to say this.  CNNBC, and I'll include the article down below, there was a judge that was appointed to the court, a black judge, a woman, in.  I think it was 2013 or something like that.  But the headline reads, The United States' First Female Muslim Judge Found Dead in Hudson River.  I don't know how this article got past me, so I'm going back in time.  This happened a few years ago.  But it's amazing.  I'm going to read a little bit of it right here.  I cannot get her name right.  So please have mercy on me.  A groundbreaking black jurist who became the first Muslim woman to serve as a U.S.  judge was found dead in New York Hudson River on Wednesday, police said.  Sheila Adas Salam, a 65-year-old associate judge of New York High's court, was found floating off of Manhattan's West Side at about 1.45  p.m.,  a police spokesman said.  The police pulled Salam's fully clothed body from the water and she was pronounced dead at the scene.  Her family identified her and an autopsy would determine the cause of death, spokeswoman said.  Adonis Salam was a native of Washington, D.C.  and became the first African-American woman appointed to the Court of Appeals when Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo named her to the state's highest court in 2013.  Justice Sheila Adonis Salam was a trailblazing justice whose life in public service was in pursuit of far or more fair and more just New York for all.  Cuomo said in a statement, The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History said Adama Salam was the first female Muslim to serve as a U.S.  judge.  Citing unidentified sources, the New York Post reported that Salam had been reported missing from her New York home early on Wednesday.  Attempts to reach her family were unsuccessful.  A graduate of Bernard College and Columbia Law School, Adana Salam stated, I mean, started her law career in East Brooklyn Legal Services, and served as a new york state assistant general attorney general.  according to the court of appeals website she held a series of judicial posts after being elected to the new york city's judgeship in 1991. now it's it's um amazing to me because i don't know as much as i stay up on news how this one slipped past me.  and so don't tell me that this slogan that we have in America, I'm proud to be an American, well, at least I know I'm free.  Now, they've all but forgot the man who died and gave the rights to you.  Well, the song says rights for me because usually U.S.  soldiers, soldiers are the ones who go to war, shed their blood, and die so that you and I can enjoy the fruits of this country right here.  And yet and still, we have people who can run for president and have bone spurs in their feet, dodge the draft.  We can have people skip country.  And come back as presidents.  And now all of a sudden they was chicken when it came time for that number to be called.  And they came back as hawks.  And now it's just utterly amazing.  It's utterly amazing.  And it's also amazing how we selectively choose people.  To remember what we want to remember and forget what we want to forget.  And this is the heightened sense of hypocrisy right here.  We fancy ourselves as judges of other people, but we ourselves are yet found weighed in the balance.  We're just stage playing hypocrites ourselves.  You never seen somebody get so mad at somebody else for the same thing.  You're guilty of yourself.  I say all this to say that do you know the type of security that a judge, even at the state level, Garners, they're very meticulous about how they enter into the building or the courtroom.  They're very discreet about their whereabouts, where they live.  I'm telling you, this stinks to high heaven.  It just literally stinks.  But it need to be out there.  And I don't know how it got by, but it's saying CNNBC, and I'll include a link below, is reporting this.  It's utterly amazing. ",
