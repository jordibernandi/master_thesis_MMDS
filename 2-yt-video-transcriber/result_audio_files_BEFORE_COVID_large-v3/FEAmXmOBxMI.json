            "text": "So I've been thinking lately about how central work is to our entire understanding of politics and sociology, to the point that it has become kind of the ontological starting point of all political discussions.  You know, we talk about the working class, the middle class, parties of the rich, the workers' parties.  And really a prerequisite for partaking in political discussion in the West is this kind of presupposed notion of the inherent virtue and goodness of the kind of working life that most people partake in.  You know, Max Weber talked about the Protestant work ethic and the spirit of capitalism.  And it's gotten to the point now where in my country, as an example, if someone isn't part of this mass of workers, you're almost considered a non-citizen.  Our prime minister here talks about representing people that get up early in the morning and Every discussion of public expenditure is discussed in terms of taxpayers' money and representing taxpayers.  Parties that supposedly advocate for the working class.  They never advocate for greater leisure or from kind of extricating people from the toil of manual labour.  and I want to emphasise manual labour there because in my opinion the toil of the middle class is far more gruesome and depressing and alienating than the labour of the working class.  But all these political discussions are framed in terms of higher wages, higher standard of living, cheaper consumer goods, cheaper junk for people to consume when they're not working.  But the idea of extricating people from labor has been abandoned.  I've been reading recently, up until the early 1930s, both parties in the United States, Republicans and Democrats, both advocated for shorter working weeks.  That's not only been abandoned now in the US, but it's kind of been abandoned everywhere.  You don't see people advocating for something like cutting the working week down to far lower than it is now.  And I think part of that is globalism, because we've put ourselves in such a situation that if we in the West decide that we're going to. ",
