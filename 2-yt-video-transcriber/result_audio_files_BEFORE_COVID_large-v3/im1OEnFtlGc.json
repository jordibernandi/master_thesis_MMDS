People are like, we've got to get different pipelines to get Saudi's oil out of there because the Strait of Hormuz caused all this problem.  No, America wants the Strait of Hormuz in there.  We want to have these bottlenecks so that we can cause problems and to blame everybody else.  This is what we're doing.  And we use our pawns, the UK.  It's ridiculous.
