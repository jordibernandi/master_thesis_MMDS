            "text": "So we're going to go through our verse-by-verse Bible study on Revelation.  Usually, before I start off verse-by-verse, at the first verse, first chapter, I always give an introduction about Revelation.  Okay, so Revelation is a book in your Bible that is written by the author John.  John is the author.  Now, I want to mention right here in our verse-by-verse Bible study on Revelation... that you'll notice the title of your book, it says The Revelation of Saint John the Divine.  Now, some pious independent fundamental Baptists, they're going to say, no, it's not The Revelation of Saint John the Divine, it's The Revelation of Jesus Christ.  So, look at Revelation chapter 1, verse 1.  Notice it says right here, The Revelation of Jesus Christ.  So you'll notice right here that since it says the revelation of Jesus Christ, that Jesus Christ should be the one whose name is after the book of Revelation.  but the problem with this teaching is that you gotta realize that we do realize that jesus christ that this is his revelation that he's giving to john.  we recognize that.  but we don't have to act like overtly pious and say well there's an error right here in the name of the book of your bible because it's technically not revelation of saint john the divine it's a revelation of jesus christ.  that's you got to realize that sometimes When you look at the word of, it can be used where this one is actually the object sometimes.  So this one we know, Revelation of Jesus Christ at chapter 1, verse 1, is the subject.  This is Jesus Christ's revelation.  When we say the revelation of St.  John the Divine, John can be the object in this case, so we don't have to be overtly pious.  Sometimes you'll notice that too.  Sometimes you'll notice in your Bible when it says the word of, and then there's a word after that, it does not technically mean that sometimes that the word after the word of, it has to be a subject all the time.  So you'll notice that several times throughout your Bible.  You'll see that.  Sometimes you'll say the salvation of Jesus Christ or the salvation of God.  Does that mean that God needs salvation?  That he's a subject?  No.  Sometimes the word can be an object after that.  Sometimes it could be an object after that.  So... Revelation does not have to belong to John, but he's the object of it.  He's the object of it.  So we see right here, Revelation belongs to Jesus, but John becomes the object of this case.  So there's nothing wrong with your King James Bible where it says the revelation of St.  John the Divine.  So notice right here that John is the author.  We believe he wrote it sometime before AD 91 or AD 96.  Now the date is important.  You might say, why is that?  Because some scholars, what they want to do is that they want to put this at an earlier date.  Why is that?  They like to put this at an earlier date So that the prophecies in the book of Revelation does not have to come out true.  So that's what they want to do.  So then because they don't like the date, what we believe is this, is that we believe that A.D.  91 to A.D.  96, which is the, we believe that this was long after Nero, sometime at the reign of Domitian.  So for some of you who don't know much about history right here, if you look at the history of the early Christians during that time, they were suffering tremendous persecution under Nero.  Now some authors, what they want to do is that they want to put John at the timeline of Nero.  so that they can apply the fall of Jerusalem.  So we know that Jerusalem lost its capital and city during this timeline, see, or sometimes slightly earlier.  They want to make the book of Revelation applying to the first centuries, not in the future.  That's very important to understand.  The majority of churches, believe it or not, majority of churches or scholars, they try to put revelation within the timeline of the first centuries.  They don't like to put it in the timeline of the future.  Because why does Satan want that?  Because that way you get rid of prophecy at revelation.  and then you get of a book that is current event with today's going on on what's happening soon in the future.  so they want to apply all this during the timeline of the first centuries where jerusalem fell.  no we believe that when it talks about jerusalem falling to the antichrist system that's at the future.  that did not happen under nero in the fall of jerusalem in the first centuries.  we don't believe in that.  There are sources out there that says that John, he was punished by Nero or some other Roman emperor, and he was isolated in the Isle of Patmos.  So that's why they want to enforce John within the first century timeline around here.  so that they can put the fall of Jerusalem after the book of Revelation was written.  But the simple answer is this, is that John, he may have been punished by Nero, but then Domitian just continued the punishment, see?  So there's your simple answer right there.  So he was under the punishment of two emperors.  So you got to think of that possibility as well.  Nevertheless, what we do know is this, is that in... The chronological order and timeline, we put it around 91 to 96 AD. ",
