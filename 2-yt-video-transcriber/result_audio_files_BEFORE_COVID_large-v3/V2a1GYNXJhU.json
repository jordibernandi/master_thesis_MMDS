There's nothing controversial about that.  In the book of Acts, people are telling stories the whole time without writing them down.  They're just telling the stories that they heard.  And so my view is a fairly standard view, which is that the stories were in circulation for many years.  before the Gospel writers produced their accounts.  Jesus and his disciples, of course, were Aramaic speakers in Galilee, a rural part of Galilee, and the Gospels are written in Greek.  And so these are accounts that were originally passed around probably in the native language of Palestine, but then are later written some decades later by Greek-speaking Christians. ",

And and he'd heard the story and he wants to verify it.  So he goes on an archaeological dig, and he finds there was a place called London.  And it was a big place.  And there was a place southwest of it, Wimbledon.  And there was a train line that went to a place called Vauxhall.  And, oh, my God, he finds that there's somebody named Ehrman who actually had a place in Wimbledon.  And he digs further, and he digs in Cambridge.  He finds there's Pete Williamson.  But the story, the way the story continued was that before Ehrman got to the interview, There was a big explosion in Westminster that blew up the entire neighborhood, thousands of casualties because of a gas leak.  And he wants to see if that's true.  And what he finds is that every geographical marking is right.  There is a Wimbledon.  There is a Vauxhall.  There is a Westminster.  There is an Ehrman.

And the priests then say, oh, we've got these 30 pieces of silver.  We can't put them back in the treasury because it's blood money.  It's used to betray blood.  And so they go off and they buy a field, and it's called the field of blood because it's purchased the blood money after Judas has hanged himself.  Luke also wrote the book of Acts, as we were saying.  And in chapter 1, there's a second account of Judas' death.  In this account, what happens is there's nothing about Judas hanging himself.  Nothing about the priest buying the field.  In this account, Judas goes and buys the field before he dies, and he doesn't hang himself.  He somehow falls head first, and his intestines break open and bleed all over the ground.  And so the people in Jerusalem start calling this a field of blood because Judas bled all over it. ",

And the other contradiction is that Judas hangs himself in one story and falls headfirst and explodes, for some reason, in the other.  I've heard an apologist, I'm sorry I wish I could remember who, who tried to explain the first contradiction by saying that Judas technically bought the field in both stories, because in the story in which the priests buy it, they buy it with the blood money that Judas returned to them, so that's technically the same as Judas buying it.  This is sophistry.  If you go to a barber and get a haircut you don't like, and the barber agreed to return your money, then you went and bought lunch with it, it would be very misleading to say that the barber bought you lunch.  If you said that, you wouldn't mean it literally, and you'd probably then explain exactly what you meant.  You wouldn't leave it to somebody else telling the same story to fill in that detail.  Yet that's what some apologists want us to think the New Testament is doing.  We're supposed to believe that one book says that Judas bought the field, and the other fills in the more literal details of what was meant by that.  This is another example of apologists expecting us to believe that the perfect infallible word of God was scribed by people with the communication skills of a wombat with an inner ear infection. ",

You don't have those stories in the earliest Gospels.  And it's striking, and you have to explain, if Jesus did go around calling himself a divine being, You know, if that really happened, as John says.  John says it happened.
