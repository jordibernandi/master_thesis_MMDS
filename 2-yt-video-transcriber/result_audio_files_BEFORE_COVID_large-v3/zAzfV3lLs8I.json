So they'd fill up the maximum weight that the cars could carry and the train would take the gold from New York City to Fort Knox, Kentucky from where the U.S.  Army would move the gold boxes from the train and transport them to the Fort Knox storage facility.  And in this description of the security of Fort Knox, it points out absolutely no visitors are allowed inside.  That's putting it mildly.  Fort Knox hasn't been audited since 1953.  Then we went into the actual mint operations and saw the physical punching out of coins of all different kinds.  Unfortunately, no cameras are allowed in the mint, so we couldn't give you any footage of that.

We thought, ooh, we'll find out about who the Federal Reserve is.  And in here they describe, well, they're going to talk about the purposes and functions of the Federal Reserve, but not necessarily who's in it.  So we thought, well, maybe the book The Federal Reserve would talk about that.  So in that book, there's this lovely page entitled, Who Owns the Fed?

Also, that the globalization of our monetary systems and financial systems worldwide means that any collapse regionally would be not able to be contained and would spread.  Also that globalization of labor moving freely and immigration moving freely between countries means lower wages coming your way, and also that the US dollar, as managed by the Federal Reserve, has lost most of its value over the period of its life, therefore not meeting one of the measures of the definition of money as a store of value.
