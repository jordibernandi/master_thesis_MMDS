            "text": "As I've mentioned in the past, I'm mostly vegetarian.  I occasionally fish, but I avoid all other meat and also cephalopods because they're just too damn smart.  It would be like eating an alien race, like E.T I can't eat  E.T.,  all right?  Sue me.  I think of most people drastically cut down on the amount of meat they ate.  Whether that means going vegan or vegetarian or just celebrating the occasional meatless Monday, the world would be a better place.  We'd have less pollution that we were putting out.  We would have more water to work with and more land to work with.  And also... we would be contributing less to the otherwise senseless torture and murder of innocent animals.  It's actually really easy to be vegetarian these days for most people, especially if you live in the developed world and are middle class.  I'm excited to say that it's actually getting even easier every day thanks to new options like the Impossible Burger hitting the market.  The Impossible Burger is truly a marvel of science.  It's made entirely of plant materials, but it tastes a lot like a real meat burger and it even bleeds like a real hamburger.  Meat eaters who I know who have tried the Impossible Burger have told me that if you just served it to them and didn't tell them it was a veggie burger, they wouldn't know.  That's really amazing.  It's something that's never been personally important to me because I actually prefer the taste of vegetables and mushrooms and things over the taste of hamburger, but it is important for millions of people who just can't imagine giving up meat.  Impossible Burgers have been in select restaurants for several years now, but they just hit a huge new milestone by having Burger King introduce the new Impossible Whopper.  And I promise that this video is not sponsored by Burger King, but you know, if you guys wanna throw a couple Impossible Whoppers my way, I wouldn't necessarily.  Say no.  This is huge because it offers great new visibility and accessibility to people who wouldn't necessarily think of going vegan or vegetarian.  Because when it's as easy as someone just walking into their neighborhood Burger King and seeing that they could get a vegan option of a Whopper for almost the same price, it's a dollar more, they might start thinking critically about what they're choosing to eat.  And speaking of thinking critically, I stumbled upon two delightful arguments against the Impossible Burger.  And I'm going to talk about them now in order of seriousness.  So first up, Right Wing Watch drew my attention to a man named Rick Wiles, who's an internet radio pundit.  who has appeared on Fox News and he used to work for various Christian television networks.  He's sort of like Alex Jones, but he's actually criticized Alex Jones in the past for Jones's controversial statements about things like the Sandy Hook massacre being a faked hoax, saying that Jones's polemics could cause a crackdown on shows like theirs.  So Wiles is like a moderate Alex Jones.  Got it?  Great.  So Wiles hears about the Impossible Burgers coming to Burger King, and here's what he has to say about it. ",

That's where they're going with this, to change the DNA of humans so it will be impossible for a human to be born again.  They want to create a race of soulless creatures on this planet. ",

            "text": "Yeah, moderate.  That's moderate for 2019, I'd say.  There are a few things about this I'd like to point out.  Number one, I had no idea that being born again was something that happened on a genetic level.  Silly me.  I mean, I am born again.  You'd think I would know this.  I grew up Baptist.  I didn't know that scientists had found the soul.  I didn't even know that modern Christians claimed it even could be found after the past two millennia of them trying.  Second, I had no idea that Eating a veggie burger could literally change my DNA.  I didn't know that probably because it's not actually true.  There's nothing in an impossible burger that will harm your DNA, either your soul's DNA or otherwise.  And third, my absolute favorite thing about this clip is that guy off camera who audibly reacts with a, hmm.  just after Wiles announces his thesis as if they're, you know, just chatting at a cocktail party.  and Wiles just proposed a new interpretation he thought of while rereading Ulysses.  So that's one negative take on the Impossible Burger.  The other was brought to my attention by someone else on Twitter who replied to me after I reported that the Impossible Burger was at Burger King and was in fact delicious.  They wrote, staying clear of these until I know a bit more about the genetically modified soy they're using.  Apparently there are open questions about how safe the genetically modified soy is for human consumption.  So if you grow gills or something.  Now I knew immediately that this was bullshit because honestly, not to be all the government will always protect us, but Impossible Burgers have been on the market for literally three years.  next month.  Not only would the FDA have not let them put out a product that is unsafe, but people have been eating the absolute fuck out of these and there have been no reports of any problems.  In fact, Impossible Foods performed their own completely voluntary recall just back in March because a restaurant worker found one tiny piece of plastic in one of the burgers.  No other problems were found in any of the other burgers and the issue never reached a consumer, but they still did the recall without being asked to by the FDA.  Meanwhile, back in September, a factory was forced to recall 100,000 pounds of ground beef because they were infected with E. coli, which led to one person dying and another dozen or so more falling dangerously ill.  I also know that it's bullshit because the idea of growing gills is the sort of thing said only by people who know absolutely nothing about genetically modified food and also who hate genetically modified food anyway, despite their ignorance.  because of their ignorance.  But I was curious to know if this person's misinformation came from a particular source that I could then make a video about.  And sure enough, they did provide me with a link to a Huffington Post article.  As an aside, I regret to inform you that Huffington Post is still in existence.  Don't know if they've started paying their writers or not.  The HuffPo article is from 2017, and it's titled, FDA Casts Doubt on Safety of Impossible Burgers' Key GMO Ingredient.  It's written by contributor Ken Roseborough, who says he's the editor of the Organic and Non-GMO Report.  Funny, because there are no GMOs in the Impossible Burger.  The genetically modified aspect refers to a protein that is put into some yeast.  There is no organism.  There is no O there.  But let's move on anyway.  Ken reports that the FDA told lab meat manufacturer it hadn't demonstrated safety of burgers genetically engineered heme, which has never been in the food supply.  Company put product on the market anyway.  OK, so what's going on here?  First of all, let's not bury the lead.  The FDA has, in fact, approved Impossible Burgers as being safe to eat.  Don't worry about it.  There was a bit of back and forth before that happened, though, and here's why.  The Impossible Burger is so much like meat.  It tastes so much like a real hamburger because of the protein known as heme.  It's the protein that meat releases when you cook it.  They found a way to get heme from a plant source, and that source is soy leghemoglobin.  Leghemoglobin is the plant form of myoglobin, which is the thing that animals have that release heme.  Impossible Foods didn't actually need FDA approval to use leg hemoglobin because all of their ingredients, including soybeans, already qualify as generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, which is used for foods with ingredients that the FDA has already looked at and agreed that they're okay for people to eat.  If the Impossible Burgers weren't generally recognized as safe, they would never have been available in a restaurant.  But to be on the safe side, Impossible Foods went to the FDA and said, here's the exact special ingredient that we're using.  Here's the research that we funded to prove it's safe.  Can you please confirm for the general public that it's safe?  They did this because they knew people like misinformed dudes on Twitter and HuffPost writers would worry about it and would send up an alarm.  The FDA pointed out, though, that while they recognized soybeans as safe, the leg hemoglobin is contained in the root node of the soy, which technically people don't usually eat.  So to be safe, they wanted some more tests done.  The product could stay on the market while they cross these T's and dot these I's.  Impossible Foods agreed to do these tests.  It's unfortunate, though, in part because it made a bunch of hippies lose their damned minds and in part because it forced Impossible Foods to do something they didn't want to do, to test their products on rats by feeding them loads of Impossible Burgers and making sure they didn't explode or whatever.  But they were forced to do it in order to get this recognition by the FDA.  So they did it.  And of course, the product was found to be perfectly safe.  But now, of course, you have hippies losing their damn minds again.  How dare this company that is focused on producing a vegan food be tested on animals?  Seriously, look at this fucking douchebag in The Independent saying Impossible Burgers are as vegan as foie gras.  And PETA ran a fucking press release, of course they did, decrying them.  188 rats were killed in this required testing.  So that means we should just throw all of Impossible Burgers in the trash, right?  Even though millions of cows might not be slaughtered in the future, even though this paves the way for other meatless options to hit the mass market now that that testing has been done, even though this makes vegan diets accessible to literally millions of people, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people who never considered it before, the utter close-minded hypocrisy of that blows my mind.  Fuck you, PETA.  And fuck you random hippies who are saying that the burgers are unsafe because the FDA says so.  That's coming out of one side of your mouth.  And then out of the other side of your mouth, you're saying that 188 rats who died to prove they're safe to the FDA... was too high of a price to pay.  It's ridiculous.  It makes me so angry.  I'll close by encouraging you to go read Patrick Clinton's incredibly informative breakdown of all of this.  Well, most of this up until 2017 when it was published over at the New Food Economy.  There's going to be a link in the transcript below.  Apparently a lot of dipshits missed it the first time around, so I'd love to bring some more attention to it.  And lastly, I will encourage all of you to go to Burger King and eat an Impossible Whopper.  If you were planning to hit up a fast food joint anyway.  You'll be doing the earth a bit of a favor compared to eating a regular hamburger.  It'll be marginally healthier for you.  And you'll be telling the food industry that we want more meatless options.  Everybody wins.  Except for PETA.  Fuck them. ",
