A 24-year-old black man threw a five-year-old white boy off a balcony at the Mall of the America in Bloomington, Minnesota last week.  Now, if a white boy had thrown a five-year-old black boy off the wall, off the balcony at a mall, there'd be riots.  It'd be all over the country.  We'd all be talking about it.  So a 24-year-old black man threw a five-year-old white boy off a balcony at the Mall of the America in Bloomington, Minnesota last week.  His name was Emmanuel, or is Emmanuel Agrande.  Allegedly grabbed the five-year-old, landed and threw him 40 feet off the third floor of the mall.  The boy survived, thank God.  The boy survived, and the man was captured and is being held in suspicion of attempted homicide.  Aranda had a history of mental health problems and had twice been ordered to stay away from the mall.  CBS Minnesota, a witness explains what happened. ",
