They let me out of prison on a day pass because I found out that my apartment is being foreclosed on by the World Bank.  All they left me was my favorite chair and my old trusty kitchen knife.  I'm going to bring this into prison and hopefully take over.  All I have to do is sneak it past the prison guard Gort, who's waiting outside for me in the car.  The guy's so friggin' annoying.  Anyways, this week we've got a great program for you as we call series regulars Matt Connerton, JJ McCartney, and the Right Chicks.  Plus, a new show called the Dr.  Nina Show and the return of our friends at Buds and Suds.  First though, Sam Seder and the Majority Report have been wonderful in bringing people over to the channel.  In fact, many of you are probably watching this right now as a direct result of the majority report.  And you'd think that would exclude them from pranks.  But if you think that, then you think wrong.  Check it out. ",
