            "text": "Last year, in April, a murderer known as the Golden State Killer was caught by the police, having his DNA information discovered by looking through the databases of GEDmatch, a website in which people volunteer their genetic codes in hopes of finding relatives and ancestors.  The same year in June, it was discovered that Facebook's algorithms for advertising categories had included a category for people who might be interested in treason against their government.  This year in April, a tweet went viral when a woman was wondering how an airline at an airport was able to scan her face to determine she had bought a ticket when she had not consented for them to store any facial recognition data.  What do all of these examples have in common?  They're all examples of the fact that we live in a society of control.  In 1990, philosopher Gilles Deleuze wrote an essay called Postscript on the Societies of Control, where, using a term borrowed from William S. Burroughs, he argued that we were entering a new type of society, a society of control.  but to fully understand what this means we first have to know what societies of control are contrasted with namely foucault's analysis of disciplinary societies which in turn were contrasted with societies of sovereignty.  in his book discipline and punish michel foucault argued that with modernity came a new type of society which he defined by the way in which such a society exercises power.  previously in feudal times the west consisted of societies of sovereignty.  this means that the law was seen as the will of the sovereign typically the king.  crimes were seen as attacks on the king as infringements upon his will.  therefore punishments were seen as a matter of revenge revenge on behalf of the king and thus typically involved the infliction of direct physical pain.  but with the decline of feudalism and the rise of modernity came a new regime of power the disciplinary one.  Disciplinary society, whether in the school, the hospital, the factory, or the prison, made use of three main techniques.  Hierarchical observation, normalizing judgment, and the examination.  First, people are hierarchically ranked with the purpose of observing everyone's behavior.  A significant function is carried out even by just the thought that you might currently be under observation.  When you're at a store and you see a camera, there doesn't even need to be someone watching the footage.  The possibility that someone is watching alone is enough for you to regulate your own behavior as if you are being watched.  Then comes normalization.  As your behavior is observed, it is judged as normal or abnormal.  and abnormal behavior is discouraged and punished.  In the old sovereign societies, criminal actions were mostly judged on whether they were allowed by the law or not, but disciplinary societies also judge whether it's normal.  And this is done partly by examination, whether medical, psychological, legal, educational, or moral examination, everyone is measured according to common standards and placed into categories according to the results.  Foucault argues that the reason for the emergence of such a system is that it exercises power much more effectively.  If you, say, stole something in a society of sovereignty, perhaps you'd be flogged or your hand would be cut off as revenge for stealing.  However, in a disciplinary society, by teaching people to regulate their own behavior according to a standard and by inducing the feeling of constant surveillance, you make it less likely that someone would want to steal in the first place.  Not only that, but in a society of sovereignty, if you wanted to rebel against the regime, it would be very easy to identify who to rebel against, namely the king and those carrying out the king's will.  In a disciplinary society, power is dispersed through a number of different institutions, and is thus harder to resist.  Finally, in a society of sovereignty, when you see someone being tortured for a crime, it is easier to sympathize and feel sorry for the victim, and to rouse your anger against the regime.  In a disciplinary society, on the other hand, institutions present themselves not as punishing, but as merely reforming individuals for their own good, and are therefore often not even seen as mechanisms of power.  the way foucault put it societies of sovereignty tax production and rule on death whereas disciplinary societies organize production and administer life.  let's take this point by point.  consider a serf working.  under feudalism a common arrangement would be that the king owning the land sets a tax for how much of the serf's product he will take for himself.  However, beyond this, so long as he'd produced the required amount, many aspects of the production process were actually up to the serf and his family.  When to work and when to take a break, what technique, method, or tools to use, when to eat, what to wear, what room to be in,  etc.,  the sovereign regime did not organize production, but merely taxed it.  in a disciplinary society on the other hand production is well disciplinary.  you are told when to come to work when to take a break when to eat lunch what to wear how to stand how to behave what techniques and methods to use etc.  etc.  Depending on your line of work, almost every aspect of your being can be decided by someone else.  Thus, your work is not merely taxed, it's organized.  Secondly, whereas a society of sovereignty ruled over death, issuing death penalties and deciding who dies when they commit a crime, a disciplinary society administers life, where it's not just death, but birth that is organized and controlled, through the study and manipulation of birth-to-death ratios, rates of reproduction, the fertility of populations, and so on.  The purpose of a disciplinary society was summarized by Deleuze as being to concentrate, distribute in space, order in time compose a productive force.  schools hospitals prisons barracks factories and offices all functioned according to this purpose spatial enclosure adherence to a schedule and strict discipline.  understanding this we can now ask what makes a society of control different?  but keep in mind that de leuze is not arguing that we have completely left behind disciplinary societies.  he saw that we are in the process of transforming into a new one.  perhaps the most significant thing is that in the society of control the exercise of power no longer requires enclosing people into spaces like the school the factory or the prison.  Disciplinary regimes leave the tight enclosures of space and expand and permeate the entirety of society.  Take phones for example.  It is no secret that your phone collects a lot of data.  Your GPS location, audio recordings, websites you've been to, and apps you've used.  And it is also no secret that this data is often utilized by governments and corporations.  What's interesting here is that in a disciplinary society, the exercise of power required to restrict your methods of communication.  A society of control, on the other hand, tells you to please, by all means, have a phone and use it, because the more you use it, the more you can be surveilled, sampled, evaluated, and harvested for data.  As another example, take airports that use facial recognition technology, something that is becoming increasingly more common.  The more you fly, the more facial recognition data they're able to collect, as well as information about your transportation habits.  Whereas a disciplinary society has to restrict your movement into tight spaces in order to monitor and observe you, a society of control encourages you to expand your movement, because it means that there is more data that can be collected.

            "text": "You see, a control is not a discipline.  I would say, for example, of a highway, that there you do not lock people up, but by making highways, you multiply means of control.  I do not say that this is the only goal of the highway, but people can turn infinitely and without being locked up at all, while being perfectly controlled. ",

            "text": "This is our future.  The methods by which you are controlled and monitored are no longer perceived as methods of control at all, but rather as exercises of your own freedom.  This is what makes societies of control so dangerous and so effective.  When I buy a phone, make a Facebook account, do a DNA test, use a credit card, or go to an airport, I am doing all of it by my own volition.  Yet by that very act, I'm increasing the power that institutions have over me.  Once it is decided that I have transgressed the standards of some institution, it is very easy to then limit my freedom, place prohibitions on me, and punish me from a distance.  To an increasing extent, we rely on things like electronic cards, internet accounts, codes, and mobile services, which can be shut off at any moment.  thus the exercise of power no longer requires direct physical intervention.  instead it can be exercised merely through the manipulation of flows of information.  it is common for people to undermine the extent of this.  Consider, for example, the fact that, at least in the  U.S.,  your internet service provider collects your browsing data, and that it is perfectly legal for them to sell it to both corporations and governments.  The amount of U.S.  government requests for private Facebook data has been steadily increasing, with 34,000 requests in 2017.  85% of such requests were granted by Facebook, without requiring you to consent or even be informed about it.  Microsoft, Google, and Apple also all send data about their users to the government, each granting more than half of government requests for such data.  And it's not confined to social media either.  As shown by the example of the Golden State Killer, if you have relatives who have used DNA testing technology, even if distant ones, there's a high chance that information about your genetic code is available to corporations and governments as well.  And when I talk about control and power, I'm not just talking about being arrested as an enemy of the state.  All institutions use such data for the purposes of control, whether in deciding what product to advertise for you, or in deciding whether they should hire you, or accept you into a given educational program, or even in making legal decisions that pertain to you.  The significance of such forms of control should not be underestimated.  But if control no longer requires enclosing people into defined areas, what does this mean for institutions like schools, workplaces, and prisons?  Deleuze's answer is that, whereas in a disciplinary society you pass from one to the other, from the school to the barracks, from the barracks to the factory, in a society of control you reside in several at once, at all times, not having to leave one to enter another.  As Deleuze says, just as the corporation replaces the factory, perpetual training tends to replace the school, and continuous control to replace the examination.  in the disciplinary societies one was always starting again from school to the barracks from the barracks to the factory while in societies of control one is never finished with anything.  the corporation the educational system the armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and the same modulation.  In a disciplinary society, because institutions were spatial, at least you knew when you left them.  You knew when you've left the workplace and were able to take a break from work for the day.  But this is increasingly not the case in a society of control.  Even when you're at home, you're expected to continue doing work, filling out papers, constantly checking your email and watching out for updates, and presenting yourself as a committed employee even in your personal life, especially on social media.  You never really leave work.  Some examples are summarized in the paper, You Can Clock Out Anytime You Like, But You Can Never Leave, by Peter Fleming and Andre Spicer.  For example, sociologist Gideon Kunda studied a high-tech corporation in the U.S The study, quote, revealed that the expectation for long working hours was built into the organization culture and was very difficult to resist once it had been internalized.  The organization he called tech attempted to appropriate as much time as possible from organizational members, and this could only be done if workers come to actively desire it themselves.  The tech culture was designed to constitute this desire through various mechanisms of role embracement, so that workers would think of themselves as tech employees all the time.  As a result of this management approach, many employees found their family and home life suffered because they gave more and more of themselves to the firm and experienced burnout role contradiction and other kinds of pathologies.  indeed even though workers endeavored to maintain some kind of spatial distance many found that work and non-work aspects of social ties are experienced as hard to separate requiring constant definition and redefinition and are never fully resolved.  And sociologist Catherine Casey studied an electronics manufacturer that had built a high-commitment culture.  Casey's study concludes that it is not only the personal time of employees that is appropriated by the company, but also their identities, a process she ominously labels the corporate colonization of the self.  When this occurs, workers become company people even at home and cannot think about anything other than their job and the well-being of the firm.  Many of these employees were classified by Casey as neurotic and obsessive-compulsive because they have allowed the company to erode the identity boundaries that once separated them from the organization and subsequent burnout as psychic anxiety and contradiction become too intense.  Various phenomena like working from home, working for school credit, wearing ankle monitors, using online doctors, attest to the fact that institutions no longer have to spatially enclose people in order to function.  What counts is that we are at the beginning of something, Deleuze says.  In the prison system, the attempt to find penalties of substitution, at least for petty crimes, and the use of electronic collars that force the convicted person to stay at home during certain hours.  for the school system.  continuous forms of control and the effect on the school of perpetual training.  the corresponding abandonment of all university research.  the introduction of the corporation at all levels of schooling.  for the hospital system.  the new medicine without doctor or patient that singles out potential sick people and subjects at risk in the corporate system.  new ways of handling money profits and humans that no longer pass through the old factory form.  deluse says that we are no longer individuals but dividuals.  the origin of the word individual means not divisible something that cannot be divided and disciplinary society consisted of such individuals usually assigned a number in different institutions.  But in a society of control, it is no longer true that we cannot be divided.  We are constantly divided into demographics, marketing samples, survey results, statistics.  It is through these aggregates of information that institutions view us.  The number is replaced by the code.  What's impressive about Deleuze's essay is how well, even in the early 90s, it was able to identify the trends that we are even more clearly moving towards today.  What's important, however, is not just to identify such trends but identify their dangers and new methods of resistance.  Deleuze is not saying that societies of control are worse than disciplinary societies, or that disciplinary societies are worse than sovereign ones.  There is no need to fear or hope, he says, but only to look for new weapons.  Many young people strangely boast of being motivated.  They re-request apprenticeships and permanent training.  It's up to them to discover what they're being made to serve, just as their elders discovered, not without difficulty, the telos of their disciplines.  Thank you.
