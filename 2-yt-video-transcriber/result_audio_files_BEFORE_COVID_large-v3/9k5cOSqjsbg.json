We don't have presidential briefings anymore.  All we have is Chopper Talk, which is not the same thing.  And to give an idea of what these impromptu sessions, what form they can take, I believe it was yesterday's Chopper Talk.  Maybe two days ago, but yesterday, I think.  In the span of one Chopper talk, he called the Danish Prime Minister nasty for not selling him Greenland.  He referred to himself as the chosen one while literally looking at the heavens.  He said he could unilaterally end birthright citizenship, which isn't true.  He talked about serving more than 14 years as president.  And he threatened to send thousands of captured ISIS fighters into Europe if they don't do what he wants.  In one Chopper talk, and the thing is, those press briefings, a lot of people feel like were kind of pointless anyway.  That they were never gonna get any accurate information, it was just a venue for Sarah Huckabee Sanders to lie to them.

I wish that there was something like question time in the UK.  He should go before the actual representatives.  I mean, that could be a mess too.  It often is in the UK.
