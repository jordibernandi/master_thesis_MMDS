See, I called it Part 3 because when I started working on Parts 1 and 2, I thought I was making a much shorter video, and I was gonna pad it out with this claim that I thought was just unbelievably dumb.  And if you've seen parts one and two, you know how that went.  Those ended up being like an hour and a half combined almost.  And then I followed that up with a two-part response to his response to part one.  And this part's not even about the same video as the first two parts were, so it's really a whole new response.  And calling it part three makes absolutely no sense, but I'm doing it anyway.  Yeah, it's dumb.  Don't worry about it.  Moving on. ",

I mean, we're already talking about dragon shapeshifters that fly on their sides.  I don't see why them being big would stretch your imagination.  Maybe they're big giant dragon-shaped airliners the Reptoids use to fly around between their moon cities.  Who's to say?  Sounds reasonable to me.  But okay, if for some reason it really does have to mean the moon is close, meaning the moon is really quite tiny, then I want to know more about the lifestyle of these moon dragon shapeshifters.  I mean, they seem to fly straight across the moon without stopping every time, and then they fly straight off the side.  That's an odd thing to do if you live on that moon, don't you think?  Do you have any videos of these dragons landing on the moon?  Do they have some sort of nesting behavior?  Do they crawl into craters and live under the surface like giant moles?  What do they eat if the moon's so small and apparently so desolate?  Is there some kind of Journey to the Center of the Earth-style underground wonderland?  And hold up, wait a minute.  If the moon's so tiny, then the people who live in the buildings on it, who we talked about in the last video, are they teeny tiny little people?  Little itty-bitty finger-sized moon gnomes cowering in their underground hovels in constant terror of the comparatively enormous moon dragons?  Oh, Donnie, I have so many questions!  None of which will likely ever be answered, because that's it for the Moondragons part of the video.  Now you go on typing about how serious is a Stargate, because it looks weird when it's out of focus, showing yet again that you don't actually know what out of focus means, and putting the lie once again to your excuse in your response to me, that you do know the objects you film.  just look the way they do because they're hideously out of focus, and you're really actually just trying to film the watery firmament in front of them, and not trying to see what the objects actually look like.  Yes, you are trying to see something about what they actually look like by taking them out of focus.  You just confirmed it again, you liar.  Alright, so, is everyone as confused as I am about that video?  Good, I'm glad it's not just me.  I think the biggest outstanding question here is why does Donnie think this video shows that the birds are definitely on the surface of the moon?  Well, if all we had to go on was this video itself, we'd be completely out of luck, but luckily, he's active in the comments.  John Daly says, I'm pretty sure those black objects are bats.  I live next to an old church with the eaves full of them.  They look exactly like that.  Yeah, that's true, John.  They could be bats, too.  Who knows?  I'll just keep on calling them birds because I don't feel like saying or a bunch, but yeah. ",

            "text": "Uh-huh, okay, okay, I think, yeah, it is, it's an actual argument, kinda.  Wow, this is great!  Alright, Donnie, I think I finally see the source of your confusion here.  See, the way you're talking about focus, I think you think it works something like this.  Is that about right?  Like everything on the focal plane is in focus, but everything closer or further from you is out of focus, right?  But as you already know, if you've ever experimented with your equipment or watched a movie or seen a photograph or looked at your own drone footage once in your life, that's not how it works.  What you're missing is that it actually works more like this.  There's a range of distances that's acceptably well-focused, and outside of that range, objects get progressively more out of focus as they get further away from that focused area.  And that focused range is called your depth of field.  This depth of field varies by your focal length, your aperture size, the exact definition of acceptable focus, and the distance to the subject you're focusing on.  That last one might sound a little bit confusing, but the point is, as you focus further and further away, you get a larger and larger depth of field.  And eventually it gets so large that everything from a certain distance away to infinity is at acceptable focus.  Depth of field is why you can, for example, take a picture showing both an object in the near foreground and a distant part of the landscape both in focus.  We've seen your brilliant leaf example before, where some leaves at one distance were in focus and some leaves further away weren't.  Well, you could have changed that.  Maybe not as easily with your spotting scope, considering its fixed aperture, but if you took one of your normal photo cameras, it would have been a breeze.  Just switch your f-stop and you have more or less stuff in focus.  Anyway, that's enough about depth of field for now, unless I have to get into some more specific details later.  You can research this yourself, Donnie, very easily.  Just type depth of field into Google or YouTube or something and start reading or start watching or whatever.  And you probably should.  I mean, once again, you don't quite seem to understand the technology you're working with, but for some reason you still base your entire understanding of the world on your assumption that you do.  You know so little that you don't even know what you don't know and you think you know it all.  I guess you could call it the Donnie Kruger effect.

If it worked the way you said, then every time you tried to take a look at the landscape with your telescope, you'd see nothing but giant birds and bugs flying around blocking your view of the mountains just because they're closer, and therefore must look bigger than the mountains for some reason, regardless of how far away they are.

            "text": "Are you sure they're in focus?  Those birds are looking a little blurry in this one, Donnie.  Either way, in the first video we looked at, they look pretty well in focus.  And in that case, the reason is that you're shooting with a depth of field that has both the moon and the birds at acceptable focus.  And yes, that is possible.  Here, let me show you.  In a previous video, we already saw the comment you left on your bird moon video about which telescope you're using.  Celestron AstroMaster Telescope with Orion Digital Eyepiece Camera.  Which is odd, because this is actually after you said you'd started using your spotting scope for moon observation, but whatever.  So since you're using an eyepiece camera, your telescope's basically just operating like a big ol' camera lens.  So we're gonna use this calculator.  Your Celestron PowerSeeker has a 1000mm focal length, focal ratio 7.87, which will round to 8, and your eyepiece camera has a 1 over 2.5 inch sensor.  Now, we don't have that option on this site, so we'll just calculate for a half-inch sensor and a third-inch sensor and split the difference for a close enough kind of answer.  As for your subject distance, well, your subject is the Moon, and the Moon is about 384,000 kilometers away, so we'll put 384 million meters.  I'll note down these two numbers.  This is the result for the half-inch sensor.  And now I'll switch to a one-third-inch sensor and note the same numbers down again.  and now I'll split the difference to get my good enough answer.  And here we go.  So you can see that if you focus on an object 384 million meters away with your telescope and camera combination, everything from a little bit less than 10 kilometers away all the way to infinity would be an acceptable focus.  And if instead you chose to focus on the hyperfocal distance, the distance at which everything from half of the subject distance to infinity is in focus, your depth of field is even deeper, from less than 5 kilometers all the way to infinity, which is pretty Probably not what you were expecting if you thought you were focusing on one single point, and everything closer or further from that should be out of focus.  I'm sorry, Donnie, but that's just not how focus works.  What you need to do is watch some educational videos on photography, maybe play with your stuff a little bit, and try to learn so you can stop thinking random birds or moon-dwelling dragon shapeshifters just because you don't know how your stuff works.  But all right, you're probably wondering if a bird several kilometers away where it would be in focus will actually look that big through your telescope, right?  Well, let's figure it out.  I really need a light pole moment in this video anyway.  So first off, I just want to figure out exactly what I'm looking at here.  So I want to know when exactly you took this image so I can get a full image of the moon to compare it to.  In your reply to Jessica Colorado, you say you filmed it at 10 p.m.  Eastern Time, the day before you uploaded the video.  So February 19th.  Here's a picture of how the moon would have looked at that time, 3  a.m.,  February 20th, UTC.  I fit your image onto this one the best I could.  It's not quite perfect because of the atmospheric distortion, but it's okay.  So according to CalSky, the moon's angular size on February 19th was 33 minutes 26 seconds, or 2006 arcseconds.  And in the image, the bird is roughly 20 pixels across, whereas the moon is about 2243 pixels across.  That makes the bird 0.89% of the angular size of the moon.  And as I said, the moon's angular size is 2006 arcseconds, so multiply that by 0.0089, and we get about 18, the bird's angular size in arcseconds.  So let's take a guess at the size of our bird and then figure out how far away it would be.  We'll think of this in terms of a diameter.  I'm sort of idealizing it as a circle with a diameter roughly representing the head-to-tail length or the length of a single wing.  I've tried this with various sizes of birds, and I found that birds with a 1.5-foot diameter, that is, the size of a medium-to-large seagull, work just fine.  if we say you're focused at the hyperfocal distance with its near limit of about 4,800 meters or almost 16,000 feet.  So that already proves that this can be a bird, and a fairly small one at that.  But with our other near limit, considering the moon is the subject, it's too close to fall within your depth of field.  I want to see if there's a bird in Florida that can be further away than both of our near limits, because... I don't know, I like to be extra thorough even when I don't need to be.  So what kinds of larger birds does Florida have?  Well, cranes and herons are common.  There are pelicans, maybe geese.  Plenty of birds that could have a wingspan of a good six feet or so, or three feet if you see them from the side in flight with the wings stretched upward.  So let's solve for distance based on a three foot real width and an 18 arc second angular size.  And that distance is 34,377 feet, or 10,478 meters.  Well, no matter which of our two near limits you take, that's well within your depth of field.  So that big ol' bird's easily in focus.  And I don't know about you, Donny, but I find it a little bit more plausible that there are biggish birds in Florida than that there are sideways-flying dragon shapeshifters on the moon.  Just sayin'. ",
