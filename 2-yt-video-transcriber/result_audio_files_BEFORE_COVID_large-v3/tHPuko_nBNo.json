            "text": "You know, Mama always says that life was like a box of chocolates.  You never know which one you're gonna get.  I'm sorry, but, uh, are you talking to me?  No, I'm not talking to you.  Are you talking to me?  I ain't talking to nobody.  I'm waiting on the bus to take me to the grocery store to get me some toilet paper.  Huh, toilet paper.  You know, that takes me back to the day that I met a very dear friend.  Hi, I'm Yancy.  Yancy Pelosi.  My name's Alexandria.  Hashtag AOC.  Hashtag AOC, huh?  Are you like a robot or something?  Are you stupid?  Mama always says stupid things but stupid things, you know?  Sure.  Yep.  Me and hashtag AOC, we're the best of friends.  We went together like popcorn and ketchup.  So that's a garbage disposal.  Yo, yo, hashtag AOC.  That's a baseball mitt.  Oh, I've got so much to learn.  Yeah, we were the best of friends.  I taught her how to read, and she taught me how to... Well, she didn't really teach me much, but, you know, we were really good friends.  Hey, those look like comfortable shoes.  Yeah, they comfortable, so what?  I remember my first pair of shoes.  I bet if I think about it real hard, I can remember my first pair of shoes.  Mama said they'd take me anywhere.  Jog, Nancy, jog!  Now, you wouldn't believe it to look at me, but I can run like the wind blows.  I don't really give a damn.  From that point on, if I was going somewhere, I was running.  Jog, Nancy, jog!  I was like Superman, running faster than the speed of light.  I told you I don't care.  Stop talking to me.  You know, you remind me of my good friend, Maxine.  Seems just like yesterday.  we first met for the first time.  My name is Maxine Waters.  People call me Crazy Maxine Waters.  My name's Nancy Pelosi.  People call me Nancy Pelosi.  Nice to meet you, Nancy Pelosi.  Nice to meet you, Crazy Maxine Waters.  Yeah, me and Crazy Maxine, we did everything together.  We were inseparable.  We went together like gummy bears and cauliflower.  Nancy Pelosi, you ever been to Los Angeles?  Yo, Crazy Maxine Waters, I can't say that I have.  Well, you gotta promise me you'll come out there and visit me in my district.  That's a deal!  But one of our favorite memories was the day that we met Lieutenant Schumer.  Well, don't just stand there like a bunch of weirdos.  Go fight the war!  We did go fight that war.  We fought that war together.  But just like all great friendships, I had to say goodbye to Crazy Maxine Wallace.  Nancy Pelosi?  Yes?  I don't want to go.  Okay.  Years later, I realized that I could have added a few more sentimental words to my last moments with crazy Maxine Waters.  That was the same day I got shot in the buttocks.  How many times I got to tell you I don't care?  Yeah, the doctor, he gave me a kiss, too.  I said I don't care.  He tastes like cigarettes.  And that's all I got to say about that. ",
