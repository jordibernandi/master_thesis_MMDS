No matter where you go in the world, this is one of those places that you never forget.  Another friend of mine, Jon Voight, I want to just congratulate you.  I know him so well, and he's a special, special man with a very, very, very, very special family.  So, congratulations on receiving the National Humanitarian Medal.  Each of today's recipients has made outstanding contributions to American society, culture and life.  They exemplify the genius, talent and creativity of our exceptional nation.  I want to hear that whole song, but I don't know, John.  Maybe we got to get it moving a little bit.  But what a great movie.  You've made some of the greatest movies of all time.  Thank you very much.  Actor and friend, John Voight is one of America's greatest living legends in cinema.  As the memorable Ed Gentry, he played one of the leading roles in Deliverance, another great one.  Whee!  And that was some great movie.  Everyone was crying at that movie.  I tried not to, John, but it wasn't easy.  It wasn't easy.  John's an actor of astonishing range and depth and inhabited the role of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor.  He was so great.  John Voight, you are an amazing artist and a beloved icon of the American film.  John Voight. ",
