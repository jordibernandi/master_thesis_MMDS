            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with the week ending 9 August 2019 with The Weekly Perspective.  Right now on the screen for those that are watching this by video, best thing to do to find our work and our free stuff is go to the main site, hit the blog.  scroll down a little bit and all these updates that I do.  interviews.  I'm usually asked to speak to an interviewer two three times a week and then I always do this with perspective.  so it's right here on the blog pretty easy usually a little icon and you can just scroll.  hit your mouse and you see the the interview now also going back one and this is i think even more important for those that are scarce on time.  i do have a uh excuse me i do have a podcast and i don't talk about that too much but This is a way for you to get these updates, audio only.  And they're right here from the Financial Survival Network.  Carrie Lett set it up for me.  So these are also on my podcast.  So if you're looking for the weekly perspective, it's on iTunes and it's also on Android.  So with that said, let's get right into it.  First thing about the markets, I'll talk with the stock market, which I usually do.  And the market's in a hesitant uptrend.  The Dow theory is showing that utilities are leading, which is a defensive posture, and the transportations are lagging heavily, which means, by Dow theory, we're probably into some resistance here in the overall stock market.  Moving to the next topic here from Wolf Street.  Wolf Richter, 12 countries with negative 10-year yields, a race to health.  Early day brings new indications that the financial world is going from already nuts to even nuttier.  According to Bloomberg, the total amount of bonds outstanding globally are trading with a negative yield exceeding the first time $15 trillion.  This includes government and corporate debt and also some Euro junk bonds that have joined the elite group, which is these negative yielders.  A chart like this of markets and central banks chasing each other further and further into the negative yield absurdity is crying out loudly, quote unquote, somebody has got to put a stop to this race to hell.  I won't read the whole article.  Anyone that knows anything about finance, this is a first and these type of things don't end well.  The central banks basically have lost control.  They won't admit it, but you can't solve a debt problem with more debt.  And when you start, producing negative yield, this is supposedly going to get people to spend money.  In other words, why would you loan money for any length of time to get back less money?  Why would you ask somebody to steal from you?  Especially on a longer term basis when you're supposed to be putting that money to work and it's supposed to be producing something of value to yourself and hopefully society at the same time, and you reap a reward for that.  Crazy, wacky, upside down world.  Further proof that we're probably nearing the next financial crisis.  Pretty much the rest of the next 10 minutes or so.  I try to keep these under 15.  We'll be talking primarily the precious metals.  And this is from Mish Talk.  Pretty good job.  I used Mish's work on this weekly update a few times.  Gold blast through 1500.  Message, and I love this.  Central banks out of control, not inflation.  Gold blasted through the 1500 level today.  Let's analyze the message.  Here's a hint.  It is an inflation.  The above chart for the end of the day yesterday.  Gold closed at 1484.  You can read this article.  He's looking at Stephanie Pomboy.  She's... Not as big a gold bug as some of us, I guess, but she's certainly level-headed and certainly has a lot to say about it and aligns herself with reality.  So I definitely like her.  Never met her.  Like to.  And this chart with gold versus faith in central banks.  Very interesting chart.  Don't have time to go over it.  You probably can't see the screen anyway, and this is mostly a podcast.  But I think the headline is what's important here.  And the next one up is from CNBC Markets.  Gold is set to stay strong for the next 6 to 12 months, economist says.  The world right now is in a precarious state and gold is due to benefit from this situation, according to Howie Lee, economist that oversees Chinese banking corporation.  Gold was changing hands at about $14.95 per ounce on Wednesday.  Midday Asian time had risen $12 on the day.  A host of global factors means gold price is set to maintain its strength at least for the next six to 12 months, according to economists from top Singapore bank.  The world right now is a precarious state and gold is due to benefit.  The gold is changing hands.  As I said, we are seeing a perfect mix of ingredients in the melting pot.  We have low rates.  We have a soft dollar.  We have trade tensions.  We have geopolitical tensions along the Persian Gulf, Lee told CNBC's Capital Connection.  He added that such a barrage of risks could propel gold to its more than six-year high and lead investors to take a risk-off approach to their portfolios.  In other words, investors are uncertain about near-term global economic trends and are likelier to gravitate toward lower-risk assets.  They are piling their funds into gold, Lee said.  Well, there's one thing he left out, and that is that all the stuff that he said is, I won't say nonsense, but near nonsense.  I'm going to call it near nonsense, and here's why.  We've had a lot of this political tensions for a lot longer than just this last couple of months.  The second thing is that there's always a good time to buy gold basis the fundamentals.  The fact remains that the only reason you're going to get a move like this in the gold market is one reason and one reason only, and very few talk about it.  And that is that the physical market is absolutely positively and completely taken control.  Perhaps, and listen to me, perhaps temporarily.  I don't know.  What I do know is how often I've looked at the gold trading for my life.  And you don't see trades like this taking place.  You don't see a 53,000 contract change.  That was last week.  I haven't looked at the data yet.  I'll do for my members here after I finish this video.  and the gold price remain the same or go higher.  So the physical gold market has taken control.  Again, I want to repeat myself.  Does that mean it's from here on up all the way?  And the answer is I don't know, and I somewhat doubt it.  But whatever physical demand is out there or demands are out there, they could accelerate.  In other words, more people could join alongside demanding physical and makes it harder and harder to get.  And as the price goes higher, someone's going to say, hey, I'll take the profit.  And here's your gold.  And then they could settle whatever is required out there.  The problem is most of the public loves high-priced metals.  So the public will buy $1,500, $1,550, $1,600 gold.  No problem whatsoever at all.  And then if you look at gold from a more realistic standpoint, let me say a bigger picture viewpoint.  Over 70 countries have gold at all-time highs right now.  Let me repeat myself, 70 countries more than are having their gold price at all-time highs right now.  So even though in U.S.  terms, which everybody focuses on, and gold's at over $1,500 or thereabouts, and it's the highest it's been in six years, and all that's the truth, if the reality is in other currencies, gold is at all-time highs.  Nothing is more bullish for a commodity than a new high.  So get ready.  I'm not saying we're not going to see a breather in gold.  I actually expect one.  Fairly soon, but every time we seem to get it, it's very brief.  I did expect gold to see 1400.  It did.  It got about four or five trades in there and then bounced right back up.  Early in the week, I spoke for the first time here at the Investor Expo, so I was the last speaker in that block.  And it was 45 minutes.  It was about a half-hour presentation on my part, talking primarily about the silver market.  Of course, I alluded to gold as well and the overall economic health of the global financial system.  And I don't know how to get access to this, but I will provide it to my free list.  I think there is a replay available.  And, uh, it was very, uh, well done.  I really enjoyed participating in this forum.  It's the first time I've done it.  So just bring it to your attention.  I was asked, uh, to probably speak again in September.  And if you're on the free email list at the Morgan report.com, just give me a name and an email, verify it's you.  And once you're on the free list, which is the best place to get not only the weekly perspective, but, uh, All the interviews I do during the week, book offers, sometimes a coin dealer will give a special and put it out to our list with my permission, of course.  So there's that.  I think we're going to see some very interesting times.  I'm really anxious to see the commitment of traders, which I'm going to do after I finish this video.  And it is interesting times.  Gold is definitely trading differently.  There's no doubt about it.  I think it really is the physical market that is starting to take charge.  And again, it's indefinite to know how long that will take place.  And of course, the factors that the mainstream talks about with, you know, the trade war and political tensions.  Yeah, you could factor that in.  But really, when you look at the markets objectively, gold or silver or any commodity doesn't ask, why are you buying?  It doesn't say, well, is it from this region or from this place?  Or, you know, do you have a good reason?  It's just, it's a buying pressure.  And it's buying pressure on gold.  And it's strong buying pressure.  And why is, in fact, somewhat immaterial.  The fact remains that there's a lot of buying pressure.  The problem is, for the shorts, is that whenever they try to take an attack on gold right now, It doesn't have any meaning.  The attack lasts very short duration and gold pops right back up.  So definitely trading differently.  Let's keep our eyes on it.  Where is it going to take a breather, see some profit taking?  The open interest has come down.  I have to look again.  I'm going to do another video, as I just said.  But very interesting times.  This, I thought, would be the year.  I know I've been wrong in the past.  I expected... Gold and silver recover earlier, and I thought 2016 was it.  As I've said many times, I admit that.  But here we are in reality.  Today is today, and tomorrow is tomorrow.  So right now, the gold market is looking good.  Silver is not really confirming as much as I'd like.  It certainly has a lot of resistance at $17 US.  And I think it's going to have a little bit of trouble getting through there.  But last time, the gold was at this level.  Silver is about $25.50.  Silver was at about, I think it was about a 55 to 1 ratio at this time.  the last time gold was at this level.  So silver's got a lot of catching up to do.  I feel that it will.  I don't feel there's any physical demand on silver like I see in gold right now, but could take place rather easily with silver being such a small market.  So interesting times.  Remember, nothing is more powerful than the truth.  And align yourself with that truth, especially in all of your affairs.  And primarily look at what's really going on in the financial markets.  Many of you that listen, look at this as entertainment, but it is physical and financial reality.  And if you are underweight metals, you should get aligned properly.  And most of the listeners probably are already aligned with the metals to some level, and probably most of you overweight.  But regardless, I'll be back with you next week.  Possibly it will be... I will be, yes, I will be here next week for an update or a weekly perspective.  Until then, make a great week. ",
