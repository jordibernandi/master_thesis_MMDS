Welcome back to another video.  Today I have a bit of a weird one for you.  Made a kind of a strange decision, I guess.  But really quick, just in case you're new, make sure to subscribe for daily videos.  Also make sure to subscribe to my second channel, which is my backup channel for exclusive precious metal content.  And if you want to support a small student-owned business, please consider getting yourself a DYDSS t-shirt or hoodie.  Got a bunch of gear available, a lot of which is being sold to raise funds for different charities.  But anyway, let's talk about silver for a second.  You can probably tell by the title and the thumbnail what's probably about to be said.  I've been thinking about this for weeks, maybe even over a month at this point.  I've been stacking silver for over a year.  I got started stacking at $17 an ounce, $17 change.  At this point, it's all the way down to $15 an ounce, in between $15 and $16.  I've been thinking about it for a while.  I got started stacking at $17 and I've been stacking and stacking and stacking for probably 14, maybe 15 months at this point.  And all spot price has done is go down.  And I know that people have made videos saying that people sell their silver when spot price goes down.  because they're afraid that it's going to continue to go down and they're going to lose money or whatever the case may be.  That's not exactly what I think.  However, with spot price not doing very much, I mean, I've given it quite a while, over a year, I'm not going to be going back to cash in any way, shape, or form.  However, I've been thinking for the last couple weeks, maybe longer, Maybe it's time to move on over to gold.  Maybe gold is the smarter move.  Maybe there's more gains to see over in the world of gold.  And I have been stacking silver for a really long time.  A little over a year.  That's a long time to be stacking.  And as much as I love silver, I mean, it's just such a beautiful metal.  I think it's time to make the shift.  i think it's time to convert my silver to gold and for the most part from here on out stack gold coins probably at a fractional level half ounce gold.  eagles and maples mostly maybe some half ounce bars possibly.  i think i am gonna for the most part stick to government minted gold As I've been saying about silver for over six months.  at this point, I started stacking rounds.  I don't want to go over to gold and stack generic gold rounds or maybe even bars.  I'm not even sure.  I think I'm going to stick to coins, at least for the most part.  Probably fractional.  And maybe every time I get, I don't know, let's just say five to ten half ounces, I'll go on over and convert two half ounces into a full ounce or something.  I haven't made up my mind yet in regards to that, but I think for the time being, I am going to keep these quarters, the junk silver.  I'm going to keep the junk silver.  But all of the silver, for the most part, that I have, that I've stacked on my own, I'm going to be keeping the presents.  People have sent me junk silver coins.  They've sent me bars.  They've sent me rounds.  They've sent me coins.  They've sent me all types of crazy cool silver presents.  Those I will 100% be keeping.  Forever.  Those are awesome.  Thank you very much, everybody who has sent me a little piece of silver over the last year and couple months.  Really do appreciate that.  But as for the silver that I've converted my own dollars into, I've been saying it for a while.  I've been saying it for months at this point.  Eventually, I'm going to be converting my silver into gold.  And I've been converting my dollars into silver, so I'm thinking maybe it's time to switch on over to gold.  so I am going to be heading on over to maybe a couple different coin shops today and tomorrow to see what's good see what they have see where I can get the best deal.  I'm not going to be converting silver back into cash.  screw that.  I'm not a big believer in that paper fiat government glorified IOU pieces of paper.  I'm still going to have that mindset.  But when it comes to silver and gold, I feel like gold is just more superior at this point.  I've been doing a lot of research, by the way, and I've been waiting a while.  I think it's time to... make the switch, or at least for a little while, just to see what happens.  I think I'm going to take, for the most part, my silver rounds, my coins, my bars, all the stuff that I've stacked on my own over the last year, couple months, over to a couple different coin shops.  I know the silver to gold ratio is like 80-something to one right now, but I think it'll help me save space.  Not to say that I'm running out of space.  I mean, I don't have that impressive of a silver stack.  And by the way, this is in no way, shape, or form all of the silver that I have.  This is just a couple of the things that I have in the room with me.  I have much more in my safe, but these are just the things that I had on hand.  I just put down a little bit of everything.  You know, a 10-ounce bar, a maple leaf, American Eagle, handful of silver quarters, and then another stack of maple leaves over there.  And I did just convert dollars into silver just a couple days ago.  I posted a video about it.  You've probably already seen it.  JM Bullion was having a sale on 2018 Eagles, so I went to capitalize on that while the spot price took a little bit of a dip.  So spot price was low, and they were on sale, so I took advantage of it.  However, whenever that comes in the mail, probably tomorrow or the next day, I'm not sure when it's going to be.  Whenever it arrives, I'm probably going to be including that as well in the stack of silver that I bring out over to a couple different coin shops.  Who knows, maybe I'll go to a couple different coin shops to convert some silver into gold.  I don't have all that much silver.  However, I'm thinking, you know, reduce the weight a little bit.  Not to say that it weighs all that much, because I've only been stacking for a little over a year, but if I could take what I have, convert it into gold, I think that's probably the smartest decision.  For me, anyway.  I'm not telling anybody what to do.  I always say that I'm never going to act like a financial advisor or a precious metal expert professional or specialist.  And I don't believe this is a mistake, but It could be.  And then I could always reverse.  I can always convert the gold back into silver.  That's the way I see it anyway.  And obviously, along with stacking silver 90% of the time over the last little more than a year, 1% of the time I've been focusing on gold as well.  So I have stacked some gold.  But I'm thinking, why would I convert all of my silver into gold when I already have a little teeny tiny bit of gold?  So I think it probably makes the most sense to take the gold that I already have and then just going over to a coin shop and convert that into silver.  So I'll be going over to a coin shop and I'll be converting my silver into gold and my gold into silver at the same time.  Might sound like a little weird thing to do, but hey, that's the decision I made.  Hopefully everybody enjoyed this video.  I don't think anybody should really care what I do with my money, so I don't imagine anybody getting upset over this.  You keep stacking your silver if you want.  You keep stacking that gold if you want.  Stack both if you want.  Stack neither if you want.  Do whatever you want to do.  It's your money, just like this is my money.  I don't think it's a bad idea.  I think the time is right, but that's just my opinion.  Anyway, if you guys enjoyed the video, please hit the like button.
