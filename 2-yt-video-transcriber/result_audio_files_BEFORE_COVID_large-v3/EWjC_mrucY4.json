Last year he won third place with the Crystal Peace, which was always linked to the threat of the nuclear war and therefore to the discussion between the United States and North Korea.  This year he carries this great monumental car dedicated to the figure of Trump, who has this kind of scientific armor.  Trump wants to go to Mars with this Space Marine army.  This figure of Trump's armor is taken from a character of a futuristic three-dimensional game called Warhammer 4000.  So a three-dimensional game, fantasy, that links video games, fantasy, and then also this sort of great conductor, that I see even a crown of gold, it reminds me a bit of... So he puts together the Roman tradition with this fantascientific character and this Trump that wants to conquer space and Mars.  and these space marines that are halfway between the ancient fantasy super soldiers and medieval knights, so they put together various different iconographies.  Here is probably one of the figurants with this great armor.  It is very suggestive, the car is built practically on the large central bonnet, there are no external fluctuations, it is an imposing main subject that now I am seeing moves precisely turning on itself and is very careful in the aspect of the coloring of the armor.  A lot of space is also given to the characters who then represent these Space Marines. ",
