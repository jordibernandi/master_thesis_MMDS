            "text": "so as the title says we're all going to spend this video laughing at the two idiots who are tommy robinson and sargon of akkad but i'm going to read to you what is happening.  so in europe we had the european election so you can just vote for a candidate for a certain region and i voted for the green party.  sadly they didn't win in my district but overall the greens and the lib dems who want to remain They did pretty well, whereas the parties that are kind of split on it did really badly.  So the Conservatives and Labour did pretty bad, Conservatives especially.  And UKIP essentially were wiped out because Nigel Farage left the party and formed the Brexit party, and the Brexit party did the best.  And if you want to look into it a bit more, it's probably because most people think it's silly to be voting in the European elections when we're meant to be leaving the EU in October.  And whereas a lot of people who want to leave are sort of galvanised by a Nigel Farage that they are all voting, you know, as sort of like a protest vote to show that they really want this Brexit stuff.  So there's not so much to read into it.  It's not like Brexit is overall way more popular than staying.  It's just, you know, in this sort of election, it's just... way it worked out because people aren't really galvanized to vote for.  you know if you remain and stuff.  so let's get into these two idiots.  so the first article from the even standard says ukip has lost all its meps in the european parliament despite topping the voting figures in 2014. the pro-league party support collapsed completely after the insurgent brexit party came top of the polls in England and Wales, picking up 28 MEPs.  UKIP leader Gerard Batten lost his seat in London, which he had held since 2004.  So that's all good news, so let's get into Sargon of Akkad.  The party's controversial candidate, YouTuber Carl Benjamin, who was second on the party's South West regional list, also failed to get elected.  And then Mr Benjamin was condemned during the campaign for comments he made about Labour MP Jess Phillips.  The 39-year-old, who stars himself as Sargon of Akkad, said he wouldn't even rate the Labour MP, and he refused to apologise for the remarks.  So, you know, that is really great.  You know, all this stuff he always talks about, you know, the arrogance to think he'd become an elected MEP is quite funny in the first place, since his whole stuff is about being like an anti SJW.  And people sometimes call me like the smart Sagan of a card, which I kind of don't mind, but I don't look like him just because I have a beard.  But he's a. he's, you know, a massive idiot.  he's part of that whole anti-sjw crowd in the uk with um who's that guy the racist dog count dacula and um who's the other one paul joseph watson and you know all their is really like disingenuous and they're basically trying to make money off.  you know you guys will know the internet outrage because who are the most successful political youtubers?  it's normally right-wingers who capitalize and make up all this.  so it's good to see him getting crushed in, I guess, the real world where people don't know who he is and know what a piece of shit he is.  So the second person is Tommy Robinson.  So if you guys don't know who Tommy Robinson is, because I'm sure most of you will, but if you don't, basically he was a football thug when he was younger and he became the head of the English Defence League, which is like a racist nationalist, I don't even know if it's a party, I don't know if it's ever won anything in elections, but yeah, it's like a political group.  And it's just basically for protecting Christianity and white people in England and shit.  But he left that, but now he ran as an independent MEP.  So the Guardian reporting, on a European election night when the Brexit party dominated across the UK, perhaps the most eye-catching story in North West England was the humiliating drubbing suffered by the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson.  Having claimed for weeks to be on the crest of an international movement, one that elected Donald Trump in the US, the man whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon had expected to walk into Brussels like Conor McGregor upon his election.  In the end, Robinson only won 2.2% of the vote, losing his 5,000 pound deposit, and sneaked out of the election count in central Manchester, barely an hour after he had arrived.  He tried to put a brave face in it, claiming the establishment had arranged and organised for him to be banned from social media to scupper his election bid, but it was a resounding defeat for the founder of the English Defence League.  So, yeah, that's another great thing that happened in the European election, and, you know, I hate this country a lot of the time, and I hate the British bulldog element, and it's nice to see two people who kind of represent that being you know absolutely destroyed.  and i don't know if you guys have seen that funny video of someone asking people in manchester what they think of tommy robinson.  and it's just funny to see like people who obviously aren't like massively interested in politics still hating on him which is a good thing.  and yeah i'm just happy about it because how embarrassing would it be like even though we're leaving the eu to have tommy robinson and sargon of akkad as two MEPs, their salaries paid by the taxpayer, and just legitimising their type of bullshit, which I hope just stays online, because especially in England, our political online stuff really stays separate from the mainstream, because I know in America you have Ben Shapiro is online and is a public figure, but these two, more so Sargon of Akkad, I don't think I could ask anyone I know, do you know who this guy is?  The only reason they might know him now is because of the rape comments.  But after that, I doubt anyone would know who this guy is.  And Tommy Robinson, yeah, a lot of people do know who he is because he got a bit of infamy.  But at the same time, it doesn't mean he's a popular person.  And the delusion on their part to think they could become elected.  And he got 2.2% of the vote, didn't even get his deposit back, which I think you have to put down to even run as an MEP.  And then if you get a certain amount of vote, I think you get it back.  But because he did so badly, he's gotten, you know, gotten it taken away from him.  So, yeah, overall, a nice silver lining from when the Brexit party really dominated these elections.  Hopefully, you know, if we leave the EU, it'll be good because we get rid of them.  But at the same time, if we stay, it'll be such a disaster because then we have our section of the European Parliament destroyed.  dominated by people who don't even want to be in the EU.  and don't people find it funny that people who hate the EU are happy to be elected as MEPs and get a EU European politician's salary which I find kind of strange?  it's literally funding your lifestyle but you don't want to be in it.  that's why Nigel Farage is such a hypocrite.  but anyway let's all laugh at them troll their fans online and just be happy that this country at least rejected these two fucking extremists.

I now have a Patreon, so that'll be in the description.  You can check that out.  I don't really expect anything from it, though.  And, yeah, let me know what you think in the comments.  I guess, you know, for a lot of you Americans, this might be the only part of the European elections you care about.  And it's just quite funny rather than... you know, it's kind of irrelevant to a lot of you and UK politics isn't so relevant to Americans anyway.  But if you made it this far, thank you for watching.
