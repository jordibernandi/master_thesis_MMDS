For Cherry Creek, this is the second student suicide in the past two months.  A sudden string of teen suicides in the tri-state area in the last month has parents, administrators, and teens struggling to find solutions.  Three suicides in the past month, the latest just yesterday.  At Sprague High School in Salem, students are greeted with words of encouragement.

And that kind of dedication, some say obsession, has catapulted South Koreans into the top tier of educational achievement.  Korean society is permeated by values reflecting the teachings of the ancient Chinese scholar.  But joy of learning is not the sole motivation.  On the other hand, education is a channel for your social mobility.  And if you want to become somebody in society, you want to go to a better college.  better school and study certain areas which will bring you higher status and probably higher income.  This hyper-competitive personal drive is what jet-propelled resource-poor South Korea into the top ranks of world economies.  Is it ever enough?  I just feel like it's just ongoing and never-ending, and I have to study more and more, and I have to learn new things.  But I never felt it's enough.  takes another toll.  When young students are lagging behind in their classes, they get blamed by their parents and they blame themselves.  And sometimes they blame themselves so hard that it's going to lead themselves to suicide.  A higher percentage of Koreans kill themselves than in any other country in the developed world.  Now, it's an unfortunate fact that South Korea is notorious for its high suicide rate, and this can be seen once again in a new report.  South Korea recorded the highest suicide rate in the whole of the OECD in 2016, more than twice the OECD.  Our focus today takes us to Japan, where people are literally working themselves to death.  Death from overwork, it's known as karoshi in Japanese, is a problem for one in five companies.  Now that's according to the first government white paper on the subject.  The paper released last month shows that about 200 people die from karoshi every year, mainly from heart attack strokes.  or suicide.  Well, now the families of the victims are fighting for proper recognition that Kiroshi is a serious threat to the health of the nation's workforce. ",

And what Professor Kasser discovered?  loads of really important things about this, but there's a few.  We're all a mixture of these things, but we move throughout our lives.  And what he discovered is the more you are driven by extrinsic values, the more your life is guided by how you look to the outside, by what you're trying to get out of life rather than enjoying it, the more you will become depressed and anxious by quite a large margin.  There's loads of studies that show this.  And also he found that we have become much more obsessed with, we're much more driven by these values over the last 30 years for all sorts of reasons, partly because from the minute we're born, we're immersed in a machine that tells us life is about consumption, right?  About externally consuming things.  More 18-month-old children know what the McDonald's M means than know their own last name.  So there's this machine constantly geared towards getting us to think extrinsically.  So this movement towards these kind of junk values, but what thinking extrinsically, what being dominated by these junk values does, is it jolts you out of the intrinsic value.  So imagine, go back to the piano example.  If you're playing the piano just because you love it, and then suddenly you think, Am I the best piano player in Los Angeles today, right?  How are these people in this room thinking about my piano playing?  How much am I going to be paid for this piano playing?  You can see how that would jolt you out of the flow state, right?
