            "text": "Who was that phone call to?  You mind repeating what you told them?  What are you talking about, stupid?  I never blocked no doorway.  What do you mean, you specifically, you moron?  Hey, I've never blocked no doorway.  You're a liar, man.  Are you talking about you go to church?  Fuck you.  All right, guys, A.V.  Watchman out here in the city of Commerce.  We're over here at City Hall, the same City Hall where Furry Potato was attacked and violated by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, including every single security guard or whatever.  they were here at the City Hall.  Can you please wear a mask?  Here you go, sir.  Deputy, is it true that you guys left a female in the back of a vehicle for over an hour in the heat, stripped down, almost naked?  I wasn't here, sir, so I'm not going to comment on whatever you're talking about.  You never heard of that story?  None of the guys talked about it?  No locker room stories?  All of a sudden, nobody knows nothing.  Did you guys offer the reporter water yesterday when she was in the back of a squad car for over an hour, stripped down naked?  I don't know, but I offered all your people water today.  Did you offer her water, though, yesterday?  Yesterday?  Yeah.  What happened yesterday?  You don't know what happened?  Yesterday.  You haven't seen the video?  Was it yesterday?  The day before that.  I don't know.  The day before that.  I'm sorry.  Yesterday.  What about you guys?  You guys go to church?  You learn morals or what?  You have morals, guidelines?  Do you know about what happened with the reporter that was violated?  So is City Hall generally open to the public?  Yes.  And visitors alone?  Yes.  When did you guys start doing the visitor passes?  Right.  On Friday, I noticed there was no visitor passes being required at the end of the hour.  Sorry about that, guys.  It happened on Friday, this incident.  Hey, guys, just do me a favor.  Just make sure that we at least are not impeding anybody's way, okay?  You guys can do whatever you guys need to do.  So as long as you guys are just off to the side, there's no problem with that.  This is what we call copsplaining, where you try to tell another grown man what to do while we're standing out of the way.  Don't eat yellow snow.  Don't sleep with your partner's wife.  Stuff like that, right?  That's the fire department with their protocol that we have.  If you were here on Friday, what would you have done different?  In regards to what?  In regards on what happened.  Well, what would you have done different?  I mean, you're a church-going guy, right?  In regards to?  What happened?  Putting her inside the back of a squad car for over an hour?  I have no idea.  Would you have allowed a female member to dress exposed for over an hour sitting in a car with the agent in her car?  In the hot side?  You know what this was?  What if somebody did that to your wife, sir?  Put her in the backseat of a car with her breasts exposed for over an hour?  Or you?  What about?  somebody did that to your mama?  How'd you guys feel then?  Ralph Levero, are you here today?  Ralph Levero!  Sergeant, these are reasonable questions I'm asking you.  What would you have done different, Sergeant?  I have no problem answering any of your questions, but if I don't know the answers to them, I'm not part of that investigation.  I wasn't here, so I can't comment on something that I wasn't aware of.  But you being a man, somebody that has morals and guidelines, how would you have felt if that was your wife or if that was your mother or if that was your daughter?  How would you have felt, sir?  Right.  Sir, how would you have felt?  How do you feel about what happened yesterday?  I wasn't here.  Like I told her, I don't know the circumstances, so I don't have a comment.  You know what one officer does reflects on all you guys.  Just like in every occupation, that's true.  All right, thank you. ",

            "text": "I get that, but do you believe that if, you know, you took an oath, right?  You remember your oath, right?  Okay.  So there's some cops that don't remember that.  And they want to, you know, take it to that next level.  And I myself, you know, this is just me and my opinion.  I believe that there's a line.  There's a division.  And that's just me.  That's just the way I feel between the public and you officers.  You get what I'm saying?  And it's not, I get it.  You guys have a rough job and stuff like that.  But I think when there's really nothing going on, there's no crimes being committed.  Somebody doesn't have to show their ID, you know, give up their rights just because there is an officer who's on a power trip.  You got something on your hood, too.  I don't know.  It's like trash or something.  Yeah, but that's all I'm trying to, you know, say is I don't, like, a lot of people, it's not just me that feels this way.  If there's a tyrant within the department, that tyrant needs to be exposed.  And a good cop will expose a bad cop.  Because if a good cop doesn't expose a bad cop, then that good cop supposedly is a bad cop as well.  You get what I'm saying?  Yeah.  No, no, I get what you guys are doing.  You know, you came, you know, you're not aggressive or anything.  Yeah, I know.  I'm cool.  Right.  No, I got you what.  just one more.  if Let's just say you're driving down the street and there's a guy in an unmarked vehicle.  He's in his own personal vehicle He runs a red light.  then you find out he's a cop.  What would you do with that situation?  Would you give him a break?  Or would you ticket that guy?  Compared to just somebody like myself, if I run a red light, what would you do then?  You know what, man?  Every situation, every circumstance is different.  I personally, I don't think I'd give him a ticket for a red light.  Well, we're just saying, like, hypothetically.  I would say no.  You wouldn't give him a ticket?  And you wouldn't give me a ticket?  No.  I personally haven't given a red light ticket.  Okay, so you would just give like a warning?  A warning.  All right, what was your name, sir?  Hernandez.  Hernandez?  Yeah.  Badge number?  609-650.  609-650, thank you.  You got it, man.  Appreciate you, man.  I hope you remember your oath, man.  Yes, sir.  All right, thank you, brother.  It's called keeping it off the radio.  Oh, so he's over here talking about... Everybody else is very professional and very... This is keeping it off the radio, guys.  So who was that phone call to?  You mind repeating what you told them?  What are you talking about, stupid?  I never block no doorway.  What do you mean, you specifically, you moron?  Hey, I've never blocked no doorway.  You're a liar, man.  You talk about you go to church?  Fuck you.  Hey, dude.  Hey, dude, you're a piece of shit, bro.  You're a bitch, as a matter of fact, you fucking punk.  I don't like people lying on me, bro.  Fucking lying on me, bro.  This bitch said I'm blocking the driveway.  The doorway.  And that was my last warning.  I haven't freaking blocked shit.  Hey, yo, you're a liar, man.  I got you on film line.  I didn't block the doorway once.  I don't like people lying on me, dude.  You wouldn't like that either, Hernandez.  You clearly don't know what service dog laws are.  Sergeant Hernandez, do you know who the Americans with Disabilities Act coordinator for your... ",
