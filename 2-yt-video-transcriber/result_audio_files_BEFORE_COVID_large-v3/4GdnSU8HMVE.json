And you have the best genes you can have, right?  Thank you.  So you travel a little bit with him, do you?  Yes.  That's great.  That's fantastic.  Let me see what that says.  Sydney, 100-year-old.  No regrets.  Because he regretted not meeting a Civil War veteran when he had a chance.  And he doesn't want anyone to regret not meeting a World War II veteran.  That's really nice.  No, I don't think anybody does.  That was a great victory.  That was a great victory.  We knew how to win wars.  That was a tremendous victory.  So tell me, you talked to me the way we spoke.  We had the greatest conversation.  Tell them what we said.  Yes.  I expressed to the president at the convention last year.  He asked me to come on the stage, which was awesome.  I was afraid that the Secret Service was going to grab me when I put my arm around you.  He just wrapped his arm around me.  And I had a picture with me and asked the president if he had signed it for me.  He said he sure would.  I said to him that I was going to be 95 today, President, on April 11, and I said, Well, I'd like to bring my family to the White House and meet in the Oval Office because somebody told me that I would never get in the Oval Office.  And I really appreciate it, Mr.  President, for you allowing us to come to be with you today.  And I just wish you the best of all of your endeavors.  Thank you very much.  I've got a young man back home.  I told you not to let me speak.  That's okay.  No, he speaks well.  He speaks very well.  I've got a young man back home that comes to my church Sunday school class almost every Sunday, and your name's mentioned by him.  And I've got to get a picture to take back for him.  We'll do that.  We'll do that.  I want to ask you one other question.  Go ahead.  When you're in Pittsburgh, I'd like to be on the stage with you.  Okay.  We can do that, which will be soon.  We'll do that.  100%.  That's why he's successful, because he's very aggressive.  He's an aggressive, great guy.  Thank you very much.  I really appreciate it.  Let me have it.  Thanks, Alan.  I'm going to sign this one, right?  Yes?  I'll sign this one for you.  Okay, I'm going to sell this one.  And Paul, how about you?  Tell me.  You feeling good?  I was in a combat outfit with Ruber.  We were second longest in combat.  We had 517 days of combat.  Wow.  And I started out in Africa, Italy, France, and Germany.  I was in the Alps Mountain area when the war ended on.  Our last position was at Fusen, southern Germany, in the Elms Mountain area.  We were pulled out and went into Schongau, a German army camp, where they trained air prayers identification people.  And we processed 14,000 prisoners there in two weeks.  It would be amazing, right?  So do you remember those days perfectly?  Yes, sir.  That's really something.  I was also in the Korean War, too.  You're a warrior, isn't he?  Twenty-six months in there.  One hundred and three.  Boy, you're going to be around a long time.  You look fantastic.  You look fantastic, and I really appreciate you being in the White House and the Oval Office.  Tell us something about the man.  Or his.  Tell us, go ahead.  He's not shy, you know.  No, he's not shy.  He's not shy at all.  I'm just like him.  This is my brother.  Congratulations. ",

We weren't going to do this with the media, but frankly, when I saw you, I said, we have to.  And thank you.  Great job.  Go ahead, please.  Mr.  President, I want you to meet my wife.  We've been married 69 years.  Whoa.  She probably can tell you more about me than I can tell myself.  Give us just the good stuff, not the bad stuff.  Well, is there much to say then?  It's all been good.  That's great.  Couldn't be any better.  That's really nice.  I can see that on your face.  I can see that.  Thank you.  Thank you all very much.  It's a great honor.  Thank you.  Thank you all very much. ",
