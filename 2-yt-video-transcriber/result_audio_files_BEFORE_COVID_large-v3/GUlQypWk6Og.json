            "text": "Hello, good morning.  I think the whole world has awakened this morning to the sad news that Paul Cain, a great prophet in America and the nations, has passed away.  And this morning, we just want to say thank God for an incredible life that has shaped our own history in the most amazing ways.  Paul Cain, we are so grateful for him.  We loved him and he shaped my whole life in many ways by the prophetic gift that was upon him.  We're in Florida doing a Florida tour before the sin going from city to city with a vision of stadium Christianity that Paul 30, 40 years ago declared that the stadiums of America and the world will be filled with preaching of Jesus and signs and wonders and miracles.  It's a very famous prophecy that has actually dominated my life for 25, 30 years.  Now we're going to descend on February 23rd.  We're believing for the mantle of Billy Graham to be passed on a generation.  I'm thinking it's time for the healing evangelist Paul Cain, that mantle to be passed on a generation.  I remember before the call took place in 2000, a word had been given to me about calling a fast at the beginning of the millennium, a 40-day fast for the harvest of the new millennium.  And Paul Cain was coming to our church.  I was sitting at the back, and I asked God, Lord, if this is you, you want me to call this fast, have Paul Cain?  call me out and use Ecclesiastes 11.1 as a confirmation.  Cast your bread upon the water, and after many days you will find it.  Amazingly, Paul called me out by my middle name and my birthday.  And he said, and I see that you are skinny for your fasting.  And the Lord says, Ecclesiastes 11, 1, cast your bread upon the water.  Because of that word, I called for a 40-day fast.  And I think even now, 20 years later, as Paul has just passed away, I believe that word is coming back.  And we are finding it for a whole generation, for a whole new Jesus movement.  That word has shaped the last 20 years of my life, and I'm so grateful for Paul Cain delivering that word.  Earlier this year, really in 2018, we were in Santa Maria Healing Rooms, a 40-day fast for California, and a friend of mine actually had a dream that I was tightening my belt 10 days, and I was saying, does anybody want to fast with me for 10 more days?  The first fast had ended on April 9th, 4-9, and the 10 days would end on 4-18. and we felt it was Luke 4.18 that we were to pray for the scroll of Jesus to be manifested.  Luke 4.18, the spirit of the Lord is upon me for the Lord has anointed me to preach the good news.  We were in Santa Maria where Paul Cain actually lived there and was part of that healing room.  So we held 10 days of prayer and fasting for those 10 days crying for that mantle, the scroll of Jesus to be manifested.  And then Paul Cain there shared the story of his mom, Anna Cain.  And Anna, at age 44, was pregnant with Paul.  And the doctors said she would not live and would not give birth to the child that was in her because she was ravaged with four diseases, her breasts completely eaten away.  But the Lord visited her and said, you'll have a boy and you'll name him Paul after St.  Paul, for he will see the miracles of St.  Paul.  She was healed by the Lord and actually nursed Paul and completely restored.  Oh, the power of God.  She lived to 104 years old, was dying, and she said to Paul, I'm going to give you the greatest word I've ever given you in my life.  And Paul said, what is it?  And she said, I don't know yet, because he hasn't given it to me yet, and went into a coma for two months.  They prayed that she'd be raised up, and she came out of that coma.  And Anna, his mom, Anna Cain said, the Lord has given me the word.  The word is this, I'm giving to you, Paul, and to the world.  Luke 4.18, the scroll of Jesus is going to be released upon you and the world.  She died on 4.18.  At 418, Mike Bickle was actually there.  We believe it is a sign now with the passing of Paul that we believe what she saw, what she prophesied will be manifested in a generation that Jesus, the evangelist, is going to loose his scroll over the whole earth.  It's interesting, even last night we preached and we said possibly Paul Cain could die tonight.  We knew he was on his deathbed.  And we believe that that mantle is coming on a whole generation.  Billy Graham, I will not let you go until I get a double portion of your spirit.  I believe that now with Paul Cain's passing, it's not just the evangelical evangelist, Billy Graham, but it's the healing revival.  Paul Cain, and both those mantles are coming down on a whole generation.  It's interesting.  He died last night.  We're not even sure if it was 212 or 213, but 2 Kings 212 and 213 are this.  And Elijah went up by whirlwind into heaven, and Elisha saw, and he cried, my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen, and he saw him no more.  That's verse 12.  And verse 13, and he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him, went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.  He took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water saying, where is the God of Elijah?  I don't think that's an accident.  I think the best thing we could ever do in remembering Paul Cain is to take up his mantle and dare to believe that a double portion of his spirit will be released to the whole earth.  Thank you, Paul Cain, for what you've given to us.  We love you.  We honor you.  Now you're rejoicing in heaven, and there's a generation that will not just celebrate your death.  They will bring forth new life into the earth.  See a grain of wheat fall on the ground and die.  It remains alone, but if it dies, it will bear much fruit. ",
