            "text": "I'm pregnant with a child.  that's not my husband's.  How do I move forward?  You serious?  I'm 32 weeks pregnant as of today.  My husband is ecstatic and is in full dad mode right now.  He has been insanely great and supportive of me during this time and will make a great father.  There's only one problem.  The kid's not his.  It's a co-worker of mine who I slept with.  My marriage with my husband is not great.  We got married eight years ago, and while it was good at first, it quickly died.  Both of us were in college and on the fast track to careers.  Because of this marriage, I've never been able to truly live.  While my friends were out having fun, I was at home with him.  Now, I'm going to stop right here.  See, this is some shit that always bothers me.  Because what really bothers me about this, right?  Did you ever notice that when young ladies are always like, I didn't get to live.  I didn't get to experience life.  You ever notice?  It's never, you know, I didn't get to go to fun, interesting places like Adventure Landing.  I never got to go to Wet n' Wild.  You ever notice that?  They ain't talking about, I don't get to go to the arcade.  No, no, no, no, no.  Whenever you see these posts and these people are like, I didn't get to have fun.  My friends are all having fun.  You haven't noticed by having fun.  They ain't talking about going to the library and checking out good books and going to the book club to talk about it.  They ain't never talking about going to the park and feeding animals.  and feeding their pigeons.  you haven't noticed that they're always talking about getting some dick.  my friends got to go out and have fun.  just means they got to go out to nightclubs get some drinks bought for them and get some dick.  that's all it means.  it's hilarious to me that that her view of fun that she could not have fun with her husband literally just talking again going to adventure.  you could have fun going to adventure landing.  nope that's not what she meant.  She can watch fun, interesting shows with her husband, talk about that.  Play Monopoly with a nigga.  Play Monopoly with her friends, too.  Nah, but that's not what she means.  She means she is not out there getting some dick by some random guy.  And I just don't get it.  Why is that her only perception of fun?  Why can we not have fun playing video games?  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  At first, I was fine with it.  But over time, I realized I was not.  I wanted to live like my friends and have freedom.  I wanted to live like my friends and get a whole bunch of dick.  Because you can read fun books while you have a husband.  You can go to wet and wild when you have a husband.  But you can't get a whole bunch of dick when you got a husband.  I just I can't stand that, man.  All the all the all the things in the world she could do with her partner and have fun with.  But now it's not good enough.  It's not good enough.  Let's continue.  This isn't to say I don't love my husband.  It's just that I think he's held me back from experiencing some great things about being an adult.  Fine.  I bet he did.  The only thing he could have prevented you from experiencing is the cock carousel.  Come on, that's it.  That's it.  Let's be real.  Let's be real.  Let's continue.  This is where my co-worker Jeff comes in.  Of course this faggot's name is Jeff.  Of course he's Jeff.  I'm surprised it's not Carl.  Or James.  Whatever normal.  Or John.  It had to be Jeff.  I met him two years ago when I came to the department and he's one of the greatest guys I know.  Is that right?  We hit it off pretty much immediately and have been friends.  You guys are about to get a world.  You've been friends.  Okay.  Okay.  Watch this.  Watch what's about to happen.  Sometimes I think he's my soulmate.  Oh, really?  Is that right?  Guys, just put a pin right there.  Put a pin right there.  Well, one night he invited me to go out to dinner.  I lied to my husband about it.  And one thing led to another and we slept together.  Or one thing led to another.  You ever notice how these ladies always slip and fall into some dick?  You haven't noticed?  You haven't noticed?  I didn't know.  I just thought we were going to go eat some food.  I didn't know.  I never would have imagined that he was actually whining and dining me so he could have sex.  One thing just led to another.  I could have never suspected that this was going to happen.  I just thought we were hanging out.  That's why I lied to my husband.  Come on, man.  See what I mean?  Come on.  Come on, man.  A few weeks later, I was pregnant.  I freaked out at the time and decided to tell my husband it was his.  And now, my friends, you see why this video is titled the way it is.  I mean, if you couldn't guess already.  We had held off having kids for a while, but he had always wanted one, so I treated it as if it was a surprise for him when I was ready.  Look at the treachery here.  Notice that there are layers.  There are layers to this BS.  As much as I'm laughing about it, notice how just disgusting this is.  This woman got impregnated by another man knowing her husband wanted children and then lied to him.  Lord have mercy.  Let's wrap this up.  Now we are here.  I know 100% that the kid is not my husband's.  I used protection with him while I did not with Jeff.  Pause.  Now maybe there's something wrong with me.  Maybe I'm messed up.  Maybe there's something off about myself.  And if there is, viewer, please tell me, but... Nigga, I thought the whole point of getting married was so you didn't need to use protection.  You know what I mean?  The whole point of sexual exclusivity is that protection of trust that you have with that person.  That's what I thought.  Now, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe there's something wrong with me that I thought that I would need a condom with my wife considering the fact that since she's only been with me, nigga... There ain't no chance of any STDs, nor is there a chance of any guy impregnating my wife.  Oh, but see, unfortunately, that requires that the woman actually has integrity and honor and at least some degree of compassion.  Now watch this.  Despite all of this, I still love my husband.  Oh, really, nigga?  That's why you lied to him.  You not only lied so you can go with Jeff, you lied that the baby was his.  But you love him, though.  But you really love him.  You know, you really respect the guy, don't you?  I bet.  Okay.  Yeah, I see.  We lie to people we love and respect.  Okay.  Okay, this is 2019.  All right.  And if he did leave me, Jeff would not take me.  Oh, guys.  Did you remember that pin?  Hopefully you remembered that pen.  Watch this.  I made the mistake of telling Jeff and he has ghosted me since.  Even successfully requesting a transfer from our department.  I think Jeff's my soulmate, guys.  My soulmate is a guy that can't take responsibility and leaves me high and dry.  My soulmate is a guy.  There's no way after two years of knowing this woman that he didn't know she was married.  No way.  No way.  I met a coworker of mine, I think, like week two.  I substituted for her class, and then I talked to her the next day.  Found out she was married.  Ain't no way in hell.  this nigga didn't know she was married.  So your soulmate is a man that will sleep with a married woman and then abandon his child and ghost the mother.  That's your soulmate, though.  That's your soulmate, though.  Lord have mercy.  See, this kid is so many people.  I'm about to go in right now.  So many people love to get on incels, get on nice guys, get on MGTOW, the red pillars, alpha fucks, beta bucks.  They love to say that that's some bullshit.  They love to get on your ass.  You're bitter.  Who hurt you?  Whenever you tell the truth that women do shit, who hurt you?  Who hurt you?  I can't believe you're like this.  You're saying this about women.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Let's just hope this is... This is not fiction.  If this really happened... All of the bullshit given to incels when they speak the truth.  The bullshit given to MGTOW when they speak the truth.  The bullshit given to MRAs when they speak the truth about this cuck-holding BS.  So much shit is given to any man that speaks the truth about the fact that women will cuck their husbands like this.  Look at this shit.  Look at the man she picked. ",
