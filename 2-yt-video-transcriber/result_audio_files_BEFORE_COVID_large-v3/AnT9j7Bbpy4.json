            "text": "which I messaged that guy.  It's just not worth my time to do a private chat off camera with an apologist.  I'd much rather have it on camera.  So I think I'm gonna just politely decline his invitation.  Thank you, period.  But I'd rather record my dialogues to share publicly, period.  Feel free to stop by if you change your mind, period.  Send.  Okay.  Oh man, have we been busy with some fun stuff.  Let me tell you about it.  Let me tell you about it.  Where do I start?  Let me start with the project that Rebecca Fox and I have been working on for almost a year now.  She did a survey with non-believers.  We had 850 responses, people that have let go of their faith beliefs.  And she had this extended survey.  It took about 30 minutes for people to complete.  And we've been working on a video and a podcast and even a website where you can claw through the data if you want to.  And the video is going to be really great.  In fact, we have some surprise narrators in the video.  So you have to be sure you check it out.  Oh, I also confirmed that one individual in particular that I want to have a third conversation with is still going here.  I just haven't run into her yet.  So I was excited about that.  The nonprofit is going really well.  We've had two organizations donate to us already.  We're in the process of developing a process for submitting a funding request to fund your SE exploits, regardless of where you are and in what country you live.  Hello.  How are you?  Pretty good.  How are you?  I think I'm good.  You're out fishing?  I guess so.  Did we chat before?  No, but I watch your channel and subscribe.  Oh, cool.  Cool, cool.  I appreciate that.  What do you think of the videos?  They're really good, and I really like them.  I'm going to stand just a little closer so I can hear you. ",

At the end, he said, you know, that was way better than when I talked to someone who's more aggressive, I think is the word he used.  Yeah, so he volunteered that he thought the conversation was more productive.  And I agree.  Wonderful.  Because I didn't tell him, oh, you're wrong.  I just said, well, how do you know that?  Are you sure?  Couldn't it be something else?  We were talking, for example, about I think it was the steel tariffs we were talking about. ",

Maybe there's a reason they have it.  It's not vindictive.  They're trying to support their economy, which is why... And I assumed, I didn't challenge him on the fact of it.  I said, well, couldn't there be a reason they're doing that?  Yeah, and so he thought, oh, I never thought of that. ",
