            "text": "So I'm sure a lot of you guys are here for the title of the video, Jehovah's Witnesses Make a Big Announcement.  So let me just get that out of the way now and tell you they have not declared the end of the world yet.  Not yet.  So Jehovah's Witness ideology is kind of a complicated thing.  What's going to happen, like, and in what order, that type of thing.  So I found this post on the XJW subreddit, and I just wanted to give it a read real quick.  Because up to this point, Jehovah's Witnesses believed that people would be judged on their heart condition, not whether or not they are baptized, basically.  My mom even told me that when I was little, that you'd be judged on your heart condition, your disposition toward the religion and things like that, not based on whether or not your participation in the organization.  So I took a look at this Reddit post.  Let's just pull up the Reddit post and give it a read here.  It says, To all naysayers and apologists who say that Jehovah will look at hearts at Armageddon and save billions, my own mother believes this.  This is the October 2019 study watchtower, page 11, paragraph 14.  As you can see, it makes it crystal clear that only baptized witnesses will survive Armageddon.  So I pulled that up and I wanted to give it a read.  I wanted to read the actual watchtower.  Let me give you a little bit of background on this watchtower.  This is not the standard stuff they hand out to anybody on the street.  This is the study edition of the watchtower.  The Watchtower is the Jehovah's Witness publication.  I'm sure most of you guys know that, but they split it up into versions that they give to the public and versions that are only available to members.  Now, anybody can access the study edition of The Watchtower, not just members.  It is accessible from their website, and that's how I accessed it.  But it's not handed out or advertised to anybody.  It's really kind of a private thing.  And they put all kinds of predictions and ideas and whatever else in this that they give to the members and not to the public.  It's designed to speak to the member base and not to the public.  And that's really concerning.  When you see a cult basically create an inner railway for information that only the cult members can access or is only intended for the cult members, that's concerning.  That's a sign that they're going down the wrong road.  It's a sign that they're trying to separate communication from the rest of the world and from Jehovah's Witnesses.  That's what they're trying to do here.  So this is in the study edition, which is the private cult member version of the Watchtower.  So let's read these two paragraphs.  Keep trying to make disciples is a subheading here.  Let's see what they had to say.  Read Matthew 28, 19, and 20.  As we conduct Bible studies, we have to try our best to make disciples, teaching them to observe all the things Jesus has commanded.  We need to help people understand how important it is for them to take their stand for Jehovah and his kingdom.  This means trying to motivate people to make the truth their own by applying what they learn, dedicating their life to Jehovah, and getting baptized.  Only then will they survive Jehovah's Day.  That's extremely relevant.  Just that last line there, if you aren't baptized, you won't survive Armageddon.  That's extremely important, and it has a lot of implications to it.  The children of parents who are baptized, but the children themselves are not.  The implication here is that those children are not going to make it through Armageddon.  They're going to be killed.  if you are not a baptized member of the religion.  Now, I know Catholicism baptizes children when they're babies, right?  Jehovah's Witnesses do not.  With Jehovah's Witnesses, it's a much more serious thing.  You're pretty much dedicating yourself to this organization for the rest of your life.  You're making a pledge to this organization.  You're signing a contract with this organization that you will remain a part of it for the rest of your life.  And if you don't, If at some point in your life you realize, hey, this is kind of messed up.  They're doing something messed up here or I don't know that I really believe this or anything.  They will pull the rug out from under you the moment they have suspicions about you.  They will cut you off from your friends and family and everything that you own or love or care about instantly.  It's just over right there.  Now that is extremely concerning to me because the fact that they're saying you have to be baptized to make it through Armageddon means that they're pushing for children to get baptized earlier and earlier and earlier.  I got baptized when I was like 14, but I know some people who were baptized when they were like 9.  That is so young to make a lifelong commitment to an organization that has such deep ramifications for breaking that promise.  The following paragraph says, as mentioned earlier, there's very little time between now and the end of this system of things.  For this reason, we cannot afford to keep studying the Bible with people who have no clear intention of becoming Christ's disciples.  Our work is urgent.  There are many people who have yet to hear the kingdom message before it's too late.  So if you're studying the Bible with somebody who doesn't seem like they're progressing quickly enough for you, then cut ties.  Just end it.  Just move on to another person who you think you can bring in.  They are making a big push right now and it's scary because they said in the end times what's going to happen is they're going to stop accepting people into the religion anymore.  At a certain point in time, they say their message is going to switch from good news to judgment.  which basically means they're going to continue knocking on doors until the end of time.  They're not going to stop doing that.  They're going to continue preaching God's word the entire time.  But instead of doing what they're doing now, which is telling people, hey, join our religion, ",
