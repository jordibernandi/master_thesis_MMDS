Owned a daycare center, a concrete supply business, trailer sales, GOP activist, U.S.  attorney who unsuccessfully prosecuted Iowa's first openly gay state legislator on trumped-up Hobbs Act charges that were dismissed by the jury in about an hour, Senate candidate.  There have been some scandals, too.  Here's one.  Trump's acting attorney general involved in a firm that scammed veterans out of life savings.  Veterans says, I spent the money on a dream.  I lost everything.  But the newspapers say you struck gold when you arrived in Washington, which the president calls the swamp.  Here's one that tells the story.  Conservative nonprofit with obscure roots and undisclosed funders paid Matthew Whitaker $1.2 million.  According to the Washington Post, in the three years after he arrived in Washington, Whitaker received more than $1.2 million as the leader of a charity that reported having no other employees.  That's a pretty good deal.  Now, what was the name of the charity that you ran, Mr.  Whitaker? ",

Casino billionaire and magnate Sheldon Adelson hates online gambling for obvious reasons.  It's competition for him.  He wants people in the casinos, not online.  And he spent more than a million dollars lobbying Congress to override a 2000 opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel, DOJ, saying that the WIRE Act plainly prohibits only sports gambling online, not gambling in the states, which is why Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, lots of states have built important businesses for themselves online.  But Congress wouldn't change the law according to the demands of Mr.  Adelson.  So rather than change the law, he decided to try to get the Department of Justice to change the interpretation of the law.  And he threw millions into a campaign to remake the DOJ and get the Office of Legal Counsel to perform a complete reversal and say that the Wire Act bans the kinds of lotteries that states run online, even though its language plainly prohibits only sports betting.  And when Donald Trump won, and Mr.  Sessions became AG, and you became chief of staff, DOJ leadership ordered a reevaluation of this legal question.  And what do you know?  The Office of Legal Counsel found some subtle and invisible points of law that apparently escaped the Department of Justice back in 2011, and it reversed the plain reading of the interpretation.  which talks specifically about sports betting.
