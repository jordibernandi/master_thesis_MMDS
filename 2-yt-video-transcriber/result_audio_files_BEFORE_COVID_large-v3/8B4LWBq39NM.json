That was very loud and probably heard up in my... No, I'm not going to do another take.  Okay.  So to do this, we start with any blue screen footage.  This is me just adjusting my shirt and wiping sweat off my brow.  You know, because I do that.  Now, by the way, I should credit Creation Effects, Creative Tools for After Effects, for... inspiring this tutorial.  You can download a full effect on their site here.  You can see what they did with it.  It gives you this nice little swirly thing.  We're going to do the second effect here.  Can you hear the train in this sound mix?  Now what we're going to want to do is go to Layer, New, Adjustment Layer, and we'll do all the effects here. ",

And yes, I am going to try and say his name with the correct Dutch pronunciation, rest in peace my comment section.  It's certainly not the first attempt to make a biopic.  Kirk Douglas starred as the painter in 1956's Vincente Minelli-directed film Lust for Life, Robert Altman made one starring Tim Roth in 1990, and so did Julien Schnabel last year with Willem Dafoe.  And interestingly, Akira Kurosawa imagined his dream self talking with the painter in 1990's Dreams, Van Gogh played by, of all people, Martin Scorsese.  And all of these films have their own solutions to telling Vincent's story, and to showing his work.  Loving Vincent did both, in a painstaking process where live actors were used to rotoscope an entire film using oil paint and canvas, the medium that Van Gogh worked in, in Van Gogh's style, using his signature impasto style to bring his most famous works to cinematic life.  And now let's take a moment to consider poor Tony Joe's inbox flooded with messages of, Hey, have you heard about this movie?  Every frame is literally a painting.  Ha ha ha ha. ",

For centuries, this made it an ideal medium for realism, before photography made it obsolete.  It was this move away from realism which made Van Gogh's work possible.  The Impressionists before him departed from realism to experiment with the nature of paint itself, that thing which can't be done in charcoal or print or photography.  Only in paint.  Photography, even high-resolution photography, can never fully capture these properties.  You inevitably lose something in the transfer from physical object to captured light.  And you lose even more in the transfer from film negative to final.  Even this form on YouTube, there's bound to be some detail lost in the H.264 compression of the original Blu-ray file.  And that's not even mentioning the picture frame.  I put around this footage to avoid getting content ID'd.  Yes, it's fair use, but an algorithm doesn't know that. ",

Or at least it would if it wasn't behind glass and a crowd of admirers that you have to fight through to get a good view.

He called it the painting's aura.  In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, he wrote, \"...by making many reproductions, it substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique  existence.\".  And in permitting the reproduction to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, it reactivates the object reproduced.  These two processes lead to a tremendous shattering of tradition, which is the obverse of contemporary crisis and renewal of mankind.  Both processes are intimately connected with the contemporary mass movements.  Their most powerful agent is the film. ",

Though I suppose all films are the collected effort of thousands.  The film itself is structured around trying to discover the essence of the artist's hand, their intent, and trying to replicate it.
