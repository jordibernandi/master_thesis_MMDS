That's Portland, Oregon, not Portland, Maine.  Apparently, the city government is trying to pass something.  I'm not sure about the specifics, but I've heard a lot of talk about them trying to ban Patriot Prayer and or the Proud Boys from Portland, Oregon, based on the usual lies that they're far-right, white supremacist,  etc.,  And it's madness.  The Proud Boys, PDX Crew, Patriot Prayer, they are diverse in terms of skin color, sexual orientation, and even political views.  They are not far-right, they are not racist, etc.  These are all lies.  A man named Jeremy Christian showed up to a rally, or maybe more than one, and was forcefully rejected and all but physically removed by the Patriots there, as I've shown you in a former video and as you can see for yourself.

I believe they have a great future in front of them.  And anyone who would make my daughter feel like less of a person because of the color of her skin or make my son feel like less of a person because of the color of his skin, I think is a horrible thing.  And I'm here to denounce all forms of white supremacy.  and hate.  with that being said i'd like to read from corinthians love is patient and kind.  love does not envy or boast.  it is not arrogant or rude.  it does not insist on its own way.  it is not irritable or resentful.  it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth the truth.  love bears all things believes all things hopes all things and endures all things.  i think that it's great to denounce white supremacy and i think that looking at this resolution there's a lot of the word hate is in it a lot.  it's about what you guys are against which you denounce.  but i think that you have to have a solution and i do believe the solution is love.  without a doubt you cannot fill in a dark room with more darkness or more hatred.  we have to bring light into it and i do believe the answer is love.  and if you guys are serious about attacking hatred and fixing that problem that you have in the city Portland there's one fact that we all have to admit okay hatred doesn't care about the color of your skin.  it doesn't care about your gender your sexuality it doesn't care for Republican or Democrat.  it doesn't matter if you're liberal or conservative.  it wants to infect every single person in this world who allows it to happen.  And unless we can admit that no one is immune to hatred, it doesn't matter if you're conservative.  There is a problem of hatred with conservatives.  There was a problem with hatred and Patriot prayer.  There's been a problem with hatred with liberals and Democrats.  Communist, Antifa, it is a problem, and I see it, and I'm just as guilty as anybody else.  And I think that that's something that we have to talk about, and we have to admit the fact that hatred is not just about racism.  It is a form of hatred, is what racism is.  And so I've seen hatred get out of control, and I know that I've made a lot of mistakes in the city of Portland.  I stand by my decisions, but I do believe that we have to admit the fact that hatred is going to affect every single person who allows it.  And I appreciate you guys bringing this to the forefront and bringing this out for people to have this conversation. ",
