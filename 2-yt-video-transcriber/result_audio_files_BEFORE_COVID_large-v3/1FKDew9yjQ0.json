            "text": "About this time every year, we're coming up onto September, our attention is of course going to turn to the anniversary of 9-11.  It's a moment when we reflect on those who gave their lives that day, firefighters and victims, everybody, and those who would pay the ultimate sacrifice in the years to come defending our liberties in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.  So now here we are, 18 years later, and we find ourselves seemingly in a state of permanent war.  We're warned that the Islamic State is poised to make a comeback, and we watch as the crescent of Iranian influence extends its long shadow.  And in Afghanistan, our leaders are negotiating the terms of peace.  ironically with the taliban not usually known for peace.  so i want to tell you guys about a recent film that ties all of this together.  it's called mosul and it's the story of the last battle of the iraq war documenting the 2016-2017 fight against isis in iraq's second largest city.  that is mosul.  it's directed by former cia officer daniel gabriel and mosul it's it's much more than a war story.  it takes you on the journey up the Tigris River into the heart of darkness, which is the ISIS caliphate, revealing an apocalyptic battle against two unyielding enemies, the Islamic extremism and the sectarian mistrust and hatred that will remain long after the politicians declare victory.  So if you haven't seen the movie yet, you can check it out.  It's on iTunes, Amazon, and Vimeo.  You can visit at visit the site www.mosul-film.com.  Again, that's www.mosul-film.com to find out more.  Next up, we have Dave Chappelle.  So he has a new Netflix special out.  It's called Sticks and Stones, and it has a lot of people talking.  Basically, everybody loves it.  Anyone on social media, it's like 95%.  positive uh it's getting rave rave reviews and personally to be honest i always found dave chapelle a little too r-rated for my liking.  uh if you don't like mature humor if you don't like a lot of swearing don't recommend you check it out.  it is definitely not child friendly but uh it was.  it was really funny.  this is the most i've laughed in a really long time and like i said everyone is loving it Except for, incidentally, leftist journalists who are not that impressed.  So, I mean, it's essentially the most politically incorrect piece of comedy I've seen since.  maybe Ricky Gervais's Humanity is the one that he did.  And that's another good one.  if you haven't seen it.  and you're okay with vulgar humor, I recommend you check it out.  So we have a promo clip of what we're talking about to give you guys an idea of what the material is like.  And this is one that actually Netflix has been promoting on their social media. ",

            "text": "So that was the first promo or first part of the special I saw before I actually watched the whole thing.  And honestly, I didn't know that this was coming out.  That promo was really my first glance into this.  And yeah, he got me good at the beginning.  But I laughed at the end.  That's one of the clips from the show that's gone viral.  And, you know, in the special, Chappelle really takes on things like cancel culture, LGBT activism, Me Too, Jussie Smollett, just pretty much everything people from Vice and Vox have been talking about for the past few years.  That's what he craps on.  So if you're into politically incorrect stuff, seriously, you're going to love it.  I haven't heard anybody who knows how to take a joke, say that they didn't laugh at least a little bit.  And he actually in one point says something along the lines of, I can't live in the world you're trying to create.  And to me, that's just, that's so true.  And I think that's why so many people are responding so positively to this is just, For the past few years, I feel like a lot of people have been walking on eggshells, right?  Unable to fully breathe almost because we're so afraid of saying the wrong thing, offending someone, and then having this authoritarian mob jump down our throats and try to cancel us.  So to have a huge comedian like that just say the most outrageous, like, I don't... I don't get offended easily.  I hope you guys know that by now.  But there were times in the show where I had like my hands clamped over my mouth.  I couldn't believe it.  He talks about Michael Jackson and how he's clearly not a pedophile because Macaulay Culkin says he didn't molest him.  But if he were a pedophile, obviously Macaulay Culkin would have been who he molested.  Right.  And it's just like, OK, it's stuff like that.  You have to be brave to say it.  And yeah, he's nothing if not brave.  And something that I really like, and we saw that in the first promo, is that he does this sort of bait and switch.  He kind of sets you up maybe believing that he's about to do the same politically correct woke comedian spiel that we now see from people like Amy Schumer or Sarah Silverman 2.0, but then he just, like, decimates that.  We have another clip.  This one's about abortion, by the way, and at first, I saw this in the special, I didn't know where he was going with it, and again, he didn't fail to deliver.  This is even better than the first one, in my opinion. ",

            "text": "It's my money, my choice.  It's a bold move to joke about abortion in this political climate, but it is especially a bold move to joke about abortion when the punchline of your joke is that abortion maybe isn't that great, right?  Because I agree with him, right?  It only makes sense that if women are able to just like full on abort their kid, that guy should be able to kind of bail out of financial support.  And like he says, but if that doesn't make sense, then maybe none of it makes sense.  And I think he's absolutely right on that.  But the thing with his comedy is that, right, there are things that he jokes about where you know that's not actually what he believes.  He doesn't think Macaulay Culkin for a pedophile is just too hot to not molest.  Clearly a joke.  But, you know, then you have things about the stuff like abortion and cancel culture where I think he is making a deeper message or commentary on society.  And I think where people get upset is when they're unable to tell the difference between the two, right?  Where... They're not able to read between the lines of the deeper context of what he's trying to say.  And apparently people in Slate, from Slate, are exactly those type of people.  They were not fans of his comedy special.  They have this article that they released.  Dave Chappelle's Sticks and Stones fights for the rights of the already powerful.  In his special, he talks about cancel culture and how it's affected people like Kevin Hart and Louis C.K.  It's good points, right?  The idea that we can't make jokes anymore, the idea that Louis  C.K.'s  behavior, although kind of gross, he's one of those ones where it's like, all right, but did he hurt anybody?  Is the response that it got from the public really proportionate to what actually happened?  Those are valid points to make for anyone to make, but according to Slate, that's just simply him defending celebrities and... We're gonna read some of this now.  The author says, watching Dave Chappelle's latter-day comedy special is like dropping in on a rascally uncle who doesn't know or doesn't care how much he's disappointing you.  He was more clever than anyone you'd met up until that point, and there was something impressive about the lengths he'd go to make you laugh.  Then he went away for a long time, and while you change with the times, he fashioned himself a badge of honor for definitely not doing so.  Now, his jokes make you wince.  Each visit reminds you that your face is technically capable of laughing and cringing at the same time, but it certainly doesn't feel good to do so.  Despite it all, Uncle Dave insists it's not that his viewpoints have gotten stale, everyone else just got so much more sensitive.  Chappelle rails against the perceived softness of many different groups, Louis CK's victims, Kevin Hart's detractors in the gay community, and Michael Jackson's survivors whom he says he doesn't believe anyway.  Chappelle also directs his exasperation at his own audience, or at least the kind of viewers who aren't interested in supporting artists and celebrities responsible for horrendous things.  If you do anything wrong in your life, he ventriloquizes, he rent, wow, ventrilo... Quizes?  Okay, I don't know how to say that word.  And I find out about it, he continues, I'm going to try to take everything away from you.  But as is so often the case with those who accuse others of having thin skin, it's mostly projection.  I don't think we can always take Chappelle at his word.  His evident obsession with the details of the Jackson case in particular gives the impression that he accepts more of the allegations than he professes to.  He'd rather just reach for the nearest narrative or the most... punchline than grapple with messy truths.  But he obviously also takes pride in serving as an oracle, or at least for the kinds of audience members who whistle and applaud when he calls Jackson's accusers liars or evokes the right's gay agenda by declaring homophobia is the single biggest taboo in show business.  If his jokes were so funny on their own, would Chappelle have to spend so much time justifying his right to tell them?  So... Clearly this person doesn't understand humor, right?  This is one of the people who Chappelle is railing against and it's so obvious because, right, he accuses Chappelle of just not having changed with the times when everyone else has and that's why he has to spend so much time justifying his own jokes when the rest of us... agree with him.  His jokes are still funny, and his justifications themselves of why he should be able to tell these jokes are hilarious.  But, I mean, one of the things I will say is that he does talk about Michael Jackson, that the whole case, the allegations, the Finding Neverland fiasco.  I actually... I don't think Michael Jackson was on the up and up.  You know, I think even just the stuff that people admit to him spending time with kids and that in of itself is inappropriate.  But here's the thing, even as someone who doesn't agree with him about Michael Jackson, it's still funny.  The jokes are still hilarious.  I don't need to agree with his political take in this instance to laugh about it, but clearly That's not a viewpoint that the Slate people share.  And by the way, guys, I do just wanna take this opportunity to tell you that if you're enjoying the show so far and you're watching live, you can, of course, give us a super chat.  We're gonna be around after the show is over.  On the same stream, to answer any Q&A's, read all of your comments, questions, and concerns.  But if not, if you want to go the extra length, you can of course always head on over to blazetv.com slash Lauren and subscribe using the code Lauren to save money on your annual subscription.  Not only do you save, I think it's 10%, but you also get a ton of other... $10.  $10, sorry.  You also get a ton of other great shows to watch.  Yeah, so Slate, not impressed with Dave Chappelle.  Apparently, though, neither were the people at National Review.  They also took issue with it.  And I think Vox or Vice had some unkind things to say to him as well.  But look, ultimately... you don't need to think Dave Chappelle is super funny.  You don't need to think that he's right about abortion or whatever.  I think the main takeaway that he would want you to agree with is that he shouldn't be canceled just for saying inappropriate things.  You know, so far people from Slate and I think it's like Vice or Vox, They're, I think, not trying to cancel him.  They're so far just saying that he's not funny, but, you know, we'll see how much this outrage builds to, because oftentimes it can get pretty bad over a period of a few days or even weeks before it really comes to a head.  I'm hoping that we've heard the end of this, though. ",
