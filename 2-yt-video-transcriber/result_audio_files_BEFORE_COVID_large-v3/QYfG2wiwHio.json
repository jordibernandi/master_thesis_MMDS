They kept promoting that they were going to, like, if you did so well, you're going to get picked up and you get paid.  And some people did.  But then they got this person who was going to help them broker movie deals.  And then all of a sudden, all the people that were losing comic deals because they were the same old people you expect, you know, with certain agendas, suddenly started getting paid series on Webtoons.  And then they would promote these people.  But all at the end of the day, they were... promoting mostly the Korean artists.  Um, but they're really trying to use the American market to promote the Korean artists, but what they were trying to do.  So, uh, we were on Webtoons.  We did pretty well, but honestly it wasn't worth the effort.  The other reason I would recommend Webtoons, uh, was if you didn't know how to do a website of your own and you didn't want the hassle, there is a lot, there are, well, there still are a lot of eyeballs over there.  So you might be able to get an audience quicker that way, but you have to be discovered and they bury you under all the promoted artists who almost often are Korean.  because it's a korean-owned company.
