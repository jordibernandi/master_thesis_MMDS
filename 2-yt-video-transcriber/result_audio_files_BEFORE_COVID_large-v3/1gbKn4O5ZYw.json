            "text": "You want double clap or just one?  I get rhythmic up here.  Bernie Sanders is the Democratic candidate who can actually beat a gangster in the White House named Donald Trump.  You have to have enthusiasm, energy to counter the escalating neo-fascist energy and enthusiasm of a Donald Trump.  All the xenophobia, with all the talk about working people, but very much tied to big military, very much tied to big money.  That's Donald Trump.  Bernie Sanders has backbone.  That's what it is to have integrity.  That's what it is to have courage and conviction and commitment and that consistency over time and space.  Oh, there he is!  That's what I'm talking, he's the one I'm talking about!  Bernie Sanders in the house!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  He's tied to a moral and political solidarity with poor and working people.  That cuts so much deeper.  What I love about this brother is not that he's a god, not that he's a deity, he's a human being trying to be morally consistent and bear witness in such a way that he can bring us together and change this nation.  He's an unprecedented candidate in American history.  It reminds me in some ways of what Martin Luther King Jr.  had to deal with in the 60s.  When you have a certain commitment to fighting against racism, militarism, materialism, and poverty, fighting against wealth inequality, trying to ensure the ecological catastrophe is held at bay by the kind of new green policies and so forth, that you get targeted.  So you get the kind of immediate blackouts or whiteouts, whatever you want to call them.  They're fearful.  They're fearful because Bernie Sanders, his political revolution, morally based, ethically based, is a fundamental challenge to their interests and their status.  And let's be very clear, the Democratic Party right now lives in the age of Bernie Sanders.  It's just a great joy to be with my dear brother Bernie Sanders, who is exemplar of the longevity of integrity, the longevity of consistency when it comes to poor and working people.  My name is Brother Cornel West, and I have been a freedom fighter for the last 50 years, and I have a smile to be in solidarity with my dear brother Bernie Sanders. ",
