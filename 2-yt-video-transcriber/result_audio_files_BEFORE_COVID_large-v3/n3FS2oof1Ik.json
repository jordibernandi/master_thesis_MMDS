And these five individuals, well, it's called actually through the Department of Defense, the Khalid Sheikh Khalid.  Mohammed et  al.,  meaning that et  al.,  there are a total of five individuals that are being tried all at once in the military tribunals, starting on January 28, 2019, which started on this last Monday.  It's interesting that when this started, that This is at the same time that a lot of 50 degrees plus below zero is going on with the weather in a lot of the Midwest.  Right now, I am Linda Forsyth, and I am here in Washington, D.C.  with Leonard Bocconi.  And we are here.  We were agreed to be able to cover the military tribunals.  at Fort Meade in Maryland, which is right next to Washington, DC.  So it's really been an exciting time for us.  We were the understanding that mainstream media would not be covering these proceedings.  And so our initial thoughts were, well, this is great, you know, because of all the things that are going on with the mainstream media of, you know, Trump not going out and going out of his way to answer questions at the White House with mainstream media and etc.  And then we find out that they're looking for alternative media only to cover the military tribunals.  So, hey, we were excited.  And then we find out, as we looked at the military tribunals and watched them along with looking at the transcriptions of the military tribunals, there's a little bit more involved.  And with that being said, as you will find out, we're just going to be very simply, for the time being, going over the main points for everyone to look at. ",

So, you know, going over the very beginning of the military tribunals, which started on January 28, 2019, which is the pretrial proceedings for the military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, commenced with a military court judge, Perella, who is who resided.  Now, all of the military tribunals were live streamed.  to various different places around the United States with a 40-second delay.  This is including actually in the room of the military tribunals in Guantanamo Bay, always a 40-second delay, to make certain that there weren't any secret information that got through within the military tribunals.  And so we had to wait for the Department of Defense to come through with these transcriptions before we come through to you.  Now, we were really excited when we saw some of the things that were said in there. ",

But we, the people, have a lively discussion going on at Seavine Facebook group page here.  And then the following is a cursory preview of part one of this report created from the lengthy transcript of the first pretrial date.  So here... Sessions was called to order starting at 09.11 Cuba Standard Time.  That's right, she's already said that.  And then all defendants were present at the first morning with the defence council.  One of the defence council of the defendant of Balucci, Captain Andrew Balucci, was sick and did not appear.  Defence Counsel Mr.  Cornell was in attendance and represented the defendant.

The judge advised the defendants that they were free to be present if they chose, but they also could choose not to be present in the courtroom.  But they were also advised that either way it must be of their own free will.  but warned them that any potential absence could be detrimental in their ability to collaborate with the defense counsel.  The judge asked each defendant individually if they understand their rights, and each defendant, of course, said yes.  However, Ben L. Spiking in English responded, as I told you last time, I cannot answer your questions because you are not qualified, Judge, for this case.  Thank you.  or thanks.  The judge addressed Ben al-Shabib's concern that while counsel is free to challenge the judge's qualifications to preside over the commission, Mr.  Ben al-Shabib is not.  So Ben al-Shabib's unwillingness to recognize the judge as the presiding authority of the commission caused him some concern that he was going to be able to adhere to the commission.  And that, in turn, would potentially put everyone's safety in the courtroom in jeopardy.  So I'm going to stop right there for a second and discuss this with Leonard.  It's like, why would that be a threat to the safety of individuals within the courtroom?  Well, it goes to a person's ability to maybe... If they're not cooperating with the judge's orders and not being compliant, it could be argued that if he's not cooperating or agreeing to things going along with the program in this matter, there could be a chance that in future proceedings or at a later time, Well, that makes sense, except when you look at the fact that we are talking about five individuals that, in one way, shape, or form, or another, had orchestrated this horrific event on 9-11-2001.
