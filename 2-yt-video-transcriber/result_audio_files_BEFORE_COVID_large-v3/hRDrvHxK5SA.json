            "text": "Some details was passed to me on Mr.  Mueller, who?  of fake Russian collusion fame or infamy.  Mr.  Mueller, as you can tell by the name, his father was the head of the Gestapo.  No surprise there, Langley too.  And Mr.  Mueller also oversaw the 9-11 investigations and was given the FBI director's job seven days before 9-11.  Recently, of course, Mr.  Obama went into office, extended his term for a further two years.  Now Comey was his apprentice.  and Comey was the new Deep State Protector.  Mr Comey got fired by Trump and Comey's Deputy Attorney General then appoints Mueller as the new Protector of the Deep State.  see how it all clicks in.  Mueller then starts leaking and lawyering up against Trump.  Mueller is building his own computer network to operate from.  it's just like the banking system hiding on backs black screens and blue screens and all others and apparently he's also creating an alternative infrastructure of power to circumvent Trump being in charge.  take note of that Mr Trump.  As the person who sent me this said, Mulek must be our target.  He is the operator.  He is someone who's actually behind the curtain.  He's not a politician.  He's not in the spotlight unless he's spouting fake Russian news.  He is a major part of the deep state who came in to help clean up what Comey was removed from operating.  Except he didn't.  Time to really focus attention on Mr.  Mueller and his family history, me thinks.  Small word on something that came up in Facebook last week.  Is it a coincidence?  Maybe not.  And some kind of took umbrage at my stance about flat earth.  And I added my usual humour to it, which some didn't like.  There's always something someone doesn't like it seems these days.  But the key core of it is this.  The key question is what difference does it make?  if the earth is flat, round, ovoid, rectangle or even penis shaped.  What does it change?  Does it solve the financial crisis?  Does it stop 49,000 children dying every day?  Organ harvesting?  The homeless situation?  The famines around the world?  Disease around the world?  Does it prevent wars or violence or global suffering?  so then it's a distraction piece which I personally know was introduced into the alt media by Langley CIA.  it's what they do and sadly too many fall for the distraction of it.  like I said it doesn't matter what shape it is.  what matters is we fix this planet no matter whether it's round or penis shaped.  it's a distraction piece rather than focus on what is real.  well this group's not about distractions.  there are a plethora of alt media sites that specializes in distractions that you can go and delve into but this group will not be part of that ever.  the earth's round with a slight bulge and really i don't care whether i'm right or wrong on this subject because it solves absolutely nothing.  it's like the argument we're all going to 4d or 5d.  one would think we need to fix things in 3d before taking our distorted mindsets elsewhere should we not?  the show will always call things as it is.  some will agree and some will disagree and some will project because i've got them into a thinking pattern they were not yet comfortable with which was a case in point in our discussion on the MIWI chat over the weekend.
