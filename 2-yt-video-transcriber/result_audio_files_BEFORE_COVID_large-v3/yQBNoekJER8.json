And so that rabbit hole continued down until we got to a point where we couldn't find quite an agreement on her side.  So I switched the conversation and told her, you can ask me some questions.  We went through my epistemology, which she agreed with at some points.  We went through how I came to... She still thinks I'm a deist.  So she was asking what deists believe.  And so I gave her the broadest types of definitions being like, well, I asked myself a series of questions.  At some point, I stopped asking questions.  At that point was which religion is right, because they all seem like they can be wrong.  There was more words, but that's essentially what it came out to.  And we talked to her about how faith sort of breaks down.  And I used an analogy because I've now spoken to a few Protestant apologists.  So I played a Protestant apologist against her.

You could be someone who gives her different resources on that stuff that you were considering and contemplating so that you can have conversations with her.  I think everybody who ever deconverted from their religion \u2013 I certainly wish I had like a friend that just kind of guided me through a lot of it.  A lot of it was like kind of doing things on my own.  The fact that you can be there for her and even if she doesn't go all the way to your beliefs, I mean it's important that she has her own journey with this and that she's figuring stuff out for herself.  But the fact that you can just be there and be a willing participant in her conversations is \u2013 and being completely unjudgmental as you could possibly be.  I mean, that's going to speak volumes for her and what kind of people we as atheists can be for sure.  So I say, you know, keep doing what you're doing.  Keep going through the book and just keep asking her questions.  Like, yeah, what'd you think of this?  Like I, you know, and, and be open to those conversations.  So any, any thoughts on this Lloyd?

If she doesn't want to talk about it, don't talk about it.  But if she does, then fantastic.  So just let her be in the driving seat and you won't go far wrong. ",

It attempts to answer as many questions as possible but is unable to prove anything until the idea is tested.  At some point, the idea will either fail or succeed.  Its success will be limited and more ideas are needed based on no understanding. ",

So I don't know if I would use that because the idea of testing out a belief in order to identify whether or not it's true is a philosophical idea within itself.  and I don't think you should complate all of philosophy with empiricism specifically.  That's my take on that.  That makes sense.  Yeah, but if you need a definition, just go to Wikipedia.  I don't know why you have to make up your own, but I don't know.  Good point.
