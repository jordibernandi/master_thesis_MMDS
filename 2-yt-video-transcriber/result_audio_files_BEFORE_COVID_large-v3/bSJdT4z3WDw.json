            "text": "Hey everybody, a little change of subject here.  Y'all know I'm a comics nerd and an old school Marvel zombie, right?  You know what's getting on my fanboy nerves right now?  Captain Marvel has destroyed the MCU.  Brie Larson has destroyed Marvel.  Captain Marvel is nothing but SJW propaganda.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me be clear.  What's pissing me off is whiny little fanboy trolls.  keep saying nonsense like that.  None of these people have seen the movie, but because Brie Larson has said some things that have made them not feel special, has made them feel that they're not who she's thinking about when she's making her films, they've decided that she's the enemy and her movie is an extension of her enemy-ness.  No, Larson did not write the screenplay for this movie.  She did not direct this movie.  She did not produce this movie.  She is an actress in a role.  But these people have concluded that her feminism is so powerful that it has been able to corrupt the creative process that Marvel has used to create a highly successful movie empire.  Now it's always possible that that is the case.  I haven't seen the movie just as they haven't.  It's possible that the messaging will be so severe that the movie will be ruined.  But I think the greater possibility is that Brie Larson's feminism is so strong that these boys wither under its smokey gaze.  I mean, just look at that.  That's not special effects.  That's feminism.  Now, from my limited point of view, there seems to be two types of criticism going on here.  The social, political, butthurt type, and the general sexist double standard type.  Now one part of the social-political side is the fact that Larson has openly criticized the prevalence of white male critics in her press junkets and stated that she had no interest in the opinions of white male critics when it came to some of her creative projects.  That hurt some of these guys right in the feels.  and they haven't gotten over it.  They don't like her, they want to fight her, and they want to fight against feminism, and they think this is where they can get a win.  So they've created this echo chamber repeating the same stories over and over again, as if it's new.  Not even the same stories, it's the same headlines, over and over, never delving into the context of what she actually said, because they want to feed their own outrage.  Then they get together and try to sabotage Rotten Tomatoes ratings, which many of these same little dudes tried to do with the Black Panther last year.  Remember when trolls were posting online claims that black people were beating up white people after watching the Black Panther?  I wonder what women will be doing to men after being riled up by Captain Marvel.  Anyway, when Rotten Tomatoes doesn't let them play their little reindeer games and shuts them down, they claim somehow they're the victims in all this.  As the saying goes, to the privileged, equality feels like oppression.  You big babies.  That's not even getting into the fact that comics, Marvel comics in particular, have always had social agendas weaved into them.  Carol Danvers was a feminist looking for equal pay in the 70s.  The Wasp, probably the most privileged character next to Tony Stark, always fought for equal treatment.  In the 80s, Chris Claremont leaned heavily on race issues when he was crafting his X-Men stories, and even in the films, the Sokovia Accords is just the Patriot Act for super-powered people.  So, even though we have no evidence that this film will push an agenda, let's not act like agendas are something new.  The second type of criticism I see of this film is based on what is seen in the trailers and takes the form of classic sexist fanboy double standard.  You have the classic, she doesn't smile enough garbage, right off the box.  And then it was, she looks so harsh, so judgmental.  It's all classic, women should be trying to please us and make us feel comfortable.  type comments.  And then you have the other double standard criticisms.  She's too cocky.  So arrogant.  Where does she get off talking to Nick Fury like she's all that?  She's supposed to be a hero.  She should be humble.  Like Tony Stark was humble.  Like Thor was humble.  Like Doctor Strange was humble.  Three male heroes that started out cocky, arrogant pricks, and then followed the classic Marvel character evolution.  Start off arrogant, be brought down, learn humility, and take on the mantle of a true hero.  In comics, Reed Richards, arrogant prick whose error in judgment nearly killed his family.  Peter Parker got his powers, decided to... used them to make money and let a criminal go by because it wasn't his job, he learned humility as well.  It's the Marvel way.  Carol Danvers didn't have the classic Marvel humbling origin in the comics, getting her powers from the Psyche Magnetron and then becoming Ms.  Marvel, and then having those powers taken away by Rogue, and then getting the powers enhanced by the Brood, and becoming Binary, and blah, blah, blah, power change, name change, a few more times, yeah.  But, I would not be surprised, told you, nerd.  I would not be surprised if she followed a similar path as Stark and Thor in this film, starting out full of herself and being taught what is truly important.  But the fact that these fans were willing to allow the male heroes to follow that path but are judging this character for exhibiting the same traits?  speaks of a sexist double standard.  And to those that say, the character doesn't deserve a movie, no one's ever heard of her, they just wanted a female character in the lead, it's true that they wanted that, and they wanted another cosmic film, so combine those and you get Danvers.  But let's be honest.  Was anyone clamoring for an Iron Man movie?  A Captain America movie?  Thor?  Ant-Man?  Had anybody outside of nerds like me even heard of Guardians of the Galaxy?  No.  But they were all spearheaded by dudes that were the kind of guy you think you are, so you were fine with it.  Your criticism is invalid.  So the more you men act like boys and whine about this movie, the more I want to see it and the more I want it to succeed.  I got my tickets for preview night and I'll be posting my initial reaction as soon as possible.  I'm not going in unbiased.  Of course not.  I want this movie to be good.  I want it to be great.  Why would I want anything else?  I'm a fan of movies.  I'm a fan of the MCU.  And this is the lead into Avengers Endgame.  I want it to be great.  And I want there to be important moments in this film leading into Endgame.  So those trolls have to go see Captain Marvel to be ready for Endgame.
