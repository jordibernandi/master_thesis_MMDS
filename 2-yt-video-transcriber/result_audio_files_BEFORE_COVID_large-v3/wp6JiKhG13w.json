            "text": "when your situation's got you down.  Hey, this is the Giggling Conservative and it's time for the Giggling Report.  Alright, so get this.  This is funny, right?  This woman named Roseanne Santos in Massachusetts.  She was in a Mexican restaurant and the dude's wearing a MAGA hat, right?  Make America Great Again.  I mean, what's wrong with that?  Why wouldn't somebody want America to be great?  Well, anyway, Roseanne Santos knocked his MAGA hat off several times.  And, you know, cursed him out and all this stuff.  So he called the cops on her, right?  She got arrested for assault and come to find out she was an illegal from Mexico who got a DUI in 2017, broke the law.  So she broke the law by being an illegal and she broke the law by getting a DUI and broke the law by assaulting a guy with a MAGA hat on.  So the police called ICE and they deported her.  Alright, so go after them MAGA hats and get deported.  Alright, people need to wake up.  Now, I know the people that listen to the giggling conservative, you are woke up.  But now, get this, Ilhan Omar, she supports and is going to make a speech for CAIR, C-A-I-R, Council on Islamic American Relations.  That has been determined to be a terrorist organization that supports Hamas and Hezbollah.  This Congresswoman who has been elected to our United States Congress supports America's enemies and is the most anti-Semitic, racist Congresswoman in politics.  How could people elect this woman?  She don't only hate Israel.  She hates America.  She supports our enemies.  She supports Hezbollah.  She supports Hamas.  I mean, how can this happen in our country?  People, we need to get out and do something.  We got to vote, like I said, 2020.  It's to determine whether America remains free or becomes a communist nation.  And people like Ilhan Omar, they have wedged their way into our government to crumble it and destroy it from within.  Did you guys watch President Trump's speech on CPAC.  Woohoo!  Man, he is going to sign a free speech executive order that says that colleges and schools must allow free speech from both sides or they're gonna lose federal money.  I think that's great.  and that comes on the heels of a guy who getting punched in the face for wearing a MAGA hat.  It's about time.  Yeah, snatch their federal funds, put them out of business.  People should be able to wear any hat they want to.  Speaking of any hat they want to, I know I wear the giggling conservative hat for the show, but I wear this in town.  So, and I don't know, may be just me, but there ain't.  nobody confronts me about it.  Because I'm not going to stand there and take it.  Senator Rand Paul turns out is a rhino.  Now here lately in the recent past, he's been a staunch Trump supporter.  But now when it comes to the state of emergency, I'm going to give you four Republicans who have outed themselves as rhinos.  So if you live in these states, you need to vote against them in the primary.  They need to be replaced and sent a message that we're not going to put up with rhinos.  Support our president because we put him in the office to enact that agenda.  And if you're not on board with that, you need to go.  And here they are.  Rand Paul is voting against Trump on the national emergency to build the wall Susan Collins is voting against him Lisa Murkowski is voting against him and Tom Tillis is voting against him on the national emergency to build the wall and protect our nation from illegal immigration.  the United States defends other countries borders and But our politicians that represent us does not want us to defend our own borders.  These are rhinos.  If you live in their state, vote them out.  If there's a primary challenge to these people, vote for their opponent.  I'm not saying vote Democrat, but if they don't have a primary challenger, start a committee.  Do something to get a Republican to challenge them in the primary to get them out of office.  And I think they come up for a vote in 2020 so we can get them out of there and get somebody in there that will support our president.  Well, this has been the Giggling Conservative with the Giggling Report.  Always remember that laughter is good medicine.  Don't forget Funny Fridays.  And y'all have a good day.  Get the rhinos out of office.  And get the congresspeople that support terrorists and enemies of America out of office.  It's time to vote for freedom.  We don't want communism in our country.  Good day.  When trouble is coming your way. ",
