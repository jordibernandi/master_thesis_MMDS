            "text": "greetings my friends and welcome again to all the members of my global home church and all the visitors today in my global home church.  this is a church that feeds you the truth from the word of god the truth from the gospel.  it shares you vital end times.  news i don't.  i don't come here to hear myself talk.  i don't come here to beg for your money.  don't come here to sell you things.  don't come here to be popular.  i come here to be a watchman a pastor the way the lord has called me and anointed me and welcome.  this is the latest and this is a different sermon than i normally do.  this is an end times huge events signs into heaven sermon and it ties into my video yesterday where i talked about i believe how god is changing the poles uh loosening up the atmosphere around earth and now poking holes in the milky way to prepare a way for the imminent rapture.  this one is on The final super blue flower moon.  that's going to be tonight, Saturday night.  It's not just a blue moon.  It's called a flower blue moon.  In the Bible, let's go ahead and go to the Bible, which I always go to.  The Bible is my source for everything that I can give you.  In the Bible, flowers denote the majesty of God's temple in Israel.  You get that?  What's God about to do after the imminent rapture?  Have the third temple built in Israel, God's temple rebuilt in Israel.  It also denotes the short life of wicked man upon the earth.  And the flowers also stand for death as well.  Again, number one, the third temple is about to be rebuilt.  Number two, the short time that seven years that wicked man will have left on the earth after the imminent rapture during the tribulation and great tribulation.  Number three, the death of the earth and mankind as we know it, as Christ prepares to make all things new in his reign for a thousand years post-tribulation during his millennial reign.  Praise the Lord.  That's going to be amazing times for all of us who are there.  Next.  In the Bible, the color blue means royalty, riches, service to God, and godly living.  You got that?  Let's go ahead and break it down now.  First of all, royalty.  Christ leaves his throne and calls his bride to heaven in the imminent rapture.  Okay?  Perfect match.  Number two, riches.  He left earth after rising from the grave on the third day to prepare untold riches in heaven for his future bride.  Hmm, two for two.  Number three.  All for our service to God and godly living.  Get it?  He didn't say eternal security or once saved, always saved, but godly living.  Those are the ones who will be raptured.  This is all lining up biblically, scripturally, 100%.  I am so excited.  Praise the Lord.  Number three.  Happens in May.  May, where in the Bible, Zechariah speaks of 70 years for Israel in the fifth month, which is May.  It is now Israel's 71st anniversary in May with the current calendar.  But if you go by the old calendars in Bible days, we're just now hitting Israel's 70th anniversary.  And we go to Jeremiah.  And what did Jeremiah say?  Jeremiah speaks of King Nebuchadnezzar.  Destroying God's temple in May, and God will soon allow Israel to rebuild it.  Could be as soon as May, if that's when the rapture is.  Things are lining up so fast.  God is making things happen so quickly.  Look at this beautiful moon God created and put in the sky, in the heavens.  Amazing.  Signs in the heavens, the Bible says, are huge, huge, huge end time signs to show us how close we are to the imminent rapture, catching Ray Harpozzo, whatever you want to call it.  It's about to happen any second of any day.  Every sign in the Bible, all the signs in Matthew 24, all the signs in Ezekiel, all the signs in Jeremiah, all the signs in every prophetic book in the Bible are showing right now that we're just waiting for God to give the word.  And I believe we're waiting for that last Gentile to fill the ark.  And once that last Gentile fills the ark, it'll be like the days of Noah.  And again, the Bible recycles itself so many times, like the days of Noah.  That ark will be rebuilt.  And it won't be a physical ark this time, but it will be a spiritual ark.  Jesus Christ will pull us up to heaven, praise the Lord, in the ark.  And we will go with the bride of Christ to be in heaven with him for seven years, then come back down to earth, join him for the thousand-year millennial reign, and then praise the Lord, come back forever when eternity begins.  And this is all lining up, my friends.  It's all matching everything in the Bible.  But the world doesn't care.  I did a video yesterday, day before, about all the little boys and girls, age 4 to 15 on the average now, who the men in America are craving for, who are of raping them during child prostitution.  They're made into sex slaves.  Only got about 2,000 views.  It's pathetic.  If I would have done a video like most Christians on a watered-down gospel, on you're the head and not the tail, on how Christ wants to give you this huge financial blessing, how you don't have to worry about sin because sin's all paid for.  You can sin all you want.  If I give you one of those sermons, It would probably be a million views.  If I gave you a video about puppy dogs and kitties, it would probably be 10 million.  But my job is not to cater, to kowtow, to placate anyone.  My job is to bring you the gospel, show you what's going on in the end times.  If you're not ready, it's between you and the Lord Jesus Christ.  I can't do anything else but show you exactly what's going on.  That's what I'll do until I'm either raptured or dead.  I owe Christ everything.  He saved my life from being a heroin addict.  He saved my life from being suicidal.  From being close to taking my own life where I would have been in hell right now forever.  Because you can't kill yourself as your last act on earth.  That's murder.  Thou shalt not kill.  He saved me from so many things.  I owe him everything.  I can't begin to repay him.  But I will give him my all until he calls me home.  Because I owe him every single thing.  I can do nothing less but give him my all.  Though my all is nothing.  Though my righteousness is like filthy rags.  I will give him everything until I'm called home.  He demands that of all of us, my friends.  I'm asking you all so many.  I've got a core group of friends who in the number in thousands.  I've got 72,000 plus subscribers on this channel.  But I have thousands who will watch my sermons week in and week out.  I've got sometimes tens of thousands or more who watch my videos week in and week out.  And they will share the gospel with everyone they possibly can.  They have a reward waiting for them in heaven.  Everyone that gets saved because of what they share of my sermons and videos.  they will get credit for them being saved as well because they are out sharing the gospel.  They are out beating the streets.  They're out reaping the harvest the way Christ commanded us all.  When he went to heaven on the third day, praise the Lord, after he rose from the grave on Easter, he had one plan and one plan only for us to share the gospel until the end of days.  We're in the last days right now.  We need to keep sharing it, keep preaching, keep teaching until our time is up.  Don't be fooled by the riches of this world.  Don't be lured in by the evil in this world, by the many evil things that Satan puts before us that tries to lure us away from Christ.  It's time to be focused on Christ 100% right now.  It's time to get out, come out from among her, the Bible says.  Come out from among your dead brick and mortar churches you go to.  Come out from among those dead YouTube channels that you visit that are Christian channels that preach lies and that preach a poisonous gospel and preach another gospel.  Come out from among all the earthly things and focus on finding the few of us who preach the truth from God's word day in and day out, who bring you God's truth and the real things happening in the world, the important things, not all the puppy and kitty videos, not the baby videos, not the jokes that bring you the truth, showing you how close we are to the end.  We are in the last days right now, how close we are to the imminent rapture and then being left behind.  You see, the left behind aren't going to just be the unsaved.  There'll be tons and tons of save people as well who refuse to repent and they're backslidden now.  They believe that once you're saved, you're always saved.  That's a lie from the pits of hell.  I've got at least 250 scriptures I've shared many times that prove otherwise.  Repentance does not work.  You're saved by grace alone.  Works can't keep us saved.  Repentance is a separate mandate after you're saved.  If you don't believe me, you end up left behind.  You end up in hell, the lake of fire.  Don't blame me.  I've warned you over and over and over and over again.  I know I'm like a broken record so many times, but I pound home the word.  The Lord's given me mandates.  He's given me mandates against wanting to be saved, against all the lies and wickedness in preaching churches.  And I have to keep preaching it until I'm gone.  I always follow the Lord's leading when he tells me to do stuff.  If you don't like it, that's between you and the Lord.  All I can do is tell you what I'm going to do and be honest with what the Bible says.  We're all supposed to be as Christians and not be greedy and not be selfish and not just be in it for myself.  I'm in it for all of you to get ready for heaven, not for me.  It's for all of you guys, all through Jesus Christ and all for his glory.  This is the bottom line.  Jesus Christ is all of our only hopes.  He's about to break the sky and snatch away his true bride for the imminent rapture.  And those who are left behind will be left here for seven periods of hell where if God didn't intervene, no flesh would remain alive as it is.  Billions upon billions upon billions without the most grotesque, awful, horrific death imaginable man.  Why go through all of that?  Jesus Christ is your only hope.  Again, if you've never been saved, you're backslidden.  Pray the prayer.  Do the six steps I have in the box for the video.  We're not guaranteeing their day, hour, minute, or second of our life.  If you'd like prayer for anything, contact me.  I pray for you every day without fail.  I love you all so much, my friends.  I don't want to see anyone again spend forever in hell or the lake of fire.  It's the most... Imagine having a perfect body, feeling pain a billion times worse than you feel right now, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for eternity.  It never ends.  Why don't you go through all that?  Imagine having a body that feels pleasure and joy a billion times more than now and spending forever, 24-7 forever, with Jesus Christ and all of those who are living for Christ.  It's a no-brainer.  We're not going to be sitting on a cloud playing a harp.  It's going to be amazing, heaven and the new earth.  It's going to be incredible stuff that God puts out.  So show Jesus Christ you care.  And the way you show Jesus Christ you care is to share.  Show Christ you care.  Share.  Share this video with everybody you possibly can.  Ask them to share it.  This video, sermon, and so on and so on and so on.  And again, we're two or three gathered together.  The Holy Spirit's there as well.  We have thousands gathered here together.  He's here.  This is the true word of God.  Help me share it and get the word out before our time runs out.  May God bless you all.  Please witness and pray for the lost.  What little time we have left.  Again, and look up, true Christians.  Our redemption draweth nigh.  We fly soon.  Take care of yourselves.  Share this video.  Get ready.  The rapture's upon us right now.  Bye. ",
