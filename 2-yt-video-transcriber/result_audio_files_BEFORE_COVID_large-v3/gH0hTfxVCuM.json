            "text": "Jesus said, No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.  Calvinistic pastor John Piper teaches this verse means, Everyone whom he draws does come, because God's drawing infallibly produces the coming.  This would mean that the Father only draws some since all don't come, and that the decisive cause of the coming is God, not man.  So the Calvinist is interpreting the word drawl as to compel or to irresistibly change one's heart through an effectual work of grace so that they will certainly come to Christ.  Therefore, the Calvinistic interpretation of verse 44 would read, No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me compels him, and I will raise he who is compelled on the last day.  But Jesus says several chapters later, And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.  If all are drawn, and draw means to compel, then that would make this verse to mean that everyone will come, which is clearly not the intention of Jesus.  A more consistent way to interpret the word draw is to enable or to grant, which would help us to understand John 6.44 to mean, no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me enables him, and I will raise up he who comes on the last day.  This is consistent with Jesus' own commentary in verse 65 of chapter 6.  This is why I told you, no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.  This is kind of like saying, no one can come to the party unless they've been invited, and those who come will have a great time.  An invitation is required to attend, but not everyone who is invited will necessarily choose to come and have a great time at the party.  This interpretation establishes two key points.  One, God's loving desire for all to come.  and the unbelievers' blameworthiness for not choosing to come when invited.  This is consistent with Jesus' words in the previous chapter when he said to the Pharisees, \"'You study the scripture diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life.  These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have  life.'\".  The reason they are to blame is because they have refused God's love and provision, not because God has refused to give them the necessary grace to come.  This raises an important question.  Why do they refuse to come to Jesus?  Is it because Jesus refused them first, or God doesn't really want them?  We know the scripture is full of passages which indicate Jesus' longing for and love for the people of Israel.  The reason the Pharisees of this day were not believing in Jesus was not because God was withholding some kind of special grace from them, but because they had not been listening and learning from the Father.  Jesus actually explained this in the very next verse in John 6, verse 45, when he said, Jesus draws this parallel throughout the Gospel of John.  For example, in chapter 8, verse 42, he says, If God were your father, you would love me, for I have come here from God.  I have not come on my own.  God sent me.  The lesson is clear.  Those who listened and learned from the father will come to the son.  But those who refuse to listen to the father will also refuse to come to his son.  The scriptures teach that the Pharisees of this day had grown calloused and hardened to the voice of God, and God had now hardened them or given them over to their unbelief so as to accomplish his redemptive purpose through their rebellious actions.  As Jesus explained later in John chapter 12, For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah said elsewhere, He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn, and I would heal them.  Clearly this prophecy is directly related to the condition of hardened Israel, and not a condition of all people from birth due to the fall of Adam, as the Calvinistic interpretation would imply.  So the reason that Jesus' audience in John chapter 6 cannot believe is due to their own rebellion and the hardening of their hearts, not some innate moral incapacity due to the fall of man.  No one perishes because God rejected them or withheld some necessary grace needed to compel them to come to Jesus.  Paul said they perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved.  God is always the initiator.  He's the one who draws, enables, and invites.  Mankind is responsible because they are able to respond by either accepting the truth or suppressing it in unrighteousness.  Jesus, like the Good Samaritan, doesn't pass by on the other side of the road of his enemies.  He's one who stops and provides for those in need.  He is good, righteous, and loving, and desires all people to be saved.  Paul taught Timothy, this is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.  For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people.
