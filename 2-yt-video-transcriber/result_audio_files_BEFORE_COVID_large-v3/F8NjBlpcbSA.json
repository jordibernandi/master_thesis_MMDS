Mr.  Vogt, when your budget or the President's budget proposes $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and $845 billion cuts to Medicare, when you propose that, you obviously studied how many people would die as a result of lack of access to health care.  What conclusion did you read?  How many thousands of people do you think will die because of massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid? ",

What that doesn't account for is the fact that we take things outside of Medicare, such as uncompensated care to non-Medicare beneficiaries.  We move that outside of Medicare.  We're going to still spend money on uncompensated care for non-Medicare beneficiaries.  beneficiaries, but when you adjust for the things where we put it back in other parts of the budget, there is, A, no cut at all because Medicare is going up each and every year, and also it's $517 in savings instead of the number that you cited.

So if you're not even keeping up with healthcare inflation, it in fact is a real healthcare cut.  I mentioned earlier, the very alarming concern that hospitals have about the devastation these cuts will do for senior citizens.  And when you cut a trillion and a half, you're also not including in your calculations the fact that there are more people who will be in the Medicare program.  I suspect Medicaid, despite the administration's effort, will continue to expand.  But you did not answer my question.  There are studies out there which suggest that many thousands of Americans die every single year because they don't get to a doctor when they should.  Did you, in your calculations about massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, come up with any numbers as to how many Americans will die or maybe get sicker because they don't have the health care that they need?

            "text": "Oh, in savings.  I see.  See, to listen to these hearings, fellow Americans, you need to get a dictionary.  Savings means cuts.  Reform means massive cuts.  Let's be clear what this budget is.  This is a budget that benefits wealthy campaign contributors.  This is a budget that goes to war against the working families of this country.  This really is, in fact, a disgraceful budget, and I'm happy to say that there are going to be very few people, even Republicans, who will vote for this terrible budget.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Let me be as clear as I can be.  This budget is an absolute disaster.  It is an insult to the working families of this country.  And I have to say, it really does expose Donald Trump for the fraud that he is.  Over and over again, candidate Donald Trump, when he was looking for votes, promised the American people that he would be a different type of Republican.  I think we all remember that rhetoric, that he would be a champion of the working class, that he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security.  I remember those speeches like it was yesterday.  On May 7, 2015, Mr.  Trump tweeted, this is during the campaign, quote, I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, end of quote.  August 10th, 2015, another tweet from Mr.  Trump, quote, I will save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without cuts.  We have to do it.  People have been paying in for years, and now many of these candidates want to cut it, end of quote.  Donald Trump.  That is what Mr.  Trump said during the campaign, but now that he is president, the tune he is singing is very, very different.  On page 32 of the briefing book of his budget, Donald Trump proposes cutting $1.5 trillion from Medicaid, $845 billion from Medicare, and $25 billion from Social Security.  Mr.  Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert this page into the record.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Question is, what happens to senior citizens in this country who are struggling with Alzheimer's and other serious illnesses who have their nursing home coverage paid for by Medicaid if that program is cut by $1.5 trillion?  Is there a working class family?  Your mom is in a nursing home dealing with Alzheimer's, massive cuts to Medicaid.  What happens to your mom?  Or what happens to the ability of your family to take care of their basic needs now that you're going to have to pay an arm and a leg for nursing home care?  But it's not just seniors.  Today, Medicaid covers millions of children with special needs.  We are the only major country on earth, embarrassingly, not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.  But this budget makes a bad situation worse and will throw millions of children with special needs off of the health insurance they have.  We have an opioid epidemic from one end of this country to the other.  But when you slash Medicaid by one and a half trillion dollars, you make it infinitely harder for communities and states to deal with this terrible crisis.  But it's not just Medicaid.  In terms of Medicare, the Federation of American Hospitals tells us, and I quote, this is not me, this is the Federation of American Hospitals, The new White House budget imposes arbitrary and blunt Medicare cuts to hospitals who will care for the nation's most vulnerable.  The impact on care for seniors would be devastating, end of quote.  During the campaign, President Trump told the American people that he was going to provide, and I quote, health insurance for everybody with much lower deductibles, end of quote.  That's what he said during the campaign.  Let's talk about what he is doing now that he is president.  President Trump's budget would end the Affordable Care Act and throw an estimated 32 million people off the health insurance they have right now.  This is a budget which will make it harder for our children to get a decent education, harder for working families to get the health care they need, harder to protect the air that we breathe and the water that we drink, and harder for the elderly to live out their retirement years with dignity and respect.  This is not a budget, as candidate Donald Trump talked about, that takes on the political establishment.  That was his rhetoric during the campaign.  This is a budget of the political establishment, of the 1%, of corporate America, of the wealthiest people in this country.  Mr.  Chairman, last year Amazon, Netflix, General Motors, and IBM, all very profitable corporations, not only paid nothing in federal income taxes, they actually received a tax refund from the IRS.  They don't need another tax break.  when families in this country are struggling to keep their heads above water economically.  Mr.  President, this is a budget that should be discarded immediately, and a serious budget should be put together that protects working families and not just the 1%.  Thank you. ",
