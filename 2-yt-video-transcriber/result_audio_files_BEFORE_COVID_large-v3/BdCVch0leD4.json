The fact that nothing can break these natural laws makes it seem like something intelligent is setting those limits.

Although the argument that the reason why the speed of light is what it is because we might get hit by something going faster is a new one to me.  There are a couple of reasons the fine-tuning argument doesn't work.  One is that while we can imagine the laws of the universe being different, we can't know for sure that they are in fact free to vary.  If they are not free to vary, then there is no need for a god to dial them in to specific values for the benefit of our existence.  They simply can't be different.  Another reason is that we don't actually know that some variety of life cannot exist in a universe with different physical laws.  In fact, if there is a God, and we take that God as being a kind of living entity whose existence is independent of space and time altogether, as many apologists tell us he is, then that God is at least one life form that can exist without any laws of physics at all, let alone specifically fine-tuned ones.  9.

Another explanation is that genetic variation makes it more difficult for pathogens to spread.  For example, a virus which can kill one person is very unlikely to be able to kill everyone because in a genetically diverse population, someone is likely to have an immunity.  If everyone were genetically identical, a virus that could kill one person could kill everyone. ",

In what sense is existing greater than not existing?  Another problem is that to prove that something exists, you have to prove that it is more than merely a concept.
