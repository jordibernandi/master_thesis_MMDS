And in fact, I had defended her on Twitter several times, but nobody ever mentioned that.  I'm very sensitive about the issue of race.  And so I looked in the media, I looked at things the British royal family had said, and at no time did I ever see anything racist directed at her.  And so I felt it was something that was a construct on social media that they wanted to use as a defense because they were grasping for straws and could find nothing else to defend behaviors that were taking place with the public watching.

That's like saying I'm estranged from my brother just because we live across the continent from each other, or I'm estranged from my aunts and uncles because... I haven't seen them when I was small because lives keep people busy in the United States.  And you talk on the phone, you can't always get together.  Life can be busy.  I can't stand the word estranged.  It seems so pointed.  But when we're talking about mental health, being human is very difficult.  And I know she's been under a lot of pressure, but clearly she has made decisions that have created a lot of these circumstances.  and You know, one way to moderate some of that stress perhaps would be to make better decisions to, you know, to be more careful of, you know, that her actions meet her words, especially in a royal position when you have the eyes of the world watching and relying on you to fulfill what you said you're going to do.  So if you, you know, it's foolhardy to assume those roles and then, oh, I can't handle it.  Well, you knew this going in, you had a choice, you know, you could, you know, do the math and look at whether or not you can handle it based on your skills and your energy level.  And if you fall short and let people down, then it, I mean, it really is on her because she's an adult, she's intelligent and, you can't jump into something like this sloppily and without, you know, careful study and understanding.

I love her.  She is my sister.  I'm not an estranged stepsister as, you know, everything unimaginable has been floating around out there.  But I really don't like how she is treating family.  I don't like how she's treating the royals.  And I think that trickles down into everything.  You know, I feel... as though the responsibility is when you claim to be a humanitarian and you know, if she can go out to homeless shelters and she can go to different places, um, senior citizen centers, well, okay.  You know, if, if she can do that as a humanitarian in front of camera, she can be that humanitarian with family off camera.  And it's just as easy.  It's not hard to make a phone call and to extend kindness and compassion.  And so I don't like that.  she is avoiding that.  And apparently now the disrespect and the shocking treatment of the royal family, I think, is horrible.  I love her, but I can't say I like her.  That hurts a bit.  It's sad. ",
