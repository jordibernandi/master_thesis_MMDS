Join David Barton and Tim Barton as they hit the highway to discover the hidden heroes who shaped the America we know today.  Some made the history books.  Others did not.  Yet one thing is clear.  These trailblazers, originators, and outright characters led lives as big as our 50 states.  This season of America's Hidden History covers characters like General Douglas MacArthur, Annie Oakley, and Francis Scott Key, as well as little-known heroes Bronco Charlie, Robert Smalls, and Phyllis Wheatley.  So buckle up and join the convoy as the Bartons comb the country for facts and artifacts on these hidden heroes of our nation's past.  Don't miss Hidden Heroes on Season 2 of America's Hidden History, only on TBN. ",
