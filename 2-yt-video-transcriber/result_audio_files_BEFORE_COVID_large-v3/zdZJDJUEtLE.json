            "text": "I want to thank you all for coming today.  It's amazing to see the turnout.  I live on the Donegal border, Donegal-Derry border.  I'm actually an Iskahine woman.  And I'm just an ordinary woman, just like you.  But every day I hear something that's very prominent in my life, that we can't change anything.  And that is exactly what they want us to believe, that we can't change anything.  And that's called disillusionment.  And the minute that you start to feel that is the minute that you've lost, that they've won.  And that is not what they want, what we want.  You want to make sure that you've got everything in place and you want to make sure that the person next to you is right beside you when you're going to war.  I live near Laval.  I'm about a mile away from there.  And they're going to put a drug provision centre there.  And the thing is, is that we can't financially support the people that we have in this country.  At this moment in time, we have 11,000 people homeless.  And I'm not sure how anyone, never mind anyone sitting in this room, can go to sleep at night knowing that, because I can't.  I don't know if that makes any... I can't.  I can't.  Every day I count my blessings that I've got a roof over my head.  But there's 11,000, maybe 3,000 or 4,000 of those that are kids, children, born in this country that are homeless.  And yet every day we're letting loads of immigrants in.  A lot of people are going to label you and, listen, that's okay.  That's life.  You take the punches, you roll with it.  But look to the person next to you right now and as long as they're standing next to you, as long as they're breathing, there's always hope and there's always a reason to continue on with what we're doing.  Thank you so much. ",
