The New Yorker is reporting this morning that the president ordered the Department of Justice to attempt to block the merger between AT&T and Time Warner over the objections of his chief of staff then, John Kelly, but also his chief white economic advisor, Gary Cohn.  In your view, is that an acceptable use of presidential power, a president trying to block a merger because he doesn't like the coverage by a news station this one owned by one of the companies involved?
