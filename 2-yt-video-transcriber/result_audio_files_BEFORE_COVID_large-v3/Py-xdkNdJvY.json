And it's interesting because you asked that question today, you have to be careful and certain circles how you ask it.  Because there's a popular movement today that talks a lot about social justice.  And it's not a good thing.  It's not healthy.  It's not balanced.  It's not biblical.  It's social justice, very emotional.  We've got to care about justice.  We've got to care about this.  But there doesn't seem to be anything that it's anchored on.  And then when it is anchored on something, it's generally on things like Marxism, neo-Marxist ideology, those sorts of things.  So when you talk about the issue of justice, as you look through church history, I think you can see that Christians have always had a concern for justice in society.  And it's interesting because we've gone from a place, I feel, that we had that vision.  when America is forming and Christians are coming over, they're The colonies are pointing directly to the God of the Bible.  The triune God of the Bible, they're pointing specifically to God's laws.  And so even in our own American experiment, not long ago you could see that Christians had a concern for justice in society.

Calling people to come to be joined to him by faith and faith alone.  to be redeemed and reconciled and receive the gift of eternal life.  But then you mentioned, of course, the latter part of the Great Commission is, and teach them to obey.  So ought we to, as we come into the nations, as Christians did historically, to be focused on that aspect of pointing people to God's law in every corner of life, his standards in every corner of life.  Is that something that we ought to be doing as a church? ",

Why would I want a form of law that presupposes that Jesus did not rise from the dead?  That makes no sense.  Jesus did rise from the dead.  The world will never be the same.  His word is authoritative.  And part of the reason we're having trouble getting the world to accept the authoritative word over them is because we're not accepting that authoritative word over us, right?  Jesus told us what to do.  That's right.  He told us to disciple the nations.  He told us to baptize the nations.  And he told us to teach the nations obedience.  That means teach communist China obedience.  Teach Islamic Iran obedience.  Teach an apostate United States obedience.  No, you can't chop babies up into pieces and call it constitutional.

I found it interesting as I was reading what the government had said about him, that he was essentially subverting the power of the state or the authority of the state.  And I thought to myself, that's how you know.  he's preaching the right gospel.  When the state recognizes that your Jesus is a threat to their authority and their power, you're preaching the right Jesus.  You're preaching the Jesus of the apostles because Rome also recognized.  You're saying there's a different Lord?  Right.  Why won't you say Kaiser Curios?  Why won't you say Caesar is Lord?  What's the big deal?  It's just a little pinch of incense.  Come on, just a little bit.  So they recognize the authority of Jesus then and the kingship of Jesus then was a threat to Rome. ",
