            "text": "What the hell's going on, Americans?  Jericho Green here with you once again, and I just got done reading an article in the New York Post.  Now, I posted a video about this on my YouTube page and on my Facebook page.  Ilhan, the double agent, the double Somali agent, Omar, Some footage surfaced from an interview she did on Al Jazeera.  Makes sense.  2018.  And the guy was asking her about the rise of Islamophobia in America.  When was that created?  2008 or some shit?  One of these garbage new words that mean jack shit.  There's no irrational fear of people who practice Islamophobia.  Or people who are Muslims.  People who are of the nation of Islam.  In some cases, that fear is not irrational.  Are there people who have irrational fears of Muslims?  Yeah, probably.  But we got a bit of a history here.  So he's asking her about it.  She says, well, this country, we should be concerned with white men.  saying that they're the number one terror threat, it's white men.  If we really want to keep America safe, then we should have policies, we should profile and create policies to combat against radicalized white men.  Profiling, don't?  the POC, the people of color, they don't like that word, profiling, right?  That's a bad word.  When it's aimed at white people, namely white men, then profiling's okay.  And he asked her, you know, he cited the, was it 2017?  The guy who rented that truck or whatever ran down eight people, killed eight people in New York.  And then San Bernardino shooting.  killed 14 people, both Muslims.  And whenever they talk about this shit, whenever they say that white men are the number one terrorist threat, remember that greasy-lipped bitch Donna Limon on CNN said the same thing, yet he beds a white man every night?  Anyway, so whenever they talk about this shit, they always say since 9-11, after 9-11.  You can't start comparing body counts after the largest fucking terror attack ever perpetrated on American soil, which was carried out by Muslims.  We can't start the clock in September 12, 2001.  You want to compare body counts?  They always bring up the Vegas shooter, which was awful.  Motherfucker should have been skinned and boiled for what he did.  No one's giving a pass to people who carry out terrorist acts or domestic terrorism.  Yeah, fuck what color they are.  You gotta go.  Most of the pussies kill themselves.  But you can't just start day after the greatest attack we've ever seen.  That already puts Muslims way ahead.  With a body count of over 3,000 people.  Did you forget about that?  I know you see it as something some people did.  But if you're going to talk shit about the domestic terrorism carried out by white dudes compared to Muslims, there is no comparison.  And since you like these policies of profiling and aiming their policies at a certain group to keep us safe, okay, if we aim it at white men, I think there's enough room to aim it at Muslims too.  You like these policies and this profiling?  Let's start where you come from.  Let's start from your district.  Remember?  Remember what Trump said?  I think part of that, this is what he meant.  Because your district is number one, the top spot.  If we did a terrorist recruitment countdown, you would get the number one spot.  Where you represent is number one in terrorist recruitment in America.  So let's do some profiling there.  Let's aim some policies at that.  America's big enough.  we can handle two things at once.  We'll take care of this petty white man domestic terrorism and that petty Muslim domestic terrorism.  No, no, I'm not saying all Muslims are terrorists, but a lot of the attacks carried out in America are by Muslims.  So what the fuck, how can you say, and that's racist, right?  You're saying an entire race of people or entire group of people are one way based on their race.  But if it's coming from someone who's draped in enough layers of victimhood, who's blanketed in protection, then they can say whatever the fuck they want.  You know damn good and well if some white politician got up there and said, well, you know, most of the murders in this country are carried out by black men.  Most of the federal drug arrests are of illegals.  Both of those are true.  But if you're not dreamt in enough victimhood, if you don't have enough victimhood flak jackets on, you're going to get it.  Somebody's going to be standing behind a podium apologizing, saying all this stupid shit to quench the thirst of race baiters and race pimps.  If they say that it's true, the numbers say it is, but only certain people can speak the truth.  Apparently.  And if the lips the truth is coming from aren't dark enough, or gay enough, or whatever enough, then you can't say it.  But she can.  So where's her apology?  Where's the Democratic Party denouncing her hate speech?  That's some bullshit.  And to be honest, I don't see how a Muslim woman... can wield this much power on her own.  What I mean is, traditional Muslims, the men are in charge.  The men set the rules and the tone.  So I think if there's a man in her life, he's telling her how to govern.  He's telling her how to do her job, be it pillow talk or whatever.  Because if she says something that casts them in a bad light or goes against their game plan, somebody's going to check her.  And according to their rules, she has to listen to it.  Now, if she can say that kind of shit, why can't everybody say whatever the fuck they want?  No matter how untrue it may be.  But you can't.  It's selective, and that's fucked up.  That's not fair.  Let people say what they want, and whoever's hearing it can deal with it however they want.  You can get offended, you can not listen to it at all.  That's also an option.  But for her to sit there and say that shit?  White men are the number one terrorist threat in America?  You're fucking tripping.  I told you she was a Somali double agent.  She don't give a shit about America.  She doesn't want to be American.  She just wants to be in America.  Man, get out of here with that silly shit.  You know, some white person said that their career is fucking over.  Let a Republican say they'd be calling for their resignation immediately.  Man, let me get the fuck up out of here and enjoy the rest of my state-mandated meal period.  You know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.
