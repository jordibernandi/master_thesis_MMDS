Monkeys and humans descended from a common ancestor.  I was a fundamentalist Christian for more than 25 years and thought that I was supposed to be a preacher.  Jesus gave some good advice and some crappy advice and some questionable advice, and that's not enough.  And there's not a secular humanist organization or country on the planet that has ever produced as a good thing, an intentional good thing, rapists and murderers. ",
