            "text": "It's a generally accepted principle that anything that isn't expressly prohibited by law is permissible.  And yet that doesn't seem to stop the public from dreaming up ever new and varied ways of unofficially outlawing behaviors that are otherwise entirely lawful.  For example, here are five more things you think are illegal but aren't.  Number one, legal tender.  In 2017, Nick Stafford from Virginia, USA, piled up five wheelbarrows worth of pennies and wheeled them into his local DMV, Britain's equivalent of the DBLA, to pay off a $3,000 tax bill under protest.  It took two staff members over seven hours to count through 300,000 pennies that they couldn't refuse because, in America, all coins and currency are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes and dues.  However, try that in Britain and you're likely to be turned away because, contrary to myth, it is not illegal to refuse to accept coins or notes as legal tender, except for the settlement of debts.  And even then, according to Section 2 of the Coinage Act 1971, legal tender has set limits.  In the case of bronze coins, they must only be accepted to a total of 20 pence, considerably less than your average wheelbarrow.  5 pence and 10 pence coins can be refused if they exceed \u00a35, and 20 and 50 pence pieces can be turned away if they exceed \u00a310.  There is no restriction on \u00a31 and \u00a32 coins.  But the term legal tender is a misnomer anyway, because no seller of goods or services is obliged to accept coins or banknotes of any denomination.  A seller can ask for whatever type of payment they prefer.  If they want to be paid in matchsticks or smarties, that's entirely their choice, especially if they're aiming to go out of business.  Legal tender and the Coinage Act only applies to legally enforced debt, which means even a miniature wheelbarrow full of pennies could be turned away from your creditors.  Also, it's worth noting that although Nick Stafford's tax bill was $3,000, he shelled out an additional $2,000 just to purchase the wheelbarrows.  Number two, free water.  This next myth seems to have buried itself deep into the public's misconception about the food services industry.  And that is this.  If you go into any restaurant or fast food joint in England, Scotland or Wales and ask for a cup of water, they are obliged by law to supply it for free.  Refusal to do so, even when the customer has made no other purchase, is a breach of trading laws.  As widespread as this belief is, it simply isn't true.  According to the Licensing Act 2003, mandatory licensing conditions, only places that serve alcohol were legally required to provide free tap water.  There is nothing that says McDonald's or Pizza Hut must turn on their taps for free, nor would it be illegal for a restaurant to charge you for a jug of Seven Trends Vines.  and yet you'd be hard pushed to find an eatery that would refuse to supply free water on demand.  Why?  Probably because most serving staff have also been taken in by this myth.  Ironically, these mandatory licensing conditions prohibit acts that most people think are lawful in bars, clubs and pubs, such as supplying free or discounted drinks to customers based on a particular characteristic, such as half-price drinks for women only, allowing any drinking games that involve consuming alcohol quickly or in quantities and bizarrely dispensing alcohol directly into another person's mouth.  Number three, breach of the peace.  Breach of the peace is a power of arrest in England and Wales that dates back to the 10th century.  Its purpose is to prevent immediate violence and damage from occurring in public or in private.  You may have used it yourself to break up an argument or fight without even knowing you were using your breach of the peace powers to do so.  The police often rely on the same powers to temporarily detain or restrain.  and thereby defuse potentially threatening situations.  But here's the thing.  Committing a breach of the peace isn't a criminal offense.  You can't be jailed for it, or fined for it.  You can't even be prosecuted for it, nor can you be given a criminal record for it.  At worst, you must either be released once the breach of the peace has passed, arrested for a public order offence, or brought before a magistrate to be bound over to keep the peace.  Which means giving your word that you will not undertake to breach the peace again within a set period of time.  If you do then you could be prosecuted for an associated offence.  Breach of the peace is provided at common law which means you'll not find it printed anywhere in legislation.  In Scotland however it has been entered into statute as a criminal offence and you can be charged and prosecuted for it and if found guilty be given a criminal record.  An interesting fact about breach of the peace is that it's a direct descendant of keeping the king's peace.  During the 11th century when a king died the power to uphold the peace would die with him.  This meant anarchy would often break out because criminals were immune from arrest.  Only when a new sovereign was crowned would the peace be restored.  But in 1272, Edward I ended this by passing a law that the king's peace was to be permanently maintained.  And these powers still exist with us today.  Seems fairly ludicrous to those in America that, here in England, we have to pay for a TV licence.  A tax which is used primarily to fund the TV, radio and internet services of the BBC.  A service that is, quite frankly, a dinosaur in a digital download age.  but england is not alone.  approximately two-thirds of the countries in europe and half of the countries in asia and africa charge for annual television licenses to fund public tv the most expensive being in austria which charges three hundred and thirty two euros a year.  england comes in at sixth place charging a hundred and seventy euros per year.  many people in england it could be argued pay for their tv license out of fear rather than necessity because they don't seem to realize that owning a tv without a license is not a criminal offense.  You can own as many TVs as you like, place in as many rooms as you like, without ever having to purchase a license, because it's not owning a TV that necessitates a license, but rather what you choose to watch.  For instance, you don't need a license if you use your TV to do any of the following.  Watch or download any on-demand programs other than those provided by the BBC, such as ITV Hub, SkyGo, Netflix or Amazon Prime.  Watch content on video sharing sites like YouTube, Vimeo or BitChute.  Use a TV to watch DVDs or Blu-rays.  Use a TV as a monitor for video games, CCTV or video cameras.  Use a TV to view electronic files or hook it up to your PC or laptop.  Listen to or download radio programs including those provided by the BBC.  The misunderstanding that in England you must purchase a license if you own a TV is thanks in part to the BBC's aggressive and, quite frankly, dishonest promotion that TV licensing officials are equipped with detector vans and electronic devices that can pinpoint the presence of an illicit TV signal from anywhere in a street.  Devices that the BBC staunchly refused to disclose the technical details of, lest the public finds a means of evading them.  Well, not only would such clandestine surveillance be a breach of various privacy and human rights laws, no court would allow evidence gathered by a secret electronic device without the inner workings of that device being open to scrutiny.  Number five, age ratings.  Finally, we come to perhaps the most misunderstood of all consumer protection laws, movie and video game ratings.  Is it illegal to allow a miner to play an 18 rated video game or watch an 18 rated movie?  And if it isn't, why do providers like Sky insist you enter a PIN number to access 18 rated or post-watershed content?  the short answer is this bbfc and peggy rated content has no force of law.  you commit no offence as a minor or by allowing a minor to access content that falls outside of age.  approval ratings enforcing age ratings is primarily the job of local government.  as part of licensing laws cinemas for instance must ensure that they sell tickets or grant access within the designated age restrictions.  If a 14-year-old child sneaked into an 18-rated movie, the child itself would not be breaking any laws, but the cinema management could find themselves prosecuted under licensing laws.  In the case of TV service providers, compulsory PIN numbers to regulate restricted content is a contractual obligation between the broadcaster and Ofcom.  Sky wouldn't even be able to provide a service if they didn't agree to Ofcom's rules and regulations.  But nothing Ofcom or the Video Standards Council Ratings Board says or does could be used as a means to prosecute you, the viewer.  not that it stops some people from trying.  In 2015, headteachers from 16 schools in Cheshire sent out a letter to all parents threatening, if your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game or associated product that is designated 18+, we are advised to contact the police and Children's Social Care as this is deemed neglectful.  Strangely, not a single prosecution for neglect ever arose from this crackdown.  Maybe that had something to do with the fact that, on average, over two-thirds of all children between the ages of 11 to 13 admit to playing 18 rated games on a regular basis.  Maybe a little too much neglect for the authorities to cope with.  This channel cannot exist without your support.
