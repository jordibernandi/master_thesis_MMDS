            "text": "What's up everybody?  It's your girl.  back for another video.  So Chick-fil-A is under attack again.  Today on the news I saw a local high school being interviewed.  The principal and his staff had declined a free lunch catered by Chick-fil-A because of Chick-fil-A's views on the LGBTQ community.  Now something was going on with football.  It was being celebrated and the teachers were offered know a free lunch and chick-fil-a offered to pay for here.  we're gonna cater.  you know all these free meals for your school and your teachers.  um you know for free and this school is declining because of the founder of chick-fil-a's beliefs on the lgbt community.  and um you know marriage between a man and a woman.  that's what they believe.  so The principal was saying that doesn't align with the school's beliefs and the school's morals and values.  So therefore, they can keep their chicken.  We don't want it.  We'll eat somewhere else.  You know, this kind of stuff is getting completely out of control.  Let me just say this.  Chick-fil-A has been under attack so many times because the founder or the president has stated that he just believes that marriage should be in the biblical form of marriage, between a man and a woman.  I've never heard him say anything hateful or, you know, faggots cannot eat at my establishment.  Faggots cannot have chicken here.  Queers, no queers.  I've never heard him say anything like that.  And Chick-fil-A... had a lot of protesters recently.  Liberals were going around and protesting around different Chick-fil-A's and harassing the customers.  Anybody that went in there, they were calling them hateful, hateful names, throwing food at them and drinks at them, screaming at them, calling them bigots and sexist and racist.  That's what the liberals do though.  They claim to be the party of tolerance The party of acceptance.  And they tolerate anyone based off their sex, their race, but yet they're always attacking people for their sex and their race.  You know, that's what they resort to when they get in an argument with someone or don't like someone.  They always attack for the sex and the race.  But they're the party of tolerance.  But anyway, this is the thing that cracks me up.  I'm always hearing on like liberal media, they're always trying to say things like, you know, America is so hateful towards homosexuals.  This country is backwards.  And I'll hear a lot of homosexual people on social media saying how much they hate this country and how, you know, how much hate they receive.  And Donald Trump is, you know, one of the main reasons for it.  And this is the thing.  You cannot be put in prison in America for being homosexual.  You will not be executed in America for being homosexual.  But countries all throughout Asia and Africa, they will hang you, they will stone you, they will execute you in some form or fashion, or put you in prison for a really long time.  It is straight up illegal.  And a lot of those countries are in Africa, you know?  A lot of countries, like I wrote some of them down, I know Kenya, Somalia, Nigeria, Uganda, and then they got some in Asia, tons in Asia, but just to name a few, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan.  But anyway, these are countries that if you try to go there and they see you, you know, two women or two men, you will be killed or you will be put in prison.  And you want to say America's backwards and America's hateful?  None of those things will happen to you in America.  Yes, when you're on social media, people will call names.  Get over it, you freaking baby.  I deal with it all the time.  You crazy ass liberals that don't believe.  You know, just because you get offended at my video or something I say, I can't tell y'all how many times they've called me names based off my race, my sex, who I'm married to, have called me every name in a book, having to do with my accent, where I'm from, you know, the way I look, things that I cannot help, you know, I was born the way I was born, and that's what they resort to, instead of saying, you know what, I don't agree with you, and this is why, they can't have that conversation, it's automatically, you, you effing be, you stupid, you know, pale bitch, and all of this stuff, so, That's the party of tolerance and acceptance, okay?  This is the thing.  Chick-fil-A, the statement that the founder made, in my opinion, wasn't hateful at all.  Just stated, I believe in the biblical form of marriage between a man and a woman.  And I'm going to tell y'all right now, I believe in the same thing.  I myself, I was not created by two men and two women.  I was created by a man and a woman.  The baby I'm carrying now, I'm eight months pregnant with was created by myself and my husband, man and woman.  Every one of you watching this video right now was created by a man and a woman.  I believe in the natural order of things.  I believe in having a strong foundation for our children, and that takes a mother and a father.  I believe it was created that way for a reason.  You know, women are one way, men are another, and when we come together, We make a well-rounded, perfect pair that can build a very solid, strong foundation for the next generation.  That is my opinion.  And, you know, if you want to call me hateful names for that, then you've got a serious problem.  You know, you're ignorant and stupid.  And there's nothing wrong with, you know, having an opinion like that.  The man never said anything hateful at all.  And I just don't understand, you know... what this is all about.  You can't even go eat a freaking chicken sandwich without being called names and being judged.  It's just really sad what liberals have done to this country.  Instead of being out at a job and working and minding their business, that's the kind of stuff they want to go out and do.  Protest and ignorance is what I like to say.  Because they're not protesting something that You know, it's just ignorant.  It doesn't make any sense.  You're going to go down and call people names for eating a chicken sandwich?  You know, as long as the business provides good food at a good price, it's clean, and the employees are respectful, and it's a good experience, they'll get my business.  I don't care what their political beliefs are.  I don't care what their beliefs are on anything, you know.  And the way I am is, and the way I was raised, we don't judge people for their skin color.  We don't judge people for how much money they have.  who they are.  We judge by character.  You know, if you're respectful to me, I will be respectful to you.  You know, I've had gay friends.  I've had gay relatives.  I don't care about that.  As long as you're not trying to teach it to my children and you respect my boundaries, we're good.  Like I said, as long as you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.  It has nothing to do with what you look like, what you believe in.  None of that needs to even be brought up.  You know, but it's always liberals that bring it up, I find.  But anyway, y'all, tell me what y'all think about Chick-fil-A.  What is your opinion about it?  Because I personally would still give them my business as long as the food is good.  And I do like some of the food there.  So comment below and I will see y'all back in my next video.  Bye. ",
