            "text": "us not wanting to date trans people.  it's not something that we've been shouting out at the top of our lungs your whole life.  i've said it once in my life and that was during that video and the only reason i said it in that video was because riley was accusing anybody who wasn't interested of being transphobic.  because what i've come to realize is that a lot of times people are trying to shame you into agreeing with them.  Shame you.  And if they can't shame you, they want to ostracize you from the overall tribe.  That is the two things that they enjoy doing.  It's why when someone is having a speech they don't like, they bang loud drums and they drown it out.  When someone is saying something they dislike, they try to have that person immediately banned.  So it doesn't allow for any form of discourse.  It just allows for alienation.  And here's why this is extremely important and why I think everybody should be listening to.  what we're saying is that If you haven't heard recently, people between the ages of 18 to 34 are actually now less accepting of LGBTQ people than they were over a year ago.  And this dropped by over 8%.  So what does that mean?  That, you know, there's always this mantra that young people are inherently going to be more and more liberal and that they're going to be more and more this way.  But we're actually seeing the opposite thing being true.  And so I would tell people part of why I think this is becoming true is that people are seeing some of the tactics that LGBTQ activists are using in order to further their agenda.  And when you're seeing these things like ostracizing, denying people the ability to speak, only allowing certain types of voices to be heard, you are then making sure that people who are young who want to explore ideas are no longer feeling comfortable.  And you're doing this. ",

They only had queer artists for the most part.  They banned me for having an opinion that 95% of men have.  Meaning 95% of men do not want to date a trans person.  Then you are saying that all these men are inherently transphobic and have some irrational fear.  Or maybe there's a diverse reasons.

You want to date, but to tell people that they have some kind of irrational feel because they don't want to date with a certain subset of groups, to me is illogical because what people look for in dating is so varied and the reasons are so varied that for me it's so small-minded of you to inherently reduce someone to some phobia when in reality you don't know their lived experience.  So you want to be seen as individuals, you want to be seen as real human beings, but then you strip people of their individuality and of their humanity when they show reasonings that you don't understand.  We can pass all the laws, but what we cannot do is legislate acceptance.  And I think deep down, more than a law being passed, we want our neighbors and the people around us to look at us with empathy and respect.
