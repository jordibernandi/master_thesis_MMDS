So if you're new here, subscribe to the channel and check back every Monday through Friday and we will continue monitoring this madness as it unfolds.  Now, those were middle school and high school kids, so I guess we should expect them to believe in fantasies like Santa Claus and man-made climate change.

I think this Scooby-Doo meme perfectly illustrates exactly what's going on with this girl.  The best part is, at another point in the day, the camera happened to be on Greta when President Trump entered the room, and the look on her face is absolutely priceless.  Oh!  Now, we shouldn't be too hard on her.  She's just a kid and she means well.  She also has Asperger's, obsessive compulsive disorder, and depression.  So she really should be getting treatment instead of being hauled out as the Democrats' latest expert on climate change.  What makes this circus extra strange this week is one day the Democrats are telling us that we need to ban cheeseburgers because the cows are consuming too much water and farting too much, and then the next they're attending the Iowa Steak Fry and literally manning the grill as the festival is grilling up 10,000 steaks.  Kamala Harris also decided to show off her dancing skills.  If you think these people are unhinged now, just wait to see what happens if we can get President Trump re-elected next year.  Since we're rapidly approaching the one-year countdown until the 2020 election, I'm releasing my new Trump White House shirt, which you can get from my online store, markdice.com, or click the link in the description below.  And like all of my designs, of course, it is available in a t-shirt, long sleeve, and a hoodie, and a whole bunch of different colors as well.
