            "text": "Hi there guys, welcome back to my channel.  Today I want to do just a little chatty sort of video with you catching up about what's going on in my life, my second trimester.  And I would really like to share some resources with you that I've been using to help prepare me for birth and like mentally and sort of physically, as well as just to share with you some of the things that I've been thinking about.  as this pregnancy progresses.  so all of the things that I share with you that are resources for moms out there that may be watching or maybe that you would like to send to a woman who is in your life that's important to you who could use these these things.  there will be links in the description so that you can you can find them easily.  so my second trimester is going really well.  I'm really happy a lot of the time, but there are sort of accent marks here and there of having little sort of emotional spirals, basically.  And I think that that's just normal, you know, I'm really sensitive and just a part of being pregnant that you're emotional a lot.  so i mean it's nothing serious.  but for the most part i'm really happy i'm really excited i'm not nervous about the birth which i'm kind of i'm almost a little bit concerned about because i feel like maybe i should be more nervous or my my midwife says that that's.  that's how you should feel you should.  you shouldn't feel nervous you should feel you know excited and That's a good thing that I feel this way, but I'm kind of, I guess the neurotic side of me thinks maybe I should be more worried about what the labor is going to be like.  But I just, the thing is I don't know what labor is going to be like.  All I can do is expose myself to as many birth stories as possible so that I can wrap my head around all of the potentialities that I could experience in birthing my son.  So that kind of leads me to my first resource that I would really like to share with you guys.  I have become obsessed with reading and listening to birth stories.  Even though I want a home birth, and that's what I'm striving for, I have a plan B, I live close to a hospital, My plan B is very detailed as detailed as my plan a is.  I have.  I'm working with a OB as well as a midwife so I'm kind of doing things in tandem because like I said This is all new territory for me And I just want I know that birth is unpredictable and I know that even though I want this home birth I might end up in the hospital and I don't want to potentially end up in the hospital and for that to be something which I affects my stamina or affects my mental ability to focus on having a natural birth whether that's at home or in the hospital.  I also really think it's important to expose myself to a lot of different birth stories because every birth story is so different.  it's amazing like that's.  one of the things that I love about listening to birth stories is that no birth story is the same.  and You know, there are women out there who they plan to have the epidural, they plan to do pain management and because of the way that their birth progresses, like maybe sometimes it'll progress really fast and they don't have a chance to get those painkillers and stuff, they end up having a natural birth.  Um, and then the reverse is sometimes true that these women who are, you know, they're really into their natural, holistic hands-off approach.  They're really, really hoping that they can achieve a natural birth.  They don't even want to think about having interventions, uh, or ending up in the hospital.  And as a result of however, their labor, their labor progresses or complications that may arrive at the last minute, they end up with epidurals and sometimes with forcep births and you know, worst case scenarios sometimes with C-sections.  So we can all have our best case scenario, but I think it's important that I educate myself about as many different, um, things that could develop in birth so that, yeah, I can have my plan A, I can have my plan B, but I'm not under any illusions that my birth is going to, the birthing of my son is going to end up exactly like either of those plans.  The one thing that is consistent among all birth stories is that it's never how women think it's going to be.  So with that being said, I would just like to share with you two books.  The one that I'm currently reading right now is called In the Spirit of Homebirth.  It's a book, it's a collection of stories of birth, home birth specifically, that are from women who live in British Columbia.  So all of these women are Canadian.  And the thing about this book is that it is a little bit kind of, like it's influenced by feminism in a way, you know?  So there's like a great attention to being inclusive and showing a diversity of, Types of women and their experiences.  and now I know you know, maybe you think you know Why.  why is this woman who is like kind of right-wing or whatever?  Why is she reading this liberal home birth book?  the thing is like I think an experience like birth.  it's it's it's like the ground of femininity in my opinion.  And the personality, the identity, the ideologies that we subscribe to, our sexualities, like these things are kind of stripped away in the process of birth.  And there have been stories that I have read in this book by women who, if I met them on the street, I would have nothing in common with them.  I would have no point of reference for how to be their friend or, you know, to engage with the things that they find interesting.  But that doesn't mean that I still haven't gained something valuable from hearing their personal experience of birth.  And I think that that's just something that's really cool that I've realized as a result of reading this book.  And there is also like an emphasis on featuring First Nations women, because I mean, it's Canada, so it's important, especially among liberal circles to, put First Nations stories and their experiences at the forefront, for better or for worse.  It's something that is just a part of living in Canada.  while again i am very different from a first nation first nations woman um there are things that they are more in touch with with regard to um like the community side of birth.  um you know midwifery is something that's still kind of more intact i think in some first nation communities.  they have a lot more traditional aspects to birth which I think a lot of Western women have lost touch with.  And so there are things that I've learned from listening to these stories too.  And I've really enjoyed it.  So, you know, if you can get past these things, and kind of keep an open mind, I think this book would be really interesting for any woman out there who's looking for specifically home birth stories.  I've been really enjoying it.  And then I also have this other book, which is called Natural Birth Stories.  So this book is like there are home births in like stories of home birth in this book but it's it also includes natural births that take place in the hospital which i think is important.  it's important to consider that as an option because if the safety of my baby um requires that i give birth in a hospital then that's what i'm gonna do.  so i want to have as much information about how women have advocated for themselves against theoretically pushy hospital staff that want to do interventions, that want to sort of induce them, that want to do these sorts of things that maybe they aren't on board with, that want to cut the cord as soon as the baby comes out.  All of these things, I want to be exposed to those stories too because I might end up there.  This book also focuses on postpartum, Postpartum recovery as well, which I find really useful.  So it's just this book and I think this book is actually.  I Think these stories are from there.  It's not just Canadian women.  It's American women as well.  So yeah, if you're interested, these are two books that I'm working my way through and I'm really enjoying.  If you're also if you're kind of the person you're not really into stories like reading.  there are two podcasts that I will link below and kind of in the same theme as the two books.  Um, one is called the happy home birth podcast, which is specifically home birth stories.  Um, many of them are very positive and uplifting and empowering to listen to.  Um, it's a Christian lady who runs the podcast and a lot of the women who are featured at telling their birth stories are also Christians.  So I think it's a good resource.  Um, it's great to just sort of turn on and listen to while you're cooking or doing housework or whatever, you know, exercising, whatever it is that you're doing.  the other podcast is called the birth hour which will be linked below and this one is more.  this one's been it's been running for longer.  there's like 300 podcasts to to choose from.  um in terms of like what you want to listen to there are stories from every type of woman and sometimes there are traumatic birth stories.  sometimes there are like you know moms of five or moms of three who are telling you about the variation and the differences in their in their birth stories and I think that the birth hour is possibly a better resource just because it's more real and raw whereas the happy home birth is kind of like.  If you're someone who's anxious and afraid but you also still wanna do this and you're looking for positive, uplifting birth stories, this one could be good for you because it shows you that it's possible and that lots of women achieve natural birth at home.  So those are the birth story things and I think that that's been huge for me lately because Yeah, like I'm preparing my body for birth.  I'm eating well.  I'm going to the gym now regularly with my husband.  I'm doing the like spinning babies moves.  I'm seeing a pelvic floor physiotherapist.  So I'm doing sort of like pelvic floor exercises and all that's well and good.  But for me, getting my head around birth and focusing a lot on the mental aspect of birth has been really important to me lately.  And I think it's something that a lot of women often forget.  And yeah, I just think that exposing yourself to birth stories is a great resource for mentally getting yourself ready for birth.  So the next thing that I would like to share with you is a website that I found as a result of listening to one of the podcasts on the Happy Home Birth podcast.  And that is a website which is called sisterbirth.com.  And so sisterbirth.com is kind of like if you're a woman who doesn't have access to a doula, you can't afford a doula service or maybe you can't afford a midwife.  Or it's not accessible to you or maybe you don't have a lot of family or you don't have a lot of emotional support for your pregnancy.  basically what sister birth is is it's like online course.  I think it costs about $300 American.  so it's I mean like comparatively to other prenatal services it's not that much.  but I mean that's how it's all subjective.  you know whether or not something's really affordable to you but it's worth checking out the website because they have a lot of free resources too which are accessible to everyone.  Um, one of these resources is, um, this, uh, sort of printout that I, that I got.  It's called, um, seven mistakes mamas make when planning a natural birth.  And so there's, there's, there, there are the things, and then there's, you know, reading material for you to engage with.  Um, some of the mistakes are, They don't get clear on their why, like why they're doing it, meaning that when you're in the intense part of labor and it feels like you're being brought to your mental and physical limit, you need to know why you're putting yourself through this, otherwise you're just going to crack and you're gonna say, no, give me the epidural.  So having your why really sort of detailed and fleshed out is important.  They don't plan past the birth, for example.  They see birth only as a physical event.  not a mental or spiritual event.  They try to tame what is ultimately wild.  So really great handout.  They also have mental birth prep checklist in this printout, and this is totally free.  You can just print this off on their website.  The link will be down below if you wanna check that out.  There's also things like these worksheets for planning your postpartum experience.  I don't know if you can see this.  I'll just do this so you can get a little screen grab, but there'll be a link below.  basically wife are resting a little checklist things to do while you're kind of bedridden for a few weeks.  you know a little little space to say.  you know what?  what are my freezer meals gonna be like?  how am I gonna do food prep?  you know do I have a lactation consultant?  do I have a postpartum doula or midwife or nurse that can provide support?  all of these things Which, yeah, I think that's really handy.  For a person, maybe for some women this isn't useful, but for someone like me who likes to plan, I like to be prepared, I'm like low-key control freak.  I'm as calm and as centered as a control freak can possibly be.  That's my personality.  And I find these worksheets so handy.  And then the last printout that I have here is called The Five Aspects to the Best Nesting.  So for example, make a list of practical projects around the house and start checking them off.  Do a quick survey of your relationships and identify the ones that need some tending.  Feel your feelings and dump them out.  The pick yourself back up.  Walk it out with God.  These worksheets and this sister birth website is also run by a Christian lady, which I love.  She really focuses on the fact that birth isn't just physical.  It isn't just mental.  It is a spiritual event as well.  And birth is something that can bring you closer to God.  It's something that will bring you closer to God, I think.  I think a lot of women, even atheist women, experience birth as a very powerful and magical and mystical experience that it's hard to put into words based on what I've heard other women say.  And so I really like that these resources, this online one specifically and the podcast, Happy home birth.  There is a special focus on Christianity and a woman's faith, which I think that, you know, in the 11th hour when, you know, you've been laboring for ages and you're kind of in labor land, as they say, having a strong connection to God can be really helpful.  I hope that these resources will be of use to you.  I hope that all of you mamas out there who are pregnant and watching are having a great pregnancy so far.  For all of the women out there who are trying to conceive, I wish you the best of luck and many blessings for healthy little miracle babies.  If you would like to support my channel, there will be links in the description as well as links to the resources.  that I've mentioned.  So thank you so much for listening, guys.  Have a great day.  Bye. ",
