            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Tel Aviv, Israel.  Yeshua, Jesus God, came to deliver us from sin, deliver us from prison, into eternal life.  Isaiah, chapter 42, verse 7.  To open the eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison, and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.  Tehillim, Psalms, chapter 107, verse 10.  Some sat in darkness, and in the shadow of death, prisoners in misery and chains.  As believers in Yeshua, Jesus, we understand that being freed from prison is being freed from the hands of Satan into eternal life through Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus.  Luke 4, verse 18.  And we know that this Bible verse in Luke 4, verse 18 is taken from the Old Testament because everything in the Old Testament is a shadow of the new.  It's one book from Genesis to Revelation.  And we find this in the book of Isaiah, chapter 61, verse 1.  The spirit of the Lord is on me because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.  He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners.  And we know that Yeshua, Jesus, stood in the synagogue, opened the scroll, the word of God, and read this direct from the scroll, proclaiming himself to be deity, to be God.  He said, today this scripture has been fulfilled before your very eyes.  But there's something even more deep in Isaiah chapter 61 verse 1.  Something prophetic.  If we continue to read in Isaiah 61 verse 2, we can see this prophetic picture.  The Hebrew text reads like this.  To proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of our God's vengeance to comfort all who mourn.  The year of the Lord's favor is talking about the year of the Jubilee, Shnat Yovel.  And we know that the year of the Jubilee, they sounded the shofar.  And they can only sound the shofar every 50 years on that year of the favor.  So we know exactly when Yeshua proclaimed himself to be God and said, The Spirit of the Lord has come upon me today.  That is the year of the Jubilee, Shnat Yovel.  It's found in Leviticus chapter 25, verses 8 and 9.  Count off seven Sabbath years, seven times seven years, so that the seventh Sabbath year amount to a period of 49 years.  Now, we know that the biblical calendar goes from sundown to sundown.  49 years sundown is 50, the year of the Jubilee.  We continue to read verse 9, Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement, sound the trumpet throughout your land.  So based on God's calendar, which is the biblical calendar, we know exactly when Yeshua HaMashiach proclaimed, Isaiah 61, The Spirit of the Lord has come upon me.  According to the Word of God, we know that it is the year of the Jubilee, which is Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.  What a way to start his ministry.  Prophetically, it's pointing to the eternal jubilee with Yeshua HaMashiach, with Jesus forever and evermore.  To the new heavens, new earth, new Jerusalem.  And that's the prophetic picture.  That's why it's so important to be on God's biblical calendar.  Yes, we live in the world.  Yeshua said we're in the world, but we're not of the world.  We operate on a worldly calendar.  But when we're in the word of God, we need to be on God's calendar in order to see the prophetic picture, prepare ourselves for his second coming as the bride of Yeshua, Jesus.  We're not to follow rabbis.  We're not to follow tradition.  We're to follow only Jesus, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Word of God, in context.  Yeshua's coming back for the final Jubilee.  The trump will sound.  1.  Thessalonians 4, verse 16.  For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Yeshua and Christ will rise first.  But there are people in Israel and around the world that really serve time in prison.  In a spiritual prison, by not believing in Yeshua, and in a physical prison.  And many times the world doesn't have forgiveness for these kinds of people.  As they try to get back into society, society rejects them.  A few months ago, our ministry launched several campaigns in Israel, blasting the post boxes.  with Bible CDs and contact information revealing the Messianic prophecies.  An ex-convict by the name of Haim contacted the ministry.  He said, I received one of your Bible CDs.  It really touched my heart.  He said, I'm an ex-convict.  I used to be religious before I went to jail.  When I got out of the jail, everybody rejected me.  And until this day, I can't find a job.  I'm living off social security.  Because every place that I go, they read on my application that I was an ex-convict and they don't want me there.  What can your God do for me?  We told Chaim, it's everybody's God.  He's your God too.  He's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  I met Chaim in a coffee house, but he was nervous and scared that people would hear.  We came out of the coffee house and I started to share with Chaim in the streets of Tel Aviv.  Chaim told me that he was very upset and very angry that society will not forgive him.  It will not give him a second chance.  He was very touched by the Bible CD that he received in his post box.  that was sharing about God's love and God's forgiveness.  I told Chaim, we were all once prisoners and God came and freed us all.  Once you're set free, the favor of the non-believer will fall upon you.  But you need to put your trust in God.  Forgive those that are against you and God will do the rest.  Chaim said, I don't know how to do that.  I'm very angry and very upset all the time.  I don't want to live on Social Security and sleep all day.  I want to get a normal job and get back into society.  I'm only 38 years old and my life is ruined.  I told Chaim, the only way to be set free is to be set free from eternal prison.  I turned the Bible and read with Chaim, Isaiah 42, verse 7.  You will give sight to the blind and will set prisoners from the dark dungeons.  Chaim asked, how can I be set free from the eternal prison?  It was time for the full gospel.  Praise Yeshua, Jesus, the Holy Spirit was working on Chaim's life.  We went through many Bible passages, such as Deuteronomy chapter 18, verses 15 to 17.  A prophet from among your brethren, you must listen to him.  We know that that's speaking about Yeshua, Jesus.  Psalms 2, Psalms 22, Micah 5.2, Isaiah 53, and many other passages.  He finally asked me, who is this Messiah that can set me free from prison forever?  Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  He died on the tree on the cross for your sins, rose on the third day, and by his blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins and eternal life, and he can set you free from prison forever and evermore into the eternal Shnat Yovel, the eternal Jubilee.  I then turn the Bible to Isaiah 61, verse 1, and read together with Haim.  We told Chaim, do not worry about anything.  God will take care of everything.  You just repent and turn to Him.  Psalms chapter 23, verse 1.  The Lord is my shepherd.  I shall not want.  Forgive those that won't forgive you because God has already forgiven you.  All you need is to turn to him.  Chaim was touched.  We pray for his salvation.  Our ministry will continue to be in contact with him as we study the word of God together.  We pray that the power of the Holy Spirit will open his eyes and that he will be set free by Yeshua HaMashiach from the eternal prison to eternal life.  One thing is certain, Chaim will never be the same again.  When he does come into salvation, he will be a powerful testimony to others that are in prison.  And for this, we give all the glory to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Tel Aviv, Israel, in the mighty name of Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Thank you. ",
