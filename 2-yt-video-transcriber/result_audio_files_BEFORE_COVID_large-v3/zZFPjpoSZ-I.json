            "text": "Twisha Christian back with another video entitled explaining the dinar RV in terms of the amount of money that we look for as far as investment from the very very low stand.  if they remove the zeros all the way to the highest end all right.  so but before we get into that I need you guys to check out this last video one of the Kim.  come on Kim Clement 8 Wells series synchrotron and there's a company that I found dealing with Viva Biotech.  alright so you guys need to do your research.  if you live outside the United States I know here in the United States you can purchase that particular one on interactivebrokers.com.  outside of the country you guys need to follow whatever services you have in your country to look that particular stock up.  alright check out the last video.  where's your faith concerning the dinar?  And just so you guys know, it wasn't about the faith in the dinar.  It was about putting faith in God that he's going to release it.  And we tend to look at the bad news of the dinar and what's going on in our and what's going on in Iraq.  So you tend to lose faith because there have been multiple times when it should have happened.  Right.  It should have happened in 2014.  It should.  it should have happened actually way before then because they shouldn't have taken them that long.  So anyways, it was just about.  You know, just being steadfast and being settled in that.  So you can begin to look at the other wells and the other opportunities because there's going to be other opportunities that come before the dinar.  And there's going to be opportunities after the dinar revalues.  And that's where where I come in, where I'm trying to point out certain things, trying to point out certain industries and also discuss the dinar as well.  so the next thing is to up for those who are you or who are on the page Iran some of you have just given a one-time donation on the page run.  but what you need to do if you're gonna give a one-time donation I've like say 10 ten dollars is go ahead and do like the three dollars a month or whatever amount that you want to do.  so that way you stay connected because if you just give a one-time donation with actually without actually signing up you're not gonna get the information until it comes out on YouTube alright.  so Here we have, here where I talk, discuss one of the, again, which is in the video, about Viva Biotech, where I put that out a couple days beforehand.  And also another one, which I don't know how long I'm going to wait to put this on YouTube, because there are other people who sent me this information, and it's very revealing about what Kim Clement said about the company relating to BBB, right?  So that is there, by Maxine Butler, who sent me the information there.  And also, Mr.  Hanson, who who actually gave me some additional information to as well concerning that particular company, B.C.  Hanson.  All right.  And so that's just that's there.  I don't know how long I'm going to wait to do that.  So if you guys want to get in, now's the time.  to do that because eventually there's going to be more and more as the more do the research and some you guys are doing the research and then you're sending it to me for me to review it.  so for those of you have sent me things in email I'm trying to get back to everybody as fast as possible.  trust me I get tons of emails every day and I'm trying to be able to respond to each individual one so I might be anywhere from a day to five days behind.  Alright, and for those of you who have questions about where to buy Iraqi Dinar, I get those questions all the time.  This particular one is open and available on Patreon.  You don't have to sign it.  It's just right there where you can go to the public post.  It's right there.  so I don't have to keep repeating it over and over again or making comments about where I go to buy it.  I just go to this particular place because they have so many other currencies that And not just the dinar.  Some places have the dinar and then they might have like 10 other currencies.  This one has tons and tons of currencies.  So that's the reason why, because I want to be prepared.  So when when the dinar RV takes place and I can look at all the other currencies that haven't that have not changed in value, I can make my purchases immediately.  So that's that's where I'm at with that.  So also to this particular this particular BBB.  right I there's only one place where I know that you can trade it for free.  you can trade it on the other American exchanges like TD Ameritrade and fidelity but first trade I. there are zero online trade fees free online trades stocks ETFs options mutual funds.  alright as Robin Hood doesn't have this particular stock but first trade does.  I signed up with it a while ago And I didn't fund it yet, but I think now, but since this is the first stock that I could find, without having to pay a fee because once you if you buy on TD Ameritrade you're basically you know unless you get your account set up so that you can day trade basically I'm in a position on those particular sites I'm buying and holding.  so with first trade I will be able to buy this particular stock without having to pay any fees and that extra money that normally that other places do charge you you can use that money to actually invest into the stock that you're buying.  So if you're spending $100, you go to TD Ameritrade and you pay $106.75, well, guess what?  That $6.75, you can do it for free on first trade, and you actually gain a few more stocks without having to pay the fees.  All right, so that link is also down below in the description as well.  It's in the description on the Patreon post that I have.  All right, and then the next thing is, Any questions that you guys have about cryptocurrencies?  I don't have a lot.  I've studied the markets, but my focus is on something else.  I have enough cryptocurrencies right now.  I'm pretty settled in my cryptocurrencies.  I may be talking about cryptos, a couple different cryptos from time to time.  Coming up here in the near future.  But if anything, I need you to refer you to Currency365.  He does all the stuff on all the cryptos.  So you need to make sure that you're checking his crypto channel out as well as his regular channel too as well.  Okay, the first thing I'm talking about is basically on the very low end of your investment into the Iraqi Dinar.  Now keep in mind, remember guys, I'm not an investment advisor or anything like that.  you always do your research alright.  I have that at the beginning of every video so I've covered myself there but sometimes I feel like I have to say alright.  so for me I and I just use this as an estimate because some people the more usually on on the online broker the currency brokers usually I if you if you buy a lot you get more but discount.  so I'm only using this as an average Right.  So for every one thousand one hundred dollars estimate, when you turn around, you invest that money into the Iraqi dinar.  You usually get around one million dinar.  So the one thousand one hundred that includes like your fees, your shipping and and all that other stuff.  Right.  So that's just the estimate.  So what is the CBI?  You know, one of the things that CBI said that they're going to do is that they're going to remove the zeros.  Right.  So your twenty five thousand dollar note.  would be worth 25 dinar.  In order for them to do that, the value basically would have to be 1 USD to 1 dinar.  So if they remove the zeros and they change the value from 1 USD to 1 dinar, your $1,100 that you spent for your million dinars will be equal to 1,000 USD.  All right, so you actually would have lost money because of the extra money that you put in for your shipping and what other fees that come along with that.  So really here at this point, if they were to drop the zeros, put the value at one USD to one dinar, then your one million dinar is worth one thousand dollars.  So you haven't made any money yet right now.  The next step is if they drop the zeros and revalue to $3.20, which is the old rate, and I'm just using that as an example, it may be $3.23, but that's the old rate.  You see, now your investment is now $3,200.  So even if they cut the zeros and they revalue one to one, okay, yeah, you've lost some money, unless you got some really good deals on your denar.  But if they drop the zeros... And they revalued to $3.20, the old rate.  Well, now your investment is $3,200.  Well, you still made some money.  But see, that's not what we hope.  That's not what we see.  And that's not what we've seen in the plans for a very long time.  And I've discussed it.  And Currency365 has discussed it.  Benny and other people have discussed that we are looking for the bigger return.  So this is just... These are just some of the possibilities that would happen if they dropped the zeros.  So all we do is just we hope that it's more than them dropping the zeros and them going back to the old rate.  So that's what we all hope to move past this.  Now, people have made money off dinars.  Now, if you bought a whole lot of dinars in 2004 when they first released it, I and then you turn around in 10 years later you sold it all you basically doubled your money.  you almost doubled your money.  so for those people who say that people are gonna make any money off the Iraqi dinar people already have because of what the old exchange rate was before.  right.  so you know a lot of people didn't see that.  so people have made money trading the dinar because they they were got in 2004 2005 and they bought a bunch a currency And they were able to sell it when the rate went down as it did to where it's at now.  And they were able to make money.  All right.  So nobody can argue that people won't make any money because people have made money already.  So we hope that even if they go to the old rate, that it's not the 3,200.  All right.  And so this is where we hope that things happen, right?  For every 1,100, the estimate, her 1 million dinar.  if they don't drop the zeros and value 1 USD to 1 dinar your 1 million dinar is equal to 1 million USD.  so right sounds impossible right but guess what if you invested one thousand one hundred dollars in the Bitcoin in 2011 12 or 13 or even or even in some of the other cryptocurrencies that were less than a penny you would be a multi-millionaire now.  so you can't laugh at at this prospect that 1 million dinar will never equal to 1 million USD.  because look at Bitcoin look at all the crypto.  look at all the trillions of dollars that were made in the in the cryptocurrency markets right so you can't laugh at that now.  if they reinstate the old rate without dropping the zeros and they do the rate of three dollars and twenty cents your 1 million dinar will be worth 3.2 million USD.  So that's what we actually look for.  We're actually looking for the bigger pie.  We're looking for the 1 to 1 or we're looking for the 3 to 1.  Other people have said 5 to 1.  I've said it because it's what I saw in my dream or vision that I had when the dinar were valued but it only stayed up there for a couple days.  So that's why I'm not trading in all my dinars because if that value, for some whatever reason, goes up from there, then I would be able to do that.  And we don't know if they're going to go one-to-one and then go three-to-one.  It sounds like it would be kind of a fluctuation thing.  So we all have to be careful when it comes into the exchange because we don't know exactly how they're going to do it.  So we don't know if, you know, I've always heard a one to one in country and then outside of the country, it'll be a three to one.  I don't know that it'll be the CBI who makes its rules.  Right.  And what can be done.  So but that is kind of explaining the short end.  Right.  If if if they change the value beforehand, if they remove the zeros and they keep it a one to one, we all.  you know we don't make any money.  some people will because maybe they saved some money buying a whole lot of dinar but not they won't make very much.  but if they slash the zeros and they add in the old rate yes you will make a little bit of money but not as much as we would hope.  and that's not what i'm looking for.  okay because everything that we've discussed on the channel all the articles that we've discussed the prophecies Everything that you can think of that we've discussed on this channel says that it's going to be way, way more than that.  So that's what we hope.  What we see is them not dropping the zeros and your $25,000 note that you have will be worth $25,000 USD.  And that's why I say this to me.  When we look at the global currency reset, Kim Clement didn't really mention any other currencies.  that but the dinar and i think it is.  when it comes to this this is probably the better investment out of any other currency.  so i'm using this currency after the global reset to see what other currencies have not changed in value.  so when you're doing your although when you're doing the math and you're trying to figure out you've made a lot of promises and this is what i mean by you know you got to figure out Because you got to remember, you got to subtract the taxes out of all this.  So if you just have a million dinar and it goes one to one and you decide to turn in, you know, you got to pay taxes out of that, you know.  And we hope for the old rate, right?  We hope for the reinstatement of the old rate.  And if that happens without them dropping the zeros, then you're looking at 3.2 million for your million dinars, right?  It's still less than Bitcoin, right?  People invested in Bitcoin who invest eleven hundred dollars, they gain well more than three point two million dollars.  Right.  So it is possible because we've seen it in other industries that people can make a lot of money with little investment.  Right.  So nobody can argue that.  All right, guys, I have a lot more videos coming.  I got more videos coming on Kim Clement's eight wells.  We're going to be discussing gold, silver.  I'm going to be combining some of Kim Clement's prophecies concerning the gold along with Mr.  Charlie and his prophecies.  We're going to be doing some.  I'm going to be doing other videos on Firepoint D and looking at that.  These are all wells.  Zion oil is another well.  And just to show you on one of my accounts, on some of the stocks that I am invested in, some of these stocks I have not sold yet because they came from referrals.  The ones that we're looking at that I saw some kind of value in, of course, is Zion Oil and Gas.  And they're saying that once they do find the oil, that once they find some oil and gas, the stock is going to skyrocket to like $100 a share.  That's just speculation.  So then you have Canberra Energy, which is the same way.  Comstock Mining, they do mining of minerals.  It's just a penny stock.  These are the ones that I researched to make sure that they didn't have any pending reverse splits that would hurt later on.  These are the ones that I am looking at.  That's LODE, CEI, and Zion Oil.  And so that's where I'm at as far as those three.  You guys need to do your research and look further into it.  And if you guys see anything, let me know.  So other than that, don't forget about the Patreon.  Make sure you get signed up.  And also, too, guys, don't forget to go and check out the other videos.  Make sure that if you have any questions, please go through my old videos.  Search through from the very beginning.  A lot of questions you guys have.  either me or him have answered those questions.  All right.  I'm going to try to get to your emails, to everybody's emails and everybody's comments as soon as I can.  And I appreciate you guys support.  And thank you for watching.  Twisted Christian out. ",
