            "text": "Shalom.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Jerusalem, Israel.  We're living in prophetic times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates.  We're not date setters.  But we know that the time is near.  The veil is being lifted in Israel and around the world.  2 Corinthians 3, verse 16.  The Bible says that the scepter will not depart from Judah.  We know that that's speaking about the lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, who's coming back soon to take back everything that the enemy has stolen.  as king of kings and lord of lords.  Bereshit, Genesis, chapter 49, verse 10.  The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come, and the obedience of the nations shall be his.  This is speaking about Jesus Yeshua.  This is speaking about the nations grafted into spiritual Israel, the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Our ministry, Messiah of Israel Ministries, began our week in prayer and began sharing the line of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, all through the Holy Land.  The results were amazing.  We give all the glory to Jesus Yeshua.  Many, many people were excited to hear the truth.  Several Jews got saved during this period of time.  As the team were praying, and I was sharing many, Genesis chapter 49, verse 10, and other Bible passages, An orthodox man by the name of David who's studying to be a rabbi was walking in the streets with his children.  He heard me sharing about the scepter and Judah and asked me, who is this scepter of Judah speaking about?  Are you studying the Talmud?  The Talmud are rabbinic books written by rabbis, not under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Ruach HaKodesh.  That's what he was asking me.  He said, I'm on the way to the synagogue to study Gemara.  My children will stay with their mother.  Would you like to come and join me?  I told David, I don't study the Gemara.  I study only the written word of God.  He was fascinated by my answer.  As you can see, he has the Gemara in his hand, and he's reading the written word of God with me.  Praise Yeshua.  I then turned the Bible to the book of Genesis, chapter 49, verse 10, and read together with David.  The scepter will not depart from Judah.  for the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come, and the obedience of the nations shall be his.  He asked me, Who is this speaking about?  I then asked David with love and compassion, Who is from the line of the tribe of Judah?  He answered me, King David.  I said, Let's turn to the book of Psalms and see what King David writes.  We turn our Bible to the book of Tehillim, Psalms chapter 45, verse 6.  Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever.  A scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.  I then turn the Bible to Psalms chapter 93, verse 2.  Your throne was established long ago.  You are from eternity.  I explained to David, as you can see, this is talking from the one that comes from the line of Judah, from the line of King David, the Eternal One, the Messiah.  He must come from the line of the tribe of Judah.  But notice here it says nations, I told David.  It's speaking about all the nations grafted into Israel.  This is the biblical truth.  David was getting nervous.  His kids were all there.  It was time for the full gospel.  I told David, this king has already come and he's coming back again.  With fire in his eyes.  And until that time when he returns.  And no one knows when that day is.  God is giving an opportunity to Israel.  And to the nations to repent and turn to him.  Psalms 2.6.  I have installed my king on Zion.  Upon my holy hill.  David then turned to me and asked, what does it say that God will establish the line forever from the throne of David?  I turned my Bible to the book of Psalms, chapter 89, verse 29.  I will establish his line forever, his throne, as long as the heavens endure.  At that moment, something supernatural happened.  The people were listening around.  A man by the name of Yossi came over and got into the conversation and asked, I overheard you speaking.  I want to know who this Messiah is and when he's coming.  I turned to Yossi and to David and said, he came, died on the cross for our sins, rose on the third day, and by his blood, if we repent and believe, we have eternal life.  And he's coming back to rule and reign because his kingdom is forever.  David and Yossi were both speechless.  Yossi then asked me, I then quoted Psalms 27 verse 1.  The Lord is my light and my salvation.  Whom shall I fear?  The Lord is my stronghold of my life.  Of whom shall I be afraid?  And the word for salvation there in Hebrew is the word Yeshua.  So what I was really telling them in Hebrew is, The Lord is my light and my Yeshua.  Whom shall I fear?  Something supernatural happened at that moment.  Yossi left the conversation.  We pray for his salvation.  David and his children were standing there.  He couldn't move.  I told David to seek the word of God, seek the truth, and he'll be set free.  I told him he doesn't need the Gemara book, rabbinic books.  You need only the written word of God.  Only the Lord is my Yeshua.  That's all you need, and God will protect you, and God will bless you.  He left the conversation.  One thing is certain, David and Yossi and all those listening will never be the same again.  And for this we give all the glory to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Al Yehuda, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
