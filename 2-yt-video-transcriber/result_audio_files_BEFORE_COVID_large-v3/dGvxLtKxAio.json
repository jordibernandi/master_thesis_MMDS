This is the test you must pass to take your next step into the Navy. ",

They must pass battle stations with at least an 80% to actually carry on and go forward in their training throughout the Navy.  Validations are approximately 12 hours long.  There's 17 scenarios that the recruits will go through, all the way from watch standing to firefighting to basic damage control and ensuring that they have what it is to be a basically trained sailor in the United States Navy.  In the beginning of the night, it's more or less calm.  And then once we actually go into our general quarters scenarios, it's a lot louder.  The lights are going off.  There's a lot of smoke.  And that's really when the recruits get that stress factor.  And we can actually really test to see if they have that toughness, what it takes to be a United States sailor.  We've just taken our first missile strike on board USS Trayer.  We have recruits going through multiple scenarios right now.  Some are saving the ship from flooding, some are combating fire.  I remember when I got here, I wasn't sure if I was made for all of the trials that were to come.  Now that everything's been finished, I realize this is what it means to be in the Navy.  In the morning when you walk off this ship to line up with your division to receive your Navy ball cap, you have shown to us and to the United States Navy that you have met the standards. ",
