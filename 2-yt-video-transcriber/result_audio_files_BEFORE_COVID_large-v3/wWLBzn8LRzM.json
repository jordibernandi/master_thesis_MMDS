            "text": "All right, Wright's Crispy here in Louisville, Kentucky.  I just was driving to our hotel and found a nest.  So I'm going to conduct a little cop watch, find out who's playing.  at the Kentucky Expo Center.  I think it's Guns N' Roses, but we'll find out.  Here's the nest.  Look at all these guys.  Hey.  No.  We're right by the airport.  Hey, what concert are they having there?  What?  There's a concert going on, right?  Louder Than Life.  Louder Than Life, okay.  I heard Guns N' Roses.  Guns N' Roses will be there later.  Oh, okay.  Really good, man.  Right on.  You got tickets to get in?  No, no.  I'm actually just cop watching.  Okay, man.  What's up, buddy?  Right on.  Check my YouTube channel out, Rights Crispy.  You guys have an Instagram you want to shout out or anything?  What is it?  KSamson9999, I think.  KSamson9991.  All right.  And check me out, Rights Crispy.  Rights Crispy.  Like, know your rights.  All right, man.  Right on.  Thank you, bud.  Take care.  Keep watching us.  hop, dude.  All right, brother.  Thanks.  Yeah, I found a nest of them right over there.  Go right around the back and hop up.  All right.  Thank you.  So these guys got license plate readers all around them.  All three of these vehicles are running.  4640.  947YAH.  and D5524.  Sir, you know where any of these officers are?  Yeah, those cars are running.  Right, there's no one in any of those cars.  Yeah.  Well, those cars are running.  No.  Other than the cars running.  They can do pretty much what they want.  No, they can't.  That's our taxpayer dollars.  They can do whatever they want.  No, they can't.  They're police officers.  They can do pretty much what they want.  No, they can't.  They're our public servants.  They can do way more than you can do.  No, they can't.  Okay.  No, we the people... Okay, okay, I'm done.  We the people have more rights than they do.  Okay.  They have the same amount of rights.  No, actually, when you have a badge on... When you have a badge on, you have less rights.  They don't have freedom of speech like we do.  Sure.  I'll take off.  I'm taking off.  I'm leaving.  Got a couple of cop suckers.  Cop suckers.  I'm leaving.  I'm trying to get them to shut off those cars.  They're running.  It's called accountability.  I do.  And so do 4,000 people watching.  I can't think of anything better than defending the Constitution of the United States.  What's your name?  Okay, you're going to be famous.  We got a couple of cop suckers here.  Sucking on cops.  He said they could do whatever they want.  They're the police.  See, that's the problem with this country.  These cars are blocking each other, so there's no tactical reason why these cars should be on and running.  I wonder if they paid $20 or if they got it for free.  There he is.  Copyright infringement.  Copyright infringement.  Copyright infringement.  There.  That's my own original.  There's one of the guys.  He's upset with me.  Is that your IQ on a number of your friends before your fish died?  You're number one, cop sucker.  He sucks on cops.  There you are.  Hey, why are these cars running?  All right, I'll be right there.  There's the nest.  All right, we're going to race across the street.  They're waiting for me right here.  Let's do this.  Ready?  Ready?  Let's go.  keep them on their toes like a midget at a urinal.  I'll be right there.  They are eagerly awaiting my arrival.  Are they going to break it up?  Ah, come on.  I said wait.  Look at them like roaches, like cockroaches.  He's going to stick around.  Hey, hang on!  677VOC.  They're not getting away that easy.  Hey, wait!  Hey!  Hey!  These cops are going to make me chase them down.  What can I help you with, sir?  Yes, please, can you give me those cops' name and badge number, please?  I don't know who they are at this point.  What can I help you with?  677-VOC.  What can I help you with, sir?  I wanted their names and badge numbers.  For what reason, sir?  I'd like to file a complaint.  For what, sir?  Denial of service, but I'll do that.  For what, sir?  At your station.  Okay, for what?  What's your name, ma'am?  I'm Lieutenant Patty Hannifin.  Lieutenant, and you have some supervisor authority over them?  Yes.  Now, do you think it's good to scatter like roaches?  They're actually going back to their poles.  Are they?  Yes.  How come those three vehicles are on?  Well, one is scanning license plate readers.  That is correct.  You know about the Fourth Amendment of the United States?  Listen, listen.  The other has food in it for the other post.  Right on.  And the other one has... We all got to eat.  Excuse me?  We all have to eat.  So that is why the car is running, not to mention the fact that it's very hot outside.  Okay.  Well, license plate reading... And I called them over here so that we could strategize on what's going to happen at the end of the evening.  Okay.  Who's that concert?  Louder Than Life.  Louder Than Life?  Yes.  I don't know.  I'm from Florida.  So that's what we're doing right now.  Okay.  Okay.  You have a good night, okay?  Well, I'm not done.  I was going to ask you if you know about the Fourth Amendment in the United States.  Okay.  I'm going to tell you.  You have a good night.  Okay?  Because I've got business to tend to.  Well, my question.  You have a good night.  I have a question.  You have a good night.  Lieutenant.  Fourth Amendment.  License plate reading is illegal.  409POV.  Gotcha.  They made me work for it.  Same!  She really made me run after her.  Look at that.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  We don't know.  if there's shuttles that'll be around.  that'll run us up there.  I don't know.  Not from here.  Oh, okay.  Think so.  Have fun. ",
