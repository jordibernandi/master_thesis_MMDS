Hey, man, you can't be doing that shit.  Hey, you can watch your fucking mouth with me, dude.  We can go toe-to-toe in here, man.  What's up?  Get the fuck up and do it then.  First of all, he's the nighttime manager.  I don't give a fuck who he is.  He's bashing people head into the fucking floor.  That's just not happening.  You can report that back there.  Man, quit fighting, please.  I am, because I'm pressing charges.  Well, the police are coming, so you just need to quit fighting, okay?  Let him go.  Let him go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Don't reach underneath you, okay?  I can reach underneath me because he got my stuff balled up.  Well, it's just not a good idea right now, okay?  Wait till the police get here.  Yeah, because I'm pressing charge.  He had no reason to bring my head and boot this fucker.  I just picked him down.  You're the one that was resisting.  And I told you not to.  But you didn't have to bang my head against the floor.  I told you not to resist, and I was going to take you down, and you were going to get hurt.  And what did you do?  I didn't get hurt.  You banged my head down.  You just would have stood there and stopped fighting with us.  We would have been all right.  Are you threatening me, sir?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did do that, officer.  Yeah, he's going to go back in right there.  Thank you.  The lights on. ",
