            "text": "I think it's so farcical that I barely even read the reports.  It's a joke.  I mean, if there was, first of all, if there was any interference by the Russians, it's essentially undetectable.  There are careful analyses of what happened in the elections.  You can see how it changed, how the money poured in, all sorts of things.  There's no sign of any Russian effect.  Furthermore, it's just almost incredible from the beginning.  I mean, what happened in the Senate and the House in 2016?  Did the Russians interfere in the Senate elections?  It went exactly the same way.  Furthermore, the whole thing is a bad joke for all sorts of reasons.  For one thing, there are countries that do interfere in American elections openly, publicly, forcefully.  One of them even sent its prime minister to address a joint session of Congress to attack the initiative being taken by the sitting president.  Is that interference?  That was Benjamin Netanyahu, and that's only one part of it.  I mean, that's large-scale, massive interference.  Any other country did that, we'd have a huge scandal.  Furthermore, does the US interfere in elections?  In Russia, for example?  Yes, and proudly.  In 1996, Clinton took pride in the fact that large-scale U.S.  interference in the Russian election swung it to his favorite, Boris Yeltsin.  The U.S.  goes way beyond interfering in elections.  It overthrows governments.  I don't have to go through the history.  So talk about Russian interference is simply a joke.  Furthermore, the whole discussion is completely beside the point.  There is massive interference in U.S.  elections.  from the U.S.  corporate sector who pretty much buy the elections.  There's extensive research.  Tom Ferguson's is by far the best.  It's very extensive, shows very convincingly that you can predict the outcome of an American election in Congress and executive with remarkable precision simply by looking at the single variable of campaign funding.  And that's just the beginning.  Ferguson's analysis goes right through.  2016, includes Congress.  This goes back a long time.  Of course, it's picked up a lot under the opening of the floodgates by the reactionary Supreme Court, but it goes back to the 19th century.  Is that interference in elections?  And that's the bare beginning.  Since the 1970s, when the neoliberal assault began, the number of lobbyists in Congress has just skyrocketed.  A normal representative in Congress may spend several hours a day just talking to donors to try to get funds for the next election so he has a chance of running.  Meanwhile, the lobbyists are meeting with his staff bringing all of their huge resources, which of course overwhelm the staff, and pretty much writing the legislation.  Is that interference with elections?  I mean, what's being discussed is not even a joke.  The election system is deeply corrupted right at its core in many ways. ",
