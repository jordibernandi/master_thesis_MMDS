It's a story about how public officials and sheriffs and police violate an independent news journalist's right to film in public.  Would you like to be part of that story?  No.  Okay.  Well, then I suggest you just let me continue doing what I'm doing and don't bother me anymore.  I'm not bothering you.  I asked you a question.  Well, I answered it.  Okay.  So we're all good?  Go ahead.  What's that?  Go ahead.  Yeah, okay.  Well, now you're going to be the story.  if you're just going to stay there and try to intimidate me.  You try to intimidate me.  Well, then go back in.  Is there a point to you just staring at me?  I'm just watching you.  I know.  What's the point of watching you?  Don't you have anything else to do?  It's public.  I can Yeah, but don't you have a regular job to do?  rather than just stare at me while I'm exercising a First Amendment right to do a legal activity?  Why don't you go out and fight crime?  Do something that's commendable for the community.  Don't bother me.  I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.  Pardon me?  I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.  You're supposed to be just watching me while I film in a public lobby?  I'm taking care of business in my public lobby.  What business is that?  Asking questions.  Well, you've asked the questions and I've answered.  Okay, so go ahead and do what you're doing.  Okay, and your point of what?  Of just going to watch me?  What's your name and badge number, officer?  Go ahead and do what you're doing.  I asked you a question.  Are you refusing to give your name and badge number?  No, you can see my name.  Is that what you tell the judge?  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  Hi, guys.  How y'all doing?  How y'all doing?  I'm doing pretty good.  Good.  The Navy called us.  They were concerned with you videotaping the airfield here.  Well, I'm just on a public sidewalk.  I'm allowed to do it.  Okay.  There's no broken laws.  I don't know why they're all upset.  Okay, did they come out and talk to you?  No, they just yelled at us.  Did they?  Yep, they just yelled, and I get yelled a lot.  Yeah, anything on that blue line right there, that way is private property.  It's military property.  It's military property, yes.  Unless you're military, you're not allowed on there.  Well, we never went on there.  We've been on here, and they just yell.  Everybody yells at me.  Well, you didn't call me.  Everybody's yelling at me.  I don't appreciate the yelling.  If I wanted yelling, I could stay at home.  We're not here to break any laws.  Could you do me a favor when you leave?  Just put on your siren.  I love it when I hear it going, oh.  Yeah, so just so you guys know.  Okay, can I finish talking, please?  What did you just say?  Okay, very good.  Very mature of you.  By the way, this is public property.  As long as you're not blocking a sidewalk and people can go by you, okay, then you're fine.  You pass that blue line, then you're with the military, okay?  I may be missing a chromosome, but I don't swear.  Oh, well, I'll leave you alone if you're missing a chromosome.  Thank you.  You have a good day.  Remember, our founding fathers, Albert Einstein said, give me liberty or give me a chocolate bar, and I want liberty.  So if we go... Listen, listen.  Don't talk to me like that.  Hey, if you walk in there... Don't talk to me in my ear like that.  Hey, do you want to go to jail?  Do you want to go to jail?  Listen, we're giving you a choice right now.  If you guys want to leave, like I told you, you're welcome to put your camera away and then come back.  Okay, well, we're out.  We're out.  You can let him go.  Finley, Finley, what's your badge number, brother?  Can you please take over this situation right here, man?  He's hurting me.  He was the first one here.  I'm just telling you what I see.  Okay, but can you, can you, can you?  1439, you have it right there.  I can't see.  I've got a vision impairment.  Okay, you guys said you'll escort us off the property, right?  Can we do that, man?  Yeah, if you guys want to go put your cameras in your vehicle.  Okay, man, that's fine, but you're about to break my arm, man.  There's no need for that.  Go put your cameras in your vehicle.  Officer, what's your name and badge number, please?  So, what are you guys going to do?  What's your name and badge number?  Walter.  8-6-3.  Thank you.  You don't know the situation here?  Look, I'll get off the property, dude.  He's in charge.  He's the first responder.  I do what he says.  So are you going to allow him to violate my rights this way?  No, he's telling you what to do.  And I agreed that I would do it.  What are you going to do then?  You didn't agree to anything.  I told you that I would get off the property and call my attorney.  After you told me, I'll do it.  He just told you that right now.  Are you guys going to leave?  He just told you that right now.  Yes or no?  He just told you that right now.  Yes, yes, yes.  Is that a yes or no from you?  You heard him.  Yes.  From you, though.  I'm asking from you.  Yeah.  Yes.  I already answered, dude.  Don't make me spell it out.  Okay.  What?  Fucking move?  What?  Swearing now?  Do you have a card?  We don't have cards.  Our department doesn't issue them to us.  You guys not have anything better to do today?  You don't got anything better to do today?  No, I did until I had to come over here.  I did until I had to come over here.  That made no sense.  That made no sense.  Like I said, you guys can't film this way.  Well, not only is this an aggressive individual, but he's highly uneducated and is a disgrace to be even in law enforcement.  He has now told us that we cannot record in the direction of the courthouse, even when we're standing on the sidewalk.  Like I said, we can film this way.  Do you want to go to jail?  For what?  Like I told you, you cannot... What am I going to jail for?  You cannot record in there or in that direction.  You're going to take me to jail right now?  For what?  Here I am.  I'm on a sidewalk.  Stay away, man.  I'm on a sidewalk.  I'm going to film my outside as much as I want.  Are either of you on probation or parole today?  Are you?  Are you on probation?  That is a lawful ask.  You can't even speak, man.  Are you on probation or parole?  Are you on probation or parole?  I'm asking you a question.  I'm asking you a question.  If you do not answer, this is your last time.  If you do not answer me, I'm going to place you in handcuffs until I can run you and make sure that you are not on probation or parole.  Put me in handcuffs if I don't answer him if I'm on probation or parole.  Do either of you have identification on you?  Do either of you have identification?  Don't say nothing else, bro.  Don't say nothing else to this guy.  You're just a tyrant, dude.  All you guys are going to be in Portland at the right date.  It's because people get burned under the camera or whatever.  It's not our fault, bro.  Listen, like I told you, it's not that they're paranoid.  Don't interrupt him.  Don't interrupt him.  It's not that they're paranoid.  Don't interrupt him.  Don't interrupt him.  Don't snap your fingers.  Go dance.  What are you doing, dancing?  Like I said.  Get him away from us.  Can you take him over here so I can speak to Officer Walters for a minute?  He is the first one that responded.  Like I said, listen to me.  No, we're not listening to you.  We're not listening to you.  Then we'll keep walking until you guys are off.  Off what?  Like I told you.  Off what?  Now you want to listen.  We're on public property.  Like I told you.  We're not listening to you.  I said, not everybody is paranoid.  It is the presiding judge that does not want cameras in.  It doesn't matter what he wants.  We know the law.  We're on a sidewalk and you're threatening to arrest me.  So I didn't answer your question.  You haven't arrested me.  You want me to arrest you?  No, no, no.  Am I being detained?  Am I being detained?  I told you guys were free to leave.  You're the one that told me.  Bad cops like that give good cops a bad name.  That's real shit, man.  You have your right to think whatever you want.  No, I can't.  He was the first one that responded.  I'm his backup.  I don't know what transpired before that, so I'm not going to step on his toes.  He was the first one here.  Do you want a copy of the rules or not?  You want the copy?  I don't want it.  This guy right here, man, check it out.  This guy right here, you guys need to train this guy because he tried to break my arm.  And check it out, the way he was, and we got it on camera, okay?  We're going to file a fucking formal complaint, okay?  And check it out.  This guy right here, the way he was doing, he was trying to get a reaction out of me so that I could resist, so that he could fuck my arm and hurt me.  This guy right here, this makes you all.  This guy gives you all a bad name.  And this guy right here.  You can't, listen, you can't come.  We have 340 people watching right now, live, okay?  And I'm going to get about 40, 50, 60,000 views on this, okay?  You guys are going to get calls, bro.  So, Sergeant Murillo, when I'm on this public sidewalk and I came out here, he told me we're still on that property.  Is that correct or wrong?  If you're on the sidewalk, you're not on the property.  If I'm not on the sidewalk?  If you are on the sidewalk, you're not on the property.  Right.  What did you tell me?  I said get off.  You said I was on the sidewalk and this is your property.  We're not here to argue.  If you guys have a formal complaint to this, you can do it.  Well, you better get a guy that knows what he's talking about.  Do I have to ID myself whether I'm probation or parole?  if I'm not?  If you're on the property?  No, right now, on a sidewalk.  Oh, no.  Not on the sidewalk.  He told me he was going to put me in handcuffs if I didn't tell him whether I'm probation or parole.  I said until I can find out and run you.  You can't do that.  I'm not going to debate this.  You can't do that.  No, you're not going to debate it?  Why don't you tell him he's giving me bullshit threats?  We're not.  Huh?  Threatening to me.  Threatening that he's going to put me in cuffs until he can verify whether I'm probation or parole.  Does he have a legal right to do that?  Are you familiar with our intel?  No, answer my question.  Answer my question.  I'm not going to answer that question.  Go to a ranch.  Go f*** off.  We're filing a complaint.  What's that?  Can I help you?  No, thanks.  I don't need no help.  All right.  What are you recording?  Well, right now, you.  I don't need you to record me or anything on the center.  It's actually illegal to record the center.  Well, you walked up to me.  I'm on a public sidewalk.  I know.  Yeah, well, if you know, then that's legal what I'm doing.  I didn't say you're illegal where you're standing.  I said it's illegal what you're recording.  No, it isn't.  It is.  No, it isn't.  We can have you removed if you like.  Okay, have me removed.  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  What are you, some tough guy or something?  I could be if you want me to.  Really?  Yeah.  You're making a threat?  Yeah.  You're making a threat, huh?  Yeah.  You're a tough guy, huh?  You're the tough guy.  I'm on a public sidewalk.  All I ask you to do is stop recording this center.  I don't need to.  No, no.  You can't do that?  No, I can't.  All right, then sit tight.  No, you sit tight, dude.  You sit tight, dude.  Yeah, tough guy, making a threat, you're going to have me removed?  Yeah, you're going to have me removed.  Yeah.  Stay right there.  No, you stay right there.  Stay right there.  Don't give me barking orders.  Stay right there.  Oh, yeah, now calling me names?  What are you doing here?  Well, right now, I'm talking to you.  Find something else to do.  Why don't you find something else to do?  Because I work here.  Well, that's great.  And policy on the center is we don't need people recording the center.  Okay, that's... So what the fuck are you doing here?  recording the center?  First of all, that's your policy.  That's not a law.  I never said anything about a law.  Well, that's what we go by.  When did I say a law?  I'm telling you it's a law, that I can film what I see in public.  Show me the law.  Where you can film wherever you want.  It's a First Amendment.  protected activity.  Yeah, man.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Okay, sit tight.  Sit tight.  Bring me a seat, man.  Fucking asshole, man.  Tough guy, huh?  I'm on this public sidewalk.  Yes, sir.  I'm filming.  Okay.  I'm filming, and they've got this security guy.  He's highly aggressive.  Sure, sure.  Do you know him?  I don't know him.  Have you had complaints about him?  No, but I've dealt with him.  I told him he's a bad representation for the Job Corps.  We don't want you filming here.  I said, well, I'm on a public sidewalk, sir.  Yes, sir.  Hi.  Are you part of this, or?  No, no.  Let me finish with him, and I'll deal with you if you don't mind.  Yeah, I just had a report.  Oh, oh.  I'll take it.  You want to turn it in?  Yeah.  Got it.  I'll take care of it.  I thought I could do it here.  Yes, sir.  I got it.  Thank you.  He says, we don't want you filming here.  It's policy.  I said, well, policy doesn't trump the law.  True.  You know, this is a publicly accessible area.  Correct.  And he says, well, who's talking about law?  So at this point, he's just irrational.  He threatened physical violence on me.  He says, wait till I come out here.  Okay.  And... There we have it.  Is that the gentleman right there, just curious?  Tall male, black, in a nice dress?  No, no, no.  I had no encounter with him.  He appears to be the supervisor.  Yes, he is the supervisor.  That's the one I deal with.  Right, right.  So this guy, he's got a lot of rage.  Sounds like it.  And for him to come out and talk to me that way and then threaten violence, I told him, wait till the cops come because they'll educate you about how dumb you are.  True.  Got it.  I think the supervisor has already done the educating.  How you doing?  How you doing?  So who's the supervisor?  One of these guys who we educated?  No, the supervisor for the Job Corps.  You're at the Job Corps, and you had to complain with the security guard.  The gentleman I just pointed out in the nice dress shirt, the tall male black, he's kind of the supervisor of security.  Well, he's the one that called to make the complaint.  Yes, correct.  So has any LEO informed him about public access?  He will be edumacated, yes.  Edumacated, okay.  I just told him.  Yep, there you go.  Okay, D. Adams.  All right, Officer Adams, you told them that... You're allowed to film.  I think I'm going to... I think I've got to make a complaint with the job board.  They should not have this guy dealing with the public.  That is your right, sir.  Anything else we can do for you?  No, just stay safe.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  All right, have a good day.  Okay, you guys have a good day, too.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What's that?  It's a video.  No video?  Are you sure?  Are you sure?  I don't think you're sure, ma'am.  No, security, they just already called security and, you know, everything's fine.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  What's that?  Suppose you're a terrorist.  I'm not taking pictures of you.  Right, and it's perfectly legal.  Right, it's a wonderful, it's great architecture in this building.  Oh, I'm glad you agree with me.  A nutcase?  Oh, okay.  Those are big words for you, but I'll let it go.  You want a good picture?  Don't touch me.  It's battery.  What are you doing with that?  Are you okay, sir?  I'm fine.  You're the whack job.  Step back.  You're in my personal space.  Excuse me?  Step back, sir.  You got that?  You're in my personal space.  You walked up to me, sir.  I'm not touching you.  You're spitting on me.  I'm not touching you.  I'm going to defend myself, sir.  Step back!  Go ahead, defend yourself.  Don't threaten me.  I'm not.  Jesus Christ.  Get out of my space, man.  What the hell?  You come in here.  You walked up to me.  Get away from me.  You come in here.  Stay away from me.  I have a right to come in here, sir.  I have a right to stand right here.  Not in my personal space.  What's your personal space?  This is too close.  Get away.  Get him away from me, sir. ",
