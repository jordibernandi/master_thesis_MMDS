The size of our greatness is measured by the size of our valley.  Okay, we can all go home now.  That's a good word.  There's greatness on you.  There's greatness in you.  There's potential in you.  There's something special on you.  There's something great on your life.  You're made for amazing things.  You're made for incredible things.  You're not made to just get by.  You're not made to just live day to day.  You're not made to just work a job, come home, go to bed, wake up and do it the next day.  There's something special on your life. ",

But I want to get this video out, so I ask the question to begin with, who doesn't want to hear that they're special?  Now, that was Pastor Brenton Stanley of Atmosphere Church in Marietta, California, preaching, believe it or not, on the vision of the Valley of Dry Bones found in Ezekiel 37.  Now, I'm not trying to be mean-spirited, but with all due respect to Brenton, This could be one of the top 10 worst sermons I have ever reviewed.  The church's website says this about their pastor, and I quote, Pastor Brenton has completed seminary and holds a ministerial credentials as licensed minister since 2008.  Now, my first question is, what seminary would that be exactly?  And second, grammar check?  Brenton does a little intro before his sermon, and then he says this. ",

Now, this is prophetic.  It is apocalyptic literature, but it was really happening at the time.  And remember, we're seeing Word, God's Word, and the Spirit active here.  Verses 11 through 14 will tell us what is understood by the dry bones in this vision.  Now, is it a fallen army?  No, we're told it's the entire house of Israel.  It's a period of despair under the Babylonian captivity for the people of Israel.  They have no more temple, no more sacrifices, no glory of God in the Holy of Holies.  The promise of this vision is the coming back to life of God's people.  Verse 11 is a promise to Ezekiel and then the preaching.  in verses 12 through 14 It's the word of God to his people.  You could overlay Romans chapter 8 and also John 3, the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus.  You see, our flesh, the part that is our humanity, which has fallen, that is the part that needs to come to life.  Because apart from the grace of God, we are dead in our trespasses and sins.  And remember, those who live in line with our fallen humanity, or the flesh, will reap from our fallen humanity, or the flesh.  Those who live according to the Spirit who gives life will live.  Remember, the flesh cannot respond to God any more than the dry bones can come back together, take on flesh, and live all by themselves.  It is the Spirit that gives life.  The flesh counts for nothing.  Spirit-enabled conversion is life-transforming.  It is the new birth, which, although it's something not visible, is just like the wind that Jesus spoke about in John 3.  You can't see the wind itself, but you certainly can see its effects.  Just look at a tree.  It is the doctrine of election that gives life to evangelism, folks.  God uses the word preached and the power of the Spirit to bring these dead bones back to life.  Remember, we're saved by the person and work of Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity who took on flesh 2,000 years ago.  And we are saved also by the regenerating power of God, the Holy Spirit, who enables us to believe that good news, which is a requirement to be saved.  And one other quick point here.  This passage of the dry bones has been misused by Christian Zionists and some dispensationalists, I should say a lot of them, to point to fulfilling a prophecy of the Jews reentering the land in 1948.  But remember the context of Ezekiel's vision and its fulfillment about the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel in 536 BC.  First and foremost, it is a fulfillment of that.  It's not a future fulfillment, but it is emblematic of those three resurrections we spoke of before. ",
