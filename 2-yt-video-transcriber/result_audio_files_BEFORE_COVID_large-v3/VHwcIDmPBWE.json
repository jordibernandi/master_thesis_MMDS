            "text": "Because it's time for a fairy tale.  Time for a fairy tale.  Is that okay?  Are we alright?  We're doing okay for time?  Because I am sick of you lying mamas out there, peddlers of jubilees.  You've got to be new to Torah.  Surely, let's look at the book of Jubilees, these lying mamas.  It's written in the Maccabean period, okay?  I mean, already it's kind of a, I mean, really?  It's written in the Maccabean period of Hellenization by a Pharisaic Jew.  It's already dodgy.  Mark chapter seven, verse eight.  Ye leave the commandment of Yahuwah and hold fast the tradition of men.  And he said unto them, full well do ye reject the commandment of Yahuwah that you may keep your vain traditions.  Let's look at the book of Jubilees.  Jubilees, we've got a five-fold failure.  A five-fold failure.  Jubilees plainly violates the Torah and violates the words of the Savior by adding to the word of Yahuwah.  Number one, the fairy tale of Jubilees deceives, saying, Abraham died with Jacob lying on his chest.  I mean, my goodness, these are babbling brooks.  Are they not?  Babbling brooks of ministers of myth.  Number two, the fairy tale of Jubilees deceives again, saying... This is outrageous.  Abraham, apparently, according to Jubilees, he puts a pagan wreath on his head and he dances around an altar at the Feast of Tabernacles, which hadn't even been given yet.  Firstly, Abraham wasn't a pagan.  He crossed over.  He left all that behind.  And now you've got the author of Jubilees attributing Hasmonean pagan worship.  Because the Hasmoneans weren't even around in the time of Abraham.  The Feast of Tabernacles wasn't even around.  until when?  The giving of the Book of the Covenant, ratification, blood, covenant, meal, Exodus 19-2411, in all clarity.  But here we have, let me get this right here.  Abraham, at a feast he never attended, partaking in a Hasmonean pagan rite before there were any Hasmoneans on the earth, according to the writer of Jubilees.  So there's your second failure.  This is a five-fold failure, and I'm just having a laugh with you.  But I don't want people to make a mockery of me and you and think that we're not alert to the game that they're up to.  Number three, the third failure of Jubilees.  According to the fairy tale of Jubilees, Jacob never wrestled with the angel of Yahuwah.  Oh no, it never happened.  No.  No.  No.  He didn't wrestle with the angel of Yahuwah to get his name changed to Israel.  This is one of the most important accounts in the Bible.  But it didn't happen.  No.  It's just whitewashed.  That's a major problem, which tells you the root of the deception, because who is it that wants to wipe out the seed of Messiah?  Who is it that wants to wipe?  Revelation 12 tells you very clearly who wants to wipe out the seed.  This is Luciferic counterfeit.  The fourth failure of Jubilees.  The fairy tale of Jubilees deceives again, yet again, when it comes to the feasts.  Because the author of Jubilees says Shavuot's origin was with the rainbow.  excuse me, yes, all the way back with Noah, that's when Shavuot, that's its origin, its inception was with the rainbow, instead of when?  The giving of the book of the covenant, Exodus 19 to 24, 11, and then a festival as they went into the land, according to the account written in the Torah.  This is massive because what happened at Shavuot, not only in the book of the covenant Torah, but then in the book of Acts, this is paramount to our faith.  And of course, it is misappropriated by the writer of the book of Jubilees.  And the fifth failure, the fifth failure, the fairy tale of Jubilees deceives.  If he's already deceived you about the feasts, he's going to have to deceive you about the Sabbath.  The fairy tale of Jubilees deceives on the Sabbath, saying one can't provide Jew benevolent unto one's wife on the Sabbath, which is in violation of the Torah, Deuteronomy 12.32.  It's in violation of the Brit Hadashah, 1 Corinthians 7.5.  And then the writer of Jubilees says, oh, it's Sabbath.  You can't travel on a ship.  That's a violation of the Sabbath.  Well, maybe you should have told Paul and all the apostles throughout the account of the book of Acts.  Because apparently they didn't know about that because they were doing a lot of traveling on the ships on the Sabbath.  And where is that?  in the Torah?  It's not.  You cannot add or... Well, there's a lot of adding going along.  And apparently you can't fast on the Sabbath according to the orthodox view of Leviticus 23, where it says that you can, but not according to the writer of Jubilees.  So we've got a five-fold massive failure here when it comes to taking away and adding to the inspired 66. and all that to say this in finality i believe we have everything within the canon the measured and ruled sixty six determined in the old testament the jewish twenty two which matches are thirty nine and then the new covenant twenty seven for a grand total of sixty six.  second peter chapter one verse three.  it is written Seeing that his divine power has granted unto us everything that we need.  All things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue.  He's given us everything we need.  And I think everything that we need for our edification and faith is in the 66th.  And I have no problem if you want to read, and I do, extra biblical material.  But I am not going to be a minister of myth.  I want to be a minister of power and truth.  And we have to decide what is inspired and what is not.  The Pharisaic author of Jubilees is definitely number one, a bold-faced liar.  And as Yahushua said, regarding those lying fiends, number three, influenced by demons because who's their daddy?  S.A.  Tan.  So the question that you have to ask, why now?  Why now?  Why now are we having more of these books being floated around?  Because people are trying to float new calendars.  They're trying to float new ideas and they are not supported by the 66 and they would be exposed by people like you and me because we're familiar and we are studied on the 66.  So why are they doing it now?  Why is there such a resurgence of the peddling of strange doctrines, myth, and speculation?  Because the ministers of myth, they have to go outside the 66 to survive and to thrive.  Because if they were in the 66, their folly would be exposed to all in its glory.  Blood ratified clarity of the Savior.  So they have to go out of the 66 to be the ministers of myth, of which they truly are.  Because otherwise, you and I, if they were in the word, the inspired word of Yahuwah, we can run circles around that.  We can expose their creed and show that it is full of fatal flaws and it contradicts the 66.  And I love to read.  This isn't about reading.  I love to read.  John Bunyan.  and J.R.R.  Tolkien.  And in reality, both Enoch and Jubilees are more akin to the Pilgrim's Progress and the Hobbit fantasy than they are the Bible.  And they would serve better being read at drag queen story time than they would at a Bible study.  and that's it.  it's very clear.  so i hope that this is giving you a breakdown on why i do not believe these books apocrypha are inspired scripture because i'm a follower of the resurrected savior and there is no place for usurpers trying to steal his glory and his blood and he is the only mediator between man and Yahuwah.  So those of you outside, which camera?  I've got no lights.  I don't know where we are.  Microphones and cameras.  There you are.  I've got you back.  Everything went dark on me.
