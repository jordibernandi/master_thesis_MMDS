            "text": "No, I'm not done.  Hey, you're my servant, bro.  You're every one of our servants out here.  Until we break the law, you better watch your mouth and watch your tone.  No, you need to.  You got a wicked heart, man.  You're a wicked person.  You are.  All right, guys.  A.V.  Watchman out here at the Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles County.  This is the East Los Angeles Share Station 5019, or let me correct that, 5019 East 3rd Street.  Alright guys, so right now I'm with California Guardian.  She's here until 1.  She might be on lunch if she's not active.  Yeah, she might be on lunch.  And I'm always saying he did have his phone because when he was writing on.  Look, this goes to show you how much they care about the United States.  Look at this little rink-a-dink flag.  Torn up, ripped up.  They got a huge pole here with a small little flag.  Dress hanging out and everything.  Wow.  Yes.  I told them, I don't disrespect you guys.  Why do you disrespect me?  Right here in the public, huh?  Well, in the back, but still.  Wow, yeah, still.  And I kept asking to use the restroom.  I pissed on their floor.  Right.  Because they wouldn't open it up so I could use the restroom.  Wow.  Yeah, they're fucking idiots.  Yeah.  Yeah, they have a really bad reputation.  Well, you know what?  They think they can get away with it, but they're not going to get away with it.  No.  In my opinion, payback's a motherfucker.  Right, right.  Regardless if you wear a badge or not.  Right.  I don't care.  Yeah.  You need to respect people.  Yeah, of course, of course.  I mean, we know that, but in their minds, they don't have to.  They think that they're better than us because they have a uniform and a badge.  And I cop that badge.  I keep telling them, come approach me without that uniform.  Right, right, right.  Because I'm sick of your attitude.  And you know what sucks?  Like, the majority of them, that they do these horrible things, they get away with it.  I know.  They get promoted.  Because it's the badge.  Yep.  Fuck the badge.  Yep.  Yep.  Sorry to say that, but you know.  No, no, it's true.  It's true.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  And this is what they've caused.  They want to disrespect me.  Of course.  Right.  I know what you mean.  I don't disrespect them.  Why do they do that to me?  Right.  Like an animal.  Yep.  That's how they look at us.  Exactly.  Because of their uniform and their bags.  Yep.  Fuck them.  Yep.  They forgot they're public servants.  I said, aren't you supposed to protect and serve?  Yeah.  Fuck you guys.  Yep.  Exactly.  Go to hell.  Yep.  And you have a good day.  Thank you.  You too.  Yep.  So you guys, you know, there it is there.  This station is notorious for violating people's rights.  You just heard what she said.  They had her stand in the back with her pants down for a long period of time.  And you know what's crazy is they get away with it.  They get suspended, but they still have pay.  You know, nothing happens to them.  And it needs to stop.  This shit needs to stop because we the people, we're tired of it.  We're tired of how they treat us, you know?  The majority of them have forgotten their oath.  No, but I called them and they told me that I couldn't go anywhere because there was something that they couldn't send to anyone.  What were your signs that they said that?  They said that they hadn't done any damage to break windows or anything.  I told them that they just unlocked the door and I couldn't open it anymore.  The boss's son had to talk so that someone could open the door.  Frank Caldwell speaking.  Yeah, okay, will do, bye.  Oh, he's putting the tape.  Here could be a crime scene inside the public lobby.  He's putting up the tape.  He's putting up the tape.  Can you see?  They're putting up crime scene tape.  What's the purpose of the tape?  What's the purpose of the tape?  Are you a cop?  Just a piece of shit, aren't you?  I knew this was open to the public because they have this phone here.  We're able to come up here and use the phone.  Is there any way we could speak to that, Lieutenant?  I'll see you in just a minute.  Am I here?  Deputy, deputy, deputy, how do you feel about leaving a woman in the car with her shirt off showing her breasts to the public?  piece of shit.  I have one more question.  can we get an oral public records request form of the officers that were involved with the young lady?  So we can't get a form for that?  That's the complaint form I just gave him.  We're making an oral request.  Yeah, Public Records Act.  I'm the Americans with Disabilities Act coordinator for your department, and who I may lodge an Americans with Disabilities Act discrimination grievance waiver.  I hope you're not ignoring me, ma'am.  No, I'm not ignoring you.  I can't hear what you're saying.  Please write down what you're saying to me, please.  Sir, we don't mind that you're here.  The problem is that there are other civilians here that we need to help.  I can't hear what you're saying.  Do you understand that?  I understand that.  But if somebody, if any of your friends could understand.  Would you write down what you're saying to me, please?  We don't mind that you're here.  I'm trying to be, of course, I don't mind that you're here.  But I'm also trying to help her.  Okay, I'll wait patiently until you take a pen and write down what I'm looking for.  Okay, so give me a few minutes while I have her.  Can you just lower your voice, please?  Thank you.  And just for the record, we're each individuals.  I understand.  I don't mind that you're here.  You can be here all day long.  Stop cramming your audible tone down my throat.  I can't hear you.  Okay.  We're trying to get the names of all the cops that were involved with the young lady.  You need to lower your voice.  Will you please right now what she's saying to me?  You can hear me, and not someone else can hear you, okay?  Thank you so much.  Thank you for your help, guys.  I appreciate it.  You're going to appreciate it when they take you back to Mexico.  That's true.  Wanted to deport everybody.  Can we get the names of all the pigs that were involved?  I'm sorry, this is not the LAPD.  It would be great.  I can give you the phone number to LAPD.  Ask for Officer H-U-E-R-T-A.  She obviously isn't here.  Excuse me, can you rewrite this in a more legible handwriting, please?  Rewrite it in more legible handwriting, please.  And also, I hope you understand that he is hard of hearing.  And you getting frustrated with him and yelling at him, to stop yelling, that's very insensitive to the situation.  Did you hear me?  Yeah, I heard.  And you're rewriting that, right?  It's little.  No, we can't read it.  I can give it to you so you can write it, okay?  Here you go.  Can you rewrite it for us?  I'll have you write it.  I'll give you a sheet of paper so you can write it, okay?  Okay, and a pencil.  Can you say the number maybe out loud for us?  Sure.  Phone number, since you're recording it.  Public Information Office, 323-881-2413.  Okay?  I've got one easier for you.  I'm making a verbal public records request per the California Public Records Act to you, Deputy.  But I want the names of the deputies that stripped a female naked in the back of a police car and left her there for an hour.  I'll be back in ten days.  If you don't have it, I'm going to sue you, Deputy, for failure to follow the California Public Records Act.  Do you understand that one?  honor your fucking oath.  I'm going to be here.  you're creating a nuisance.  so you can step out.  you can go fuck yourself too and I'll step out.  can you step back for her privacy?  nope for her privacy?  no there's no expectation of privacy in the public.  fuckboy take her to an interview room.  No.  Well, we could always go outside in the park and we could talk.  We got to have cameras on.  Cameras on, man.  We don't trust you guys.  You guys are blue ISIS.  Blue ISIS thugs, man.  No, no, we want to talk to you, but we want to talk to you on camera.  You're a public official.  We want to have cameras on.  Cameras on?  Why?  Well, then come out here with the public and talk to us.  Go ahead.  Okay, we would like to make a request for public records.  You have to go through our discovery unit to get that.  I'm sorry?  You have to go through our discovery unit to get that.  We can't just get a form here?  No, no.  We have policies that we have to follow.  We don't just give out things like that.  Your policy is not law.  I just told you.  You have to go through our discovery unit.  Your policy is not law?  Just answer it in front of everybody.  Why did you guys arrest a female, put her in the backseat of a squad car, strip her naked, have her chest showing for over an hour in the heat?  Yes, you do.  It happened on Friday.  No, no, no.  I just asked you something.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Nobody knows nothing about that.  Nobody knows nothing about that.  Yeah, why are you guys so secretive for?  How would you feel if somebody did that to your wife?  What would you do to the person that did that to your wife or your mom or your daughter?  They would get arrested or shot, right?  Yeah.  Did they give you a phone number to contact someone?  They gave us something, man.  Okay, well, there you go.  There's that phone number.  That's who you have to contact.  Because you don't know nothing.  How did you become the watch commander knowing nothing?  Are you done?  No, I'm not done.  Is there a form we can get for public?  Hey, you're my servant, bro.  You're every one of our servants out here.  Until we break the law, you better watch your mouth and watch your tone.  Yeah, you need to.  You got a wicked heart, man.  You're a wicked person.  You are.  Sir, is there a form we can get for the public records?  Watch your tone, servant.  Every one of you guys are public servants.  Is there a form we can get for public records?  For public records here?  No, you go to our discovery unit.  Which is where?  They'll give you the number.  All right, guys.  There you have it there.  I'm going to go ahead and cut the video.  Pretty much nothing happened after that.  But, um... Anyways, I'm really hoping that there is a video somewhere of them detaining Furry and having Furry sit in the back of that squad car with breasts showing.  Because as of right now, it's going to be Furry's word versus their word.  And we all know how that goes.  So hopefully there is a video out there somewhere that we can get our hands on.  But yeah, everyone is on the hush-hush.  Nobody wants to talk.  Everybody's playing stupid like they don't know what's going on.  Bunch of pussycats.  But yeah, guys, so this is A.B.  Watchman.
