There is a story in that book that comes pretty soon at the beginning of the book.  that is the single funniest thing that I have ever heard about Jordan Peterson, and nobody ever talks about this, which tells me that nobody read even this far into Maps of Meaning.  So he tells the story of how he first became interested in Jungian psychology, which is what he's into.  And it starts out with this whole thing about how he used to be a socialist, but then he realized that socialists were actually bad, that they like the poor, but they really just hate the rich.  And he said he got this out of reading The Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell, which Orwell himself would be very disappointed to hear Peterson say that, were he alive, because Orwell was a lifelong socialist.  In any case... Whatever socialist group this was that Peterson was part of, and he hypes it up like it was some revolutionary communist sect, but knowing Peterson's penchant for hyperbole, it's entirely possible it was just the NDP.  Even after he quit, he was still political enough and still left-wing enough to be really concerned about about the issue of nuclear war and nuclear disarmament.  In fact, he had this year where he was having these really intense dreams about nuclear war.  He was reading everything that could explain these dreams.  And so, of course, one of the first things he turned to was Sigmund Freud's book, The interpretation of dreams.  But Peterson says that that wasn't doing it for him.  Right.  That Freud wanted to make everything about sex.  But these dreams, you see, they didn't have anything to do with sex.  They're about politics.  They're about nuclear war.  Hold that thought.  The one and only one of these dreams that Peterson actually gives is an example in this part of the book.  It starts out, he's watching TV with his cousin, who he parenthetically describes as the most beautiful woman that he has ever met.  And then something goes wrong.  He goes down to the basement.  The bomb goes off.  Right there, there's some forbidden sexual stuff going on.  Bomb goes off.  I don't think you have to be Sigmund Freud to read something sexual into this.  But let's keep going.  As people are walking around in the charred chaos outside, things have gotten really crazy.  Dogs are walking around on their hind legs.  So every time you see Peterson talk about chaos, remember that's what he imagines.  Dogs walking around on their hind legs.  You know, if we just had total chaos... And the dogs are exchanging cooked meat for canned food for some reason.  And he makes this exchange.  And then Peterson realizes at the end of the dream that the cooked meat is the cooked flesh of his hot cousin.  Yeah, nothing Freudian going on there. ",

What happened to them, essentially, and what happened to Jean-Paul Sartre for that matter, was that by the end of the 1960s, you couldn't be conscious and thinking and pro-Marxist.  There was so much evidence that had come pouring in from the former Soviet Union, from the Soviet Union at that point, and from Maoist China of the absolutely devastating consequences of the doctrine that it was impossible to be apologetic for it by that point in time.  So the French intellectuals in particular just pulled off a sleight of hand and transformed Marxism into postmodern identity politics. ",

All that stuff happened way earlier than that.  1956 is when Khrushchev gave his famous speech denouncing the crimes of Stalin.  It's also, by the way, since one of the figures he mentioned was Jean-Paul Sartre, the year that Khrushchev sent tanks into Hungary to suppress a democratic socialist uprising against Stalinism in that country.  And Sartre wrote a whole book about about that invasion and his break from capital C communism because of that.  Long before 1968, Sartre was an anti-Stalinist Marxist, as were most of the Marxists who were involved in the 1968 student uprisings.  And let's not even get into the conflation of postmodernism and identity politics as if those were the same thing.  They're not the same thing at all.  Not only is Marxism exactly the kind of grand narrative they're rebelling against, that the Marxist narrative about, you know, the relationship between history and class struggle and feudalism and capitalism and socialism.  But it's actually one of the primary ones a lot of these guys had in mind.  And one of the reasons why, you know, Foucault, for example, and somebody who was actually still very much a Marxist after 1968, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Couldn't stand each other.  Let's see what he said when an actual Marxist thinker, the economist and podcaster Professor Richard Wolff, challenged Peterson to a debate. ",

That is amazing.  the way that when he's rattling off Stalinist horrors, as if Richard Wolff was a Stalinist and not an advocate of democratic socialism and, in fact, expanding democracy by putting it into the workplace, which is the opposite of the top-down Soviet model.  He just casually equates Vietnam, Cambodia, as if those were basically the same thing.  Communist Vietnam invaded Cambodia to stop Pol Pot's killing fields.  The United States, for Cold War, anti-Vietnam, anti-Soviet reasons, actually backed the Khmer Rouge against them after fighting off... A U.S.  occupation that killed, depending on the estimates you wanted to believe, between one and four million Vietnamese peasants.  You know, what the U.S.  did in Vietnam was quasi-genocidal with the Khmer Rouge, who the U.S.  was backing.  So, this is just \u2013 I don't want to pull any punches here \u2013 Abysmally stupid.  You know, there were Stalinist atrocities.  The people who carried them out did say they were Marxists.  Of course, you might think, all right, well, Jordan Peterson's very interested in Nietzsche, and the Nazis tried to claim him, so I'm not quite sure why Nietzsche's not out of bounds the way that Marx is.  Not that he should be, because the Nazi claim on Nietzsche was absurd.  Nietzsche hated anti-Semitism and German nationalism and went on about both frequently.  Marx was a consistent advocate of free press.  He was opposed to censorship.  He was opposed to the death penalty.  Marx's example of how dictatorship of the proletariat would work was the Paris Commune of 1871, which was such a radically democratic experiment that it was supported by both Marx on the one hand and Bakunin and the anarchist wing of the First International on the other hand.  And in fact, not only did Marx not support any dictatorships, as far as I know, there's exactly one head of state who Marx liked enough to ever send a nice letter to.  And that was one Abraham Lincoln, who Marx sent a congratulatory telegram to on behalf of the First International at the time that Lincoln was re-elected president.  postmodernism and identity politics and Stalin and Marx.  You know, maybe for all of the things those things don't have in common, maybe there's some common thread that Peterson has identified.  Once we understand that common thread, then we'll see that, okay, despite all the things that he's getting wrong, Peterson has some kind of insight into some of this. ",

And I don't see that that's being done.  They're driven fundamentally by a horror of inequality and the catastrophes that inequality produces.  And fair enough, because inequality is a massive social force, and it can produce catastrophic consequences.  So to be concerned about that politically is reasonable.  But we do know that that concern can go too far, the doctrine of equality of outcome.  And it seems to me that that's where people who are thoughtful on the left should draw the line.

In other words, you're attributing a claim to a thinker that if you had read even some of his shortest and most accessible writings, you would know that is just wrong.  If you're going to go around giving lectures and recording videos where you spout off about Marxism and how horrible Marxism is, you should probably read at least the Critique of the Gotha program because... One, it is the one place where he's getting into a lot of these issues.  And two, it's super short and accessible.  Marx explicitly says that in the early stages of a socialist society, you would need to have unequal distribution of resources to incentivize work, incentivize certain kinds of economic contributions.  Those who are able to work, you know, you'd have to have unequal payment for the purposes of incentives.  Obviously, there's nothing about having collective ownership of the means of production.  that's incompatible with saying that, yeah, we're going to have somewhat unequal distribution to incentivize certain kinds of things because at that stage you're going to need to.  After a certain amount of time, as technology progresses, well... it would play out differently than how it plays out under capitalism.  Under capitalism, when technology eliminates certain categories of jobs or you need fewer employees, some people lose their jobs and they're in temporarily desperate circumstances or maybe permanently desperate circumstances, depending on whether they can find a new job.  But of course, if workers controlled jobs, the means of production, distribution, et cetera, then technological changes could play out differently.  Everybody could just vote themselves fewer hours but the amount of resources created would stay the same.  It would just be that you would have to spend fewer and fewer hours of your day, as things progressed, doing tasks that you wouldn't necessarily have chosen for yourself.  You think that Marxism is fundamentally wrong, and a quality of outcome is not something that we should desire.  That, you know, in that, like you say, OK, Marx, Marx didn't advocate equality of outcome.  It's another yet another thing that Peterson is just fundamentally confused about.  But whatever the Marxist stuff is crazy anyway.  And a quality, you know, equality of outcome is bad, too.  So even if Peterson is wrong to associate the two together, he's right to reject both.  Right.  Here's the problem with saying that.  A quality of opportunity to quality of outcome.  Trying to draw any kind of sharp line between those two is just going to be a hopeless project.  Because as anybody with any knowledge of how the world works should realize... Think about the college cheating scandal that just happened.  And then think about the fact that with no cheating whatsoever... No violation of any rules.  The children of the well-off have a much better chance of making it into college than the children of the poor.  There is no meaningful distinction there, at least in an intergenerational way, because one generation's outcomes are the next generation's opportunities.  Wow.  Thanks, Ben. ",
