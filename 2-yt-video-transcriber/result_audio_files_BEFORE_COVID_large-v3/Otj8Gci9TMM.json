            "text": "We can't even imagine this, but I want everyone to grasp this.  You are dying, and perhaps you even get a glimpse of heaven.  And then the door to heaven slams in your face, and you know that you are lost eternally.  Now, just to tease this out a little bit more, Jesus, in this passage of Scripture, gives us several different warnings.  Earlier He said, for example, that the way to life is narrow, and few there be that find it, whereas the way to destruction is broad, and He says many go in thereat.  Think about this.  What Jesus is actually saying is there are going to be fewer on the narrow road.  It's a scary thought.  And then there are going to be a lot more on the broad road that leads to destruction.  So what we need to do is to find out what that narrow road is.  And we're living in a day and age when everybody wants to make the narrow road a lot broader.  We want to include other religions.  We want to include other ways to the Father.  But only Jesus qualifies as the way to the Father.  And while we're talking about that imagery, Visualize a long freeway with many different lanes.  This is the Broadway that leads to destruction.  It doesn't matter what lane you are on.  The fact is that you are going to end eventually in destruction.  And you can switch lanes.  You can go from one religion to another, one guru to another, but in the end there's destruction.  And the important point to make is this.  These are people who expected better.  They actually thought that they were going to be able to enter into the kingdom.  They thought that they were saved, but they weren't.  That's why in this series that we are doing, in this program and also in some of the other programs, we're going to be discussing how it is possible that people who think that they are saved really aren't, because this is absolutely critical.

            "text": "Yeah.  I think we've scared everybody sufficiently in the church, okay?  And there are people on the outside that don't give a rip about what we're talking about, but they ought to be concerned too, because, you know, as far as I know, everybody's going to die someday, okay?  So, you're going to have to face it either now, you need to think about this question, or you will be thinking about this question.  And Jesus Christ, by His life, death, and resurrection, He's given us a lot of evidence of who He is.  He's the Son of God, and He's got power.  And someday you're going to meet Him face to face, all right?  And He's got the keys to the kingdom. ",
