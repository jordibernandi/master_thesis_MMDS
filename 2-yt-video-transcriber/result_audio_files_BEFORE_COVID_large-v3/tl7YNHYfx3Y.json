She's a stand-up comedian you might have seen on HBO.  And recently, as well as the last couple of years, she's been involved in a lot of issues and a lot of disputes with people online and in person.  I've watched her in a few interviews now, and every time I've seen her, I felt like she exhibits a lot of behavior that indicates to me that she may be a narcissist.  Recently, she was denied entry into a black Emmy party, and it turned into a big deal.  So I decided to do some research on Amanda.  I'm going to play some clips from her, and I just want you guys to look for narcissistic behavior. ",

Yeah meaning I see the chasm between me and people who are truly highly intelligent, and I recognize how difficult it is to stand with them in a conversation about certain topics, so I tend to just listen in those scenarios.  But I'm smart enough to know when someone is full of shit.  And that's the most frustrating thing about that kind of curve, is that dumb people far overestimate their intelligence.  Intelligent people really can't relate with a lot of dumb people, and people who are in the middle find themselves frustrated because they realize how much of a distance there are between them and smart people, and they get frustrated at dumb people for not realizing how dumb they actually are.  And so I sit here and I listen to you, And I'm like, boo-boo, you're not nearly as smart as you think you are.  You're not.  You don't talk nearly as proper as you think you do.  And that arrogance and that kind of egotistical aspect of you is what makes people dislike you so much.  The more people hear you, the more they actually get to see you.  And more of what they've seen, the more they dislike.  If you look at the Breakfast Club interviews with her, the dislikes on those videos have grown with each passing time.  Because you're rude!  And also because people are really starting to see you for who you are.  It's ironic that her book is called Small Doses, because it seems like people can only handle her in small doses.  You see what I did there?  Oh, shit, dude.  It's almost as if she seemed insecure.  All right, that shit's corny.  But I couldn't help myself, you know what I'm saying?  I was just like, okay. ",
