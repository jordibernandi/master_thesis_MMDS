You don't want to make the assumption that the people who were our forebears were stupid just because they thought using metaphors that aren't the same as our metaphors.  It's like the story in the second part of Harry Potter.  The phoenix stands in the same relationship to Dumbledore that Christ stands in relationship to God the Father in Christianity.  in Sleeping Beauty.  The prince also represents the woman's own consciousness.  The consciousness is presented very frequently in stories as symbolically masculine, as it is with the Logos idea. ",

            "text": "As you were talking, I was reminded of something I wrote in The End of Faith.  And I just want to read this to you because this is, I believe, this counterpoint to this way of talking about mythology and stories and archetypes is still valid.  I walked into the cookbook section of a Barnes & Noble with my eyes closed, grabbed a book, and opened it at random.  and looked at the first recipe i saw.  and the book turned out to be a book called the taste of hawaii new cooking from the crossroads of the pacific.  and therein i discovered an as yet uncelebrated mystical treatise.  while it appears to be a recipe for wok seared fish and shrimp cakes with oggo tomato relish We need only study its list of ingredients to know that we are in the presence of an unrivaled spiritual intelligence.  One snapper filet cubed, three teaspoons of chopped scallions, salt and freshly ground pepper is a long list of ingredients.  And then I go through with a mystical interpretation of this recipe.  So when I say the snapper filet, of course, is the individual himself, you and I, awash in the sea of existence.  And here we find it cubed.  which is to say that our situation must be remedied in all three dimensions of body, mind, and spirit.  Now you have three teaspoons of chopped scallions.  This further partakes of the cubic symmetry, suggesting that that which we need add to each level of our being by way of antidote comes likewise in equal proportions.  The import of the passage is clear.  The body, mind, and spirit need to be tended with the same care.  I go on and on, and this is all bullshit because it's meant to be bullshit.  But my point is, you can do this with anything.  And religions have been doing this for millennia with specific books.  Most of these books are profoundly mediocre.  The fact that most people most of the time have found profound meaning in much of this work is not proof otherwise.  I mean, again, if you found me a culture that was doing what I just did to a recipe in a cookbook, the fact that they had gone generation after generation enamored of that interpretation wouldn't prove anything.  That's the problem I'm having here. ",
