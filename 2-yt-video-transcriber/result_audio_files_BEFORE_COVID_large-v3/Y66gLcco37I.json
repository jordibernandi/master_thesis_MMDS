Before then, life was generally simple in structure and function.  Until that explosion happened and bam, complex organisms began to dominate and diverge into all the major groups of animals.  And this happened over like, I don't know, 15 to 20 million years?  Don't get me wrong, that's actually a lot of time.  Of course, there have been scientific ideas being thrown around in the community to address the Cambrian explosion.  And you know what?  Creationists like to make claims like these without going into what scientists themselves are saying about it.  Come on, you really think the scientific community would let this slide without giving it possible explanations?  Currently, there's not just one factor that caused it.  We know it's most likely a combination of factors that played a role.  Here are some explanations that have been given already.  It's important to note that the Cambrian explosion could be easily explained by a very accelerated evolutionary phase, not impossible evolution.  So all you have to do is identify what caused the evolutionary pressures.  520 million years ago, there were massive changes in the ocean systems and ecosystems in general.  There's no doubt that a combination of survival pressures facilitated the accelerated changes in organisms.  For example, one factor was likely the increase in photosynthetic activity, which increased the overall amount of oxygen in the air.  That allowed organisms to adapt and become more complex due to greater abilities to consume and utilize oxygen for metabolism.  Another example is the glaciation of Earth, which could have killed a lot of organisms.  This leaves the gene pool of populations to be smaller than usual, which increases evolutionary rate due to bottlenecking.  Of course, there are many, many other explanations, and it was likely a combination of these that caused the Cambrian explosion.  But anyway, Stephen really isn't here to talk about evolution rates during that time period.  He has something else in mind, so let's have a look. ",

However, we obviously know that's not the case because the only way we see this is through fossils.  There's a bias towards what the fossil record shows.  If you have a hard skeleton or shell, for example, it is much more likely to be preserved.  So we don't see a lot of soft-bodied organisms.  So a favoritism in hard-bodied organisms could likely be the reason we saw this explosion, and makes it seem as if there were no ancestors.  As the environment favored organisms with complexity in hard shells or skeletons, they adapt to fit that condition.  And then in the fossil record, it looks to appear as if there was a sudden entry of organisms when in reality we just couldn't see them before.  So in that case, their ancestors would have just been invisible in the fossil record. ",

You certainly can't keep doing this and expect some cool new program to pop out.  There's a mathematical reason for this.

Any small change can generate a syntax error that could ultimately break it.  But that's not the case for DNA, not even close.  See, I'm currently doing a master's in bioinformatics, and we look at DNA all the time.  One of the few things you come to realize is that DNA and proteins are incredibly nonspecific.  They can undergo many, many changes and still retain the same function.  This is due to many reasons.  First, most DNA does not code for functional proteins.  There are more often either junk or regulatory sequences.  that does not necessarily serve a direct purpose in the structures of the protein itself.  Second, you can change the DNA sequence without changing the resulting protein.  This one is actually less relevant compared to the other points.  Third, even if you do change the protein or DNA sequence, it may very well still retain its primary function.  Just look at related organisms in a blast result.  They generally have multiple differences between them but are conserved enough.  In fact, you can even map out these differences and create a phylogenetic tree with it.  That's right, you can just take these proteins and draw an ancestral tree based on it, and it matches the actual tree fairly well.  The point is, changes in a DNA sequence does not destroy it like it does a computer code.  DNA is very flexible.  So what happens?  You introduce a bunch of changes through mutations, and then the beneficial ones will be selected out by natural selection.  It's that simple.  And since now we know that mutations most likely do not destroy the function of DNA and proteins, it's fairly easy to imagine how this is possible. ",

            "text": "If you start from scratch and just create a gene by randomly assigning letters, then yes, getting a protein with the proper function can be difficult.  But that's not what happens in reality.  You already have a template to start off with, and random changes in that template will cause changes, yes, but more likely, it won't drastically affect the gene's function.  And whenever a useful change does occur, natural selection snatches it up and spreads it throughout the population.  Don't forget, we're talking about entire populations here, with hundreds, thousands, and millions of members, each having their own variations and mutations of DNA.  So it's very easy for the favorable gene change to be present already before the environment selects that out via natural selection.  Overall, I think you just fundamentally don't understand evolution by natural selection. ",

            "text": "So, two serious doubts about modern Darwinian theory.  The Cambrian explosion, the sudden appearance of new animals, which evolutionary theory has failed to explain, and the DNA enigma, the implausibility of random mutations producing the information needed to build new forms of animal life.  Scientists who know about these problems are not ignorant, stupid, or insane.  They are just appropriately skeptical. ",

Anyway, that's the end of the video today, guys.  Thank you again for watching.  Hopefully we won't talk about evolution and creationism again next week, just to keep the content fresh.  Shoutout to Fireshard for being the all-time top supporter, as well as everyone else who has decided to help me through difficult times.  Bye! ",
