We have 20 minutes for our little check-up from the neck up.  Gentlemen, so if we could take his jacket.  Please sit down.  You'll feel a little cold as this anaesthetic gel goes on.  Probe sheath.  And probe.  Please relax.  Are you relaxed, Pete?  Yes, sir.  Pete, I'm going to drill a tiny hole in the skull, which will allow delivery of the new implant.  So, what you'll feel is a little discomfort in the form of pressure and also a loud vibrating noise in your head.  Probe going in now.  Good.  Excellent.  Releasing implant.  There.  That wasn't so bad, was it, Pete?  No, sir. ",
