Well, a couple of things we might say about that.  First of all, when God elects to create this universe, he knows how it's going to turn out.  Because he's outside of time, he knows the end from the beginning.  But the people that believe and the people that don't believe in this universe are freely doing so.  So somebody like, say, Billy Graham, who was a great evangelist for many years, God knew when he created the universe, Billy Graham would believe.  He also knew that somebody like Richard Dawkins wouldn't believe.  But he didn't force them to believe or not to believe.  He allowed them to make their own choice. ",

            "text": "All Frank Turek has done here is assert his internally contradictory position without actually offering explanation as to how it's possible.  And the way he does this is by reducing the definition of God down to the attribute of omniscience, ignoring the attribute of omnipotence given to him by Christianity.  God is not merely an observer who knows the outcome like a person watching a movie created before they were born for the second time.  God is in fact the writer, director and producer rolled into one.  As an omnipotent being, they had control over every aspect of creation.  On that basis, they knew the result that every choice would have on the later actions of people.  That removes the possibility of free will in its entirety.  The universe simply became a set of predetermined outcomes, chosen by God at the very start, during creation.  It's like one of those coin drop machines you get at the seaside where there are rows of pins that the coins hit as they go down, and it'll go one way or the other.  Now, there's an element of randomness for us because there's too many variables for us to account for.  But if we built a machine with 100% accuracy that knew the outcome of each layer before it put the coin in, the results would cease to be random.  they'd be predetermined.  In effect, if God, the supposed creator of the universe, is both omnipotent and omniscient, Billy Graham and Richard Dawkins did not choose anything, let alone beliefs which I'd argue are still not a choice either way.  But the point is, God chose what they do and apparently will torture one of them for eternity because of said choice.  So how is that just? ",

It's logically possible, but probably not actually achievable.  Because if God has truly given people free will, then they're going to make their own choice.  And I don't know about you, but I don't always choose God.  Maybe you do.  You're so innocent.  But I don't always choose God.  And... I would have fallen just like Adam fell if it was just me.  So I think people inevitably will fall away from God.  But some people don't want to be redeemed by God. ",

            "text": "The fact that people can be predisposed either towards or away from God suggests, at least to some degree, that people's beliefs are predetermined.  Also, if God is omnipotent, they should be able to create a universe in which people have free will, but ultimately come to realise that God exists through the evidence around them.  But we don't have that.  Instead, religions have to spend trillions of dollars annually to indoctrinate each generation.  Why?  Well, they're finding it difficult to compete with improving educational standards and greater scientific and philosophical vigour.  The statement, logically possible but not actually achievable, is okay for a non-omnipotent entity such as human beings.  It is not okay for an omnipotent entity such as God.  Therefore, you either have to give up omnipotence or omniscience. ",

How?  Richard Dawkins, for example, writes a book.  A Christian reads a book and goes, wow, I never thought of that argument.  I better go get an answer to it.  It forces the Christian to actually become closer to God by reading what atheists write.  In fact, the more I read atheists, the more I'm convinced that Christianity is true.  because I think their arguments are so  poor.\". ",

All it really does is show us that the Dunning-Kruger effect is alive and well in Mr.  Turek.  Fact is, point two, as with point one, doesn't actually deal with the question being asked, at least not in a way that Christians would likely be happy with.  The girl was asking why, if God only knew the outcome, did he bother creating the universe knowing full well that a number of people would, through God's choices at the start of the universe, be forced into denying their existence and, ultimately, be tortured for eternity because of God's choices.  In response to this, Turek goes, well because it makes Christians stronger in their faith.  A statement made without basis, but I'll accept it as a hypothetical.  What Turek is effectively telling the girl is that God would torture countless people if it helped a few Christians keep to their faith, instead of designing a system in which nobody was tortured because they became Christian of their own volition, which is not exactly the image of God most Christians like to forward.

            "text": "Again, Frank Turek dodges the actual question.  If atheists didn't exist, procreation wouldn't cease to happen.  Christian couples would still have children, who in turn would have children of their own, and so on and so forth.  Only in this scenario, people wouldn't be tortured for eternity as a result of choices made by God when they created the universe.  Now one may argue that Turok is referring to himself and the people that exist today specifically.  And if that is the case, what this reveals is a level of inflated ego.  That would mean that Turok believes his existence is worth countless people being tortured for all eternity.  Which it isn't.  Nobody's existence is worth that.  However, this once again raises a problem with God's supposed omnipotence.  It says God couldn't create a world in which everyone was Christian.  and yet Frank Turek exists in some form, something which puts a clear limitation on God's power.  God's either all-powerful and all-knowing, or he isn't.  And yet all three of Turek's arguments rely on ignoring at least one of these traits in order to avoid what the girl is actually getting at with her question.  i.e.  is it moral to create people and force them to walk down a path which, thanks to God's design, will result in them being tortured for eternity?  Because that's a question Turek can't actually answer in an honest fashion. ",

And what's more is, I think this girl realizes that from her reaction as Turg finishes up.  This isn't the nod of understanding, merited or not.  This girl seems genuinely disappointed that she didn't receive an honest answer from Mr.  Turek.  Whilst the congregation applauds him, I can't help but feel that this girl sees through the bullshit.  And if she can hold onto that seed of scepticism, I have very little doubt that she'll shed her parents' religious beliefs.  And Mr.  Turek will have played a key part in extinguishing her misplaced faith in God.
