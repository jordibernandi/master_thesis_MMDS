            "text": "The first step that a new Christian should take to learn more about what he or she believes is pretty simple.  Read the Bible.  And that's the starting point.  I even suggest that before, you know, certain books.  I would rather have someone become familiar with Scripture.  You know, the Scripture has its own glory.  We say God has glory, Christ has glory, the Holy Spirit has glory, but the Scripture has its own glory and its own inherent power and glory.  that rises out of it.  And so the first thing a Christian needs to do is feed on the bread of the Word of God.  Man doesn't live by bread alone, but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.  And here's what I suggest.  that you begin reading the Old Testament and just read sections of the Old Testament on a daily basis.  Just kind of read your way through.  But when you get to the New Testament, every day take the New Testament, pick a section.  Let's say you start with 1 John.  Read 1 John every day for 30 days.  Just read it every single day for 30 days.  By the end of 30 days, you're going to know what's in 1 John, and you're going to know how chapter 1 connects with 3.  You're going to know the flow of it.  It's going to be familiar.  You probably visually will see where a verse is on the page of your Bible because you've been doing that.  And then when you've done that for 30 days, go to the Gospel of John, take seven chapters, read them for 30 days, seven more for 30 days, seven more for 30 days.  poured the Gospel of John and 1 John through your mind, and you begin to realize that the Scripture explains itself.  It is its own greatest commentator.  If you did that for two and a half years, you could do the whole New Testament.  That's what I did at the beginning of my serious approach to the Word of God, and I became so familiar with the text of Scripture.  And if you listen to me preach today, you'll know that I explain one verse with another one.  Typically, you know, I'm explaining this by this verse and that verse because that's how I took it in.  By reading repetitiously the Scripture, I began to see how it is its own best interpreter.  That's where a believer needs to start.  And along the way, you can be, you know, reading other good, I would suggest good doctrine, books on doctrine and books on the biographies of people whom God has blessed through history.  But the primary thing is to read the scripture, read it repetitiously so you retain it. ",
