            "text": "Okay, full self-disclosure here.  I've never used dating apps like Tinder and Bumble and haven't even had the cause to use them in a long, long time.  Just the same, the use of dating apps has been a relatively common theme with the men I've worked with over the past several years.  For some of those men, the vast majority actually, the reviews on them haven't been exactly sterling.  I suppose I should drill down on this a little further and say that the problem isn't really the apps, so to speak.  They work as advertised.  The problem is the women on the other side of the connection.  And that, dear listeners, is one hell of an understatement.  It's a worthy discussion considering that online dating apps are the number one way that couples meet these days.  Linked below.  I suppose at this point, I should quantify that what you're about to hear from me is not to be taken for my impressions of women, generally speaking.  While my personal experience with women generally pairs up fairly well with what you're about to hear... I'm still issuing this declaimer in anticipation of the not-all police showing up in the comments like irate librarians, wound up and ready to unleash all manner of scolding on me for generalizing about women.  If you're a member of that sanctimonious brigade, you can save it.  All I'm doing here is reflecting the views of men I've talked with over the years, men in whom I can find no reason to think or being deceptive or dishonest.  As a matter of fact, I'm talking about men who, for the most part, are motivated to see the best in women they're encountering.  It's their wishful thinking.  They are, after all, seeking women out for everything from casual sexual encounters to long-term relationships and even marriage.  Every time they go into one of those apps, often more than one, they are doing so with the hope that there is one woman in the multitudes with the potential to fulfill their desires for companionship and a great deal more.  These are just guys calling the results of those efforts like they see it, and they are doing so in an environment that openly welcomes their wholehearted honesty.  What these guys see, what they are calling, isn't very pretty.  To begin with, there are the misleading images, or as one man put it to me, every time I see a woman's picture, I add 10 years and 30 pounds in my mind because more often than not, that's what she really looks like.  I suppose to be completely fair that probably not all men are 100% honest on dating apps either.  I'm sure there's a lot of 5'7 men billing themselves as 5'10 or more.  I suppose they've read a lot of women's profiles who plainly state that they don't want a man under 5'10 tall.  Indeed, there is a lot of must-haves on the women's profiles.  But more on that in a few moments.  For starters, let's just focus on what those old scrapbook images really mean for the women posting them.  What does it say about a woman when she uses photos she scarcely even resembles anymore to try to rope in a man?  Any self-respecting denizen of the red pill community already knows the answer.  These are women whose sexual use by date was at the expiration point when their profile pics were actually taken, like a decade ago.  She spent her 20s and possibly her early 30s riding the cock carousel with such enthusiasm that she measures the penis that has plowed through her in miles.  She is trying to hide the years spent with her back and her virtues in repose behind a fake news version of herself.  All to recruit an idiotic beta male who will take care of her and mind well now that her sexual market value has dropped into the subprime area.  The alpha fucks have lost interest in her.  So now she is angling for beta bucks.  And this is where she clings to what remains of that younger, lighter version of herself, to that solipsistic little brat that she still is, ten years after any reason for lofty expectations was captured in a now grainy, misleading photograph.  In short, how she has changed from her youth can only be seen in the mirror.  There is nothing about her internal existence that is fundamentally any different than when she was 13.  Which is to say that the only way she's grown is older and hairier and more annoying.  The fact that there are legions of slobbering men who will tolerate and insist on enabling such stupidity only serves to delude her into thinking she's on the right path, that her list of childish, petulantly worded demands is justified.  And indeed, when you get past the begging-to-be-photoshopped image of Ms.  Wrong, You find that petulantly worded demands pretty much sums up everything she has to bring to the table in a relationship.  She is a symptom of a sick society, circling the drain because the only people left to inhabit it are overgrown children and their enablers.  Which brings me to the other dimension of this discussion, her dating profile.  or in other words, all the very real crap behind the very fake picture of her erstwhile highness.  And the truth in this area is a good deal less attractive than she is.  What the men I've talked to report, and I mean to a man, paints a picture much bleaker than all the post-wall desperation we see in 40-plus throwaways still looking for Mr.  Moneybags.  What the men tell me is that the women on these apps are simple.  All take, no give.  All expectation, no provision.  All me, no you.  These are women who are boldly plain-spoken about what they want, indeed what they demand from a man.  And they demand a lot.  They want a man who knows how to treat a lady, which roughly translates to do what I say and buy me shit.  They want a man, and you can find this on apps everywhere, who treats a woman like a princess.  They like men who love to travel, the subtext being who love to travel and take a woman with them, no expense to her, of course.  They want a man who enjoys the finer things in life, and that subtext being that she, of course, will ultimately be the one enjoying all that fine shit on his dime.  Time and time again, I've queried men on this subject, and time and time again, they've responded with, that's all I see out there.  Time and time again, I've been informed that the only thing that seems to stump these women, to stop them in their tracks, is the dreaded, soul-crushing, female-interest-killing question.  What do you bring to a relationship?  Several men have reported never hearing back from women who they've asked that fatal question.  Others reported women responding to the question with, What do you mean by that?  It's as though they asked in a Martian dialect and were met with pure consternation.  I am reminded of the line from a Don Henley song in which he opines.  I said, now, baby, have you got no shame?  She just looked at me uncomprehendingly like cows at a passing train.  And this is where we're at, folks, on Tinder, on Bumble.  on planet Earth.  This is, as far as I can tell, the defective, malignant pool from which men feel compelled to select.  And the options available?  Look past the fake photos and infantile demands and try to find something, anything, that doesn't smell like rotten kimchi.  Needless to say, when men ask me what can be done about this, the only thing I can tell them is the truth.  That the pool they're looking at, the modern estrogen ghetto, isn't just a dating app.  It's a microcosm of our entire society.  Until women change, nothing changes.  And women won't change as long as there are millions of blue pill idiot men giving them reasons not to.  So, settle in for the long haul, guys, and be prepared to do the only same thing left to do in these circumstances.  Swipe left.  And that is it for this talk, gents.  As always, I hope you've enjoyed, even if you haven't, and we'll see you next time.  Thank you. ",
