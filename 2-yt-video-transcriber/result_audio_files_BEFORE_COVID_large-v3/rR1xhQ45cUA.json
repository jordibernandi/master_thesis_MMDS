Not only did he solve Bible contradictions, not only does he have an awesome name, and not only will he solve Bible sexism in my upcoming Into the Zodverse video, but as we'll see today, he actually proved God.  Amazing, right?  I guess all the other apologists might as well hang it up and go get day jobs, because this magnificent bastard actually did it.  Now before we get started, I should do what I always forget to do and tell you to like, comment and subscribe and all that.  And if you think my channel is worth supporting, you can find a link to my Patreon page in the description box.  But that's all up to you.

I look for one and never found one, except as a principle of Buddhism, and I got a lot of feedback from others saying the same.  But whether or not it is a law really doesn't matter, because the act of calling something a law doesn't dictate that a stated principle always counts for all eternity in all situations.  All it means is a group of people, perhaps well-qualified people with good reasons, notice that something always seems to happen within the universe as we've observed it so far.  but there are almost certainly exceptions to this law.  Just thinking back far enough into the past seems to show that our intuitive idea of cause and effect must break down at some point, and quantum physics, in ways I'll admit I don't understand, is starting to reveal that not everything in the universe behaves according to cause, effect, and even time as we understand it.  But of course, Butt, like most apologists, counts on his audience to have an exaggerated layman's understanding of what is meant by a law for reasons I think we can all see coming.  Also, did you notice how he just kind of throws in a statement that the cause must be greater than the effect?  This is wrong on so many levels, both scientific and semantic, and it's clear he just tacked this wording on with no scientific reason whatsoever, just so he can say the earliest and ultimate cause must be greater than everything else.  to insinuate it must be... What again?  What's he want it to be?  Oh yeah, God.  Because in case you forgot, we have a teensy reason to be suspicious that he's loading his definitions to ensure that wherever the argument leads, always leads to God. ",

He also doesn't make it easy not to interrupt all the time because he keeps throwing out all these little bits of wording that slip misleading insinuations into the minds of Christians if they go unanswered.  Here he says that the idea of a singularity is popular today, giving his audience the impression that it's just kind of a trendy little guess people are currently making to give themselves an alternative to believing in God.  This idea that non-Christians need an alternative to believing in God, that being a Christian is just kind of the starting default position and people including scientists just invent things like singularities and evolution so they'll have an excuse to stop believing, unfortunately makes sense to Christians who mainly view the world from inside their religion.  And I think that's what Butt's appealing to here.  But the idea of a singularity isn't just a silly thing that's become popular today.  Cosmologists and astrophysicists have constructed solid models that give pretty conclusive reason to think the universe as we now see it expanded from one.  So it's the result of scientists observing the universe and methodically trying to understand how it works, not some crazy attempt to come up with a wild guess about where everything came from as an alternative to Christian's wild guess about where everything came from.  Also, it wasn't an explosion, so that was definitely misleading and probably on purpose. ",

He said that the idea of something popping into existence from nothing is not a scientific idea.  Fair enough, I guess.  Kind of on an intuitive level to the average person.

He creates two categories.  one is the natural and one is the supernatural.  And he suggests that everything in the natural category must always follow laws of nature, so that if something does not follow one of them, it does not belong in the natural category and could only logically occur within the supernatural category.  And since he deduces that the origin of the universe could not occur according to these laws, it must have been a supernatural event.  then, you know, hurries his audience past all other possibilities that could fall under the label of supernatural and straight not only to God, but to the Christian God.  Since, of course, he's on a journey to find the truth wherever the arguments take him.  But what's more likely?  That the supernatural exists?  That a divide between the natural and the supernatural even makes logical and linguistic sense?  And that if we discover a phenomenon that seems to contradict previous observations we've labeled as laws, it must not be part of nature?  Or maybe, just maybe, when our written observations about part of the universe seem to conflict with what we observe in other parts of the universe, that just means the laws we've used to assist us in describing nature are incomplete or incorrect and need to be modified.  Thousands of years ago, humans might have been pretty well justified in establishing a law that unconscious objects fall down instead of up, and a religious apologist of that day might claim that since the sun doesn't follow this law, it cannot be natural and thus must be supernatural.  Then of course rush you straight to the conclusion that the supernatural thing must be Apollo.  But what was wrong in this situation?  The behavior of the sun, or the established scientific law?  The answer is painfully obvious in hindsight.  Nobody has ever ended up being right by jumping to religious conclusions using arguments like this.  And I somehow doubt Mr.  Butt, or William Lane Craig or all the dozens of others, since Butt is plagiarizing the f*** out of this argument, will manage to be the first. ",

Objects in nature taking the space they take in nature and fulfilling the role they inevitably play in nature may seem to be doing what they do well and thus give the intuitive but misleading impression of being designed.  There are a lot of reasons for this.  partly when dealing with life having to do with natural selection and a lot of it is honestly as simple as the fact that within any system pieces designed or not will fill roles such that an observer within the system like a human might stand in stupefied primitive awe of how things naturally work.  then of course apologists come by and take advantage of this sense of awe to make a career of proving god.  It's easy to forget that we humans are looking at the universe from the inside as part of the universe and are thus vulnerable to all kinds of tricks of perception about it.  And of course not only is it normal that we might pattern our attempts at shaping nature after what we see in nature, but it's to be expected that we, as small feeble parts of nature simply trying to replicate things, won't necessarily create technology that's better than nature.  But does our inability to do this imply that nature is designed by someone greater?  Or could it be that we as humans are egocentric and thus not only overestimate our own expected ability to design things, but project our process of altering nature to design stuff onto the cosmos, thus tricking us into thinking it came from a bigger supernatural version of ourselves?  But what's more likely?  That humans need food and found ways to get it by adapting to our environment, then fell into misguided awe of the inevitable fact that food is available for the people who survive to find it?  Or that God designed us to die unless we constantly fueled our bodies with the dead remains of other creatures he'd made, then gave us the means to, with great struggle and varying levels of success, compensate for this absurd weakness he'd created as part of his design?  What's more likely?  That cheetahs and antelope both survived extinction because of traits they developed over time and each still struggled to find food or escape being food?  Or that God for some reason created this weird, internally escalating loop by designing the cheetah with a speed necessary to catch the antelope?  that's good at escaping the cheetah because God had intelligently designed the antelope to be quick at escaping the cheetah because it was so fast?  What's more likely?  That God created an inexcusably piss-poor eye, then designed the brain to compensate for it?  or that we've evolved extremely imperfect and imprecisely assembled traits that still worked well enough together to ensure our survival.  Intelligent design advocates seem to forget that if God designed something to solve a problem, he had also designed the problem itself.  Thus, the very idea of intelligent design pretty quickly collapses upon itself with even the most meager investigation. ",
