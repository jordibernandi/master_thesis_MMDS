            "text": "Thank you.  How about out there?  Was there any problems looking through that, your apartment?  I'll talk to my lawyer first, but I don't think it would be a problem.  You want to talk to your lawyer first?  So you wouldn't have a problem just looking through your car?  That'd be okay?  Like I said, I'll talk to my lawyer, but I don't think that would be a problem.  Okay.  How about your apartment then?  I have to check with him on that.  You have to check with your lawyer?  Yeah.  Well, answer me this.  What do you recommend?  I'm not answering no more questions without my lawyer.  Why do you think you failed the polygraph?  Just answer me that question.  I'm not answering no more questions without my lawyer.  How long do I got to be down here?  Until you tell me where she's at.  So you're saying you can keep me down here?  You can keep me down here?  I didn't say that.  Well, actually, can I go?  Did I say that?  No, I'm just asking, can I go?  Because I did everything y'all didn't ask me to do.  I'm ready to go home.  I'm saying if you got some moments, lock me up.  If you don't, I'm ready to go home.  Why aren't you going to tell me the truth?  I'm asking you, can I leave?  So you didn't have to come drag me down or I came down here on my own.  I'm asking you, can I leave?  Okay.  Are you going to come back if I ask you to come back?  Sure.  I came down here when you asked me to come, didn't I?  You didn't see me say, no, I'm not going to come down here.  No, I'm not going to take it.  I appreciate your cooperation.  I didn't come for the polygraph test.  Okay, I meant it.  I didn't want that.  But like I said, I wouldn't do nothing to hurt Sandy.  If you got something against me or if you want me down here again, I would be right back down here. ",
