            "text": "Well, the news in Marxist circles in the recent weeks was the disturbing incident that took place with the Democratic Socialists of America meeting inside of Kansas.  Now, the organization was assaulted by a group of people who didn't particularly identify themselves, but said that they were Maoists and that they were part of an anti-revisionist squad determined to fight fake socialists inside Kansas.  of the United States.  And thus, as a result, what they decided to do was actually attack a DSA meeting.  They confiscated what they called propaganda.  They attacked members.  Apparently, it eventually devolved into violence.  And there is some discrepancy on who actually initiated the violence, etc.  But we'll put that aside for now.  I mean, that's the kind of situation that you know is going to blow up into violence anyway.  Here's my question.  What did attacking a DSA meeting actually accomplish?  I mean, what did that achieve?  to these Maoists.  And it's interesting that this occurs in the same area where the Red Guards Kansas are and serve the people Kansas are before they went dark for whatever reason.  And it's just strange that this happens in the same area that they do.  It almost seems like they're very much the same kind of people.  And that's something that these so-called Red Guard organizations in the United States keep doing.  The L.A.  Red Guards, the Austin Red Guards, who went and attacked the PSL because the PSL was doing a protest against U.S.  aggression against Venezuela.  Why would you attack that?  It's anti-imperialism.  And that's the primary contradiction, in the very least, according to Mao.  So it doesn't make any sense.  Either they're fully ideologically and morally bankrupt, or this is COINTELPRO.  Now, I want to answer this action from two different perspectives.  First, I want to answer it from the Third Worldist perspective.  And the Third Worldist perspective says that this whole thing, attacking these people, was a complete waste of time.  That was complete nonsense.  It accomplished absolutely nothing.  If anything, it only would make your organization look stupid.  It's meaningless.  I mean, you'd be a lot better off... attacking some kind of fascist group, you'd be better off just doing what the Black Bloc does.  You'd be way better off, and you would accomplish, I'd say a lot more, but you would accomplish something.  You're not accomplishing anything.  So by doing what the Black Bloc does, you would accomplish a lot more by comparison doing what they did and then accomplish nothing.  So it would be a meaningless effort.  From the first worldist perspective, this action was also dumb.  What is the point in attacking these people?  Obviously the DSA are not socialists.  I mean, that much is blatantly obvious.  But what would be the point of going to their meetings, stealing their literature, and getting into a fight with them?  What did that really accomplish?  If we were to go by the premise that there's a revolutionary potential in the first world, in this case, the United States, then we would, and being a Maoist, you would at least understand the principle of Mao that says don't hit out in all directions.  I mean, this is one of the really important principles of Mao Zedong thought.  You know, there's some people who are not communists, but they're like X percentage communist or X percentage socialist, and they should be won over to our cause,  etc.,  This would be like a kind of basic Maoism thing.  And they're not following that.  So... Again, I return to the point.  I mean, I would suggest looking up Don't Hit Out in All Directions.  It's good work.  It would explain a lot of things.  It eventually flows its way into unity struggle.  Unity, you know, you unite with people on things they agree with.  You struggle with them over what you disagree with this, and then unite them again after having won them over to your position.  You know, negation of the negation kind of thing.  But they're blatantly throwing that out the window.  Now, I could possibly understand why they would throw that out the window if they were Third Worldist, and this would still be a stupid action from a Third Worldist perspective.  But to knowingly support First World Revolution and believing there's a revolutionary potential in the First World, that would still not make any sense.  So I'm even tempted to say that this was pure co-Intel work.  I mean, if it wasn't actually co-Intel Pro, I mean, these guys might as well hit them up for a job because they seem perfectly suited for it.  They're just wrecking.  I mean, this wouldn't mean anything.  Like, if you went into a white supremacist rally and smashed them up, that would make sense.  But from a First Worldist perspective, it would make more sense to go in there and try to win them over to your side rather than just destroy them.  That's not to say that the DSA are socialists.  No, they're not.  But, you know, theoretically, according to the First Worldist belief, they could be won over to that position.  I would disagree, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt from their own ideological position.  So this whole situation of simply going in and attacking people who really present no threat to them, really, was kind of really was a waste.  You'd be a lot better off going after white supremacist groups.  But we keep seeing that from these so-called Red Guard organizations attacking other Marxist groups, going out there attacking, harassing, and physically attacking the PSL for protesting against imperialism, which is a good thing.  I don't know why you would attack them for that.  Going after membership of the IWW, particularly the leaders of, local leaders of the IWW, and slashing their tires, which is beyond me.  That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  You'd think you'd want workers to unionize in the First World, so it makes no sense that you would attack them at all, based on some Puritan principle, which isn't even properly expressed publicly by them, so I'm not even sure what it is.  But regardless, these are completely nonsensical actions by the Red Guards Kansas.  It doesn't even make any sense.  So I think it's a time that if anybody isn't looking at them sideways at this point, wondering if they're cops, now would really be a good time to start doing that because these actions are more than suspicious.  These actions are outright reactionary.  Thank you for watching.  If you like this program, then please head over to my Patreon page and set up a monthly donation.
