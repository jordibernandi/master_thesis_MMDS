            "text": "So Joe Rogan made a video, the York-Joe Rogan Experience 1315, where he had Bob Lazar on it.  And the description for the video is, Bob Lazar is a physicist who worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.  Okay, well, technically, I guess, sort of.  And also on reverse engineering, extraterrestrial technology, etc.  So basically Joe Rogan is lying in his description right here in order to back up the con man he is featuring on his show in typical Joe Rogan style.  Okay, let's just break this down.  Bob Lazar is a physicist.  Alright, clearly Joe Rogan is putting this in here because he wants his audience to believe that Bob Lazar is some kind of accredited physicist that he went to college and he got a degree in physics.  And Bob Lazar says he went to MIT and some other school.  I'll look it up in a second.  But so Joe Ryan clearly is just backing up Bob Lazar's lies about this.  But the truth is Bob Lazar is not actually a physicist.  I mean, he might be like in the sense that anybody can be a physicist.  You can research the stuff on the Internet and do some experiments and stuff you've got on the Internet and become a physicist.  But.  He's not an accredited physicist in any way, which we're going to show you in a minute.  He basically is just a con man.  He's a liar that lied about going to MIT.  It's been proven that he fucking lied.  And Joe Rogan did not bring this up in any possible way.  Basically, the whole episode was Joe Rogan treating this guy like he's an honest person, treating this guy like he's telling the absolute truth, and Joe Rogan being fascinating.  And then Joe Rogan recommended the guy.  And he even tells the guy at the end, I don't see any reason that you would be lying. ",

            "text": "So... Just bullshit spread by Joe Rogan.  Let's look into Bob Lezzar a little bit.  Like I said, this dude was debunked back in the fucking 90s, right?  I'll look this up for yourself.  Feel free to fact check me, please, because I'm telling the truth.  You can actually see it for yourself if you go research it.  I guess we could just look at his... Let's just look at his Wikipedia page.  That's literally all Joe Rogan had to do.  Now, Joe Rogan definitely knows he has to.  He had to have gone up and researched this guy a little bit.  I mean, I refuse to believe Joe Rogan knows nothing about this guy whatsoever.  But he chooses not to share the information with his audience, which is dishonest.  If he knows that the guy's lying about his credentials, if he knows that he's a dishonest person, if he lies about his credentials, there's a good chance he's lying about everything else he says.  I mean, why would you lie and say you went to MIT if you didn't go to MIT and then be telling the truth about everything else?  But Joe Rogan never mentions that, never brings it up to his audience because he doesn't give a shit.  He doesn't want you to know that this guy's a liar.  He wants to mislead you because he just cares about ratings.  Joe Rogan just doesn't give a fuck.  Lazarus states that he holds a master's degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, and a master's degree in electronic technology from the California Institute of Technology, Caltech.  So I've literally looked this up.  What he did was they've asked him, hey, can you back this up?  Can you tell us who some of your professors are at your college?  And he names two professors, and they went and looked it up, and neither one of these professors went to MIT or taught at MIT.  One of them taught at a local community college, which Lazar attended, and the other one was Lazar's high school teacher.  That's who he brought up when they asked him to name his professor.  So he's been proven, outright proven, to be a liar.  MIT says they have no record of him.  He claims that the government went in and they... They disappeared him from the record.  They didn't kill him and disappear him from the earth, but they somehow went back and they disappeared him from the records at MIT.  They somehow, they wiped the minds of all the teachers where nobody there remembers him and all the students.  And so he's a liar, basically.  The guy's a fucking con artist.  He's been a con artist since the fucking 70s.  And Joe Rogan's just like, yeah, those guys are fetishes.  That's the first thing you're going to do in technology.  And it's so disappointing because wasn't Joe Rogan supposed to be the guy that questioned everything?  Didn't he like literally do a show?  Let me look.  Joe Rogan.  questions, everything.  Boom, let's see what comes up.  Yeah, fucking he had a show, right?  He had a show, Juggler in Cushion, everything.  And he had this guy on his fucking channel, and he didn't question shit, man.  He didn't fucking bring up one goddamn thing.  He basically just agrees with the guy the whole time, even though the guy was so full of fucking shit. ",

No.  He wants you to believe this is true, and his audience does believe this is true.  People say, it's okay he has these people on there without challenging them because his audience know better.
