            "text": "Stirring the coffee with chopsticks using the vortex method.  The only true way to optimize the taste of your coffee at the molecular level.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Daybreak Show.  I am the Sultan.  We'll get started.  But first, coffee.  Perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  Now that's a way to start a Monday morning.  That was half Indian monsoon.  that was from John Williams.  Gift from John Williams who got it from St.  John's Roasters or St.  Thomas Roasters.  I'm getting my Virgin Islands mixed up in Linglestown, PA.  And the other half of the beans were from Maryland, from Justin Darling.  That was a gift from one of my clients.  So I put them together and the blend is out of this world.  But I'm going to have to do more of that Indian Monsoon.  Wow, that's really good.  So I'm going to start looking for that Probably roasting my own Indian monsoon beans.  That would be good.  Would you rather have, and I took a poll, would you rather have fame or fortune?  4% said fame.  96% said fortune.  And I thought that was interesting.  That's almost, that reminds me of the question, like if you won the Powerball lottery, Would you rather take the annuity, which is like the payout over 20 years, or would you want the lump sum?  And there are good arguments for both.  I've always heard some people have made the most compelling argument for take the lump sum because with proper financial person, you can do a lot with that money.  You can really let it work for you.  And then some of the comments... that came as a result of this were pretty darn brilliant.  Fortune because you can use it to become, you can use it to become if you want, if you want.  or you can use your fortune to hide.  I don't.  Fortune because you can use it to become, okay, probably meant what you want.  or you can use it, use your fortune to hide.  One person said, I'm good as long as I have my pipe and people leave me alone, I'm happy.  Invisibility.  Fame makes you a target.  Fame is a chore.  Fortune is power.  Social proof is greater than big green.  Fortune equals freedom.  Depends on what I'm famous for and how I worked to get my fortune.  Fortune, enough to pay the bills and let me ride the motorcycle when I want.  There's a lot of good answers, but I always thought this was really good.  This one jumped out at me.  A smart man can easily turn fame into a fortune.  Hmm.  Interesting.  That's thinking beyond.  The lump sum, the fortune that just magically appears.  It's leveraging the fame into fortune.  Now, of course, there was no definite number given here.  $10 million, $5 million, we don't know.  But I thought that was interesting.  That kind of stood out for me.  Comment of the year in 2018.  Still interesting.  Vortex, what?  You ain't doing nothing with them.  chopsticks, bitch.  Absolute best comment of all time.  You bicker like an old married couple.  Ever hear that phrase?  I know you have.  Why does bicker, old and married show up in the same sentence?  Because if marriage is not done right... That's how it ends up, bickering like an old married couple.  It becomes a colloquialism, an idiom.  Even just two people, even just two buddies, just arguing over what beer is the best, and the waitress might come along and say, man, you two guys are bickering like an old married couple.  Or if people are dating, or people who are friends.  Bickering like an old marriage.  Isn't it a shame that marriage has to be... The metaphor has to include marriage and bickering.  God.  Are you in that?  Are you bickering like an old married couple?  Man, I don't want that.  I do not want that.  I don't want to bicker like a young married couple.  I don't want to bicker like anyone married.  Period.  Okay, here's a rant on alcoholism.  Alcohol.  Some people drink daily to intoxication.  Their personality changes.  The people closest to them cannot discuss it.  Or the subject controls them without bursts, anger, and passive-aggressive behavior.  They bear the scars of accidents, legal issues, and social isolation.  They're in for an early death and a lot of suffering and medical issues before they die.  Their whole life revolves around three things.  Getting drunk, recovering from being drunk, sleeping it off, and then gearing up for being drunk, which is usually their work day.  Think about it.  You work all day long.  Think about the person who drinks too much.  They work all day long.  What they're doing is gearing up for that 5 o'clock cocktail.  They get drunk quickly initially.  Shots or heavy stuff first.  Then it's easier to drink more.  They have trained the people around them to live with it to the point where those people make excuses for them, doing things by themselves and let the subject do their thing.  Just let him do his thing.  Let her do her thing.  It gets to the point of pure emotional survival for the codependent, for the wife, for the husband, for the person who's living with the alcoholic.  The entire household can never be normal unless all intoxicating substances are purged.  The codependent's life is... is like trying to dance with a drunk person.  Even their moves are to compensate for the alcoholic.  Excuses, stories, lack of social life, isolation.  Alcoholism is but a slow terminal illness for some and those that love them.  Do you have someone like that in your life?  Put it in the comments.  You don't have to reveal names.  I just watched on YouTube an interview that Tim Russert had with Donald Trump.  Think about it.  Tim Russert.  Good interview.  Almost prophetic.  But can you believe that Tim Russert has been dead for over 10 years now?  I can still hear Tim Russert's voice in my head like it was yesterday.  I loved his journalistic style.  Loved it.  If you liked Tim Russert, comment down below.  Tell me what you think of Tim Russert.  Play it pretty for Atlanta.  Ronnie Van Zant.  You stay close to the people who supported and encouraged you on your way up.  Smart move.  You're all fired.  In three days, everyone's welcome to reapply and interview for a new job.  That's how you clean house.  I'll share that with you sometime.  I did that.  Leave the gun.  Take the guacamole.  El Padrino.  Regarding gender, some say the phrases, you hear these phrases, she's got looks and smarts.  or he's got brains and brawn.  Discuss what comes to mind when you hear looks and smarts and brains and brawn.  Got my tweed pressed.  Got my best vest.  All I need now is the girl.  Got my striped tie.  Got my hopes high.  Frank Sinatra, 1968.  The Collectors was released on Saturday night.  I hope you saw that.  A little bit different documentary on people and their fountain pens, the people that collect.  I hope you liked it.  If you haven't watched it, please do so.  One of the comments says, I swear this could be a modern-day PBS special.  I could see the Discovery or History Channel doing an Anthony Bourdain-type show where you travel the world talking and interacting on subjects about coffee, pipes, and cultural wisdom.  It would be a home run.  That's from Jason Weems.  Jason, I agree with you.  I think it would be a hit.  I like the Anthony Bourdain style of show.  It's a shame about Anthony Bourdain, what happened to him, how he offed himself because of a girl.  Not depression.  It was because of a girl.  Changed my mind on that.  Men, do not let your roller coaster life be called depression.  Well, I guess I must be depressed.  No, you made the wrong choices.  Now, is there such thing as clinical depression?  I do believe there are biological downs and biological ups that we can use.  I believe that most of the time when people use the word depression, what they really mean... is discouragement.  The answer for depression is medication.  The answer for discouragement is courage.  Rather than going for psychotherapy, how about going for courage?  Therapists talk about the past.  A good coach talks about the future and the courage that you need to approach your future, grab it by the balls, make money, have healthy relationships, be productive, and live a life worth living.  Let's read a letter.  Good afternoon, Sultan.  I'm semi-retired at the moment or semi-stuck.  I'm 63 years old.  I was the president of a telecommunications company in the Philadelphia area for over 20 years.  Director of operations for the... I'm not going to give the name because I don't know how private that this person wants me to keep this.  Director of operations for the XYZ for 10 years.  I became a widower as of 1-23-19.  So January 23rd.  This man's Wife passed away after 36 years of marriage.  A different form of grief than divorce, I would imagine.  A topic you may want to touch on in the future.  The Daybreak Show is my morning meditation, and you are a breath of fresh air, my brother.  Continued success.  Peace.  And then he gives his name.  And my response is, that is a good interview.  That is a good topic for future.  I do have many people who are widows and widowers, and I will bring that up.  And I would imagine that some of my teaching on the 50 things that you will feel after a breakup or divorce do apply to you after a spouse dies.  So, sir, we will be in touch.  Thank you for your letters.  I do appreciate that.  And I will be reaching out to you.  Somehow, I want to get your phone number if you're local, and we'll talk.  We'll do an interview.  I think maybe it might be too early, I don't know, for you to talk about it on camera.  And even if we don't press record, I would still like to talk to you.  Okay.  And then over here is 400 writing prompts and a fountain pen that was made for me by a subscriber.  You remember a gentleman made a fountain pen out of Madagascar ebony.  So finish your coffee and I'll see you tomorrow on the Daybreak Show.  And links for this will be down below.  Okay. ",
