Because principle number one, it's about the reintegration of the national territory.  It's about that.  the National Party believes that the territory of Ireland consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.  But I want to say this to you, the National Party principle number one, The scope of that principle extends even beyond that wording.  It's not just about the territorial reunification of this country.  It's not just about the final ending of foreign British rule in the six counties of this country.  It's not just about that.  It's not just about taking back our fishing waters, re-establishing Irish sovereignty over the whole country.  It's about bringing about the unity of the Irish people. ",

It is a flaw that has been exploited by others, that has enabled others to come over here and to conquer and to colonise and pillage and rape and steal and subjugate our country for centuries.

The division between the green and the orange.  The divisions that occurred back in 1922 because of the treaty.  The divisions between people who have allowed establishment political parties, now globalist political parties, to use the mass media, to use the Griggs system, to manipulate public opinion, and we have people divided.
