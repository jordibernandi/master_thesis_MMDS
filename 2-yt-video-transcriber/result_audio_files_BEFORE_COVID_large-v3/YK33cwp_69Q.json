            "text": "So, this is a very particular video response I'm going to be making.  It's not really even so much like a response to a video, but maybe multiple videos, maybe dynamics.  particular to a YouTube channel I actually have grown very, very fond of.  The person who runs the YouTube channel is MondayBlue3 or ForeverLongMonday, something like that.  I just call him Monday.  Maybe I can just look at whatever.  It's not important.  What is important is I think Monday, without a shadow of a doubt, is kind of one of my favorite, and I don't like using this word, incels.  Fine.  It pains me to say no.  Um, He doesn't like using the word incel either.  He refers to himself as like forever alone or so, but again, I understand people get what the word incel means.  I think it's a dumbass word, but at least you understand it.  But he's one of the best examples I oftentimes feel for a lot of different reasons, not only for his analytical mind.  But I think for how much of a human he is, you know, and if you watch his videos, you probably don't really like, you know, kind of grasp what I mean when I say how human he is, right?  You know, because his voice is or his presentation is very by the books.  He's very robotic.  You know, he doesn't really like inflect his voice, you know, not like me, not like me, like portraying different characters and, you know, doing my accent, you know.  Or laughing a lot.  He doesn't really do a lot of that.  He'll either read data or he'll just explain his thought process.  But when I say that he's really human, especially as an incel, is that you can see that there's a deep pain in his heart for his experiences.  And I've talked about incels a lot and a lot of people get caught.  On so many different things on himself, particularly the rage and anger and the misogyny and the frustration.  But with Monday here, you don't really get that at all.  You can't really see that.  He's not misogynistic in any particular way, which I'll talk about in just a second as well.  But what I think is one of the most important things about Monday is there is a sadness and a depression to him.  that you can hear in his voice, that you can see in his eyes, that he's torn up about his experiences.  And I think that he's a real person.  He puts a real face to what a lot of people see, again, like on anonymous image boards.  And you see on incel.co, or you see on Reddit, you see all these usernames.  But Monday, you actually see a person talking about his life and how difficult it's been.  And one of the most particular things about Monday that I've always felt is that this guy... should have been someone's dad like 15 years ago.  Not just because he looks like he's someone's dad, but I mean, he's a pretty intelligent, reasonable guy.  I don't know him personally, but he seems to be pretty switched on on a lot of different things.  I know I'm just spending a lot of time complimenting him, but I really do like this guy's channel.  The thing I really kind of wanted to comment upon, though... is uh... there's a video.  i wouldn't call it a video series but he uploaded multiple videos where he was talking to a woman named anika skywalker or anika.  she actually i'm pretty sure a lot of people know her a lot better than you know me.  actually she used to have a pretty popular youtube channel.  i'm not very familiar with her.  I know she's been on the internet a couple of times.  I know she argued with Roosh V before.  I'm just not the most familiar with her.  But the long and short of it is they met each other and they've made multiple different videos where they're kind of talking about incels and femcells and all of that.  And I kind of want to talk about two things in particular.  And the first thing I wanted to talk about was their clear and obvious attraction for each other.  Because I had a point.  I was going to make a point.  But I have to renege on that point.  And you'll see why when I make it right now.  So they made their first video podcast about an hour long.  And it was clear as day, at least to me.  It was obvious to me that that woman was attracted to them.  Come on.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  No, but seriously.  And maybe it's because I spend a lot of time thinking about social interactions and I think about people.  I know I'm an awkward son of a bitch, but I'm awkward mostly by choice.  As in, I understand social tact perfectly well.  I just don't like it.  I may come off as autistic, but it's only because I... Ironically, I understand it perfectly well and it's because of my understanding of social tact that I don't give a fuck about it.  Um... Which a lot of people probably will see.  I think I made a lot of... All Booty, No Personality, Volume 1, where I talked about this one lady I tried to talk to.  I wasn't even trying to spit game to her, actually, which is why I didn't really give too much of a fuck about, like, really being appealing to her as much as I kind of wanted to understand where she was coming from.  So, like, I didn't really put my best face forward.  And that's the thing a lot of people do, actually, when they spit game or when they, like, talk to new individuals.  They put their best foot forward and they try to skirt around, like, safe... topics, they try to skirt around people, try to make them not feel uncomfortable and all of that jazz.  My whole point is kind of like... Explain this as I understand people pretty well.  I understand social interactions pretty well.  So to me, watching Monday interact with Anika, it was clear to me that this woman was attracted to him.  It was obvious.  Not only just the way she looked, how comfortable she was around him, how much eye contact they were making, how much fun they were having.  I mean, more than anything, they were just having so much fun.  She was having a blast, like being in his presence.  It was clear as day to me to see this.  And I made a comment on his video and I said, you know, it's interesting because... And this is kind of like a shorthand.  I mean, you could find my comment somewhere on there.  But I was like, basically, you can see that this woman's attracted to this guy, but... At the end of the day, will she date this guy?  Will she be with him long term?  And we all know that she won't.  She won't be with him.  Now, the reason why I was thinking initially that she wouldn't want to be with him is because in that video in particular, she spent a lot of time trying to find his problem and nitpick his issues instead of scooping that man out for herself.  Because, I mean, to me, I know I'm projecting, but I'm just like, to me, if I find me a good woman, you know what I mean?  I'm not.  I'm not going to be trying to solve her issues and try to get her out into the dating market to find other guys.  I'm trying to get that woman to be with me.  I'm just saying, come on, you know what I mean?  So, like, I'm not going to try to help her date other people.  So, I was, and I was incorrect here.  I know I was incorrect because later Monday made a video where he talks about, he did do stuff with her.  I don't know, he didn't give any details, but he did stuff with her, you know, so.  But the long and short of it is I was wrong about them mixing fancies.  But the reason why I initially thought that there was no way that she would date him is because a lot of the time I see lots of women do this.  There'll be women who will friend zone guys.  You know, I'll promote the concept of friend zone.  But they'll put guys in this undateable category.  They'll be able to say, oh, you're very handsome.  You're very good looking.  But they'll never date him.  They'll never want to be with that guy.  Now, there's lots of different reasons as to why that I've come up with.  You have fear of intimacy is one of the biggest ones.  You have obliviousness.  You have lack of attraction.  Now, lack of attraction simply means that he doesn't tickle her fancies.  You know, a lot of guys who have that edge and who are dangerous, that bad boy archetype, the fuck boy, all that bullshit.  You know, we can clearly say they have that edge.  You know, they have that nastiness to them that challenges women.  and make them want to change them and make women want to kind of master their aggression for their own principles.  Or it fuels that woman's desire to be special to that man in particular.  That's one of the biggest drives for a lot of younger ladies is they want to feel special.  And if they see guys who are at the top of the social hierarchy, and they're not really honorable and good people, but they're at the top, they're the most popular, they try to become special by hanging on or clinging on to that guy and obtaining him.  You know what I mean?  And so... You have lots of different women and they'll see really good options, but they'll never pick them.  And what I was originally going to be talking about in this video in particular was how a lot of Monday's problems may not actually even be his own.  Because even I as a young man growing up, a lot of people know this, but when I first started trying to date women, I never thought for a moment that the issue wasn't me.  I always thought I was the problem.  I always thought that I was doing something wrong with a lot of these different girls that I talked to.  Because it didn't make any sense.  Because I treated them well.  And more than I just treated them.  well, I genuinely cared about them.  I was not trying to smash and dash.  I had... resolve myself to be a virgin until I got married.  So my desire for these girls was never sexual.  Which it isn't me saying that I thought they were ugly or unattractive.  It was just that I literally put the sexual thoughts away.  I didn't even masturbate to them.  It may have been too much information.  I didn't even masturbate to these girls.  I didn't think sexually of them because I didn't want my sexual desire to overcloud me genuinely caring about them as people.  I always thought they were attractive.  I always thought they were beautiful.  But that was never why I liked them.  You know, and being so genuine with these women, I thought I was the problem because I was like, I just don't understand.  How can I care about these women so much?  They just don't care.  They just don't like me.  They just don't accept it.  I was like, what am I doing wrong?  It took me a very long time before I came to terms with... Maybe there's nothing wrong with me.  And it took a lot.  And there's lots of stories.  There's lots of things I'm omitting.  My journey to this realization is very long.  It can be its own video series.  I intended on making it its own video series one of these days.  But the long and short of it is, it took me a long time to finally say, I don't think that I'm the problem.  And I don't think Monday... I think Monday sometimes skirts around that in some of the videos I've seen.  But I do think a huge portion of the issue... is not monday and i think that's kind of one of the most important things that i wanted to i wanted to give to people when it came to incels because there's always a lot of focus on what incels are doing wrong.  there's never a focus on what on what our culture in general is doing wrong when it comes to dating, when it comes to relationships because as much as incels are not having success you have the fem-cells who I shouldn't even call them fem-cells because they're just fucking normal women.  They're not even, they're just women, you know what I mean?  You have women who are so upset at the fact that they get smashed and dashed, you know what I mean?  They can't have good relationships, you know what I mean?  Or they have this heuristic that men are nasty And men are going to hurt them or do something bad to them because of their negative experiences constantly.  You have so much dysfunction and you very seldom have success.  And it's interesting when you finally find some people who are successful are still kind of dysfunctional in their own way.  As in like they get into relationships and then they start getting abused, you know what I mean?  Or they get into relationships.  And then they have all these crazy fetishes to keep them together.  They have these open relationships, which defeats the purpose.  They have cuckoldry, again, defeating the purpose.  And you'll then have that kind of element.  There's a lot to it that I've only barely scratched the surface of.  The long and short of it, my whole point in saying all of this is that when I look at Monday and I see how analytical he is, I honestly don't really even see a man that genuinely has a lot of fucking problems.  And even though he considers his, I guess, relationship with Anika, I don't really know if they DTR'd, but just for sake of this video, their relationship with each other, he considers it to be a fluke.  But honestly, it shouldn't be.  Because he's a fucking great guy.  You know what I mean?  I can kind of recognize, you know, he's been told that he's been handsome quite a bit, but he just has had no success.  And I won't attribute all of that, honestly, to Monday, which isn't me saying that.  Some people might think that I'm saying that incels or whatever, for other guys, or even I myself didn't need to improve.  I'm not saying that at all.  I'm not saying that I was a perfect guy.  I'm not saying that Monday's the perfect guy.  There isn't anything he's weak in.  I'm not saying that incels can't self-improve and incels can't become better people.  In fact, I encourage that they do.  But my ultimate point is that a lot of the time, the focus is on, as men, you have to become better and prove yourself worthy to women.  That's the message our whole lives.  We've got to figure out what's wrong with us.  But the truth of the matter is, that's only half of the issue.  Because even when you are a good, strong, loving man, You will fail to get into a relationship.  My ex-girlfriend did not break up with me because I was a shitty person.  She broke up with me because I was a good person.  And I remember the text message off the top of my head.  I'm not going to say it all.  I remember that shit because it just threw me for a loop.  This girl broke up with me because I like talking and commitment and trying to make things work and talking it out.  I'm about to read the text message naturally.  My whole point... Is that, you know, the only girlfriend I ever had broke up with me because I was a good person.  That's why she ended the relationship.  Because I loved her.  Because I cared about her.  I mean, I didn't really love her at the time.  That's a whole fucking story I won't get into.  The long and short of it is, there are good men who try to care about women and love women.  And they just fail.  You know what I mean?  And I'm not sure.  Monday... He isn't kind of in that category that I'm describing, but my whole point in describing that category is to say that you have these perfectly good men and they're feeling too because the other half of the issue is not simply and then sells are ugly air that these men are ugly and these men are weak willed.  the other issue that i've talked about for years is that the feminine side.  and i think monday you know not only just because i like his commentary i like his uh... his authenticity you know i really do you think that he's a great person and i just want him to be successful and his love life.  i really do because this guy he fucking needs to be someone's father.  he's he's.  he says that he's a great guy.  She should have been someone's father a long time ago.  He really should have been.  But it's not only just.  I really want to see him be successful.  I do think that Monday himself kind of has to acknowledge he's a pretty good guy.  You know what I mean?  And I think a lot of men, I think ultimately at the end of this video, I think a lot of men have to come to terms and realize that you're a good guy.  And I don't think there's enough of that.  You're a good person.  That positivity and that affirmation to these men, you know what I mean?  Because they fail so much in dating that they don't get, listen, man, like, there's nothing wrong with you.  Like, you're not the problem.  You know, that doesn't mean that you can't improve.  Doesn't mean you don't have any areas to get better at.  Of course, we all do.  We all fall short of the glory of the Lord.  Of course, we all do.  But when it comes to attracting women and dating them, sometimes, sometimes, it's not you, it's her.  And in my assessment, I was wrong about Anika, but I do still feel that, in general, my commentary, I think, there was pretty important.  Yes, yes, yes, I know.  I have a different hair, you know.  Yeah, I know.  Obviously, I got a haircut.  I am recording this video after I made the first part.  And the reason why I'm adding this addendum is because I was going to start talking about Anika... But then I realized that to create a video where I dissect Anika's commentary and her behaviors, it would be its own thing.  So I decided I'll split it up and I'll talk about that the next time.  And the reason why?  Because I found it to be pretty interesting.  I actually found Anika to be a very intelligent and very well-spoken person.  But then she kept doing things that reminded me that she was a woman.  So... Oh, what does that mean?  Is that sexist there, Isaiah?  Oh, well, you just have to tune in for the next video to see what I mean when I say Anika reminded me that she was a woman.  I mean, it does sound very obvious, but you guys will see.  Next time.  So the point of this video, though, that I was trying to make, I know I was just dick riding Monday the whole time, but the ultimate point is there's way too many, I feel, really good men that I've talked to, I've known, who have been my friends, who have struggled, who have just been great guys, and they just get their teeth kicked in.  And I feel like a lot of them just kind of aren't told that you're not the problem here.  I think too many of them are going into dating coaches and too many guys are looking up for advice on forums and shit.  And it's just so much when really the issue is not them, it's the other half.  And I think a lot of men need to be told that and reminded that.  Which, once again, is not to say that men can't improve, but I think it's very important to at least have some guys realize if you're a good person, You got to remain a good person and be steadfast.  And that is the point of this video, ultimately.  So with that being said, I assume you guys got something out of today's video.  And if you did, man, go and click the like button.
