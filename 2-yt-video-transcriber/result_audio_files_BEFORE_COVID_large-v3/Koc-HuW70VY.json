So for me, to me, he's one of the greatest TV actors of all time.  You know what I mean?  So if you slip up, it's going to be exposed.  And so for me, it was a learning process because I never really took an acting class.  So I've learned.  on the spot from greats, you know, and the experience has been amazing.

I think Love Rhythm is the one.  Which is fire.  Yeah.  So he was just like, all right, well... And he's never wanted to hold you back from anything.  He's like, bro, I believe in you.  I know this day is going to come.  So this is before I put the project out.  So I put the project out, and mind you, I still had... Because I got out of my deal early, so I still have a balance that he still put in terms of being his artist.  Right.  So we worked it out where the mechanicals will be paid.  So when you have mechanicals, it's basically saying... the royalties that you make off of your project, that's how he gets paid back.  It's not necessarily out of my pocket.  So the sales off of it.  But the man's a marketing genius, and he's dope the way he does.  And I think, honestly, I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day, because we already had discussed, like, okay, that's how you get it back.
