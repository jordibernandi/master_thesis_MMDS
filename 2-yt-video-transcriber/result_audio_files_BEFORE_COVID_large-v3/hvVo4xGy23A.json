            "text": "Tanya, you are not a victim.  Tanya, you are not a victim.  Process my, process my, this woman is calling the police on me after they told me, I went to the ATM and got cash.  They told me that I did not have enough money, that I did not have enough money in my account.  when I have enough money in my account.  And now Tanya is calling the police on me after I have asked her, after I've asked her to process my payment.  This woman is calling the police at me on CVS.  When I have cash and I have asked her several times to process my payment.  Take my money and process my payment so that I can get my prescriptions.  I am currently, I'm at CVS and I'm having the police called on me after I'm asking them.  She's calling the state on me because she doesn't like the tone of my voice.  They messed up my prescription three times.  I had to come back into the CVS.  I had to come back in here to process my payment.  They told me, they... I'm just so infuriated.  I can't believe this.  I'm not going anywhere.  What I'm asking you to do is process my payment.  You're playing the victim.  You're on the phone.  You're acting like you're being attacked.  And what I want you to do is take my money so that I can leave, and you're refusing to do that.  I don't need to hear you out.  Here you tell me what.  You apologized, and I said I don't need to hear an apology.  What I would like is to get my items and go.  I'm not yelling at the top of my voice.  I'm using a stern tone.  So using a stern tone with you is illegal?  Just process my payment so that I can go.  You're calling the police on me because I won't coddle your feelings?  I didn't blame you for that.  Last month, my prescription was messed up.  That was not your fault.  But the issue was, when I'm there in the car, Samir's trying to process the payment.  It's not processing.  Instead of trying another register, you tell me I don't have enough money when I know that I do?  It's fine.  We don't even have to go over it again.  Just please... It's just wild to me, you know, just the immediacy of calling the police just because what your feelings are hurt.  It's just absolutely absurd.  What was the problem?  You know, she wanted me to hear her out.  Is that against the law that I don't want to listen to her?  It was stern.  It was stern.  And like I said, none of this would have happened if I wasn't black.  But I just want to get my stuff and go.  I don't care if you have black friends.  What does that mean to me?  No, it does not mean that you're not racist.  What's my change?  It's enough to have to come in here and, you know, and combine and pay $200.  What was wrong with the machine?  It's a lot of things that went wrong.  It's a lot of things that went wrong, but I'll take it up with corporate.  I will.  I will be taking that up.  I got Debbie, Samira, and Tanya.  Got you, ma'am.  Got my recording.  Thank you, ma'am.  Oh, Lord, I done dropped my wallet.  Oh, I'm so upset, y'all.  And normally I wouldn't go live for this, but honestly, I've seen what happens when, you know, white women get their feelings hurt and they start calling the police.  And for like, your feelings were not, I mean, and then also, I didn't say anything to you.  I didn't say anything to you.  Tanya, you know, you have a good day.  This is going to cost you your job, ma'am.  Start looking.  you know who calls the police, who calls the police because somebody is not saying what you want them to say. ",

            "text": "I'll tell you what, every time I see these issues and incidents, it just remind me of what Tanya said years ago and she stated on this show that the majority of white people call the police on black people cause they believe they're there to keep black people in line.  This is why I don't have no conflict resolution with black people.  This is why I don't try to solve anything.  Anytime they get their little feelings hurt, They run and go call the police.  Now I'm talking about those who's doing it.  If it's not you, I'm not talking about you.  So don't write me.  no, nothing like that.  Cause the first thing I'm gonna say is, well, you got your feelings hurt cause you probably be one of the ones that call the police.  So she's getting medicine doing what she has to do.  Now me personally, you know, it just, well, medical issues, it's kind of hard to say, Oh, just switch your prescription cause she may need it that day.  I don't know, but I definitely, I would not want to patronize that CVS anymore for sure.  Now when she did post the video, CVS did contact her corporate and wanted to speak to her about the incidents.  I don't know how they're going to solve that.  But what she said was right.  Every time they get their little feelings hurt, they want to go call the police.  Like what the police supposed to do about that?  I mean, only police can tell you at that time and say, well, you know, they want you to leave the property.  You got to leave the property.  There's nothing the police going to come there to do.  I mean, what you're trying to call in the murder of a black person, hope you get a racist cop to go start doing things to her in there.  Cause that's what I believe a lot of them do.  They want to call in the murder of black people.  Because little incidents like that, how many times have black people been roughed up, tased, you know, shot?  It don't matter.  Black women suffer with the police just as much as anybody else.  And like I stated before, in the previous video, Dr.  John Henry Clark said we have no friends.  Well, where's John Lewis and the rest of them with these conferences talking about trying to protect black people from them calling the police on them?  You don't have that, because we black.  That's why.  It's nothing, you know, they can gain out of protecting black people.  We're looking to gain things protecting everybody else.  That's why I said I don't care if all the CBC members go, for the most part.  Minus the new members, but the ones that been there the longest, all of y'all can go.  Wouldn't hurt my feelings none to watch you go, but the reason why I want you to go is because you don't do nothing.  Like, you're just a waste of time.  That's it.  And I had a black person tell me, well, you know, they're trying to primary them and we still kind of need them.  No, we don't.  We don't need none of them.  Where are they when these incidents happen?  Where are their conferences for us?  Where's the rallies?  Sheila Jackson Lee.  Well, that's it.  I'm about to be on Sheila probably in the, Sheila about to be my new target because Sheila been doing a whole lot and Sheila gets away with a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of BS that nobody calls Sheila Jackson Lee out on.  And like I said, I got to make up my new target because I was reviewing some of her voting record as well.  You know, just so I could point out some things that she agreed with.  Now you may say, why Sheila Jackson Lee?  Because like I said, she, she got a reputation in Houston that, um, you know, She's a politician.  They know she's not going to do anything.  She just show up to everything though.  But you hear me mentioning Sheila a lot.  That's why.  But with this situation on black people being, you know, targeted in this way, you know, they should be laws against that.  Just calling the police for silly things like that.  But you know, Obama, once again, if you see something, say something.  So you just gave them a green light to do it even more.  Let's say Barack Obama has not been a great addition to our living in America.  He has, and he has caused us a lot of problems and issues by just some of the positions that he taken.  And you got some black folks swelving down at.  Barack Obama was the best thing since sliced bread.  Well, leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think about the situation with this particular sister.  Trust me, it can happen to any of us, but Keep turning on those cameras.  The cameras is your friend.  Live streaming is your friend.  And make sure whatever live streaming platform that you're streaming it to, make sure a copy goes to your phone as well because you don't want that company to delete the video from your account and you don't have a record of it on your phone.  So just make sure that your lives are saved.  That's the only thing I'm saying.  Whatever platform you're using that can actually save a life, Because these people here, they dirty, they'll try to cover up their own. ",
