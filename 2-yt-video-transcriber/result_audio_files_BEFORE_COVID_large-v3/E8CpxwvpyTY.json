            "text": "Okay, so Keag M\u00edle F\u00e1ilte to everybody here today, and in particular those that have travelled to be here.  There's actually one person here all the way from France, which is fantastic.  Okay, the pursuit of truth is the essence of civilisation, and the freedom of nations depend on it.  As such, truth, freedom and democracy are the essence of the civilised Western world.  We as sovereign people are standing at the precipice of another invasion of Ireland through the medium of mass immigration.  We are watching silently at the destruction of our communities, the breaking down of our family, the removal of our religion, culture and the dismantling of our state.  We are not allowed to have an opinion.  or indeed an objection to any of it.  We did not choose this path for ourselves, it was chosen for us.  Our replacement and the dissolution of our state has been visited upon us by the European finance capital and an anti-Irish government in favour of global financial gain.  Extreme social liberal ideology is the flavour of the decade, so extreme in fact that the lines of right and wrong truth and lies are constantly blurred by the sensationalising nonsense of the left in the mainstream media and the scramble for money and control.  Ireland is no longer a democracy but a socialist state where intimidation, rape, murder, terrorism flourish in our cities and towns.  Our people and the vast numbers of Islamic migrants are mere pawns in a game of thrones that will change the demographics of our country forever.  Our extreme leftist government refuses to discuss or even acknowledge the demographics, betting and border security matter.  The Socialist paper, People Before Profit, reported on 27 February, the Government Strategic Communications Unit paid for sponsored news pieces to appear in national and regional newspapers promoting Ireland 2040, which could not include negative or critical content.  Varadkar's government used taxpayers' money to generate positive stories about its national plan.  His strategic communications units, plural, contacted journalists from the independent group of newspapers to write good news stories about a plan delivered with glorious spin that promised more hospital beds, schools, broadband and better transport connections.  This type of manipulation is part of Varadkar's record.  Just before he became the leader of Fine Gael, Leo Varadkar used his position as minister to launch a publicity campaign against welfare cheats.  He spent \u20ac165,988 of the Irish taxpayer's money and was photographed in the national press holding a placard which stated, Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All.  It was a cynical exercise designed to win over the Fine Gael grassroots for his leadership bid.  Subsequently, it was revealed that there were just 11 cases of identity fraud in Ireland in 2017.  And the top civil servant in the department, John McKeown, admitted that that the advertising campaign was a mistake.  By the time the admission was made, Varadkar had won the leadership of Fine Gael, 50 to 57 votes.  47 TDs never turned up to vote on the day. ",
