My channel's called Let's Chat, and here, any two people can talk about whatever they believe to be true, anything that they're really confident about, anything they center their life around, and my goal is just to help them utilize critical thinking skills in order to understand how they arrived at their conclusion.  One of the techniques that I use is called street epistemology, which is a really great way for two people to talk about something that's really important to them without turning the conversation into a debate or an argument.  If you like stuff like that and you want to see this skill utilized in a good way, why don't you check out my channel?  It's pretty cool.  And you're welcome here any time.  See you.  Now, conversations can literally be... Hey, Nolan, how are you?  Did you get any more views?  I did three more interviews since you were gone.  I did one with a lady named Heather and she was sick.  Sick?  She was sick.  yeah she was a sick lady but she she looked healthy but she was sick on the inside.  and then i saw a lady named jean and she was a scientist and a real estate person.  hey what's up?  and then i did an interview with.  who was the last one?  i just did an interview with oh a lady named lisa and she liked music very much and we talked about that for a while.
