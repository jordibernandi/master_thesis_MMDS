You are a Christian dog.  That's what they say.  And you think it's good.  And I have been very careful up to now.  I have never repeated it.  But you let it go and I don't do it anymore.  And if I have to put it differently, fine.  But it's about your children, your grandchildren.  What's the difference?  Do I have to put more in here?  I can't do anything else.  And I don't do anything else.  Then I'm finished.  Okay, fine.  But the problem, sir, that remains. ",
