            "text": "Shanah Tovah.  Happy Rosh Hashanah.  It is a new year.  again on the Hebrew calendar, 5-7-8-0.  This is the season of blowing trumpets, and the Apostle Paul says that at the last trump, the dead in Christ will rise.  So prophecy watchers are looking for the season to be possibly the rapture season.  however i'm here to give you a couple of prophetic words and i don't believe that the rapture is going to happen this year because there are many other things on god's plan that needs to occur before.  first of all israel is in a lot of uncertainty.  they don't have a government form even after two elections in april and in september.  so what is happening with that?  Well, Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest serving prime minister, was unable to form government in April and he is unable to form government again now.  But the president, they have a prime minister and a president.  The president's a bit of a figurehead, elected for seven years by fellow parliamentary members.  And he has mainly the power to give pardons, kind of like a president in America.  He's able to do that, but he also initiates the forming of the government.  So he's asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form government.  He's had a talk with his counterpart, Benny Gantz, and they were unable to agree.  Much of their dispute is surrounding the issue of support for the ultra-Orthodox and including the ultra-Orthodox, which is the most right-wing religious party in Israel, to be part of the government.  And so Benny Gantz is more secular, more left, But I'll explain a little bit.  It's not like America or Australia.  So they were unable to agree.  Now we're in a high feast season.  It is Shabbat.  And so Benny Gantz has gone to London and Benjamin Netanyahu is now going to wait until they can form government.  Now, there are two prophetic messages that I believe the Lord downloaded to me.  Number one is.  I want you to understand God speaks in numbers.  He also speaks through names and words.  And if you haven't noticed, there are two Benjamins, both rivals in this election are both Benjamins.  That means the son of my right hand.  Notice it's the son of my right hand, not the left hand.  I think, again, that's prophetic.  Benny Gantz was the former IDF chief and he founded the Blue and White Party to basically, you know, counter Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud movement.  Then you've got Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also another Benjamin.  And the prophetic word in the book of Genesis is in chapter 45, verse 22, where Joseph, who was the prince of Egypt, he encountered his brothers, but he didn't see his brother Benjamin.  That's the only full brother that he had, the one that didn't betray him.  He says, where's Benjamin?  They brought Benjamin back.  And when they're sitting around at a table at his house, the prince of Egypt's house, He made sure to favor Benjamin, and he gave him five changes of clothes.  And again, five.  in the number in my Divine Code book, five is explained there.  Again and again, it represents grace.  And so who is it that has this name Benjamin and has received a grace that is related to the number five?  Well, it's Benjamin Netanyahu because he's been elected four terms.  He was elected in 1996, 2009, 2013, 2015.  And guess what?  He's going to be elected again to be prime minister in 2019.  Now, they may complicate it.  They may rotate it.  They may alternate it.  But he's going to be prime minister because he is Benjamin.  And the number five goes with this Benjamin.  Number two, prophetic word that I have for Israel and for the body of Christ.  Please listen to me.  I believe that this division and this necessary reconciliation has come about by the hand of God.  Why?  Let me explain to you.  what's going on here.  First of all, the Knesset, which is the assembly in Hebrew, just means the assembly or the parliament of Israel, has 120 members.  That means that any ruling party must clear the halfway mark, must get 61 members in.  Of course, in their history, they've never had that.  I in the election so nobody has the clear majority and what they usually do is they form a coalition.  That means people who are willing to work together and they cross over the 61.  The trouble now is it's so evenly split between the left and the right that none of them can even get that majority coalition and so they go into what's called a unity government.  The breakdown is that the Blue and White Party, Benny Gant's party, got 33 members of the Knesset or MK in.  Benjamin Netanyahu's group, Likud, got 32 in.  So again, clearly none of them can.  And since they can't even form a coalition government, they went into another election.  They're in the second election and the results are out and they still can't form a government.  And so what is necessary is a unity government.  And remember what I said to you.  2020, in the Divine Code books, 2020 represents war.  20 is the age when Hebrew or Israeli men go into military service according to the Old Testament, according to God.  And so you got 2020, it's going to be double war.  All right.  Now look at this.  Listen to what Wikipedia says about the unity government.  All right.  The unity government means no clear majority for any party.  They all have to unite together and work.  They don't even know who's going to be prime minister.  So they may have to rotate between Benjamin Netanyahu for two years and Benny Gantz for two years.  I guess they could do alternating years.  You know, Gantz, Netanyahu, Gantz, Netanyahu.  They could do it any which way.  But listen to what Wikipedia says about the National Unity Government.  It is a broad coalition government consisting of all parties or all major parties in the legislature, usually during a time of war or other national emergency.  Listen carefully.  This usually happens during war.  Israel has had several unity governments.  Such a coalition was notably formed in the days leading up to the Six-Day War.  So look at the significant dates that happened in Israel's history.  Look at the wars and the results of these wars.  1948, they had the War of Independence.  This was the war for their nation.  They regained their land.  Enemies attacked them.  God delivered them.  And then God blessed them.  Very dangerous to attack the people of God.  19 years later, number of royalty, all right, 19.  You come to 1967.  That was the war to win Jerusalem, to regain control of their capital city.  But it wasn't until 1967 plus 50 in 2017 that Donald Trump recognized the first nation to recognize Jerusalem.  Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people.  So 50 is the number of Jubilee.  It happened right on the nose.  I believe you add to 2017, three years, you're going to come to 2020, and you're going to come to 2020. possibly a major war for the Temple Mount and for the Temple reconstruction.  And guess who's poised in this time in history as the most powerful man on earth right now, politically speaking?  Donald Trump, the real estate developer.  And his son-in-law is a Jewish man that's trying to negotiate the deal of the century.  So you've got, according to the Psalm Code, between 2020 to 2022 for a major announcement about the Temple Mount.  So I believe that there's going to be a war for the Temple Mount.  Many of the Messianics that live in Israel just cannot fathom this.  They think it's never going to happen.  Israel is so secular, which is why it's going to be so miraculous.  It has to happen because Revelation 11 says that There is a temple there, and there are measurements that are taken there.  And the two witnesses are going to come and preach there, and they're going to have a ministry for 1,260 days.  Please listen to me.  If you're Jewish and you don't realize that the New Testament is yours, check out what Revelation says, and you're going to see it.  come to pass very soon.  So let me read to you what the Jerusalem Post said about this.  On the 28th of September... The election for the 22nd Knesset ended without a clear result.  In the battle between the two major parties, Blue and White won 33 mandates compared to Likud, which won 32.  Neither of the candidates for the post of Prime Minister, Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu, has a majority of 61 Knesset members needed to form government.  Gantz has the support of 54 Knesset.  Netanyahu has the support of 55 MKs or members of the Knesset.  What's interesting is Gantz, again, considered left wing, has 10 out of 13 joint Arab lists MKs.  And so they're willing to work with the seculars.  They're willing to work with the Arabs.  Whereas Benjamin Netanyahu has made a promise that the ultra-Orthodox would have a part in his government.  And this is where the clash is.  It's almost a clash between more between the religious and the secular.  And that's why it's right-wing, left-wing.  But in the end, both right-wing and left-wing in Israel would never have open borders.  They would never have unchecked immigration.  They would willingly go to war against any of the enemies like Iran or Syria or anybody else.  So it's strange there, I guess, that the left wing very much want war.  In fact, the head of the left wing party is the former IDF chief.  Maybe it's not so strange if you look at America.  Who is it that wants war with Syria?  The left wing.  Who is it that wants war with Iran?  The Democrats.  Who is it that is so anti-Russian?  More so the Democrats.  So for some reason, they speak peace and all that and the love of humanity.  But yet they're just so driven to have war.  While the political situation is complicated, four major changes can be noted.  when comparing the April election to the September election results.  Number one, a slight rise in voter turnout from 68.5% to 70%, and the result may have come from an increase in voting among the Arab public.  Number two, In April, the Arab parties won 8% of the vote, giving them 10 Knesset seats.  But here now, in September, the joint Arab list garnered 10.5%, which is 13 seats, an increase of almost a third in its power.  The turnout among the Arab public increased from 50% to 60%.  So that was the change.  Number three, votes shifted to the minor parties.  Even though the blue and white won 26% of the votes, retaining its gain in the April election, the party lost two seats.  They're down from 35 seats to 33.  And fourth change that we can notice is that the votes also shifted among the right-wing parties.  Likud dropped from 26.5% to 25%.  Again, that's from 35 seats down to 32 seats.  But they were able to get some votes from Kulanu and Zehut, which they won in April, but what they agreed to do was to merge with Likud prior to the September elections.  And so I believe all of this, again, right and left, factions that could not work together, they have to reconcile now because this is God's timing.  When the major war comes, it's not going to be, you know, the right wing started it or the left wing party started it.  Israel has to be united for her survival.  And God is going to deliver and God is going to give them the Temple Mount.  I know that's very, very controversial.  But Revelation 11 already says it.  You might as well believe it.  Even if you don't know the New Testament yet, you're going to see it come to pass.  And so once again, the book of Psalm, there are other codes that will tell you something is coming in the vicinity of 2020 to 2022 relating to the temple and the temple mount.  And so this is the time that if it happens to Israel, it's going to happen to the church.  And this is the wonderful thing that you can expect.  Israel leads the way, it happens in the natural first, then comes the spiritual.  So what it means is the church is also very divided.  And the church must now learn to work together.  God is literally forcing the Jews to work together to form government.  Come on, church.  Come on, Christians.  Rather than backbiting and holding conflict and bitterness against each other, now is the time to really lay aside differences and work together for religious freedom, for the advancing of the gospel, so we can get the program, you know, the plan of God fulfilled and get ready for Jesus' resurrection.  wish to come true.  He wants revival.  He wants people to get saved and he wants to return and rule.  Psalm 122 verse 6, pray for the peace, for the shalom of Jerusalem.  May they prosper who love you.  So remember that Shana Tova, it's happy Rosh Hashanah 5780, it's a new year, and may you be inscribed in the Book of Life.  The only way to do that is to have all your sins washed and forgiven by the Messiah, Yeshua HaMashiach.  He fulfilled all the prophecies, and He is the Messiah that God promised.  So may your name be inscribed by the blood of the Messiah into the name, into the Book of Life, and may you be sealed for a good year.  It's going to be a good year.  Even if Israel goes through some conflict, God is going to deliver them.  And same for you that are listening.  Whatever you're going through, believe for the same deliverance that God has done for the Jews.  Believe for the same deliverance in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah.  He is the same God yesterday, today and forever.  He is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  And he's the God of parting the Red Sea.  And he's the God of the resurrection.  He's our God.  We better trust him.  We better take him seriously.  It is the time now to believe him because he's about to do an amazing thing and help Israel recapture and rebuild the third temple.
