            "text": "Have you ever been asked the question, why did you believe the gospel but your friend did not?  Are you wiser, smarter, or more spiritual, or better trained, or more humble?  This is one of the most popular questions used by Calvinists to convince others of their theological worldview.  However, there are several theological and logical problems with this question.  The Calvinist argument relies upon the logical fallacy of question begging because it presumes a deterministic answer is required.  It's tantamount to asking, what determined the response of you and your friend?  as if something or someone other than the responsible agent themselves made the determination.  The question presumes determinism is true and that libertarian free will is not, which is question begging.  The cause of the choice is the chooser.  Now, a friend may list influential factors in their decision-making process, but it doesn't mean that those influential factors somehow determined the agent to make a particular choice.  Influential factors do not determine choices.  People do.  For example, your friend may say, I ate a piece of cake because it tastes so good.  That, of course, does not mean that the taste determined the agent to choose to eat the cake, but only that that was a factor that the agent used in making their own determination.  So when a Calvinist asks the question, why did you accept the gospel, but your friend did not?  You can list influential factors in your decision, but it is a logical fallacy for them to assume that someone other than yourself determined your choice.  This mystery of free will is not one that the Calvinists can really escape.  Even R.C.  Sproul, a well-known Calvinist, has said, but Adam and Eve were not created fallen.  They had no sin nature.  They were good creatures with a free will.  Yet they chose to sin.  Why?  I don't know.  Nor have I found anyone yet who does know.  What many Calvinists fail to realize is that Calvinism is actually the only system that teaches the believer is better or more capable than the one who refused to believe.  Calvinistic scholar R.C.  Sproul taught, \"...at the heart of Reformed theology, this axiom resounds, regeneration precedes  faith.\".  What that means is that someone is born again in order to believe.  They're regenerated in order to have faith.  Well, regenerated people are more capable or better than unregenerate people.  So if the claims of Calvinism are true, the person who accepts the gospel does so because they have been made better.  They have been regenerated or born again, and thus they have a capacity that their friend does not have.  On provisionism, however, all people have the necessary insight and moral capacity to respond willingly to God's appeal.  Thus, all are truly without excuse, because everyone has everything they need to believe in God.  This is due to the fact that everyone is created as His image-bearers in a world where His truth is made abundantly clear and believable.  On provisionism, no one who remains enslaved can fall back on the excuse that God did not make them morally capable to respond positively to his own appeals to free them from their bondage, or insightful enough to understand and accept plainly spoken truth like they can on the Calvinistic system.  The fall does not cause humanity to become morally incapable of accepting God's appeals to be reconciled from that fall.  If it did, then what better excuse do unbelievers have than, I was born incapable of responding to my own God and his appeals to be reconciled.  I was born unwanted by my maker.  I wasn't given the grace needed to come to him.  And Jesus didn't in fact die for me.  I can't think of a better excuse.  And the Bible clearly teaches we are without excuse.  In fact, there are some who use Reformed theology as an excuse for their unbelief.  As an example, Derek Webb, the former lead singer for Cademan's Call, enlisted in the top 50 of the most influential people in the gospel-centered movement of the Gospel Coalition, said this. ",
