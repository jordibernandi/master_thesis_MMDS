            "text": "You have a former NFL player by the name of Jimmy Kennedy.  Now he was doing business with JP Morgan chase bank.  Now if you know the history of that bank, we'll talk about the history of that bank a little bit in relation to our ancestors.  This is why a lot of us need to start looking into the history of a lot of old entities in this country.  because a lot of them have been tied to slavery.  So this brother lives in Arizona and if you want to be part of the chase private client, you need to deposit $250,000.  That's the level you have to deposit.  Now that status of private clients, uh, will get him, um, some big travel discounts and other perks.  He was told to conform to the racist attitudes when he was confronting them while he was shopping for a bank in Arizona.  They told him you're bigger than the average person period and you're also African American.  the bank employee, Charles Pelton, who is black told Kennedy, he said, reported to the New York times.  Now he said, we're in Arizona.  I don't have to tell you about what the demographics are in Arizona.  They don't see people like you a lot.  Now I don't live in Arizona.  Some of the family probably live in Arizona.  Is it like that?  Is it that bad in Arizona?  So his experience demonstrated a long history of racism within the culture of the American banking system.  They say with few black people represented in the top ranks of the financial institutions and even restitution paid to black employees or being isolated from their white peers, Kennedy's treatment came as no surprise.  It said the national bureau of economic research has stated this year they found that black mortgage borrowers were still charged higher interest rates.  Black borrowers are also were denied mortgages that would have been approved for whites.  That is the reason why white Americans will always have an advantage in this country.  They make sure to sabotage black people.  Listen to that.  even if your credit is straight, even if you do get the home loan, they charging you higher interest rates versus if you was a white person.  I told you this system is set up to sabotage us as black people.  And a lot of you, when I say things, you know, as I'm going into 2020 because I'm more of a person that say, let's have a solution to issues and to broaden your horizons on different things.  As long as these people are in control, they are going to constantly sabotage us.  We have to expect that if we not sabotage and say, Oh, that was great.  We can get sabotage that time.  But you must understand this is why black people don't have the home ownership.  This is why home ownership haven't changed much since the sixties is because of the banking system in America.  The same bank JP Morgan chase on slaves to slaves as collateral.  Okay.  They owned slaves up to 1250 but they had 13,000 in collateral when people didn't pay their bills.  You understand this same JP Morgan chase and you got black folks that's engaged in a bank that was doing this.  it's still treating black people bad to this day.  Can you say, okay, well that was a long time ago.  Those people didn't go fine, but you always see as a racist practice going on at.  Chase.  bank said that JP Morgan chase and other banks claim they work hard at reversing the tide of racism has been over the business.  It said, but Kennedy was told that he was too black.  his initial financial advisor also complained that he was a victim of racism and also afflicted as a recorder on an unsuspecting colleagues who have normally passed off the allegations as made up.  Cause you know, you have to record them because if you go report them and say, yeah, they're being racist, they can say, Oh, you making that up until you get them on tape, then they will have to concede.  And I said, JP Morgan Chase spokeswoman said the bank was unaware of all the recordings and changed their position after it was revealed by the New York times.  And then executive being placed on leave.  So what happened is Kennedy had claimed he was comfortable with his first advisor, Ricardo Peters, and he has slowly transferred $800,000 to the bank in 2018.  Now you think the bank would be, Oh yeah, that's great, man.  Shoot.  Great, great. ",
