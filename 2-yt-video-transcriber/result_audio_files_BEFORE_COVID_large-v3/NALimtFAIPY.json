Everybody, Terrence Popp here with another episode of Live from the Lair.  Now this next story I want to start off with.  Pfeffert recalls back to the Second Gulf War and one of the big talking points and one of the big points that actually influenced america to get involved and to invade iraq was saddam was stockpiling you know nbc weapons which later on everybody said no there wasn't any there and it caused all kinds of who do you do and drama.  well this next story It's going to curl your fucking tail feathers.  By the time this happened, 1st Platoon was basically doing convoy security every day.  That was their mission.  They escorted vehicles between Victory and Abu Ghraib Prison and some of the other FOBs that the 202 MI had personnel on in Baghdad.  And some of these were relatively far away.  Now on this particular day, I believe Fallujah had already taken place, the first one.  But as we all know, you know, what happened after the first Fallujah, we decided to stop fighting and let the Iraqi army handle it.  Well... That did not happen, as we all know.  First platoon was on their way back from a mission on the freeway, and a large truck pulled past them.  And one of the soldiers noticed that something was at a \u2013 I don't remember what it was, either \u2013 There was something out of place, or they saw something leaking from the back of the truck, and they decided, you know, fuck it, we're just going to pull this motherfucker over.  So they pull him over, open the truck, and it is filled, filled, you can't even go in there, with UXOs.  Old 500-pound bombs, all kinds of artillery shells, all kinds of landmines, hand grenades, crates and crates and crates of explosives.  Then they come across some shells towards the back of the truck.  which were old VX shells, and VX is a nerve agent.  So they kind of, they all freak out, and they basically like, hey, fuck it, you know.  Nobody really went in, they were all just looking through, you know, standing up, looking in, and they could see them, you know, in the back, because they were still on a pallet.  And, you know, Everything else looked like it had been taken willy-nilly from all places that they were just left lying after the Iraqi army surrendered.  That pallet looked like it came from a storage area. ",
