Morning, good morning.  What's going on with you guys?  Nope, just down here fishing.  Okay.  Advertising gun rights.  Okay.  We're down here from Florida Perry and stuff like that.  He's just here.  He wants to have a couple months or so.  We, you know, we just run into places in Florida where there's beaches.  How about yourself?  How are you doing?  Not too awful bad.  Oh, yeah?  You a veteran yourself, sir?  No, sir.  That's a veteran part.  We're all vets.  We're just asking if you were.  No, sir, I'm not.  You think that's a true American, though, wouldn't it be?  Oh, absolutely.  That's what I thought.  So we are true Americans, aren't we?  Absolutely.  I guess you're just visiting.  Yes, sir.  I'm just saying.  You're just visiting.  I know.  You're just visiting the American country that's ours.  Oh.  Well, I'm saying a true veteran.  It's a true American.  He's not a veteran.  I'm just saying.  We'll come back and talk to you guys.  We're true Americans.  We're veterans.  True Americans.  Are you a veteran, sir?  No, sir.  There you go.  That explains a lot to us.  You understand what I'm saying?  Unfortunately, I'm not.  There it goes.  We carried a flag for you so you can go in and have your rights.  Sit right there.  Yes, sir.  Absolutely.  You sit right there and have your rights that we carried.  I'm not arguing with you.  I'm just telling you who earned it for you.  Absolutely.  Take a good picture of this.  I'm a member of the B. That has nothing to do with that.  That's absolutely nothing, sir.  We're the people who serve you, okay?  You understand that.  We're not arguing with you.  I'm just telling you now, you do what you need to do.  We'll come back and talk to you in a minute.  We'll talk to you in a minute.  I'm just telling you who's who.  You better understand who's who.  What did I say?  Welcome back.  Good.  We just had the ID, everybody.  You got your ID with you?  I gave him my fishing license so that you'll know that I'm legally fishing, but it's totally lawful.  We've got to make sure you're not a convicted felon.  That's why we need your driver's license.  We don't know who you are, so we have to check.  You have to do a convicted felon check.  That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it?  Well, people do.  They arm themselves all the time, and they're convicted felons.  That's why we need your identification.  Yes, sir.  Okay.  Look at me.  We know that.  Look at me again.  We know that.  Do you understand that?  No, but I'm saying don't tell me.  I'm asking you, do you understand that?  we do know?  That's why we're saying, listen, are you in handcuffs or anything?  No.  So we understand.  We know that.  We know that.  I'm just telling you that don't dictate to us about what's going on.  We already know that.  You do what you need to do.  Hey, we ain't gonna do nothing with them.  I'll just get them on video.  I'm being nice But I'm about not to be nice, but they're telling me what we don't know.  We know this.  I'm going to turn this off again.  That's all you're doing.  We're trying to normalize it so that the concern isn't there.  Normalize it?  So you're saying a couple weeks ago was normal?  No, that has nothing to do with that.  We're not doing anything like that.  I know, yeah, but look at it from our standpoint, though, when we say we're going to have to sit right there because we're going to get a phone call.  You don't have to sit there.  Oh, we will, though, because we have to respond to calls.  I don't mind if you sit there, but you don't have to.  Okay, well, you know what I'm saying? ",
