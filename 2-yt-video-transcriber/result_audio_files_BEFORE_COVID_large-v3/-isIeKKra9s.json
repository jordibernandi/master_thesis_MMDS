            "text": "Hey folks, Matthew coming at you here with your TNFM Raw, I mean Raw Report.  10 August 2019.  Well, as you probably, unless you've been hiding under a rock or in a coma, at 7.30 Eastern Time, guess who showed up dead?  Suicided, they claim.  Jeffrey Epstein.  Now, folks, I've got to admit to you, who didn't see this coming, especially since Judicial Watch, Mr.  Fitton released those names, the reports, the documents, 66-plus charges, onward and onward, as I just spoke about last night on... BP Earthwatch talking about the Epstein revelations and, you know, we've heard that Epstein was the keystone.  Well, I've got to tell you, folks, not anymore.  And anyone that disagrees with me, well, you're free to have your opinion.  But, folks, a little quick message from Matthew this morning.  Wake up, America.  Doesn't seem like much is changing to me.  Now, if I'm wrong, I'll admit it, but I don't think I am.  Just like I'm keeping my eyes watching right now with these coming gun laws, these continued events, dressing folks up like we just saw in Missouri.  20-year-old young man walking around with similar, same kind of hat that I wear all the time, claiming he's wanting to check to see if Walmart's going to honor his Second Amendment rights.  What, are you kidding me?  Walking around with a rifle, pistol, plate carrier, and wearing a United States of American flag on his hat.  Folks, do you kind of see what's going on here?  Do you see what's happening?  Well, it looks like the Keystone just turned into a dead end.  Who else is seeing this?  You better have a plan, you better be prepared, and you better be ready to protect you and yours.  We're getting ready to see some more events, folks.  And I hope the president's watching as well.  Last thing I want to say.  Go back and look at your history, folks.  Now, I'll be watching.  I'm sure all of you will as well.  And if I make some folks upset, at this point, gents or folks, I don't care.  I'm coming out.  I'm pointing out what I see.  And I can tell you right now, I'm not surprised at all.  Now, think about this.  It was a suicide attempt already.  They moved him to another part of the prison.  Maximum security, they say.  Supposed to be two guards on duty at all times.  And now we're hearing he was found at 7.30 Eastern.  Come on.  Suicided at 7.30 this morning.  Where were the guards?  You can't even have dental floss, folks, on suicide watch.  or sheets to some degree.  Vet me on that.  So what's the plan now?  Anybody want to tell me what the plan is now?  Anyone think we're going to see the true consequences and repercussions of Jeffrey Epstein and all those folks from Hollywood to D.C.  that flew to that island that he owned?  now better wake up folks.  and lastly there is no such thing as a good gun law red flag or any other laws.  Patriots, now is the time.  Stand tall together for that anthem.  Keep fighting, hold the line, because this fight has just begun. ",
