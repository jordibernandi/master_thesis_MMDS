            "text": "Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  So before the 2008 crisis, it was open season on consumers.  Giant financial institutions cheated people on mortgages, on credit cards, and a bunch of other financial products.  And government regulators did nothing.  After the crisis, the CFPB was created to be a cop on the beat to aggressively enforce laws that protect consumers, especially those who get regularly cheated.  So, Director Craninger, during your confirmation hearing, you testified, quote, under my stewardship, the Bureau will take aggressive action against bad actors who break the rules.  Is that still your plan? ",

So let's put that together and see how you and Director Mulvaney have been doing in your combined year and a half running the CFPB.  Let's start with student loans.  The law that set up the CFPB established a student loan ombudsman, at the Bureau because Congress believed that students needed a regulator who had their back when loan companies and for-profit colleges tried to cheat them.  Director Craninger, in the past year and a half, how many lawsuits has the CFPB filed against student loan companies? ",

Not one dollar returned to students who get cheated.  In contrast, when he led the CFPB, Rich Corddry filed 15 cases, and he recovered $712 million for those students who had been cheated.  In fact, you have done worse than nothing.  You and Mulvaney disbanded the office of student ombudsman.  It was so bad that your student loan ombudsman resigned because the, quote, leadership of the Bureau has abandoned its duty to fairly and robustly enforce the law.  So that's student loans.  Now let's ask about discrimination.  Before the financial crisis, banks targeted communities of color for the worst of the worst cheating mortgages.  So after the crash, Congress said there would be a special office at the CFPB to enforce laws to stop lending discrimination.  Director Kraninger, in the last year and a half, how many lawsuits has the CFPB and the DOJ filed for fair lending violations? ",

Rich Gordry filed 11 lending discrimination cases, recovered almost $620 million for consumers who were targets of discrimination.  And again, in this area, you have done worse than nothing.  You took enforcement powers away from the CFPB experts who were in charge of the Office of Fair Lending, And who did you put in charge of the office?  A political appointee with a history of writing racist blogs.  Okay, student loans, lending discrimination.  Now let's do credit reporting companies and debt collectors.  Two-thirds of the complaints that come through the CFPB hotline are about credit reporting or debt collection.  Under Rich Corddry, the CFPB brought 20 debt collection cases and 24 credit reporting cases, putting almost $1.2 billion back into the pockets of consumers who were cheated.  Director Craninger, in the last year and a half, the CFPB has filed three cases alleging violations of credit reporting or debt collection laws.  How much relief did the Bureau win for consumers in those cases? ",

So, student loans, lending discrimination, credit reporting companies, debt collectors, Much more we could talk about, but I see I'm out of time.  It seems pretty clear to me that you stopped enforcing the laws designed to protect consumers.  Money returned to consumers as a result of the CFPB's lawsuits has slowed to a trickle.  And when you do bring a case, the settlements you've secured from the companies average about 1,125th the size of the ones that Rich Corddry got.  That's hundreds of millions of dollars that companies stole from consumers and that you are permitting them to keep.  Director Kraninger, you are supposed to be the cop on the beat, but you are only watching out for the crooks who are cheating American consumers.  If you had any decency, you'd either do your job or resign.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman. ",
