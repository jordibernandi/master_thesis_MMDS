You see, our friend that guy thinks I should delete my channel because either A, I'm lying about atmospheric pressure, or B, I just don't understand it.  When in reality, he's got the term vacuum pressure confused with just simple pressure inside a vacuum.  Let me show you what I mean.  If I've got a container, and inside the container we have a pressure of 4.7 psi, and outside the container we have 14.7 psi, then there is a difference of 10 psi.  It's 10 psi less in the can than on the outside, and we will call that a vacuum pressure of minus 10.  It doesn't mean that vacuums have a negative pressure, it's just a relative term.  And it really is that simple.  Our friend that guy has heard the term vacuum pressure, completely misunderstood it, and applied it in a way that only a flat earther could.
