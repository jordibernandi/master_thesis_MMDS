And net 60 and net 30 means, yeah, you get paid in 30 days or you get paid in 60 days.  And if you don't get paid in 60 days, there's really not so much penalties and too much you could do about it.  You just got to fucking wait to get it, and it creates a timing issue.  So, yeah, cash flow can become an issue when you're dependent on other people paying you.  The only thing I can say is have more streams of cash flow, right?  So it's almost like when this one's late, it's almost when it comes in, it's on time because the other one's late.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, know that money's always going to come in late.  It's never going to... I have timing issues more than anyone on this planet, to be honest.  And it's just because I just don't wait.  You know, I just don't save for the timing issue.  It's just that I'm always like, I got to put it into business now while I'm inspired.  And I don't be like, oh, shit, I might not get paid in 30 days.  It's hard to think like that in the moment.  But it is something to be conscious of.  But the things that do save me, like I said, I'm having a timing issue now.  What's saving me is what I invested in 10 years before now.  You understand what I'm saying?  So, it's like you always... As an entrepreneur, it's like you're always feeding that beast, you know, kind of.  And to have some kind of security is almost like it doesn't exist.  You know, especially when you're out to buy goods.  Buying goods... is really, like, it seems like she doesn't have to buy any goods, so it's like, all right, that might fuck her bills up.  But imagine if you're posting a page in 30 days, and you have to physically use the money from that to go make some more product to ship in 60 days.  And if you don't get the money now to make it, you're going to be late for the things you have to ship in the future, and then you start to lose a lot of money.  That's the fashion business.  That's what happens all the time.  Also, maybe get a bank to give you a credit line.  So if you know the money's coming... And you have a time in this, you pay a couple points on it, and you just give it right back.  But you got to always give it right back because the more you loan, the more interest you're going to pay. ",

That'll pay 10 points and shit like that on it, you know, so they don't feel that timing issue.  But short-term lending is usually expensive.  You know, people usually rob you for that because they know you're in distress.  They know it's an emergency.  And I've gotten caught up with that as well.  You know, I start to, you know, that's what happened with my... With those foreclosures I had.  that time was because I had a demand to buy inventory for Rachel Roy, and I didn't have the cash that I thought I had because of fucking Barry Klauber.  I had a note for $5 million that I thought was liquidated, and I ended up that the note... could only be liquidated for half of what the value of it was.  So it was for five million and ended up I had to liquidate it for two and a half.  So I was two and a half short thinking I had five million.  So I had to go refinance one of my houses and the interest rate, you know, for quick money.  and the interest rate was so crazy that, you know, after a couple of months, I couldn't pay it anymore.  You know what I'm saying?  So, you know, my shit went from 20,000 to 80,000, some stupid shit like that.  You know what I mean?  So just borrowing money can be expensive, especially when you're in distress and people know it.  They'll shit on you.  They'll shit on you. ",

You know what I mean?  Or feed each other's kids.  If you ain't got no food in the house, it's okay.  Your babies will still get to eat.  So we feed each other's businesses in the sense that if you have an audience that my product can sell to, I'll make a deal with you, an affiliate deal, where I'll give you maybe 40% and you push it to your audience and we'll both get money.  Then you do the same thing with me.  Also, there's a market in terms of like your bond and lending.  You know, like if I know you can trust me and I can trust you, then if you're short $5,000 or $10,000 or whatever the amount is, I can loan you that money.  You know what I mean?  There's an understanding because we've worked together in the past.  Everybody knows each other.

You understand what I'm saying?  So let's say there's 10 of us and I need a million dollars, a hundred thousand from each person.  I'm a millionaire all over again.  And everyone else, you know, has only had to give up, you know, a hundred thousand.  There's nothing that's going to crack you.  So it was the biggest form of security was to keep your friends rich because whenever you need them, they'd be there for you.
