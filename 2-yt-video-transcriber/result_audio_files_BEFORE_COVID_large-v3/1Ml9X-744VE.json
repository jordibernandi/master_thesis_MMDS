            "text": "If you were punk rock, you had your hair above your ears.  You'd get your ass kicked just walking down the street.  It was dangerous.  It was radical.  And it scared the hell out of people because they didn't know what it was.  It was in your face, blunt, simple.  It was dangerous in a really safe way.  Adults didn't like it.  Not everyone likes hardcore.  There weren't very many women.  I love it.  because I am loud and I'm fast.  It had every bit to do with sort of stamping out hippie culture, like just destroying it.  It's really fun.  You know, it's fun.  It's really fun.  It's fun.  Around the world, Hooskadoo is born to the game.  I first seen Hooskadoo, I thought, what the hell is this?  It was just a barrage of obnoxious noise, but it was beautiful.  We didn't know Hoosker Do weren't that good at the time.  We just thought, you know, it must all be that good.  Lansing's record is probably the defining heart for it.  It was recorded live in the 7th Street Entry.  The VUs on the board were just pegged.  I went to the entry, and Husker Du and the Throes of Landspeed record, and every song was a million miles an hour.  And that's kind of when I went, wow, this is a contest.  Let's see who can go the fastest.  Some bands tried to be real fast.  There were songs that were less than a minute.  We just plugged in, and it was chaos right out of the get-go.  My heart's a bleak, it's not a crack-up, but only good.  We did a 10-song, 15-minute set.  And everybody was like, you guys do 10 songs in 15 minutes?  It was so fast.  It was like poker music.  It's something you can compare it to.  Because they always start calling it a poker punk.  the original slam dancing was was aggressive but it wasn't a fist fight it wasn't.  it wasn't actually violent.  it was like played violence and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until it was just out of control.  i mean i remember you know cleaning up the blood on the carpet on so many mornings the day after and then crack I heard my neck break.  At that point now, I'm like a floating head.  And I saw my right hand hit the floor.  You know how you can recognize your hand?  You know that's your hand.  I couldn't feel it.  It was crazy back then.  You were younger.  You could get away with murder.  You could get into a bar.  It was a free-for-all.  It was a fun free-for-all.  Like, real fun.  Because what we saw from people just like two or three years older than us didn't look fun at all.  Any musical movement that has an impact usually is because a lot of like-minded people were coming upon the same conclusion, the same idea at the same time.  Be reasonable.  Demand the impossible.  You know, we just want a different world, right?  Lots of ice.  Get a glass.  Fair proof. ",
