            "text": "Jesus was so clear when he said, look, if the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.  And he says in John 15, no servant's going to be greater than his master.  And so there's a sense in which you rejoice, okay, look at the way they're treating me.  They're going to treat you that way also.  And what's awful about the prosperity gospel is it's saying your life is going to be completely different.  I promise you it'll be completely different from what Christ went through.  You're going to be healthy, you're going to be wealthy, the people are going to love you.  And it really sets people up for failure in a lot of ways.  I mean, like Peter says, don't be surprised when the fiery trial comes upon you as though something strange were happening to you.  And what the prosperity gospel teaches is, hey, Be surprised if there's any type of trial in your life because you should be experiencing, man, He's our heavenly Father.  He wants us to experience the best.  You know, you should be treated like kings.  when Paul's saying the exact opposite.  He's talking to the Corinthians and these super apostles.  He says, oh, you're already rich.  Oh, you've all become kings and that without us.  Meanwhile, we apostles are like the scum of the earth.  We're like these guys condemned to die in the arena.  And he actually contrasts himself from those that were preaching a prosperity gospel.  So it just goes against what Jesus preached and what Paul preached and what Peter preached. ",
