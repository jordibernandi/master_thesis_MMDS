            "text": "Right, I'll tell you what I'm talking about.  But before we do that, we need to put that quote into some sort of context.  Quantum Eraser believes that the atmosphere must burst off into the vacuum of space because entropy must always increase.  therefore disorder must always increase, therefore the gas particles of the atmosphere must disperse.  I'm simply making the point that entropy can increase if we have exchanges of energy and not necessarily the gas particles themselves carrying that energy.  So take a look at this.  We all know that the Earth's source of energy is the Sun, and the Earth absorbs high frequency, short wavelength, high energy photons from the Sun.  And a lot of these are absorbed by the Earth and then re-emitted back into space.  But when they are re-emitted back into space, they are re-emitted as longer wavelength, lower frequency, lower energy photons.  Now, what this means is we are emitting more photons back into space than we are absorbing from the Sun, which perfectly fits the description of an increase in entropy.  Now what I do want to point out is that the atmosphere also plays a role in this.  When those photons are emitted by the Earth, they are absorbed by different layers of the atmosphere and then re-emitted again at those longer wavelengths.  Now in the description I've given you a link to this scientific paper here, which is all about atmosphere and its behaviour in terms of entropy.  And in that paper, and any paper you'll find on atmosphere and entropy, we get the statement that essentially energy flows from the Sun to cold space via the Earth.  thus having an increase in entropy.  Now I am looking forward to Quantum Eraser's, how can I put it, unique take on that paper.  That should be very interesting.  But for now it does seem, Quantum Eraser, that your claim that to increase entropy the atmosphere must burst off into space is not supported by mainstream science in any shape or form.  And I haven't even mentioned gravity yet.  How do you feel?  For fuck's sake, man!  But it gets worse for Quantum Razor.  You see, he's claimed over and over and over again that to obey the second law of thermodynamics and to have entropy increasing, the gas itself must burst off into space.  And he completely ignores any arguments about the movement of energy.  But when he starts reading his own definitions of entropy, well, take a listen for yourself. ",

And we're going to use this new house as an analogy for microstates and macrostates.  I've linked a video in the description that does it with far better graphics than I can achieve.  The macro state here is that Quantum Eraser is in the house.  That's the big picture.  It doesn't matter what room he's in, but we can describe him as being in the house.  But of course, in reality, he could be in the bedroom or he could be in his talking nonsense room.  Now, the room he's in is what we're going to define as the micro state.  But the microstate, whether he's in the bedroom or the talking nonsense room, isn't going to affect the macrostate, which is the fact that he is in the house.  And to put this into context with a gas, the macrostate is just the overall large-scale thermodynamic properties of that gas.  But if Quantum Eraser went and bought himself a bigger house like this one, then while we can still claim he has the same macrostate, he is inside the house, we can see that the number of rooms he can occupy, the number of microstates he can occupy, whilst having that macrostate of being in ",

He can be in any of those rooms but yet still have the macro state of being inside the house.  Now we can compare that to the first house he bought where there was only two rooms and two possible microstates.  So we would say that the biggest house has an increased entropy.  In other words, there are more possible ways that those particles could orientate themselves to give us the same macro state.  So that's what quantum realism means when he uses the word microstate, or at least it would be what he meant if he actually took time to understand the concepts and not just read a definition.

First of all, the thermosphere might have an incredibly high temperature, but that doesn't mean that there is more energy in the thermosphere than there is lower down in the atmosphere.

However, in the thermosphere, the atmosphere is so incredibly thin that even though each molecule has a lot of energy, it's actually very cold.  You would literally freeze to death if you stepped out of your spacesuit in the thermosphere.  So energy hasn't increased.  And secondly, the particles of gas in the atmosphere haven't gained that high temperature by moving through the atmosphere.  They've gained that high temperature because they are absorbing X-rays and ultraviolet rays from the sun.  In fact, the reason the thermosphere is so close to being a vacuum is the fact that the particles beneath it haven't had the energy to rise that high for reasons that we've already discussed.  So to claim that we can't have an atmosphere next to the vacuum of space because, in your words, the atmosphere or the particles of gas in the atmosphere actually gain energy as they go higher is absolute codswallop.

Just take a look at this beaker of water being placed into a vacuum chamber.  Now, I've linked this video in the description, but what it clearly shows is that when we remove the atmosphere around something, then liquids have a tendency to want to move towards the state of being a gas.  Now, come to my razor, you're a big fan of entropy in the second law of thermodynamics.  This is entropy in action.  A more ordered state like liquid becoming a less ordered state like a gas.  Because the pressures around it are lower.  Now, given your fantastic understanding of the second law of thermodynamics and entropy, I'm surprised that you're surprised by this. ",
