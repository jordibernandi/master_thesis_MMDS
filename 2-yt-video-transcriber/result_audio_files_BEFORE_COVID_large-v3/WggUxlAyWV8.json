Make sure you subscribe to us on Bichu because YouTube is limiting our channel in various ways and is phasing out channels like ours anyway, so see the links below.  Also see the link below to the webpage version of this video with all the links and etc.  At least one of the sources that I used for this piece, Berkeley, said it is very biased in favor of Antifa, BAMN, and etc.  So, even more than usual, I am not claiming that what I report in this video is true.  But because it would be very tedious to say, according to reports, before every little statement, let me say this once and for all about this whole thing.  According to reports. ",

Put those sunglasses on if you have them.  a vet florica real name yvonne capistrana florica of bmn infamy has been ordered by a judge to pay judicial watch twenty thousand dollars to help pay their legal fees.  If you don't know who Flarka is and what BAMN is, see the links below.  Here we see Flarka, who is a teacher at Martin Luther King Jr.  Middle School, the main face, voice, and often the fist of BAMN on the right, and two of the three BAMN founders and leaders, the elusive Leland Sanders in the middle, who you may remember calling for murder in former videos of ours.  I can live with nothing, unfortunately, but it would be tragic.  Kids, this is why you need to stay in school and don't go drugs.  And Flark is attorney and the cult leader apparently of BAMN, Sean the Driver, on the left.  Again, Flark is a teacher.  She teaches children at a middle school named after a great man who preached non-violence and seeking real justice.  And she spearheads a group that takes its name from the pro-violent phrase touted by the pro-violent Malcolm X. Judicial Watch is the organization best known for uncovering the scandalous Hillary Clinton emails.  This is one of their latest.  This is just from, I think, yesterday. ",
