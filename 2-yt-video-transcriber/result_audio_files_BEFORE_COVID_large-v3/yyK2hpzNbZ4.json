            "text": "Here is your latest Africa news update.  More fires are now burning in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo than the Amazon.  Blazes burning in the Amazon have put the world on notice, but Brazil is actually the third in the world in wildfire over the last 48 hours, according to Modi Satellites data analyzed by the weather source.  The weather source has recorded 6,902 fires in Angola over the past 48 hours, compared to 3,395 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and 2,127 in Brazil.  But it seems nobody cares about the fires burning in Africa right now, and all the rage right now is the Amazon fires on the international media circuits and Western media.  Even more shocking, over the last 48 hours, Zambia placed fourth on the list while Brazil's neighbor in the Amazon, Bolivia, placed sixth.  The mainstream media cared more about a burning old church, the Notre Dame, than it is caring for the Amazon fires while completely ignoring all the fires in Africa right now.  This is a case in point where Africa needs to tell its own stories and stop depending on Western medias to tell our story.  Did you know South and Central Africa is currently burning?
