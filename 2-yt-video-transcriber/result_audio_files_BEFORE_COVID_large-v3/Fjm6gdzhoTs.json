            "text": "Hey Scaredy Cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt.  Zombies.  Remember those little guys?  For a while, there were zombies everywhere.  It felt like they were overwhelming us.  Millions of zombies running around, gobbling up brains, coming from every direction, just endlessly marching towards us.  No hope of escape.  Now at times, it feels like zombies are a little less overdone, thank God, but they still haven't fully lived down the stink of those days.  I think it's safe to say we're all a little fucking sick of zombies.  But we're willing to watch it like a train to Bataan, and we might be curious about a The Dead.  Don't Die every now and then.  But something terrible has happened to zombies.  Zombies used to represent all sorts of things.  Slavery, consumerism, mortality, conformity, classism, militarism, the dangers of technology, isolation.  But all of those analogies are dead.  Zombies don't really seem to mean the same range of things in our current landscape.  They seem to have adopted a new meaning.  Imminent societal collapse brought about by bleeding heart softies.  Now it would be pretty petty of me to blame this evolution on any one person.  There's a wide variety of factors that influence how the Gestalt comes to understand any work of art or any cultural concept at all.  But on the other hand, it's all Zack Snyder's fault.  Tommy.  Tommy.  The myth of the zombie has its roots in Haitian folklore.  Now keep in mind, I'm not a historian, and I'm not Haitian, so I'm going to be giving you a very narrow and reductive view of this story.  Quick history lesson about Haiti.  Yeah, we're doing this.  Since the arrival of Columbus, Haiti had been brutally colonized by Europeans.  In the 17th to early 19th century, Haiti was ruled over and enslaved by the French.  Then the French went ahead and had a big ol' revolution trying to establish human rights and shit.  So the colonized Haitian people were like, yeah?  So the Haitians led a bunch of revolts, kicked the French's asses up and down the street, and set themselves free.  You can imagine, though, that living under centuries of brutal slavery tends to leave a pretty lasting impression on the psyche of a nation.  In Haitian folklore, a zombie isn't a mindless corpse that feeds on the flesh of the living.  It's a corpse that has been reanimated by dark magic to become an eternal slave.  Completely lacking all agency of its own, a zombie does its master's will without question.  And if ending up like that sounds scary to you, imagine how scary it must have sounded to people who had fought a bloody revolution to free themselves from earthly slavery.  A perpetual, eternal enslavement that you could not possibly escape from, no matter how hard you tried.  Now, old-timey Hollywood always had some weird ideas about zombies.  Sometimes they were hypnotized, alive people.  Sometimes they were dead people that were reanimated by mad scientists or aliens or radiation.  Very occasionally, they were created by extremely problematic stereotypes of voodoo practitioners.  Voodoo is just a religion.  It's a normal-ass religion.  It might surprise you to learn that early Hollywood didn't really consider the perspective of Haitian people all that important.  When these movies did acknowledge Haiti, it would be in the same way that a movie today might acknowledge Transylvania.  It's a spooky place where foreigners live, and there's evil magic there.  Then came a little movie called Night of the Flesh Eaters, later renamed Night of the Living Dead.  Of the Living Dead, Night is a landmark film in a lot of ways, and it represented the birth of a genre of zombie movies so completely divorced from the term that it might as well have invented the concept of a zombie.  It didn't!  And we should acknowledge that.  But when you and I think of a zombie, this is what we think of, typically.  In Night of the Living Dead, the word zombie is never spoken.  In fact, it's not in the screenplay either, where the creatures are called ghouls.  Only after the film's released did people start to refer to the creatures as zombies.  And unlike traditional zombies, these guys ate the flesh of the living, and if they bit you, you'd turn into a zombie, like a werewolf or a Dracula.  And this has been the dominant interpretation of the zombie ever since.  When we talk about a zombie movie, this is usually, but not always, what we mean.  It's here also that zombies as an analogy tend to get a little more... nebulous.  The zombies in Night of the Living Dead don't really matter?  They're the central conceit of the film, they're the inciting incident, but what the movie is exploring is how characters react in a crisis, how danger and fear can spread paranoia and violence, how stress can make people stop listening to one another and foster division.  The zombies could really be replaced with any crisis that forces the characters inside, and the story of the movie would proceed the same way.  At the end, the movie's hero, Ben, an African-American man, is shot dead by a roving band of armed white vigilantes.  In this movie about division and how a lack of mutual understanding can make people cruel to one another, there seems to be this deliberate invocation of America's ugly history of lynching.  Now, I know that the part of Ben wasn't originally written for Dwayne Jones or for a black man.  I have no doubt that Jones just gave the best performance of the actors auditioning for the part, because he's great in this movie.  But I also find it difficult to believe that it was lost on everyone involved in the making of this movie that the image of white vigilantes murdering an innocent, not to mention heroic black man, made a powerful statement.  Particularly as this movie came out in the middle of the fucking civil rights movement.  It's possible that this was all just happenstance, but they had to be aware that the movie was going to be read this way, and therefore, they were still making a political statement by choosing to include it.  In Dawn of the Dead, the film's direct sequel, hereafter referred to as the good Dawn of the Dead, zombies become a critique of mindless consumerism.  And yeah, I know, George A. Romero, the film's director, said that he didn't intend that.  But, like, have you seen the movie?  The zombies are drawn to the mall because it was a place that was important to them in life, and then we see them mindlessly shuffling around in a shopping mall while ironically upbeat diegetic Muzak plays in the background.  Also, the characters in the movie go through phases where they're consuming stuff to try and make themselves happy in a world that's falling apart and find that it doesn't.  Only the community they build together makes them happy.  This film is not subtle.  And in the next movie in the series, Day of the Dead, the zombies become pitiable half-human creatures.  They retain just a little bit of their living personality, enough to make them grow bonds with humans, enough to make them hold a grudge.  The human villains of the film, by contrast, are tough-guy-no-bullshit military dudes.  I'm running this monkey farm now, Frankenstein, and I want to know what the fuck you're doing with my time!  And this is a huge theme in a lot of zombie movies.  People who revel in the violence of the zombie apocalypse are more dangerous than the zombies themselves.  Everybody would be able to survive and thrive if not for the destructive impulses of violent assholes.  From the vigilante gangs in Night of the Living Dead, to the hot-headed military chauvinists in Day of the Dead, the military in 28 Days Later, the bikers in Dawn of the Dead, the punks and military in Return of the Living Dead, in these stories, the true danger of a crisis isn't the crisis itself.  with the human tendency to become selfish and uncaring.  Zombies are dangerous, but they're also not real.  At least Romero-style zombies aren't real.  If you make a movie where the zombies are literal and don't represent something aside from zombies, you end up with Day of the Dead 2.  Contagion.  The real danger, the one these filmmakers used to want to talk about, is man's inhumanity to man.  And if you're familiar with contemporary zombie bullshit, that's a theme that should be very familiar to you.  The most popular piece of zombie media in the past few decades, maybe ever, is The Walking Dead.  And if you've watched it, you know that the world it takes place in is miserable.  It's a parade of human cruelty, a world where every outsider is a threat and every act of compassion or mercy is a risk.  Now, I'm not saying that to criticize The Walking Dead.  If I wanted to criticize The Walking Dead, I would mention how bad it sucks.  The relentlessly bleak tone is by design and is part of the show's appeal.  And like zombie media before it, it condemns violence and man's inhumanity to man.  However, the solution that the show proposes is that good people should become equally brutal and cruel to combat brutal and cruel bad people.  Altruism in the world of The Walking Dead will get you killed or cause others to suffer for your mistakes.  The appropriate response to a hard situation is to harden oneself, to become bigger and stronger and more capable of violence in your self-interest than others who are also using violence in their self-interest.  At times, it might seem like people working together altruistically have created a small haven from the horrors of the rest of the world, but inevitably they'll be hiding some sort of dark, dangerous secret.  Zombie movies traditionally played to liberal fears and prejudices.  The mindless masses, consuming without thought.  They're coming for you, and if you can just get everyone to think like you do, you can stop this crisis in its tracks.  The more zombies become cannon fodder, the more they become divorced from being human beings, the more they started to appeal to conservative fears and prejudices.  See, there's this invading horde constantly at our gates.  We must be strong and have big strong boy guns to stop them.  And everybody has to fend for themselves in this new dog-eat-dog world that is coming.  There's no room for bleeding heart compassion.  Only the strong will survive.  So we can't have a social safety net.  Oops, I mean comfort someone who was bitten by a zombie.  Did I say a social safety net?  That's not what I meant.  I meant being nice to injured people.  Can't do that.  Let him die.  Now truthfully, it would be dishonest to lay this entirely at the feet of Zack Snyder.  If anything, it's probably influenced more by post-911 foreign policy than anything else.  But Snyder's Dawn of the Dead in 2004, a remake of George R.R.  Murrow's classic and one of my favorite movies, is the first time I noticed this trend.  And blaming him lets me talk about how much I hate this fucking movie, which is one of my favorite hobbies.  In Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, hereafter referred to as the bad Dawn of the Dead, the heroes are all badass motherfuckers who take no shit.  You either learn to do violence decisively and without remorse, to let go of your creature comforts and all attachment to the well-being of others, or you are a liability.  Care about your family too much?  You just made a zombie baby.  Nice job.  Care about sick people too much?  You just let a zombie into your home.  Care about your dog too much?  You just got the extremely friendly and cool gun store owner killed.  Liking dogs is dangerous.  You should like... guns.  One of the heroes of the movie starts off by literally kidnapping the other main characters and imprisoning them until he's defeated.  Don't worry, though.  He's violent and doesn't give a shit about anything, so he's just the sort of person you want on your side.  Sarah Polley's character chides the dude from Modern Family about the glee he takes in shooting zombies, which, in fiction, is a fucked-up thing to enjoy, because they were all people at some point.  And he defends himself and says that if he were a zombie, he'd want to get shot rather than scribble-scrabbling around as a little zombie.  And, okay, yeah.  Sure, but would you want people to laugh at your misfortune while they did it?  Would you want people to enjoy putting you out of your misery?  Imagine walking into funeral homes and shooting dead bodies in the dome piece, and then when people tell you, like, hey, don't shoot grandpa, that's a fucked up thing to do, you say, well, when I'm dead, I won't care who shoots me!  So it's fine!  And that's technically true, but it misses the broader point that enjoying violence for violence's sake is... fucked up, man.  And I'm not talking about watching a violent movie.  I mean doing real-life violence.  It is something you may have to do in certain extreme situations.  But it's really fucked up and weird to enjoy it.  That's a really weird and bad quality to have.  And yeah, the character making this argument is a villain.  He's not meant to be likable.  But he's still proven right when Sarah Polly shoots his brain off when he becomes a zombie.  What do you know?  It does feel good to do violence against worthy targets.  doesn't it?  Now you can get away with something like that in a heightened reality like Zombieland or Evil Dead 2.  Those movies don't really show you the stakes of violence.  It's all cartoon silliness.  It's a black comedy.  The joke in these movies is the tonal dissonance between the slapstick silliness and the brutality on display.  The joke is how fucked up it is to laugh at that.  The Bad Dawn of the Dead, though, shows people suffering realistic violence, shows the trauma that inflicts on survivors, and then lets you know that if violence can be justified, it's okay to enjoy it, to revel in it, maybe to fantasize about doing it.  Maybe if the rules broke down a little bit, maybe if society collapsed and you got to do whatever you wanted, you could dish out all sorts of violence to everybody you think deserves it, and it would be okay.  because it's all justified.  It had to be done.  Or you could be some namby-pamby regular person and die like a moron because you don't know how to use weapons like the Strong Boys.  It's worth pointing out that these two characters that die gruesome, painful, and pointless deaths because of their inability to kill people are a sexy lady, so you know she's dumb and worthless, and a gay dude who, in case you missed the message, in one scene wears ladies' shoes, so you know that he's effeminate and therefore weak and therefore a liability.  Not like Strong Boy, who is so annoyed that you're talking about gay stuff.  Ew!  I guess the first time I knew I was gay, I was 13.  This guy, Todd, he was building a deck in our backyard.  Okay, just please stop.  Fuck this movie!  Fuck its toxic legacy of converting a once sensitive and socially conscious subgenre and turning it into survivalist propaganda.  Even though it's not really the movie's fault, it's a broader problem.  There's something deeply fitting about the fact that, despite their humanity having been ripped away from them, zombie movies keep shambling on, a husk of their former selves, clinging to a life they no longer remember and can't return to.  Maybe the real zombie was movies.  Thanks for watching.  Fuck Zack Snyder.  And please press the like and subscribe buttons for me, your old buddy, old pal, Matt. ",
