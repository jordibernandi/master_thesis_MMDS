So, ultimately, each of you are here representing the services and you are responsible for making sure that these private partners are providing safe housing, responding to maintenance on time, generally satisfying the terms of their agreements.  In practice, these private housing providers are virtually guaranteed to make a profit.  They get a base fee plus cost.  Your big tool is the incentive fee.  Now, DOD told the committee that The incentive fees were paid out about 95% of the time.  And you heard the testimony from the companies themselves, not a single one, said they were ever denied all of their incentive fees at the same time that we're receiving testimony about appalling conditions.  So I just wanna understand what's gone wrong here.  How it is that these guys can get 95% of their incentive fees plus their base fee, plus their expenses, at the same time that we're hearing this kind of testimony.  So let me ask my first one.  Secretary McMahon, tenant surveys are your main tool to determine whether private partners are meeting their obligations.  But those surveys evidently did not alert you to the mice, the mold, and the lead poisoning.  So do you agree that surveys are not giving you a complete picture of what's going on? ",
