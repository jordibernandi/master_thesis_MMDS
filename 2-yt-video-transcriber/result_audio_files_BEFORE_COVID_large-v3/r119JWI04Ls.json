The glow is white.  So why are they surrounded by a blob of cold air?  Why is this jet surrounded by a cold glow?  Or these engines here?  Or this jet?  Could it be that the dog, the people, and the jets each have some kind of alien technology anti-gravity generators that are warping space around them and somehow cooling the air?  No, of course not.  It's obviously just an artifact of the thermal camera system, not alien technology.  And yet alien technology is exactly what some people are claiming about the same glow seen in the gimbal video. ",

But all this glow, this aura, this cold warping of space-time actually is, is a contrast enhancement in the camera that highlights the edges.  It's a filter called an Unsharp Mask, sometimes used to give a slight sharpening in photography or video.  It's a simple filter, easy to add to a camera.  Thermal camera footage is often low contrast, and people using it for surveillance, like law enforcement or military, don't care so much about the aesthetics, so they often crank it up, which gives you the glow, but really makes the heat sources stand out against the background.  All the videos I showed you at the start had this effect, except for the dog one.  I added that myself so you can see what it looks like.  Unsharp mask?  No mask.  Unsharp mask?  No mask.  So no.  The glow around the gimbal UFO is not evidence of advanced alien technology.  It's the sharpening in the camera, cranked up to 11.  If you've got experts telling you otherwise, maybe you should look at what else they are telling you.  Even experts sometimes make mistakes. ",
