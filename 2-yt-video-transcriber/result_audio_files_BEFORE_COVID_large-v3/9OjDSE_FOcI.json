            "text": "Serena looking for a trainer.  Yeah, we've got a problem here.  The physio has come out to take a look at Serena Williams.  Uh-oh.  Serena in tears.  I didn't see what happened if she was favoring anything.  Serena.  Bianca's going over.  Wow.  The match is over.  Dude, dude.  Don't even get me started.  You're not walking.  I can't move.  Yo, I've watched your whole career.  You're a fucking beast with injuries.  I've been through so many already.  I mean, you know how they are.  This sucks.  On your back, right?  I know everything about you.  Wow.  Thank you.  Wasn't that an amazing moment?  Even if you're not a sports fan, you have to look at that and think, isn't that a great moment of humanity and solidarity, of kindness and friendship?  You know, this is a big match for both players.  Serena Williams is the greatest female tennis player ever.  She might well be one of the greatest athletes of human history.  But, you know, she's been struggling with injury.  and wants to come back on a strong note.  And for Bianca Andreescu, the young Canadian, she's trying to make her mark in tennis, and she won a tournament of this caliber earlier in the year, but has really been struggling with injury, and as with all of these things when you're a young athlete, you want to prove that it wasn't a fluke the first time you won, you want to prove you can do it again, and you want to prove you can do it again against the greatest of all time, and still one of the greatest nowadays.  So it's all cast in this adversarial relationship, these two great athletes, the grizzled veteran and the young up-and-comer.  But in this moment, Serena Williams is injured, and she realizes she can't continue on.  And it's no longer about winning and losing, because Andreescu comes over, and she consoles Serena.  This young woman, she's still a teenager, goes down and consoles one of the greatest athletes of all time.  And she talks about her shared experience with injury, and she talks about how she's idolized Serena, and she's been watching her her whole career.  And because Serena's been playing for more than 20 years, I mean, Serena's pro tennis career is older than Andreescu in some ways.  It's hard to believe.  Serena's not an old woman, but she's been a star since she's been a teenager herself.  So... It's this really powerful moment, and there's this great line where, you know, Andreescu almost knows what Serena's injury is because she follows Serena so closely, because she knows that, okay, Serena has periodic back issues and things like that.  And it's such a special event because... It's a sign of real solidarity.  These women compete with one another.  There's no teams in tennis.  It's an individual sport.  I mean, there's doubles tennis, but in individual tennis, there's no teams.  They compete with one another week in, week out.  But I think there's a solidarity.  There's an understanding that it's a grueling schedule and it's a grueling sport and it's incredibly emotionally and physically and mentally demanding.  And in that moment, There was a young woman who, in a sense, took on the role of being the voice of stability and support for one of the greatest of all time.  And it shows that even the greatest among us can be really vulnerable and can need support.  And it can show that even young folks, even the up-and-comers can have moments in which they show real leadership and they show real support for those who would, in most cases, be the ones expecting to give support and give leadership.  So even if you're not a big fan of sports, I think it's these sorts of moments that I can show to people and say, you know, sports isn't just about the numbers.  It's not just about the winning and the losing.  It's not just about the brand deals.  It's about these real moments where the physical expression, where the physical realities of the sport give way to these pure emotional human moments.  And whether it's athletes helping one another after injury, or whether it's Andreescu in this moment where she's won a major tournament, And has made a ton of money relative to how much she's made in her career in this win.  Is not thinking about any of that.  She's not thinking about this as a stepping stone to greater things for herself.  She's thinking about her fellow competitor and her injury.  And how she wants to support her.  And I think also she's thinking, I would have liked to win a different way.  Because it's not just about the W on the score sheet.  It's about... proving yourself all the years of training and effort and exertion to say, I've worked hard and I can beat the best when she's at her best.  And today that didn't happen.  Andreescu's win is 100% deserved.  But I bet she feels, I would wager she feels, that she would rather have done it the traditional way.  And I think Serena Williams, obviously, certainly doesn't want to lose in any case, but if she does lose, she would want to lose knowing that she was able to give it her 110%.  And so it's these moments that reveal such character, such humanity.  And you see it in all sports.  You see it in all sports.  Individual and team, pro and semi-amateur, you know, whether it's the Olympics or whether it's professional sports, you see these moments.  That's why sports is really special.  And that's why I think this is going to speak to more people than just those who follow tennis or sports broadly. ",
