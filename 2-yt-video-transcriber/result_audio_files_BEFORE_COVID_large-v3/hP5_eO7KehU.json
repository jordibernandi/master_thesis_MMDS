            "text": "Hello there, I'm Lloyd Evans and you're watching the John Cedars channel from the bunker.  And you must excuse me if I'm wearing a jacket, it's because it's quite cold in here and I don't have my heating up and running just yet.  I've jumped in front of the camera because I really need to talk about this article in the Moscow Times.  It's just gone up three hours ago as of filming, titled, Seven Jehovah's Witnesses Brutally Tortured in Russia, Spokesman Says.  It's just a heart-wrenching article.  And, well, I'm going to talk a little bit about my thoughts on the Russian ban and what I've said before.  But let me first of all read this article to you.  It's only a brief article.  a spokesman for the jehovah's witnesses has said that russian investigators have brutally tortured adherents of the group who are currently held in detention.  russia's supreme court declared the jehovah's witnesses an extremist organization in twenty seventeen leading to mass raids and causing hundreds of its estimated one hundred and seventy five thousand members to flee the country.  Earlier this month, a court in the city of Oriole convicted Dennis Christensen, a Danish Jehovah's Witness, of extremism and sentenced him to six years behind bars in a case that rights groups warned may trigger a crackdown on religious minorities.  A spokesperson for the Jehovah's Witnesses said Tuesday that investigators in the Siberian city of Sergut had stripped... suffocated, doused with water and applied stun guns on at least seven believers detained on extremism charges, days after criminal cases were reportedly initiated against 19 Jehovah's Witnesses following mass raids.  the agents stripped the men naked put a bag over each suspect's head and wrapped it with tape.  agents then tied each suspect's hands behind his back smashed his fingers and beat him on his neck feet and kidney.  jared lopez a spokesman for jehovah's witnesses at their world headquarters in new york told the moscow times by email.  tuesday lopez said members of the investigative committee in surgut poured water over the men shocked them with a stun gun in the anus area gradually increasing the strength of the shock.  The victims were reportedly asked to disclose information about their meetings and leadership during the interrogation.  A Sergut court placed three of the alleged victims of torture in custody pending trial for two months, with an estimated 250 local Jehovah's Witness members in the crosshairs of the authorities.  And I cannot express just how... how appalled I am at this report.  I think that this is disgraceful and deplorable thuggery by the Russian authorities.  And if you're watching this as a Jehovah's Witness, you may be confused at this point.  What's this guy who's an ex-witness, who runs an apostate channel, why is he condemning this?  I condemned it before the ban.  I actually was on BBC World Service Radio and I was asked about my thoughts.  This is what I said. ",

            "text": "Hello, Nuala.  I think it's a terrible idea.  There are three main reasons why I'm opposed to the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses.  First reason is human rights, fairly obviously.  Everyone should be free to believe according to their conscience.  The second reason is persecution complex.  I think that with Jehovah's Witnesses, a lot of the teachings and beliefs are oriented around Satan's world coming after them.  And this sort of action by the Russian authorities really kind of bolsters that kind of fear and paranoia.  And the third reason is that You know, by banning Jehovah's Witnesses, you're driving the organization underground.  And that makes a lot of the more dark and more abusive practices harder to regulate. ",

            "text": "I also made a video titled The Day After the Ban, which I put out shortly before the ban was introduced, explaining in detail my reasons for condemning it.  Put simply, no matter how much I dislike The organization and dislike is putting it mildly.  No matter how much contempt I have for the abusive policies and practices of the Jehovah's Witness organization, we must always, always differentiate between the leadership and those being led.  Jehovah's Witnesses I view as victims already because they have their lives devoted to something that is ultimately unfactual.  illogical and ultimately it can be abusive depending on the circumstances.  So they're already victims.  People who are victims need support, sympathy, understanding, resources to help them get through these issues.  and instead of providing those things the russian government is rounding these people up and best case scenario incarcerating them as has happened with dennis christensen and we don't know what's happening to him in a russian jail by the way.  And worst case scenario, these people are being outrageously tortured.  Nobody ever deserves to be tortured just because of what's going on in their heads.  And when I first spoke out against this ban, I received a lot of abuse from other ex-Jehovah's Witnesses who accused me of being, among other things, an apologist.  And they seem to think that Putin had a handle on this.  Putin knows what he's doing.  He knows how to deal with cults.  Well, this is the wisdom of Putin that we're seeing right here.  This is what the Russian regime is capable of and always has been capable of.  We knew they were doing this already in the case of homosexuals in Russia, or at least in parts of Russia.  So... This should come as no surprise, but I still feel utterly, utterly gutted to hear of this.  I feel that Jehovah's Witnesses are in need of support and resources to help them get their critical thinking skills up and running, and we simply do not persuade people in that situation.  by clamoring for this sort of thing, by cheerleading for this sort of brutality.  We need to take a stand, I believe, as ex-witnesses and say, no, it's the leadership we have an issue with.  And make no mistake, in this particular scenario, as I said in the Day After the Ban video, this plays directly into the governing body's hands.  I mean, seriously, if you are Stephen Lett, Tony Morris, Mark Sanderson, Jeffrey Jackson, I think it's unreasonable to say they're rubbing their hands, but this is furnishing those men with decades worth of persecution porn, as I've called it in the past.  There will be videos made that talk about this, reenacting some elements of the torture.  And these videos will be used to bring more people into the organization.  And imagine as well, because there's 175,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, apparently, A percentage of those are going to be physically in, mentally out.  And some of you watching this who are ex-Jehovah's Witnesses are probably in that situation.  You're not able to speak out publicly.  But as far as your families are concerned, you're a Jehovah's Witness.  Well, imagine if you're in the situation where you are going along to the occasional meeting just to keep your family happy because you don't want them to shun you.  And on top of having that to deal with, you're also worried about being on the receiving end of this sort of brutality.  Imagine being in the scenario... Where you're tortured like this, but you're thinking, I'm going to have to go through with this torture because otherwise I will be outed as an apostate and I'll be shunned by my family.  So I'd rather take the torture.  Imagine having that kind of dilemma to deal with.  It's a dilemma that no one should have to deal with.  If we respect human rights and if we recognize that no matter how nonsensical people's beliefs are, people have the right to hold them and have the right to think them, you cannot be policed for what's going on in your head.  And I recently had a comment from somebody who watched the Day After the Ban video, and I got into a little bit of an exchange, a very respectful exchange, but he made the observation, well, what's your suggestion?  You're condemning something here, but what is it that you propose instead?  I propose holding the leadership to account, and I've always proposed that.  I would ideally like to see every single one of the governing body behind bars serving time proportionate to how long they've been serving as governing body members for the covering up of child sex abuse.  That's what I think needs to happen.  I think that Watchtower as an entity needs to be prosecuted, needs to be fined.  legislation needs to be passed to make it impossible for organizations like Watchtower to abuse people.  But certainly not to allow them, certainly not for there to be a situation where they can get away with this sort of behavior and claim tax exemptions and claim charitable status.  So part of the problem, I think, is that there's so much ignorance on the part of governments in dealing with cults.  that this frustration among XJWs boils over to the point where they're able to side with someone like Putin, who, I'm sorry, is just a monster.  And it's because not enough is being done about Jehovah's Witnesses in modern democracies where they understand things like human rights and they're able to come up with solutions, come up with legislation that punishes abuse but doesn't punish people simply for having the wrong ideas in their heads.  So, I realize I've spoken about this a number of times, but it's just one of those times in your life where you think, no, something needs to be said about this.  I do not want to be, I don't want anyone who watches my channel or who stumbles on my channel who might be a Jehovah's Witness just assuming that I'm okay with this just because I'm an ex-witness.  I want to make it very clear that I utterly, utterly condemn this torture in the strongest possible terms.  And if it were in my power to prevent it, if I were there at the time, I'd be doing everything I can to stop it.  We need to be better than this.  We need to find ways of tackling cults and tackling destructive mind control groups that do not involve punishing the victims.  So that's all I really have to say.  Thank you for bearing with me for my rant.  Please don't forget to subscribe to the John Cedars channel for more of my thoughts, more of my videos.  But for now, thank you so much for watching.  I've been so long, I fell off from the top of the world But it's finally over, finally over. ",
