And yes, essentially right now the space debris is going every which way but given a while again a long ass while the chunks of debris will become a uniform ring.  as i understand it this happens because there will always be more of these pieces travelling in one particular direction than any of the others.  So over time, as parts are smashed together, they are either completely obliterated or they'll start to move into the direction that the majority of objects are already moving.  And as a disk is formed, the remaining parts that are not already in the mass of objects now have this thing that they have a very high chance to smash into on the regs.  So this is simplified because of my limited braining, but the fact is they will absolutely do this over time and your credulity or inability to understand doesn't change that.

Or your simplistic gibbon brain doesn't understand that when you see something that isn't intuitive to you, instead of everyone else must be lying or trying to lie, that actually you simply don't understand it.  Because here's the main reason I always end up sticking to the science.  And I've said it before, but it always, always, always bears repeating.  these lies and these hidden truths for some goddamn reason keep making things that work whether they be predictions about the universe or the world around us or more importantly to the everyday slack-jawed yokel technology.  that does frankly astounding things that wouldn't work if everything they did and said was lies.  And then on the other end of that spectrum, flat earther and general pseudoscience pushers of all types only ever seem to produce really, really bad YouTube videos where they can't even get a basic green screen to work properly or fill the frame.  It's absolutely baffling that you can't do that, but you're convinced that you're smarter than everyone else. ",

Now that is my stupid and overly simplified and very, very likely I'm a bit wrong explanation, But it is certainly nowhere close to some insane brain-melting mathematics that no one but the smartest of brainers could understand.  And the fact that you didn't even try just goes to show that you aren't just stupid, you are lazy.  And there is very little to be gained from listening to you unless you're an idiot knight making internet videos because no one loves him.  And none of us are that pathetic.  Oh wait.  Okay, for those of you who are keeping up, this is normally where I would have stuck an advert for Sick Stuff TM, but today I wanted instead to update those of you who care on the state of the infamous firehouse.  It is officially move back in-able to.  Water, electric and gas all back in play and a moving van booked for mid next week.  Huzzah!  It's been a heck of a few months that was... Apparently supposed to be two weeks.  That didn't happen.  I've impressed myself with my ability to keep on top of getting out regular vids although I haven't been a hundred percent happy with them all including this one, but Hopefully once I can have just a little bit more normalcy I can knuckle down and really start making stupid stupid content.  But I wanted to end this video with a thank you to everyone who's been so supportive during this time.  Whether that be kind words, throwing us a little bit of shiny coins, or most importantly of all, pointing out how ironic this line now is.  amazingly not only do i not have a small jar in my house i don't have any at all and yet somehow my house hasn't burnt down.  yeah that aged well.  so thank you.  everyone here's to getting back on track and making even more dumb jokes about the sillies.  Also, while I'm here, Mrs.  Sick will be celebrating her birthday this Sunday, as it's her birthday on the Monday.  So we will be seeing out our last proper night in this place with our usual terrible streams for terrible people.  We usually start around 10 or 11, so say hi if you want.  Otherwise, we will see you on the other side.  Cheers.  Thank you. ",
