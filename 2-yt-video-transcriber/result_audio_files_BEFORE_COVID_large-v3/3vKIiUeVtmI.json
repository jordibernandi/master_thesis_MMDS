Given the blunderbuss nature of their subpoenas and the clearly political nature of their investigation, it may very well be that many people will resist these subpoenas, invoke privileges, and litigate the matter, and they may very well, and that is the Democrats in the House, create bad law on the power to subpoena individuals.  These investigations are skirting an area of the law that the Supreme Court has ruled that if investigations become abusive, they can be stopped.  Now, there is a presumption that what Congress does is justified.  But that presumption can be overcome by the facts and circumstances of an individual situation.  Nadler better be careful.
