            "text": "Fingers down my spine Girl, you're looking mighty fine.  Oh, won't you rub your fingers down my spine Girl, you're looking mighty fine.  Hello everyone and welcome to a new sex toy review.  Today's product is Male Masturbator Cup with 3 Pump Suction and 9 Vibration Modes for Men, Masturbation, Electric Vibrating Heating Blowjob Stroker for Penis Stimulation, Fond Love Oral Sex Toy for Adult Pleasure by Fond Love.  So this is the toy.  It looks kind of like a pepper grinder.  But it's actually, it's like a blowjob machine.  It's a combination of a vibrating masturbation cup and a suction kind of toy.  So I have an example of both of these kinds of toys.  So this is a suction kind of toy.  I reviewed this fairly recently.  So the way this works, is it gonna work?  Come on.  All right, here we go.  All right, so the way a suction toy works, in case you don't know, I'm gonna put my finger in this actually.  you can see that it sucks it right and what you do is you can ride the you know the release button and it creates like kind of a like a tempo of suction and then you kind of like you masturbate with it like this as you're riding the suction and this is effectively how a suction toy works.  okay all right.  so that's a suction toy all right Alright, so the suction toys are good if you're into the sensation of actually having your dick sucked and not just like basically having a woman use her mouth like a kind of a substitute vagina.  Alright, this is like a male vibrator masturbation cup.  It's a very simple device.  It's effectively just a silicone sleeve.  And this entire part of the toy is actually two extremely powerful vibrators.  So I'm gonna peel this back a bit.  This entire thing right here is a vibrator thing.  They rest kind of horizontally.  One is here, one is here, and they're stupid powerful.  So I'm just going to show you this.  You may not be able to appreciate it, though.  So, like, I don't know if you could tell just how powerful the vibrators are for this, but I'm going to put it on the desk just so you can see.  It's like a Zuzu pet.  Remember Zuzu pets?  Anybody remember, you know, hit like in the comment section if you remember Zuzu Pets.  So this is like a masturbating Zuzu Pet.  It uses vibrations to actually like move along the ground.  It's pretty freaking crazy.  And the vibrators in this thing are stupid powerful.  And like you put your dick in this and just kind of go in and out for a few seconds, it'll make you cum.  That brings us to today's toy.  This is a combination of those two toys.  It has suction and it also has vibration.  So the way it works is you hit the power button.  Alright, that's the vibrator.  It doesn't have low, medium, high.  It just has different kind of pulses.  So it's always on high.  The downside to this toy is the vibrator isn't that powerful.  It's not bad.  It's akin to... I mean, let me try to see if I can get a good feel for it.  It's like your basic kind of bullet vibrator.  It's not like a crazy powerful.  This one is stupid powerful.  But like your basic, like when you think of a vibrating toy, that's what it is.  It's like the kind of vibrator that would be like in your console controller.  So that's one function, it has the vibrating function.  So you put your dick in, and it has two vibrators.  Very similar to this, they're just not as big, they're not as powerful.  It has two more functions.  It has a heat function, that's what the little sun button is.  Hold down the heat function, I think it lights up.  Come on, light up.  Oh, I guess you have to turn the suction on first?  I don't know.  I thought this had a light.  Alright, I don't see a light.  It's supposed to have a heating function, but I can't really... I can't confirm that.  I have used it.  I felt there is a heat function.  The other thing it has is it has suction.  So the way the suction... Let me see if I can show you.  Hold on, let's turn this off.  Alright, so I don't know if you can see this.  Can't really see it.  There's a hole at the very bottom of the channel that sucks in liquid and then it comes out right here towards the lip.  So you can see that hole?  That's where the liquid comes out or the air comes out, whatever.  So it's like a constant channel.  It sucks in at the tip and then it spits out over here and it creates like kind of a whatever.  So the whole point of this is you stick your dick in it and you turn on the vibrator, turn on the heat, you turn on the suction and you get like a legit kind of blowjob experience.  However, OK, so there's one downside I do want to talk about because this is hard plastic.  Whereas this is more flexible.  See that?  So if you're a little bit on the girthy side, you could fit your dick into this.  It might be a little tight, but it'll still accommodate you because the toy is inherently flexible.  So just to compare, you know, stick two fingers down here, but I could stick three fingers in if I needed to see.  So I can stick three fingers into this.  I can't stick three fingers into this.  Can I sit three fingers into this?  Yep.  So my point is you can, If you're girthy, I'm using my fingers as a benchmark.  So you can stick three fingers into these toys.  So these are appropriate for girthy guys.  I cannot stick three fingers into this toy.  So if you're on the girthier side, you may want to steer clear of this toy.  Just because it is, you know, it's a little bit, it would be on the tight side for you.  I didn't have a problem with this, but I have reviewed toys in the past.  And some of my followers who are on the girthy side have bought the toy and have been disappointed because the toy isn't made for guys with their girth.  So I'm just giving you a heads up.  I'm giving you a heads up about the... If you're on the girthy side, probably steer clear of this because this is a two-finger toy.  This isn't a three-finger toy.  Really the only thing I don't... Oh, the other thing is it comes with a USB charger.  The USB charger plugs in... See this little hole in between all the buttons?  That's where the USB charger plugs in.  So it plugs in like a headphone jack.  See?  Like that.  Now what this means is this entire toy is waterproof.  Not like, don't submerge it in water, but you could rinse this off in the sink.  Which is great, because that's one of the reasons why I like this toy.  I can just rinse the whole thing off in the sink, and it's not a problem.  I don't have to take it apart.  This toy can't be taken apart, and you don't need to take it apart.  You can rinse the whole thing off in the sink.  So after you're done using it, and actually, the one advantage to this over this, is because this toy is like, uh, like, it's not really shaped like a vagina, it doesn't hug your dick.  Again, if you take your dick out and you're not pointing it down, the cum will get all over your pants or the floor or something.  Whereas this, it more like snugs around your dick, because it's kind of like a mouth shape.  So the cum's going to stay in there easier than it would with a toy like this.  So there are advantages to this design.  The only disadvantages I can see is if you're on the girthy side.  If you're not on the girthy side, there's no problem.  The only improvement I would make is I think the vibrators could be more powerful.  Now, this is a pretty cheap toy.  It's only $37.97 normally.  I have a 15% off coupon code, which will take more money off.  But at full price, if you pay MSRP, it's less than $40.  Now, I would love to see a slightly more expensive version, probably in the $70 to $80 range, that has the vibrators of this toy along with the suction of this toy.  I think that kind of combination would be great.  It might actually, like, go right up there to, like, one of my favorite toys.  As it stands now, the vibrator's fine.  I'd put it, you know, if I had to, I'd definitely put it above the suction toy.  Because suction toys are kind of like, once you've tried one, you've tried them all.  They just suck.  In a good way, but still they suck.  But as far as vibrating toys go, I prefer this one because the vibrators are stronger.  However, I do like the design for this one and I like that.  it has the suction.  So I would love to see more powerful vibrators.  I do understand that that's going to raise the price of the toy.  So, this is a heads up, pass it on to your engineers.  I wouldn't mind paying closer to $70, $80 for a toy like this with more powerful vibrations to go with the suction.  But for the price point for a sub $40 sex toy, I think this is a solid buy, assuming you're not too girthy.  If you're average sized, if you've used other toys that I've recommended in the past with no problems, then this is a good recommendation.  If not, if you're on the girthy side and other toys that I've recommended have hurt you or broken, maybe steer clear.  That's my only really downside.  Stronger vibration and maybe a different model for girthier guys.  Or maybe allow the shell to be adjustable or, I don't know, like... I don't know.  I can't think of too many things because I think the design is good.  It just doesn't leave a lot of room if you're on the thicker side.  That's all.  Anyway, good recommended toy.  If you're looking for a toy that's sub $40, I think it's probably one of the better toys I've ever seen.  So thank you Fondle for sponsoring this video.
