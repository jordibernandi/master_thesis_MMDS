I don't think people realize how much further behind blacks started and how much progress has been made.  There's a distinguished economic historian, Robert Higgs, who has said that for blacks to go from being completely illiterate in the middle of the 19th century to being one-half literate by 1900 is just an amazing achievement in the history of the world, that you very seldom find that kind of change that quickly.

Because when it comes to the incentives that are created, the businessman is going to try to protect himself whatever way he can.  And that means hiring those blacks who are overqualified, who have a long track record and so on.  And that's what all the data show.  For example, black couples where the husband and wife are both college educated now make more money than white couples where the husband and wife are both educated.  But the black female-headed family has lost real income in absolute terms over the past several years and has fallen further behind white female-headed families.  So the very opposite trends are going on at the same time.  And you can't argue that it's because of blackness or racism, because both of them are black people.  One group is shooting way ahead.  One is falling further and further behind.  And a large part of that reason, I believe, and the data seem to suggest, is because the incentives created by affirmative action and similar kinds of programs just make it too dangerous to take a chance.  I don't ask what is the cause of poverty.  Everybody is born poor and ignorant.  The question is, what factors allow some groups to get from that position?  Blacks, first of all, started further back and are coming forward.  And at this point, there simply has not been the pattern of entrepreneurship in the black population.  That's been true of other groups, such as the Irish, for example.  The Irish are doing quite well today, but they're not doing well in entrepreneurial occupations.  They're in the law, they're in the church, they're in this, they're in that.  And the bottom line is they're doing better than the average American, but they're not doing it in those particular fields.  Every group succeeds in some particular area.

So it's not that politics can't do anything.  It's a question that politics, like everything else, has some things it can do and some things it can't do.  And from what I've seen of groups around the world economically, one of the things it seems not to be able to do is raise groups from poverty to affluence.  People have discriminated against other people wherever they've had the power to do it almost everywhere in the world in almost every period of history.  Some groups are kept back by this and some groups it seems to make no difference whatever.  Insofar, for example, as you have entrepreneurial skills, the fact that people didn't hire Jews in the 19th century didn't stop Jews from hiring each other and dominating industries such as the garment industry or the beginning of the great Hollywood movie studios and other areas of the economy.  It is the skills that are crucial and not the fact that other people are willing or unwilling to hire you. ",
