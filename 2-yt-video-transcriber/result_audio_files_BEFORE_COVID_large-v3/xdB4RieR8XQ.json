Derek Beach was fired in October for violating the department's pursuit policies and were told disobeying direct orders to disengage from a high-speed chase.  But as NBC4's Ted Hart tells us, Officer Beach insists he never was actually engaged in that pursuit. ",

That was enough for the city's safety director, who wrote, I find that your decision-making process is fundamentally flawed, as demonstrated by your actions over not only this day, but other incidents in your career.  One of those other incidents involving Beach was this one, another high-speed pursuit documented by his dash cam, hitting speeds of 115 miles per hour, passing vehicles on the right, speeding through neighborhoods.
