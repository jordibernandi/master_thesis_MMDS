Then she goes to college, presumably for four years.  Then she graduates in 2025.  So between 2025 and 2027, she works for AmeriCorps until she gets bored, then becomes a solar engineer, then makes her career in childcare until she decides to run for Congress in 2028.  And as far as those giant windmills behind the White House, Washington, D.C.  is very protective about its skyline, so that's never happening.  Okay, maybe it's a metaphor, but either way it's stupid.  But none of this matters because the big revelation here is that Ocasio-Cortez plans to give up her congressional seat sometime before 2028.  And that means either AOC is going to have a successful run in the Senate, or even worse, she becomes President of the United States.  Okay, if I've learned anything from time travel movies, it's that there is no fate but what we make, which means that the future isn't set in stone, especially the one that AOC is painting.  Painting, see what I did there?  Because what if I told you that we could keep driving the same cars and flying the same planes and still get to net zero emissions?  There's a company called Carbon Engineering that can remove CO2 from the atmosphere.  Each facility would have the capacity to not only remove 1 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere each year, but also uses that CO2 to produce 84,000 gallons of ultra-low carbon synthetic transportation fuel each day.  The technology is proven, and Carbon Engineering is now in the process of building their first commercial plants.  Imagine having tens of thousands of these facilities around the globe, creating millions of jobs and helping the entire planet get to net zero emissions by 2050.  And the best part?  No socialism or social justice required.  Thanks for watching, sharing, and hitting that like button.
