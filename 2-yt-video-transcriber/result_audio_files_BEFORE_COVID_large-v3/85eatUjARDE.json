            "text": "Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of Who Wants to Retire in America?  That's right, the game show where we see just how many people or just how few people will actually get to have a retirement.  So I got a couple articles here to go over today.  And the first one is from Barron's.  And it's called The Next Retirement Crisis.  How Many Seniors Won't Be Able to Afford Housing Today?  Well, I'm surprised the Federal Reserve didn't issue a statement that said, you know, housing isn't necessary.  The economy's doing great.  Housing isn't necessary.  You can live in your car.  You can live under a bridge.  So, um... 54% of middle-income seniors aren't expected to have the financial wherewithal to pay for senior housing.  Okay.  In the next 10 years.  And so, um... There's going to be a major epidemic.  There's going to be a major crisis.  It's going to be like America's going to turn into something like Japan.  If you walk around the streets of Japan, like especially in Osaka, you see a lot of really old people.  God bless them.  I got nothing against them.  Actually, I admire them.  I liked being around really old people for some reason.  I don't know why.  I just... I like to see really, really old people walking around, still getting out of bed every day and walking down the street and trying hard.  It's very inspiring to me.  But this is really bad news.  Because as baby boomers hit their mid to late 70s, their kids are probably going to be at work, so they're not going to be able to come home and change their diaper.  And if they can't afford this managed care type situation, what are they going to do?  See, it says here, the oldest boomers... will be 83 in a decade.  Researchers project 60% of the 14.4 million middle-income seniors who are 75 or older will have some sort of mobility issues, and two-thirds will have a chronic condition, and about 8% will have cognitive impairment.  I would disagree.  I would say baby boomers already have a large amount of cognitive impairment.  I mean, we're talking about people who voted for George W. Bush and Barack Obama.  Oh wait, I voted for Bush once.  But never for Obama, so... You can't hold me, uh... You can't hold me accountable for that one.  So, um... You know, the money... They don't have the money, first of all.  And a lot of them are relying on, uh... Social Security, okay?  But here's the problem with Social Security.  How much longer will Social Security last?  The 2018 annual report from the Social Security Board of Trustees indicates that the Social Security Trust funds will largely be depleted by 2034.  So that means that the administration will be able to continue to pay out what they take in each year, but nothing more.  So here's the... Here's the thing.  Americans are forced to pay into this Ponzi scheme, and that's what it is.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  It started after World War II to give Americans and the post-World War II generation this idea that there was a social net that would... The big government's going to always be there to help you because you helped defeat the angry little man with the tiny mustache.  But the truth is... Now Americans are paying into this.  It's going to run out of cash reserves in 15 years.  And the Social Security Administration estimates that even after their cash reserves are depleted, they'll still be able to pay out 77% of retirement benefits and 96% of disability benefits.  So it's not a total loss, but it is going to become a bigger loss.  This means that, wow, what a great investment.  I give you 100%, you give me 77% back.  But the truth is, this is going to be much lower by the time people who are contributing the amount they are, which is the 12.4% of your salary... you're going to be getting back 8%, 6%.  So as if you don't already have to keep up with inflation, now Big Brother is breaking your leg, handing you a crutch and saying, see, I helped you walk.  So this article here on Seeking Alpha goes on to encourage people not to rely on social security.  That's like saying don't eat the yellow snow.  Yeah, I think people are kind of cynically aware of this.  So it says that you should contribute to a 401 .  Yeah, I mean maybe.  Contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA.  Create a backdoor Roth IRA if you're in San Francisco or Seattle.  Or you can have a self-directed IRA like a gold IRA.  which is something I've been recommending for a while now, since everything else is an admitted scam.  I mean, the only things left that are not scams, precious metals.  That's it.  Everything else is a highly inflated scam.  And growing your own food, okay?  That's about the only thing that is not a scam right now.  So moving on, this is mainstream, mainstream media.  There's a retirement crisis in America where most will be unable to afford a solid life.  Private savings, you get punished now for saving with the low interest rates.  Pensions, there are pension crises breaking out all over the world, and Social Security going downhill are all in dire shape.  At Vanguard, the median 401k account value for an investor aged 65 and older is less than $60,000.  Can you imagine trying to live and retire for 15 to 20 years off $60,000 plus Social Security?  And I'll get to the average.  The average amount of Social Security drawn is around $1,400.  Can you imagine living off of that your entire life?  You work so hard so you can live in some hood apartment in South Central like I was when I was waiting tables in West  L.A.?  What a reward.  This is your payoff.  This is your payoff, Goyim, for supporting all those trillion dollar wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Atta Goy.  So, um... Uh-oh, the St.  Louis Fed concluded, it could be worrisome that for many American households, the total balances of their retirement accounts may not be sufficient to ensure a solid life in retirement.  Don't you love how the Federal Reserve comes out and states the obvious as if they are necessary, as they continue to parasitically drain us of the value of our currency, but then they go, oh, by the way, you're going to have a rough time ahead.  Thanks.  Can I have some money now?  Alright, so let's get down here to some more stats.  The median 401k is less than $60,000.  Yeah, and like I said, 20 years is about the average life expectation past retirement.  Wow.  And you can't even have $3,000 a year from that.  Amazing.  Median private pension is only less than $10,000 a year.  And Social Security, yeah.  The average Social Security check is $1,422 a month.  So, you'd be living on $29,000 a year, which is less than $3,000 a month.  So, even if you have a home, you're paying property taxes.  Even if you have low expenses, everything is expensive.  And you wonder why seniors aren't going to be able to have housing.  This is really horrible news.  And this is mainstream media.  They're putting out this information and yet this is not what anyone is paying attention to.  This is glossed over on mainstream news.  If anybody out there in the general public tries to have a conversation with others about this, they're going to be... They're gonna be told, oh, it won't be so bad.  Oh, it'll be okay.  Oh, stop complaining.  So they keep kicking this can down the road but the problem is the can keeps getting heavier and people keep skipping leg day in the gym.  So eventually this is going to come to a head and the outcome is not going to be pretty.  So let's look at the retirement savings survey.  In 2018, the survey found that 42% of Americans had less than $10,000 saved for retirement.  So imagine 4.2 out of 10 seniors walking the streets, you know, poor and, you know, limping around.  It's a very dismal picture.  And on average, adults 65 and older spend almost $46,000 a year.  So how much you want to bet?  after Trump leaves office, you're going to get some super hardcore socialist Democrats.  Because these older folks with no savings are going to be begging for the government to steal even more money from younger generations.  to compensate for the fact that they did not save money.  and America has been on a downward path for the last 50 years, five zero years.  Accentuated, punctuated by Nixon taking the dollar off the gold standard and admitting defeat.  So there are small amounts of Americans.  So about 26% have $200,000 or more.  But really, still that's not enough to keep up with all these official numbers.  So it's really... It's really disconcerting.  I mean, this is America.  Is this the American dream that we were lied to about for the last 50, 60 years, told we were exceptional, told that deficits don't matter?  You know, what's going to happen when the party's over?  And what's it going to take?  Now, mind you, If these people have their money and 401ks or IRAs and the market tanks, then they're going to lose just about all of it.  This is why I've been making all these videos saying, look, you might want to get ready to sell and sideline some of your funds in your IRA or your 401k into cash or convert it into a self-directed IRA and get some metals like a gold IRA or just go out and buy some physical metals.  But again, then you run into the storage issues and the security issues.  But until then, I don't know.  I guess seniors are going to have to start buying smaller portions.  I for one have already gotten into that.  Like today, I bought this quarter pounder from McDonald's here.  and uh... i noticed with shrinkflation it's noticeably smaller.  it's also made out of some type of gummy bear material.  so i'm gonna have to write a letter to mcdonalds about that.  maybe get a get a lawyer and sue him or something for six six piece mcnuggets but anyways.  so what do you guys think?  What do you think about the retirement crisis?  You know, I got a great message from one of my patrons, and he broke it all down.  I'm assuming this guy is younger than me, probably by 10 or 15 years, and he's in school.  Let's just read what he wrote.  There's also the motivation for me filming this topic today.  I just wonder how the U.S.  can go on without restructuring its economy.  They say Social Security will run out of cash reserves in about 15 years.  That's very soon.  Google says it can fund 79% of people until 2090.  But they do not say if that will be paid with higher level debt servicing costs because of that, but probably... and they don't even include the future working age to retired population ratio which is going to make any current projections worthless by time and it might be the most important factor that determines if we can manage those liabilities.  on top of that half of working individuals cannot sustain their living standards in retirement exactly just like covered in the video.  who knows the rule numbers?  because there are stats that say the average american only has a couple grand in their savings accounts and most americans don't have 500 saved.  Who knows if our economy can ever run again without near zero interest rates.  That's another great point.  Look what happened at the end of 2018.  If you can't raise interest rates past 2.25% without everything pooping itself, proverbially, you know there's a problem.  stock market is only as high as it is because of easy money yep which is why individual investors get screwed.  because the firms have all the best info and they run up the prices a millisecond after they receive any exclusive data and sell it rapidly before anyone gets a chance to discern anything.  they inflate the valuation.  so much because they can afford to with virtually free debt servicing for themselves absolutely.  And now only the elites get to exclusively access most of this free debt.  because why would a bank or any other source of funding risk lend to anyone but the highest credit worthy groups when they barely get any return on the principal with low interest?  I 100% agree.  And this is why, you know, I used to be able to get a loan through PayPal, a business loan through PayPal from anywhere from 2K to like 6K, no problem at all.  And they just give me a loan.  And now they won't give me a penny.  Not that I really need it, not that I care, but it just shows, okay, the credit is drying up.  These banks... They smell what the rock is cooking, if you know what I mean.  They know it's coming.  And yes, they have cornered the market.  We're living in crony capitalism.  It's just a sneeze away from communism and fascism.  You're forced... to participate in the Affordable Care Act.  You're forced to pay your taxes and then they give almost a trillion to Raytheon and Halliburton and defense contractors.  You're forced to bail out the banks and all the risks they take and all the BS even though it doesn't benefit you at all.  And it's all just a wealth transfer.
