I think you're just showing that even from this alone, you don't think of individuals born in the United States.  as being part of the United States.  And I'm just wondering where someone from the District of Columbia, if you were to make the argument that it states that is not a state.  Would the gentleman yield?  So my question, no I will not yield.  I don't have a lot of time.  So I wanted to ask you about the Census Bureau Chief Scientist report that you discussed.  You said Mr.  Dowd wrote to you about the effect of the cost and accuracy of the census.  He estimated that the addition of a citizenship question would lower response rates by approximately 5.1% and would, quote, also reduce the quality of the resulting data.  Lower self-response rates degrade data quality because data obtained from NRFU non-response follow-up have greater erroneous enumeration and whole-person imputation rates.  Mr.  Secretary, is that what the memorandum stated? ",

Whereas it says in the scientific report of Dr.  Abboud that it will cost you $27 million additional funding to take up the inaccuracy of that.  And in the court's opinion, which is the court's opinion the State of New York versus the Department of Commerce and New York Immigration versus the United States Department of Commerce, that it's unlikely to remedy the reduction self-response rates, which means that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, will go uncounted in the census if the citizenship question is included.
