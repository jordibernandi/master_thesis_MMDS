            "text": "August the 20th, 2019.  As you're looking at the new Sky Live, and this is a simulator, but it's showing in the purple line what we call Comet 168P.  Now it's called technically 168P Hergenrother from the man that initially tracked it.  And I think it was back in 98 or 99.  It has a 6.9 year orbit and Thursday night it's going to be visible with the naked eye weather permitting in the east.  It's going to start after 9 p.m.  and last until about 5 a.m.  in the morning.  Now it's a high arc.  Earth is in the blue dot.  The sun is center in this model.  You see Mercury and Venus.  But 168 P's comes up from the bottom.  It's not in the elliptical orbit of the planets.  And it rises up heads out towards Jupiter.  Again, some call it seven year orbit, but it is a 6.9 year.  Now back in 2012, one year in November.  One year before ISUN came in November, this thing started disintegrating.  That was the last time it orbited close to us.  And it happened during the perihelium or the closest approach to the sun.  And that actually happened.  two weeks ago the its closest approach to the sun.  so we don't know if it's had any more effects but these pictures at the top are from 2012 and it shows four different objects.  you have to look very closely but all that was the big headlines back then orbit i mean the comet splits into four fragments.  now you're looking at currently Five different comets that are going to be visible or already visible that are incoming.  And so we'll update those as we get to it.  But just tomorrow night, looking east, guys.  We'll find east, look into that area because if you look at the model, it's obvious the sun will be behind us, setting in the west, and we'll be looking up and outward toward the comet.  Again, after 9 p.m.  central, start watching for it to rise, maybe around 9.15, 9.30, and that would be after 10 on the east coast, guys.  So as the sun sets and gets the sky starts to get dark, you can take advantage of it not being a bright moon.  Now, again, they saying naked eye visibility and you'll be looking for a bright star that has a tail behind it in the east sky.  And it's going to be.  you won't be able to tell it's rising because it's so far away that arm.  The motion won't be as obvious.  Now if you watch one of these models you can set them faster and you can see it.  But it'll be back around in 6.9 years.  Now the one thing that I mentioned about it breaking apart and showing the four different rocks.  is it's like a shotgun blast those spread out over time as it separates there.  initially they start pushing apart and we've seen it in other comments before.  that have split apart ison in 2013 split into wings and millions of pieces 40 million miles wide.  but it all a lot of people thought it was going to hit the sun but it barely missed it.  but what that did was create so much g-force on the comet that it broke it apart.  now notice this comet only comes as close as mars.  it doesn't dive right into the sun like some do and so it doesn't go through that stress.  but obviously that point that closest approach to the sun was enough to break it into four visible parts last orbit and so that's always interesting.  to see that and i don't know if you'll be able to without a telescope or maybe some powerful binoculars or zoom camera dsl or something like that guys or telescope you'll be able to see the smaller pieces.  it may be just one glow with that tail but these things are always interesting and so that's i just want to put a heads up on that.  we'll do another video between now and thursday night.  but guys now they're saying for 10 days you know with small telescopes and things like that you may be starting to see this thing and going forward for another week.  but Just check it out guys.  You don't get to see these very much.  A lot of times they're not close enough to see the tail.  But you're going to get to see one here.  Again Comet 168P Hergenrother.  Coming up in just about an hour from now but after the video loads.  well we'll be going live and that will be at 2 30 p.m central.  just a quick update.  last 30 minutes of the market.  some things we need to be watching.  it's a heads up be safe.
