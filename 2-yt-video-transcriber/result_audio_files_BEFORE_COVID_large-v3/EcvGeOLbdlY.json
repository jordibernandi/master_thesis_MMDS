A few students and myself are going to the atheist convention in Cincinnati this coming weekend.  And I just want some advice.  I've never really talked to an atheist.  Everybody I talk to seems to be some sort of believer.  And I wanted to ask, how can I prepare this week?  But I feel like God's already telling me to get in a quiet place with him.  Well, if I can tell you from an atheist point of view, how to witness to us is different.  Don't!  That's as simply as I can put it.  Most atheists in America, at least, this seems to be like America, you're talking about the American Atheist Convention that was held in Cincinnati this year.  It really, it just seems like you're talking about American type of atheists.  I know that it can be applied to all atheists around, but... surely in the United States, if you're an atheist, most likely you started out as a Christian.  There are some atheists out there that were never religious, and that's perfectly fine, but I can guarantee you that an atheist has heard about Jesus, about what kind of things he comes with, like all the baggage that he comes with.  I'm sure they have been proselytized before.  You are not going to meet an atheist and be like, hey, do you know about Jesus Christ?  You didn't know about Jesus Christ?  Where's our rule book?  Where's our manual?  I gotta get my manual.  This has never happened before.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared. ",

I don't hate unicorns because they are so good at playing hide and seek.  I don't hate God.  I hate Christians that use God in order to say, oh, atheists are immoral, or atheists are horrible people, or atheists don't have a foundation for being a good person, or something like that.

Marriage is not a godly institution.  Marriage was once used to form bonds between tribes so that they would be stronger and they would form allegiances and everything like that.

If you're talking about, oh, well, I felt God in my heart, you know, or anything like if your testimony is something a bit more tangible, we can definitely refute that.  But ultimately, it just comes down to, oh, I was convinced by this, and so you should be convinced by this too.  I've had this long-running idea that whenever somebody witnesses to you, they're saying, hey, you shouldn't think like you want to think.  You shouldn't believe what you believe.  You should believe what I want you to believe.  That's why I'm going to tell you this subjective experience I had or these subjective thoughts that I have.  And I'm going to say that they're completely and utterly true, like true in reality, not just true for whatever experience you had, but like these are factual things that these things happened and therefore you should believe too.  I feel that it's very egotistical, like the whole witnessing to atheists and trying to convince other people to your faith.  That's why I don't try to convince anybody on my channel to become an atheist.  I'm not going to sit here and tell you what to think.  But what I am going to do is present you guys with factual information, with good commentary about why you shouldn't take like this fuck.  at his word.  Here's a good example.  If you've noticed throughout this entire video, they have shirts on that say Lifestyle Christian University.  This university is in the same vein as other theological diploma mills.  You basically pay a lot of money and then you get a diploma.  They're not a real university.  They're a lot like a PragerU university, with the exception that they're not just some like social media accounts or anything like that.  They do have real facilities.  It's a little bit more than a PragerU university, but they're not accredited by anybody, and the only affiliations they have are with other Christian colleges.  And in fact, you cannot use their particular credits at their university anywhere else other than Grand Canyon University, I think it's called.  Grand Canyon College is, or Grand Canyon University, whatever, is an accredited college, but Lifestyle Christian University is not.  So, I'm sorry, you're a bullshit peddler coming from a bullshit university telling me a bullshit story, and that's what all of this boils down to.  It's just bullshit.  Anyways, I hope that you guys enjoyed this video today.  If you did, please go down below, leave me a comment.  I'd love to hear what you guys think about Mickey Rourke here, or, sorry, Mickey Rourke's brother.  I would also love for you guys to smash that like button and subscribe if you like this kind of content.  Don't forget to stand up and use your voice, and I will see you heathens later. ",
