            "text": "I remember hearing for the first time that gender roles were a social construct.  I was in high school.  I looked around and saw girls wearing makeup and guys hitting the weight room, and I understood that the look each was going for was a construct to a degree, that each was exaggerating his or her natural traits to do better with the opposite sex.  gender roles are somewhat mutable, fine.  This idea was being popularized by feminists who wanted to do all the things men do.  But nobody was using the idea to talk about transsexuals.  That's the word we use then, transsexual.  Years before I had heard about a man who had a sex change operation in Denmark, George William Jorgensen had undergone a series of surgeries and emerged as Christine Jorgensen.  The surgeries began in 1951.  I probably heard about her in the mid 60s.  She was an international celebrity for decades.  I saw her on TV several times.  Before we go any further, let me say that I feel for anybody who is unhappy.  If you are unhappy about your sex or your weight or your height or whatever, you have my sympathy.  I mean that sincerely.  But there are some real logical fallacies attached to the whole transgender craze and some very dangerous ideas too.  Let's get into it.  Ours is a two sex species.  No human being ever lived who was not the product of a male sperm fertilizing a female egg.  Of all the primate species, we are the only one with such immediately obvious sexual differences.  And it's pretty hard to find another species that thinks about sex and mating all year round.  Everything we do, all the things we build, the way we dress, the art we make, it's all influenced by the human desire to mate with the best candidate one can find.  It's not too strong a statement to say that most everything dynamic that humans have ever done was directly influenced by males competing with each other for the most desirable women.  It fell to women to separate the winners from the losers and to keep the competition focused on providing rather than killing.  It's hard to imagine how a civilization like ours could have been built without acknowledging the differences between the sexes and seeing to it that everybody knew what was expected of each.  The degree to which gender roles are constructed by tradition and style and whatever other factors go into that is debatable.  But the purpose is to give a structure to the most important human game, which is the human mating game.  Don't believe it's the major driving force?  Turn on the radio and listen to 100 songs.  You tell me what 90% of those songs are about.  Back to the timeline.  A couple of decades after learning that gender roles were largely a social construct, I was asked to believe that these vanity related activities are not gender accentuating behaviors, but gender creating behaviors.  and that gender doesn't really even exist.  We were being asked to believe that the differences we'd always assumed to exist between males and females were nothing but habits developed over time.  That other than the differences strictly limited to their genitals, the two sexes were interchangeable.  Men just as capable of nurturing children, women just as likely to excel at engineering.  We were told that all the other stuff was just window dressing used by the patriarchy to oppress women.  Second wave feminism was now up and running.  Now, everything having to do with sex and gender was up for grabs.  Monies were stripped from men's sports in high school and college and given over to female sports.  Women were welcomed into jobs where men had all. ",
