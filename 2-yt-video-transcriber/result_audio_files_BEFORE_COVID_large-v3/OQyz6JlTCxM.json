            "text": "Hello, everyone.  My name is Stephan Rao.  I am the treasurer for the Guardian of Camelot Association.  Today, we are announcing our Constitutional Enforcement and Investigation Division, known as Lawful America.  It's very important that we pay attention to these details right now, and we are going to give people real ways to contribute to ensure that their unalienable rights, as defined by the Constitution, are enforced and upheld.  We want to make it clear that in the Constitution, it actually says there is no emergency that can supersede the unalienable rights of the American people.  Therefore, any law or the appearance of law that is coded, it actually violates the Constitution and our constitutional rights that the entity which does that is in violation of their own agreement with the people.  Now, because that's happening, we recognize the vaccines have been mandated, although they can't actually lawfully mandate anything.  And we need to remind the governments in the state level and on the federal level that the government draws its power from the governed.  That being said, the highest court on the land is, in fact, the people.  They cannot overrule or override our decisions.  And with the vaccines, they're currently doing it based on absolutely no research.  So we are launching a very important case today, and this case will be Stefan Rao versus the United States of America Incorporated.  Please make no mistake, this is not an anti-government movement, but it is attacking the corporation for violations of our constitutional rights.  And we will give everyone the opportunity to log in, examine all of our evidence, our statements, and our argument, and we will put this on lawfulamerica.com, and that will open tonight at midnight.  At midnight, you will be able to register.  At noon tomorrow, we will actually allow people to vote.  So you will be able to say whether or not they are in violation of the Constitution, and if somehow they actually have the right to do that.  And I am certain and confident that what we have gathered together is absolute.  And this will be published, and this is where the various lawyers have failed us, because they are attorneys.  They are officers of the court.  But we are the people.  And if the people stand together and work with us, we can overcome this incredible obstacle.  Now, whether you are for vaccines or against them, it does not matter.  This is not a pro-vax or anti-vax argument.  It is a pro-human right.  It is a pro-constitution.  It is your right to speak, your right to worship, to practice religion, to make conscience decisions, which are unalienable.  They are part of the pursuit of happiness, which all of us are guaranteed by being American.  So we need your help.  We need volunteers in every single county, community, school district in the country, because every single government employee who continues to support this unconstitutional and therefore unlawful acts against the American people, they are in violation of our rights.  And we have the right to stand up and say no.  And we will submit this and have it published, and it will be entered into the Library of Congress as law.  And this is where we need to stand.  And if all of us stand together, there is no one that can stop this from happening.  So thank you and stay tuned. ",
