            "text": "And what drives people from God?  Which people?  Many people.  I mean, this is so general a question, there's no generic answer to it, and of course the questioner knows that.  Sadly, I meet many people driven away from God by negative experiences of professing Christian churches.  That's a very sad thing.  A friend of mine did a survey of leaders of atheist groups in American universities and discovered every single one of them had become an atheist because of their church experience.  We're losing people.  It's terrible.  And in England they did a survey.  Why have you left the church?  Number one answer by far.  because they don't answer our questions.  How much time in your church is spent answering questions?  Now be realistic about it.  I often walk into a church, well I used to, I'm too old now to do it, but I walk into a church on a Sunday morning and all I've got in my hand is a Bible and a notepad.  And I say, I bet you've all had an interesting week.  What are your questions?  And they look at me and their mouths fall open.  I said, I'm serious.  You want something relevant to life?  Well, tell me what your questions are.  So I jot down 10 questions and I say, right, let's go.  And that becomes the sermon.  People love having answers to their questions.  And if they don't get them, they vote with their feet.  And if we're not giving them and are simply giving little talks from the pulpit, we're never going to reach them, sadly.  But anyway, we can spend hours on that. ",
