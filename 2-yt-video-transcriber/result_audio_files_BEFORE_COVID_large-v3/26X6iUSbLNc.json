            "text": "Last week I had a spicy take.  I'll be honest, I have a spicy take like at least three times a day.  But this is one that I actually tweeted and it got a pretty mixed reaction.  Over on Reddit, I found a post on the subreddit Am I the Asshole, which is a subreddit where people tell stories in order to be told whether or not They were the asshole in this particular situation.  And I'll be honest, I was procrastinating and I was just going through the posts that had been tagged as like definite asshole, because I love when an asshole tells a story in which they don't think that they're the asshole, but they are obviously are.  It's pretty entertaining.  But for one of those posts, I was really confused.  Reddit weighed in that this guy was a definite asshole.  But in my view, he was definitely not an asshole.  So let's talk about it.  Discussions are fun.  Latagio wrote that as a young man, he had sex with a girl who ended up pregnant.  He wanted the girl to get an abortion, but she didn't.  So they agreed that he would have nothing to do with either of them except for to pay child support.  He basically considered himself a sperm donor.  Seventeen years later, the girl calls him and asks him to have a relationship with her son, who wanted to quote-unquote know his dad.  He again insists that he absolutely does not want a relationship with this child, over her objections.  A short time later, the kid himself calls Ladd and asks if they can meet.  Ladd once again explains to the kid that, sorry, he doesn't want a father and son relationship with the kid.  So the kid says okay and hangs up.  The mother calls back the next day, furious with Ladd because he destroyed his son's hope.  So is Ladd the asshole?  All of Reddit said yes.  My perspective is absolutely not.  For the most part, I don't think anyone should be forced to be a parent against their stated wishes.  I was shocked to see that nearly every comment called him an asshole.  The most upvoted comment read, And then the second most popular comment was simply, you're the asshole and a bad human being.  And then the top reply to that was somebody calling out a sociopath.  Now, I know that Reddit can be wrong, or at least I know they can disagree with me.  But one of the reasons I was so surprised about this particular post is because I read a very similar post to this a few years ago.  In this one, a man writes that he got a girl pregnant and she wanted an abortion, but he did not.  She agreed to have the baby, but she wanted absolutely nothing to do with it.  She gave up full custody.  She pays more than her share of child support every month.  But two years on, the poster wanted her to be in his child's life.  He took her to court in order to force visitation, but the court denied it.  He complains to Reddit that she just calls herself an egg donor.  He calls her a deadbeat mom.  The replies were the exact opposite to the replies to Ladd.  The posters absolutely destroyed this man, as I think they should.  The top comment points out that he made a selfish and cruel decision to bring the child to term and that of course she wants nothing to do with the child that she didn't even want in the first place.  I totally agree.  I don't think it should be any different if the person who demanded the child be born is a woman.  When I tweeted about Ladd, many comments disagreed with me, and I want to talk about why those people are wrong.  Because it's one thing for Redditors to be wrong, but for people who actively follow me to be wrong, that's disappointing.  So let's talk about it.  One common complaint was this one.  that if you have sex, you accept all consequences.  Here's the problem.  The consequences of sex are determined by humans, not biology or some greater god.  And for the most part, we have everything in our power today to make sure that there are pretty much no negative consequences to sex.  Let's say you have sex with someone and you get gonorrhea.  Gonorrhea is a rather common sexually transmitted disease that results in painful urination, but it can be cured very easily with a simple course of antibiotics.  But what if you go to your doctor and you say, doc, I had sex and I have gonorrhea.  And your doctor replies, I'm sorry, but if you have sex, you accept all consequences.  Good luck.  Now your painful urination may just escalate to the point where you end up completely infertile.  So there was a solution, but someone decided that having sex is bad and people who do it deserve to be punished.  So they ignore that solution and instead come up with some consequences for you.  I've seen that same type of thinking apply to women who accidentally get pregnant, even those who use birth control.  That ends up failing.  Want to get an abortion?  Sorry, but if you have sex, you accept all consequences.  Now you get to spend the next few decades raising a human being you never wanted as a punishment for sex.  I don't buy it, and I repeat, no one should be forced to be a parent against their will.  No one should be punished for sex.  No one should be punished by becoming a parent.  Another common complaint I saw was that Ladd's disinterest in parenthood was hurtful to the child, who didn't ask to be born to a single mother.  Guess who else didn't ask to be born to a single parent?  Everyone.  Literally everyone.  Every day, single women go to fertility clinics in the hopes of getting pregnant through artificial insemination to knowingly become single mothers.  I have friends who have done it because they wanted to be mothers and they didn't feel like waiting and worrying about finding a partner first or at all.  Should we prevent these women from doing that?  because kids do better in a two-parent household or because kids naturally will want to know who their other parent is?  Is it really always about the absolute best interest of the kid being born?  Or is it at least in part about the wants and needs of the parents involved?  What about parents who want to get divorced?  Should we prevent that from happening because children of divorced parents have worse outcomes in life?  are they assholes for getting divorced?  Uh, what about parents who fight all the time, but don't get divorced, even though everyone in their lives would probably be happier if they did, should they be court mandated to either get a divorce or to love each other more?  What about women who bear the children of their deceased partners?  Uh, should they be forced to get abortions because their child will be worse off than, uh, one with two parents, and those resulting children will have no chance of ever meeting their father?  Are those women assholes?  Or what about very poor people?  Should they not be allowed to have kids at all because those kids won't necessarily have food security, leading to a whole host of problems they're likely to encounter throughout their life?  Should we tell people they're assholes if they have kids without making say a combined $70,000 a year?  No, we wouldn't do that because it's absurd.  When we really think about it, we know that.  Not every kid gets to have two loving, well-off parents.  And in this case, it's the mother who did everything in her power to be a grade-A asshole to that kid.  It was her decision to have the kid, which is not immoral that she chose to do so, but she made that decision knowing that Ladd would absolutely never be a father.  A non-asshole in that position would raise a kid to know that he has no father.  Exactly how one might raise a kid who resulted from artificial insemination or whose father died when he was a baby.  Sure, once he's a teen, it's natural for him to be curious about his sperm donor.  I mean, hell, I wasn't adopted, but I spent many years as a teenager daydreaming about one day meeting my real parents.  Kids are stupid and imaginative and curious.  but a good non-asshole parent would say, your sperm donor wants nothing to do with us, and so I will not give you his information until you are an adult.  Once you're an adult, you can feel free to contact him, but I assure you that he will not appreciate it, and he will not want a relationship with you, and that may hurt your feelings, and I don't want to see that.  Your family is here, and we have been here your entire life, And we will continue to be here for you forever.  That's what a good parent does.  An asshole would try to make the sperm donor feel bad by calling him and getting upset when she learns that he hasn't changed his mind.  A top tier shithead would then give his number to her son.  Raising his hopes and hoping that the son will just guilt him into being the parent that he has repeatedly said he didn't want to be.  Knowing, knowing that that's going to get this little kid's hopes up so that he's ultimately going to be heartbroken.  When I was a kid, I wanted a big dog to go on adventures with.  But my parents said no, because my mom had this stupid little smelly cocker spaniel.  And my dad didn't even like dogs really at all.  My oldest brother ended up getting a puppy, a golden lab puppy with his girlfriend that They broke up and my brother dumped the puppy on my parents.  My dad was furious, but they kept him.  My dad absolutely did not want another dog.  And yet, I've never seen my dad bond so fully and completely with an animal before.  He loved Sammy like he loved me and my siblings.  Maybe more.  It's a heartwarming story, but it's rare and it's about a dog.  A lot of people and a lot of movies and TV shows would have you believe that the same thing happens all of the time with children.  So many of us think that it should happen all of the time, and if it doesn't happen, then there's something wrong with you.  This isn't Hollywood, though.  Some people don't want to be parents, and having a whole-ass human being foisted upon them because they had sex once when they were a teenager won't suddenly turn them into loving parents.  And that's okay.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Abortion should be affordable and accessible and stigma-free for anyone who wants one.  And the same way that people with uteruses should be able to opt out of parenthood before a child is actually created and born, everyone else should be able to as well.  No child ever lived their best life with a parent who didn't want them. ",
