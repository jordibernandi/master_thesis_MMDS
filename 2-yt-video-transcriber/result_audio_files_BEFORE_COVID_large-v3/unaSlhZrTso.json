            "text": "So, Onision, the giant douchebag, became famous on YouTube after making a parody video called The Banana Song.  It gained traction after being shown on a TV show.  The video currently has over 77 million views.  and is simply Onision jumping and screaming like a dressed up in a banana suit, but it was enough to skyrocket him to mid-level internet fame.  But these days, Onision is better known for his controversial content, controversial may be a bit of an understatement, where he likes to objectify women by rating them.  Now, Onision had a forum where his viewers could submit photographs of themselves, And he just didn't seem to care whether those photographs came from girls that were not of legal age, we shall say.  Hence him being called Onision, because he's a giant nonce.  Anyway, Onision and his wife Kai, who is now his husband Kai, just stick with me, I know it's confusing.  They had a thing for grooming underage girls.  Enter Sarah.  former friend and alleged partner of the pair.  Sarah shared her story in the greatest detail with Chris Hansen, who's been collecting statements from all parties involved with Onision and streaming them on YouTube.  She said that she initially began a friendship with Kai, known then as Laney, in 2014 after Sarah had just turned 14 years old.  This is where the allegations of grooming stem from.  What makes this even more worrying is whilst all this was going on, Sarah was actually... in their care.  they were her legal guardians because she came out of the foster care system and you can easily find so much information about this online tweets like this for example only seeing on kai intentionally skated the legal lines when they manipulated sarah and groomed her for their sexual intentions their predators.  But there is little legal protection for victims in these types of situations.  Kai even tweeted this.  And then they go around protesting their innocence.  Are you really this stupid?  Yeah, so they just constantly scream, we didn't groom anyone, we did nothing.  But the internet is a dangerous place because once something is uploaded to the internet, it's there forever.  Even if you delete it, you can bet your bottom dollar or pound that somebody will have downloaded it and that video will come back to haunt you. ",

A Patreon spokesperson confirmed that it is considered those actions to be doxing, which violates his platform's rules and justified Onision's ban.

And I wanted to apologize to you guys for being so irrational.  And maybe a little schizo.  I've been up for about... 20 hours now, and, uh, ever since my Patreon got deleted, I haven't been feeling very good.  So, if you could forgive me, I would appreciate that.  I would feel good about that, and, uh... ",

People have made videos about you.  People have made videos about me as well.  Suck it up.  And when you're going to apologize, how about apologizing to all the women that you've abused?  But no, you won't do that, will you?  There's a very high likelihood that Onision will claim this video because that seems to be his method now.  Anybody that's making a video about him, he's crying and complaining, but then claiming all the ad revenue from the video.  So he'll probably do that to me as well.  It's called fair use, you loser.  Get over it.  There's videos about me right now where people are saying terrible things about me.  There's so many.  Have you ever Googled my name?  Well, there we go.  Onision.  All around scumbag and thoroughly horrible person.  If it's your first time here, thank you very, very much for making it all the way to the end of the video.  Peace.  my patreons who i would like to thank extra specially.  it's because of the support of my patreons that i've been able to make this almost a full-time venture.  so thank you guys.  i really really appreciate that.  if have i already said if it's your first time here i'll say it again.  just in case if it is your first time here don't forget to hit the subscribe button until.
