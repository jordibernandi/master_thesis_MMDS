            "text": "This video is a special update and action alert for Shark's campaign against cockfighting.  Shark's first public release for this campaign involved a Kentucky father and son cockfighting team where the father is a captain at the Harlan County Jail and the son is a former corrections officer at that same jail.  Shark sent our evidence to the Kentucky State Police and have been regularly communicating with an officer of that agency.  On September 15th, he told us that he was going to meet with the county attorney.  We were cautiously hopeful, but then five days later we received a shocking email.  that is the cause of this special video.  There were two atrocious parts of this email that defied logic, the law, and common sense.  The first was this, quote, I spoke to the local prosecutor this morning, and he advised the Kentucky statute for animal cruelty does not apply to cockfighting.  It only applies to four-legged animals.  Wait, what?  The prosecutor says that cockfighting is suddenly not illegal in Kentucky?  And the state police bought that line?  This is absolutely wrong, and here are the reasons why.  Kentucky law states that a person is guilty of cruelty to animals in the second degree when they subject any animal to or causes cruel or injurious mistreatment by causing it to fight for pleasure or profit.  There is a part of the law that relates to the quote four-legged animals mentioned in the officer's email, but that is clearly only related to spectators at fights, not participants.  In no way does that mean cockfighting itself is illegal, and any third grader reading the statute can understand that.  Unless the county prosecutor is going to claim he's illiterate, he has no excuse for his inaction.  On top of that, we've obtained court cases that have affirmed that cockfighting is illegal in Kentucky.  This decision from the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is as recent as this past July.  It involves a man who was found guilty of cockfighting but appealed, saying that roosters were exempt from the statutory definition of being an animal under state law.  The court ruled it was proper for that man to be prosecuted for second-degree cruelty to animals, and they affirmed the original decision.  We have the law.  We have the court cases.  There is not a question or doubt that cockfighting is illegal, yet we actually have an email from the state police saying that a county prosecutor, all on his own, decided it isn't, and that the state police are going right along with it.  Can the Kentucky State Police actually be that ignorant of the laws they are charged with enforcing?  The second line from the police email that astounded us was this.  Quote, currently the subjects involved have removed their Facebook accounts so the evidence that would have been on the account is no longer available.  And he said, we do not have enough to prosecute the case.  To be clear on this, before we went public, Shark scoured both men's Facebook pages and took screenshots of all the evidence they had posted regarding their cockfighting activities.  This includes two videos from their pages that we downloaded.  We created a huge report filled with evidence and it was sent to and received by the state police.  While we have shown some of this evidence publicly, there is a lot that we have not.  Here is the son writing, in his own words, about their fights.  It doesn't matter that they took down their Facebook pages or even if Facebook had closed shop and shut their doors.  We have preserved the pictures and damning words written by the accused cockfighters that they themselves wrote and posted.  It is right there and it is undeniable.  The question remaining is this.  Why would a county prosecutor falsely tell the state police that cockfighting does not violate the law?  When we went public with the Harlan County law enforcement officers being cockfighters, we received a number of emails telling us about corruption in the Harlan County Jail, including that other staff members have attended cockfights.  From what we've read, the captain's cockfighting was well known within that community.  When you have that much corruption infiltrating a jail, then it is not a great leap to speculate that other law enforcement, such as a local prosecutor, were well aware of cockfighting happening amongst their own people, and that they would protect those offenders, even to the point of giving false information to the state police.  While not mentioned by name in the state police email, the Harlan County attorney is Fred Busrow.  Please politely contact Mr.  Busrow and tell him his office was absolutely wrong to say that cockfighting is not illegal and that the father and son must be prosecuted for what they did.  Please also contact Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear and ask him to make sure that Kentucky's anti-cockfighting law is enforced and prosecuted.  Finally, please contact Richard Sanders, Commissioner of the Kentucky State Police, and let him know what has happened.  Please be polite and respectful in all of your communications.  Shark will continue to stand against cockfighting and expose those who participate in it, as well as those who protect them. ",
