            "text": "So today I want to talk about an experience I had in the mall yesterday.  And I don't know, after thinking about it critically, or maybe overthinking it, I've kind of come to some of my own conclusions about it.  But I wanted to express myself even still in video format and see if I can get some other different opinions as well.  So let us begin.  So I went to the mall the other day to get a haircut.  In case you guys wondering what it looks like.  I don't like the way it looks.  And also, I can feel the wind blow on my scalp, and that shit is annoying AF.  So, I'm wearing this hat.  And also, I couldn't wear hats when I had the afro, so now I can wear hats.  Anyhow, it's not important.  So, this is after I got the haircut.  I'm chilling out at the mall.  The reason why is because my mom was at a nail salon, so I'm here.  I'm just existing.  And so, I went around.  I walked around a little bit.  Apparently there's a new puppy shop in the mall.  I went and I saw the puppies and I was reminded of my old friends who recently passed away last year.  And it kind of hurt my heart a little bit.  But at the same time, I was endeared to see that, you know, it was still nice to see some puppies and some dogs.  You know, I kind of wanted one.  Anyhow, um, and so, as I walked away from that place, I saw a woman with a regular large posterior.  Now, you guys think I'm joking here, okay?  Like, you might, you might be thinking of, like, a nice ass, you know, kind of like a bubble butt, but no, like, she had a fucking big ass.  Her butt was huge, okay?  I'm not joking about that, okay?  And, um, actually, interestingly enough, this will spin off into the next video I'm going to make because the story behind this is important.  Don't worry.  Well, I'll explain in the next video, but I ended up finding her her YouTube channel where she made a couple of videos Talking about her the struggles of her finding clothes or something along those lines And so you guys will see that I'm not making this up.  Okay, like in person that shit was fucking huge and I that's the only way I could describe like her went like just like the thing was just like.  Anyhow, okay, so I saw her.  She was like, she went to Baskin Robbins and then she like went back to work.  And I was like, you know what?  I don't have anything better to do.  You missed 100% of the shots you don't take.  May as well talk to her, you know, see where it goes.  Initially, you know, but then I came up and I saw she was talking to her coworker.  So I'm like, you know what?  Honestly, I'm not even going to try to spit game.  I'm just going to have a conversation.  I wasn't going to try to get her number.  My objective there was not to get her number at all.  But really was to inquire what her life was like having a big ass.  And I know that sounds strange.  But the reason why is because I spend a lot of time talking about women.  And I feel like it's equally as important to understand the experiences of women too.  And I knew it was going to be awkward at some point when I brought it up.  But I was going to bring it up, like, a little bit, and then, like, let it go.  Now, maybe this decided the tone for, like, the rest of this engagement.  Perhaps it did, but I did it anyway, okay?  And I'm an awkward son of a bitch, so I don't really think I did it with the most tact.  Actually, I think I did it with a lot of good tact.  Don't worry, I'll get there, okay?  She's with a co-worker, right?  So a co-worker sees me.  He's like, hey, what's up?  I say, hello there.  How are you doing?  He actually wasn't as exacerbated as I made him out to be.  He's a really chill guy.  And he was just like, hey, you just came in here to chill out with us?  And I was like, yes, exactly that.  I've got to wait.  For my mom, so I'm like, I'm just here and what's up?  And what happens next, my friends, is what was originally I was going to like make this video about, okay?  Was just the stark difference between his personality and the woman's personality.  Now, I'm talking to this guy, and he's very personal, okay?  He's very cool, very chill, talking to me, having a good time, laughing and joking.  I talk to him about, like, my job.  I tell him I'm a substitute teacher, how my experiences are, you know, all of that.  I talk to him about, like, how he feels.  Like, you know, do you enjoy what you're doing?  You're here in the mall selling, you know, all these different smoking accessories.  Like, do you like it?  He's like, yeah.  I asked him if he's, like, an enthusiast.  He's like, yeah, I enjoy it.  He said, like, one of his, like, life dreams, you know, or, like, one of his goals in life.  Was to own his own shop, selling smoking material and whatnot.  And he said that when marijuana became legal, he would have liked, you know, maybe become a dispensary or something like that.  So we're just having, we talked a little bit about anime too.  Now, all in this, like he's a genuine guy.  Talk to me, we're laughing, cracking jokes.  I'm talking to this girl.  Bruh, this shit was like talking to a fucking cardboard box.  Now, maybe she was tired, okay?  You know what I mean?  Maybe I was an ugly son of a bitch, okay?  Like, look at me with this haircut, okay?  I don't like this shit.  Maybe she didn't like this shit.  Maybe I just looked off to her.  Maybe she just didn't give a fuck about me.  And maybe that weren't the case.  I'm giving this to her, okay?  But I'm trying to talk to her, man.  Sprat.  And I couldn't, like, get anything, I couldn't get her to talk, like, express any interesting idea at all beyond, because, like, I'll give you examples.  We're talking about anime, like, I asked her, like, is there any anime you like watching?  And she tells me she likes Death Note, right?  And then she says she likes Attack on Titan.  And then that was pretty much it.  I was like, is there, like, anything else, you know?  And she's like, I mean, that's just pretty much it.  Okay, thanks.  I'm like, okay, two TV shows out of the whole of anime.  I think she said she used to watch Inuyasha too.  And I'm like, okay, good, good shit.  Good, good, good shows.  I watched Inuyasha when I was a kid as well.  So I'm like, okay, so what is your taste in anime?  What do you like about it?  And she's like, I don't know, I just like anything with a good story.  Okay, Brad, listen.  Now, guys, listen.  Now, you know, if you've been on my channel for a while, you know I'm an introspective guy.  I think critically about pretty much anything and everything I touch, okay?  But I don't expect that of everybody.  I wasn't expecting her to write me a video essay as to why Death Note was an amazing anime and everyone should watch it.  Nah, bruh, I was just expecting, like, you know, maybe she'd talk a little bit about the characters.  Maybe she'd talk about the stories.  I think at one point she said, you know, she liked the fact that it was unpredictable and, like, you couldn't really tell where it was gonna go.  It was, like, some surface-level stuff.  But, you know, but, like, if you were to ask me, like, why do you like Death Note?  I'll tell you.  Because I like the fact that Death Note is an anime that, instead of looking at a typical hero's journey and hero's tale of, like, power and friendship, is more about, honestly, a villain... His perspective and how a villain is outsmarting the people around him and even the people that the villain is facing aren't particularly the best guys.  Or more accurately, L isn't really a good guy so far as he's just the antagonist.  He's not really the hero of the tale, he's just the opposing force.  Mori Matsuda is more the idealistic hero of Death Note, right?  You know, and I wasn't expecting her to, like, think critically and tell me about the characters and shit.  But I expected a little more than just, you know, I, like, the story is good.  I just thought it was unpredictable.  You know what?  Okay, fine.  Fair enough, right?  But I asked her, like, about, like, her hopes and dreams, right?  I say it like that.  But I asked her, like, so, like, what do you want to do, like, later in life?  Like, what are your aspirations?  This is coming off of the fact that I'm talking to Keith.  She's like, I don't know.  I just, you know, I just, I don't know.  I don't have anything.  I just go with the flow.  But how the fuck you don't want to do anything with your life, man?  I'm not saying that everybody has to aspire to be Bill Gates.  I'm not saying I was expecting the most extravagant thing.  Hell, if she told me that maybe she wanted to become a school teacher, beautiful.  If she said that she wants to become a fucking janitor, that would be infinitely better than I don't know.  Like, how the fuck, how do you go through life, like, existing?  And that was the thing, like, and this is what initially I was going to make this video about.  Is the fact that, like, this woman is literally going through life existing.  Like, she's not thinking hard about anything.  She's not thinking complexly about her life's decisions.  She just exists.  Like, she just bees.  You know what I mean?  And I think that she was a perfect example.  Of what I've been saying on my channel for a long time.  That women get offers for dick for just existing.  My initial reaction was to offer her some dick.  But then I was like, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'm not giving her some dick.  Okay?  Originally, I was like, damn, her ass is fat.  But then my conscious mind kicked in.  I was like, okay, there's got to be something more than just her thick ass.  I got to respect her more as a human being than just that.  Literally my thought.  Maybe I was wrong.  I don't know.  But that's how I felt, right?  That's how I had to deal with it.  So to come to her, if I was that thirsty, if I was genuinely thirsty for her, right?  She got an offer for some dick for just going to get some fucking ice cream.  Just existing gave her that, right?  But, but I wasn't, so I mean, but maybe some other guy, I don't know, I'm certain some other guy probably tried, even though, like, I did, I asked her about, you know, like, like, what is it like, like, having, like, I didn't ask her like that, but I asked her, like, I said, yeah, you have a big butt, I'm like, does anyone, like, does it ever, like, come up, and she's like, I mean, not apart from, like, right now with this conversation, and I was like, oh, okay, like, fair enough, maybe she's bullshitting, I don't know, but, yeah, maybe it was, it was tacky for me to ask, Okay, fair enough.  But the fact that, like, even then, like, this was all kind of... This was all after.  Like, this was after... Like, this actually... Prior to everything I described, I asked her about her butt.  So, like, it didn't... So, even if that was fucked up, which, I mean, you know, you can say that it is, the prior engagement was not... Even centered around that.  Like that was just her genuinely just her just disinterest.  Maybe she was disinterested or maybe she really just is that void of fucking personality.  And so this is the thing that was going to get to me.  I was going to make the main focal of this video.  was the fact that I have a lot of these experiences with women where I'm talking to them, and they just have no substance.  Like, I'll ask a girl, like, what are your hobbies, man?  Like, what do you enjoy doing?  And she's like, oh, I like watching Netflix.  And then the pedantic part of me is like, do you watch the logo, bitch?  What the fuck do you mean you like watching Netflix?  You don't watch Netflix.  It's a streaming website.  Do you just look, do you stare at the fucking website as all the options slide by?  Fuck you mean you watch Netflix?  What do you watch on Netflix?  I know that was a huge exaggeration, but bruh, the amount of times I watch Netflix, bruh what shows like?  what are you interested in?  like what is like?  what do you think about like?  i have a genuine conversation with me.  i'm not saying that she has to like like delineate her whole life experience right i'm not saying that right but what i am saying is that like if we're talking about something you're interested in like you should have like some thoughts on it like.  i asked her like do you have any hobbies?  is anything like you like to do for fun?  at first she's like no it's like no i don't i just yeah.  I was like, bro, how the fuck you don't have hobbies, bro?  So then she finally was like, I mean, I like playing video games.  I said, okay, what kind of video games do you like playing?  And she's like, PS4.  She said she plays Division.  And this is what killed it for me, bro.  This is how I was like, okay, I see where this is going.  They said, why do you like Division?  Like, what's cool about it?  And she's like, I mean, I don't know.  People don't have to have a reason, like, for why they like things.  Like, why do you like what you like?  I'm like, nigga, don't even.  Okay, I'm done.  I'm like, look, listen, here's the thing, man.  Like, I'm not asking, again, I'm not asking for an essay on why Division is the greatest game ever produced ever.  Brad, you just say you like the level design.  You just say that the characters are interesting.  The story is great, right?  It's convenient, you know what I mean?  Like, I like the... I don't even... I've never played the fucking game.  So, honestly, me asking her why she liked it is her trying... It could possibly create another fan for Division.  But instead of taking the opportunity to, like, express something that she was interested in, she was just like, whatever, fine.  Maybe she was tired, man.  Maybe she thought I was trying to put my dick inside of her.  Who knows?  And so she was trying to create the most worst, awkward conversation ever to get me to leave her alone.  Perhaps.  But honestly, if we're talking about things you're interested in, first of all, here's the thing.  If that be the case... It would have been infinitely easier to just be like, you know, honestly, I'm not interested in this conversation.  And this is why I honestly love black women.  Because black women will tell you what that shit is.  Maybe not all of them.  Black women will tell you what that shit is.  A black woman doesn't want to talk to you, Brad.  You don't know she doesn't want to talk to you.  And if a black woman wants to talk to you, you're going to know she wants to talk to you.  We don't get any of that passive bullshit that white women... She wasn't even a white woman.  I think she was like... Middle Eastern?  Arabic?  With an ass like that, she's probably Lebanese.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Again, we're talking about things you're interested in.  Like, we're not talking about geopolitical, you know, like, theory.  We're talking about, like, you like playing division.  Like, don't you have thoughts on it?  Like, the control scheme.  Like, even if you said you like the control scheme, at least that's something, right?  And again, maybe she was tired.  Maybe she just wasn't interested in the conversation at all.  Maybe she just was like, man, can this nigga go away?  Can this ugly ass monkey nigga go away?  Perhaps, but... The whole conversation was like talking to a fucking brick wall.  And that has been my experience with a lot of women as of late.  And she wasn't even a young woman, dude.  She's 27, right?  So, like, she's older than me.  And I'm like... Man, like... And with so many women, there's just... are just lacking substance, man.  They don't have thoughts about the world.  And again, I'm not saying you gotta be writing essays and shit about how you feel so complexly about your existence in life.  But if we're talking about a TV show, why do you like watching what you like watching?  You should be able to have something more than, I just do.  But how the fuck are you supposed to have a conversation?  Are you supposed to learn anything about someone with... I don't know.  Fucking hell, dude.  But again, it's interesting, because I'm talking to the guy, and again, he's telling me his thoughts.  And maybe it's different when men talk to men, because we're not trying to fuck each other.  There's no pretense of one person trying to fuck another person, right?  But here's the thing, with that girl, I wasn't even trying to date her.  Like, my initial, like, attraction to her was literally undercut by my conscious mind.  Now, she can't read my mind.  She can't know that I'm not trying to put my dick inside of her.  But I knew that I wasn't trying to, like, do anything to her.  Like, I knew that I'm just trying to chat.  And if it's like this, Brad, like, maybe I got to do something different to, like, indicate to women that, like, look, I'm not interested in trying to date you.  I'm just trying to talk to you.  Um, and I feel like in this particular circumstance, when, like, she's at work, and, like, and I actually ended up, like, buying a lighter from them, so, like, I didn't just solicit there, like, I did buy a product from them, um, because lighters are cool, like, the lighter I got is pretty cool, um, so it wasn't just, like, you know, floating around, I didn't buy something, you know what I mean, like, I just feel like... And here's the thing, my experience with her isn't one-off.  She's just the most recent one that just happened the other day.  But my experience is very consistent with a lot of women and their huge lack of substance.  You know what I mean?  And it's entirely possible that the reason why, and this is just conjecture, I don't know.  But the reason why is that I'm just ugly.  She just wasn't attracted to me.  Maybe she had a boyfriend or something and she was just trying to get me off.  Even though I wasn't trying to date or anything like that.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Or the alternative is that she's just genuinely devoid of... She just doesn't think about life.  And if that be the case, hopefully it's more the form of the latter.  I'll take it.  If she wasn't interested in me... Fine.  You know what I mean?  I wasn't interested in her.  I was only interested in her big ass.  So, fine.  I can take that shit.  But, bruh, to not think.  To not have substance, bruh.  That's the shit that fucks with me a lot.  So, here's the thing.  At the end of the day, if she didn't want me, fine.  I didn't want her.  That's fine.  That's cool.  Again, though.  this is what I wanna, and this is what the crux of this video, of this particular video was about, was, like, if, if this is, like, if this is the woman we gotta deal with, bro, like, this is the one we gotta try to date in our lives, bro, like, bro, I, I think I might be done, dude, because, like, man, like, how you, I don't know, man, I think it's, I think it's over for me, dude, I don't think, I don't know, man, I'm just, I'm just, it's not all women, man, it's not, it's not, like, every single woman, it's just, like an airhead that doesn't think, you know what I mean?  But I think, I don't know, all of her brain probably went to her butt because that shit was, her conversational skills were fucking weak.  So with that being said, so here's the thing.  So in the next video, I want to talk about something else that was actually related to my journey and to finding the video example I showed you guys in this video.  Don't worry, we'll talk about that in the next video.  So with that being said, I just want to hope you guys enjoyed today's video.  And if you did, man.  As you go and click that subscribe.  Comment in the comment box below.  And as always, you guys have yourselves a great day.  See you cool cats soon.  Adios. ",
