            "text": "Hey Shalom family.  Welcome to another edition of Maccabees TV.  It's your brother Priest Daniel of the Alliance of Israel.  Maccabees Alliance Council and as you can see on your screen it's about that time again.  It's about that time again.  For those of you that are avid watchers of the channel you know that I posted a couple of months ago a different herbal tonic that I was drinking.  And that one was called Dr.  Missions.  Some of you went out and actually got the Dr.  Missions after I posted it.  So make sure you guys let me know how you liked it, how it worked for you.  This right here is a different one.  I like to switch up because the body is adaptable.  This is a different one.  This is called Coromante, right?  And Coromante is by a company named Sundial.  They're actually located right there in the Bronx on Boston Road.  The name of the company is called Sundial.  And basically, you can see right there, that's their phone number.  Free advertising right there for them.  They ain't going to give me nothing, but that's okay.  And that's their website, sundialherbs.com.  And you can see that Coromante is what they call a traditional herbal corkscrew bitter, which we'll get to in a second.  Let's see what's in here.  Real quick, let's see what's in here.  So some of the ingredients in this is purified water, which is the main ingredient.  You have white oak bark, mojo bush, senna, ginger, cloves, mint, cayenne pepper, cascara, sagrada, pepper elder, and pimento seed.  And again, this is what they call a corkscrew bitter.  So you might want to know what a bitter is for.  So let me just come over here to my laptop real quick.  And let's see what bitters are for.  Hopefully you guys can see this.  I should have held this the other way, the phone the other way, but that's okay.  This is a quick and prompt video.  Bitters have been used throughout history to stimulate the digestive system.  Thus began the tradition of steeping bitter-tasting roots, leaves, and berries in alcohol and serving the mixture before or after a meal.  Right, so... Basically, that's exactly what it is.  Bitter is used to stimulate the digestive system.  So these herbs that are in here are used to stimulate the digestive system.  And so because of all the things that we eat every day, even if you eat a healthy lifestyle, a lot of the foods that we have are still processed in some way, shape, or form.  A lot of them are GMO in some way, shape, or form or something.  So you always want to stimulate the digestive system as much as you can.  to keep yourself healthy, to keep your digestive tract healthy.  If you keep your digestive tract healthy, then you have a better chance of not being diagnosed with a lot of other illnesses that really start in the digestive tract, okay?  So this is just something I've been sipping on.  As you guys can see, I have my little cup right there.  I'm about to drink.  And it's called bitters.  for a reason, brothers and sisters, because it's bitter.  One time, one brother... I gave him a glass of that, and he described it as being dirt water.  And you know what?  He's not that far off, because everything comes from the ground.  As it is written, the Mosiah said he created man from the dust of the ground, and all the ingredients that we need to replenish our bodies come from the ground.  And the Mosiah said he created the plants and the herbs to come from the ground.  The Mosiah said in the book of Psalms he created herbs for the service of man.  I'm paraphrasing those verses.  But you brothers and sisters get the idea.  All right.  We promote a healthy lifestyle amongst the Israelite community to the best of our ability.  So every now and then I like to share with the family what it is that I'm doing, what it is that I'm drinking.  And you guys can look into this for yourself.  All right.  And this is in between me doing the flushes.  This is not in place of the flushes.  It's in between me doing the flushes.  And the cleanses, so forth and so on.  Because I have a busy schedule, I'm not able to take them because when you do these flushes and so forth and so on, you probably got to stay home because you got to be close to a bathroom because your body is going to be cleaning itself out.  It does it with this too, but not on the level of the flushes.  But this definitely helps in their place in the meantime.  If you're drinking this or the Dr.  Missions that I did in the last video, brothers and sisters, please try your best at the very least to stay away from fried foods while you're drinking this.  Okay?  Very important.  Stay away from fried foods.  Try to stay away from dairy and things of that nature.  Okay?  That's it for me.  Hope you guys got something out of it.  I'll be right back at you with another video.  It's your brother Priest.  I'll see you soon. ",
