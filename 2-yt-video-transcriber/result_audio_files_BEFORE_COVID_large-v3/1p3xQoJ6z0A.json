            "text": "You guys are part of a cult.  You people are absolutely crazy.  Anyone that could support Trump is absolutely crazy.  End of conversation.  And he's, I think, a Russian asset.  This is Milly Weaver and we are here at Otterbein University where Democrat debate night number four is about to take place.  As you can see behind me, we have some never Trumpers out here, some anti-Trump protesters, and we also do have a handful of pro-Trump people out here as well on the other side of the street.  Why are you out here outside of the Democrat debates protesting Trump?  Well, I'm not exactly here protesting.  I'm saying we need an alternate candidate.  And I think we'd be well advised to get a Democrat.  But the other thing is I've just completed a musical, 2020 The Musical.  Trump in 2020, the time has come to halt his bigotry.  What is Trump doing?  that's wreaking havoc on our country?  Well, let's just use a current example about pulling our troops out of Syria and now Russia's moving in.  So aren't you happy that he brought the troops home?  Well, I don't think it's that simple.  And, you know, I'm not... I'm guessing that you've read more about this than I have coming in to this place to ask questions.  What's my source of news?  Yeah, is it Fox?  Oh, I use tons of different sources of news.  I'll bet Fox is your main source.  I do use Fox sometimes.  What's your source?  No, do you watch CNN?  I watch lots of different news sources.  Okay, so you probably do watch CNN.  So did you hear about the Project Veritas video exposing CNN that CNN's president is essentially pushing all this impeach and this anti-Trump news because he has a personal vendetta against Trump?  President of CNN has a personal vendetta against Trump?  Project Veritas has released the video proof of CNN staff proudly admitting to leading an anti-Trump crusade.  We're moving towards impeachment.  Which may amount to professional misconduct.  He has admission saying that.  It was shown at a Trump event recently where he's shooting media people and anybody else he can get his hands on.  That was a meme.  No, it was shown at a Trump event.  It was a meme.  This is a disturbing example of the so-called meme wars.  These kinds of videos, in this case, pro-Trump videos all over YouTube.  This particular video was created more than a year ago, but became very notable last week when it was shown at this right-wing conference in Florida.  Right-wing conference in Florida.  We know Donald Trump Jr.  was there.  We know that Sarah Huckabee Sanders was there.  They say they didn't see the video.  They say they didn't see the video.  Did you all see the liberal Democrat left wingers outside of Trump's rally in Minnesota beating Trump supporters that were trying to go into the rally?  Did you see that footage?  I did not see that footage.  Smacking women in the head, beating them.  Have you seen the violence in the Trump rallies?  He's trying his best to agitate these Trump supporters, to get them to snap and react to him, but none of them have been snapping.  They've just been showing him love, giving him hugs, offering to come cut in line and come with them.  There's not violence inside the Trump rallies.  They're outside.  I've seen it on TV.  I've seen it on TV.  Let me guess, CNN?  I've seen it on... recently been exposed for being fake news.  This is the current state of politics in America right now.  As you can see, we have different groups of supporters standing on different sides of the street, just all shouting at each other.  You have the Tom Steyer camp.  You also have Amy Klobuchar's camp right alongside them.  You've got Beto O'Rourke's camp and you have Joe Biden's camp over here.  And then we even have a Donald Trump camp right here.  So it's just interesting to see all the different people standing on their corners chanting.  They're letting us know that they're standing here.  I think it's pretty apparent.  Thank you for pointing out the obvious.  No fear.  Democrats are standing here.  So you're standing here?  Yes.  You're standing here?  Yes.  Why are you standing here?  I support Tom Steyer.  No fear.  Why are you guys standing here?  No fear.  Democrats are standing here.  No hate.  No fear.  But are Democrats standing over there too?  And over there?  Democrats are standing here.  No hate.  No fear, Democrats are standing here.  Democrats are standing here.  No fear, Democrats are standing here.  Why is Beto better than Tom Steyer?  I'm okay.  What do you think about Joe Biden and the corruption with him and his son Hunter?  Do you think that that's going to weigh on him in the election?  I think that that is, whether you want to call it corrupt or just an old fashioned way of looking at politics, I think we're ready to move on.  I think we're ready to say that The vice president's son shouldn't be making money on a company that the vice president does business with.  Whether or not there was anything illegal, we all know.  it's kind of swampy.  Who do you think is the candidate right now that has the least likelihood of beating Trump?  The least likelihood of beating Trump?  Out of the ones debating tonight.  Elizabeth Warren.  Does anybody really get excited when somebody goes, hell yeah, I'm taking your two cents?  No.  It's boring.  There's nothing.  People get excited when they say, hell yeah.  I'm giving you tax breaks though, right?  Everybody likes more money in their pocket.  I hope that we have an idea of America that's bigger and broader and more exciting than here's $200 a month.  You mean like Andrew Yang's UBI, $1,000 a month?  Anyway, you know, the $200 here on Social Security or the $1,000.  I hope that America means more to you as an American than here's a check.  Well, I actually don't, have not decided to vote for Amy yet.  I'm here with my friend Christine, who's from Minnesota, or Christina, who's from Minnesota.  I have not yet decided.  Why are you wearing an Amy shirt then?  Well, like I said, I'm here with my friend Christina, who's from Minnesota.  I'm an MPA student at Ohio State, so I think it's important to participate in the political process.  She's a really pragmatic leader.  I used to work for her in Minnesota, and I think she's a great moderate choice for, you know, those who might not be all the way, you know, left or all the way right.  She's a great center choice.  So what do you think about the controversy with Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden?  Do you think that's going to hurt him during the election?  I'm just wondering why Infowars, of all of the... What did you just say?  What?  Someone's racist?  I don't think that's what she said, but I don't really understand.  You know, I had to look you up after we talked, and we had a wonderful conversation.  So I don't understand why you're interrupting my interview if I have done you no wrong, ma'am.  Well, I guess I'm wondering why you're not being transparent with people to say, I'm from... CBS.  I'm from NBC.  I'm from CNN.  I'm from Infowars.  I'm being very transparent right here.  It says I'm Millennial Millie on YouTube, MillennialMillie.com.  Anyone who knows me can find that.  And I would venture to guess that most people here don't know you, although it's a pleasure to meet you.  Okay.  Okay?  Thank you.  Okay.  And so am I not allowed to talk to people in the public?  No, you are absolutely allowed to talk to people, but I think it's nice to introduce yourself.  Thank you.  What about the allegations of corruption in the Ukraine with his son Hunter Biden?  Do you think that that's going to weigh on him during the election?  How many more allegations can you have than what with the current person we have in office?  There is no way.  It has been proven that he has not done anything.  It has been proven that he has not done anything wrong.  So to continue to make allegations, especially false allegations, in an attempt to dissuade Americans from voting for the person who would be the best president of this country.  Do you think Joe Biden's history with... advocating for segregation in the country is going to weigh on him?  I think Joe Biden's history of advocating for this country will weigh on him.  And I feel that that should contribute to him being selected as the next president of the United States.  Him being selected as the next president.  I'm standing for anything that eradicates the current president and all of the misgivings that he's doing and all he has done to.  Is that the most important thing, to eradicate the president?  Well, how about all that he stands for?  How about all that he's done?  How about all that he's doing?  He's made the lowest African-American unemployment in history.  That's one of the things he's doing.  That does not even resonate with me.  It's all the other things.  Our economy is doing great.  Our stock market is great.  It doesn't matter about the economy.  It doesn't matter about the economy.  No, it's about what he has done globally and what he is doing as far as his misgivings of his inarticulate behavior.  You don't think he's helping the economy?  Oh my gosh, no.  So the numbers, the facts, the statistics, they don't mean anything, right?  What he thinks he's done for the economy.  But look what he has done globally.  What numbers are you quoting?  The record low African American unemployment.  Numbers?  Numbers.  No, no, no.  I want numbers.  I don't even want to say anything.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Money, money, money.  Money, money, money.  He's the only president that's ever donated his presidential salary to the veterans.  So what?  That makes him great?  She said all he cares about is money.  Obviously not.  He would have made more money if he never became president.  He's making money hand over fist.  He's not making money hand over fist.  Hell, he's not.  Look at Trump.  I'm not talking about him personally.  I'm talking about he thinks the only thing this country cares about is the economy, and that's not the only thing to think about.  Those poor Kurds over in Syria, he just left them.  Okay, so you're for war then?  I am not pro-war.  I'm for keeping the... Just take me off.  You're going to share a network with Alec Jones and you're going to try and be legitimate?  I thought Democrats didn't like war.  I thought Democrats didn't like war.  Democrats used to be the party that did not f***ing war.  And now everyone's complaining that he doesn't like war.  Try and be a legitimate person out for any sort of good.  Ad hominems don't prove your argument, sir.  Look at this guy.  He just wants to tell everyone not to talk to me because he knows that these people don't have a way to defend their argument.  So crazy.  Where'd they go?  The Biden quarter is now empty.  They all ran away when I asked them about Biden and his corruption.  Take advantage of the amazing final days.
