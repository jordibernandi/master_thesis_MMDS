Pedro V here coming to you with a new video.  so remember when I said the third seal has been broken famine the horsemen famine and I made another video about there will be a deadly disease that will be released to the public very soon.  well now look here it says.  experts warn.  fatal zombie deer disease could spread to humans.  Hunters are urged to be on the lookout for symptoms of chronic wasting disease.  Though they can take years to appear after infection, health experts are warning that a fatal infectious disease that is spreading across the country among deer, elk, and moose may be transmittable to humans.  Chronic wasting disease, CWD, which is described as progressive fatal disease that affects the brain the spinal cord, and other tissues of animals has been documented in at least 24 states as of January.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, the disease, which can take years for symptoms to appear after infection, is believed to spread through bodily fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine by direct and indirect contact in the environment.  There are no treatments required or vaccines.  The symptoms which have been compared to those of zombies may include drastic weight loss, stumbling, lack of coordination, listlessness, drooling, excessive thirst or urination, drooping ears, lack of fear of people, and aggression.  Though there have been no confirmed animal to human transmissions, some health officials pointing to laboratory tests say it may be only a matter of time.  Well, there you have it folks.  Only a matter of time.  So I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.  Let you guys know what's going on with that.  To be cautious and to know your surroundings.  To be aware and prepared.  With that all being said guys, God bless you guys.  Stay safe.  And over and out. ",

It is not going to jump to humans.  Everybody watches this news, and they think of Contagion, you know, the movie Contagion.  It's going to happen that way.  It's not going to happen.
