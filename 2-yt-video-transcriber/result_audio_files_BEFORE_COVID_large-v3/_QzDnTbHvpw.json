Well, it's someone who believes that Jesus had a human body and a human soul, but had a divine mind or spirit that enabled him to overcome all sin, perform miracles, and always do the Father's will.

We have will.  We have affections, right?  I'm sorrowful to the point of shedding blood.  Stay here and keep watch.  Does God do that?  No, the person of Christ does that.  Sincerely and truly.  I'm hungry.  So you see the whole history of the church.  You have these statements by Jesus.  Maybe he didn't say I'm hungry.  I'm hungry.  Well, that was just the humanity talking.

But we can tend to read over it because we are more functional Apollinarians.  We tend to think when he was tempted, yeah, he kind of was because it said so.  But, you know, he had that divine nature and he just kind of drew strength or pulled that card and, you know, just made it right through.  To where?  when we see him humbling himself to take upon flesh, he doesn't fail to be God.  He's true God in every sense of the word.  Consubstantial with the Father.

Now the word of God in his man's nature was not like that of a human soul limited to the body.  For he was not bound to his body, but rather was himself wielding it.  So that he was not only in it, but was actually in everything.  While external to the universe, abode in the Father only.  So his point is two things.  We have to be careful here.  He's talking about the Word of God and, of course, in the incarnate Jesus of Nazareth.  And he mentions, rightly so, that Jesus of Nazareth cannot contain the eternal Son.  Does that make sense?  When you think of the eternal Son, he's infinite.  Right?  He's everywhere.  Infinity.  Omnipresence.  Okay?  So the fancy language we touched on that was the finite cannot contain the infinite.  He's about, who knows whose height he is, right?  So eternal sun's everywhere.  But did you see the language though?  But rather was himself wielding it.  You see, that's kind of a key statement, which of course, yeah, it's written 1,700 years ago.  What does Athanasius mean?  But that's the how?  question.  How Christ?  If the eternal son wields the person of Christ 24-7, 365 for 33 years, then how does he need to grow?  Why does he need to pray?  How does he... sympathize with us in our weakness if he's tempted in every way just as we are.  God can't be tempted by evil nor does he himself tempt anyone.  So we have to allow some room for the scriptures language.  So let's look at our confession, okay? ",

The confessional language... Okay, Christ is consubstantial with who?  Good, right, God.  And he's also, we'll see, consubstantial with someone.  We're talking about the person of Christ here.  So the Son of God takes upon man's nature, and this is a key language here.  What do they mean by this?  With all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin.  We know about the virgin conception.  And you notice the language it uses.  Of her substance.  So that's really important.  So Christ in the incarnation is consubstantial with who?  God and who else?  Did you see?  Us, Mary, humanus, humanity, okay?  So the real issue you had in the early church was this distinction language, homoousius or homoousius.  And it was a big debate, I believe at Nicaea, is Christ of, it's one vowel difference.  In O versus N, homoousius means what?  of like substance.  Of like substance.  Of course, this is referring to this.  Homo oiusius means what?  Homo?  You got it?  Same.  Same substance.  And so the Confession, of course, knows that debate.

You know, all sorts of, boom, take it on the chin, stumble, go this way, wander away.  No, no, no.  He's not fallen like us.  And He's anointed with the Spirit beyond measure.

And of course, he knows it all.  He knows it all.  And he's just faking it.  God's not a liar.  But this is why blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is so damning.  Let's look at this passage in Mark.

Heal my shoulder, heal my knee, heal my, you know.  And when he goes and prays, the chapter earlier, he says, all the crowds are like beckoning, you know, where have you been?  He says, hey, you know, I've come to preach the gospel.  That's why I've come.  And so you see through the communion with the Father, you can read about it in the previous chapter, He knows.  that's why He's come.  So all the crowds are coming to Him, of course, to be healed.  And He's wanting to preach the gospel, but He's also super compassionate and loving and kind and healing.  But let's look at verse 22 of chapter 3.  And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, He is possessed by Beelzebul.  And by the prince of demons, He casts out demons.  That's a bold statement, right?  That's a bold statement.  Because how does he cast out demons?  Who is he possessed by?  Exactly.  You see that?  That's like, by what power?  Oh, it's the power of the devil.  It's actually the power of the living God.  The eternally proceeding Holy Spirit, who at this point in redemptive history, because often our Christology is like the Father's architect of salvation, the Son's accomplisher, and the Spirit's the applier.  Not quite, because to accomplish salvation during the incarnate ministry as God, mediator, God-man, prophet, priest, and king, he must be anointed by the Holy Spirit.  And we're so Apollinarian in our Christology that we just think it's the divine son.  kicking booties and taking no names.  That's not what's happening.  It's dependent upon the Holy Spirit. ",

He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
