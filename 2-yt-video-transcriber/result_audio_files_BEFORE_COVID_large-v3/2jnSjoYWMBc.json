            "text": "Greetings, my friends.  I've been telling you all ever since Donald Trump has come out with his peace plan that I'm convinced that this is indeed the seven-year peace deal of the Bible, the one that happens right after the imminent rapture.  Now the word is out on the street that Netanyahu, Abbas, all the Arab world, everyone out there in the Middle East is greatly anticipating and ready to embrace this seven-year peace deal.  Abbas is kind of on the fence, but he's being chastised by so many.  He's being hammered by so many.  He's being threatened to be totally ostracized that he's starting to come on board as well.  And I'm telling you, my friends, this peace deal is going to be ratified.  It's going to be ratified by everyone, and the Antichrist will confirm it.  And that means that the true bride of Christ is out of here so quick.  All the signs are everywhere.  You see all my videos for the last week have all been hammering on the rapture.  All the signs of the rapture are here.  The birth pangs are increasing day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, second by second, like the Bible said they would.  The delivery is imminent.  Delivery of the bride of Christ out of here in the imminent rapture and her apostle catching away.  Things are happening so quickly and so fast, and this Donald Trump peace deal is coming out within the next, just a little over a month, right after the Israel election is coming up again in April.  And we could be out of here any second of any day.  God has been showing signs in the heavens.  More wars and rumors of wars, more great natural disasters, more great changes and bizarre weather, the anger, the hatred, the godlessness, the lawlessness, everything is everywhere just picking up like a steam train and just getting ready to roll over and just blow this place out.  We are so close to getting out of here, and I am so happy to be going to heaven, praise the Lord, but I'm so sad because so few are ready.  So few people are saved by Jesus Christ's precious blood, and less than 1% of Christians ever even bother to share their faith.  And sadly, There are so many Christians who are backslidden, who refuse to repent.  They're going to find out the hard way.  They should have repented because they're going to be left behind with the unsaved for seven pure years of hell on earth, where if God didn't intervene, no flesh remained alive as it is.  Billions upon billions upon billions upon billions will die grotesque, awful, terrible, horrific deaths, the worst imaginable ever.  You can believe what you want. ",
