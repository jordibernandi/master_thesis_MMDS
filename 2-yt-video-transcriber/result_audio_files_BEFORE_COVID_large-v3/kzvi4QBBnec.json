And one state has had a dividend in place for almost 40 years, Alaska, which gives $1,000 to $2,000 in oil money to every Alaskan every single year.  So what I'm saying to the American people is that what oil is to Alaska, technology is to the entire country.  Because we're in an era where technology is going to do more and more of the work.
