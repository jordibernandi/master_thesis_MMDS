            "text": "Runaman here, back in Thailand.  Loving life.  Just did a nice little sauna and gonna do some yoga.  It's just a beautiful day and sun is out.  It's kind of, it's rainy season so usually it's not so sunny as it is now but it's beautiful today so I'm gonna definitely get out.  Went out to Little India the other day, it was fucking awesome and I'm gonna do it again here pretty soon.  So okay, so what did I learn today?  I learned something today that was really cool.  actually when I was in the sauna.  I which I love the sauna right I totally love the sauna and suddenly I started feeling bad and I before when I felt bad what I would have done is I would have said to myself like Maybe I would have thought to myself like, it's one of these days or some BS like that.  But now I take it seriously and I say, wait a second, no, something just happened there that changed the way I'm feeling.  So what is it?  What is it that just happened?  So I listened to my voice and what was it?  I was horrified actually to hear what was actually going on in my mind.  What I had just done.  Even once I realized what it was, I still had a tough time putting it in a box and realizing what it was.  Okay, I had said a very insulting thing to myself, basically.  And it was a very pointed... You know, it was something that you know yourself the best.  So if you want to put yourself down... you can really put yourself down more than anybody else in the world because you know yourself, right?  So you're like, you know your weakness and you know the times that you, I don't know, like maybe you didn't do your best or you got lucky or something like that, right?  So you know your own self, right?  what I had done is I had put myself down like super super bad right.  and then I thought okay what did I just do?  so I could have thought to myself okay I just put myself down.  but then I thought to myself wait a second wait a second.  that's not actually what just happened.  something deeper happened and I realized that what I had done what I had done is I had essentially Essentially, I have the access to the database in my own mind.  I have the access.  I'm the only one that really knows all my history, all my weaknesses, all my successes, the things that I got lucky on, the things that I... You know, everything.  I know I have the secret database.  I'm the only one who has the password to everything in my mind.  Now, what I had done is I had taken that database... and it was almost like you know if you wanted to put somebody down and you had access to their like their secret.  what do you call it like the inside of their mind if you had the access to somebody's um everything they've done wrong everything they've done right.  if you had that right you could really really really think of an insult.  that would be terrible right Because you know that guy's exact weakness, right?  And now I know my own, right?  And I had put myself down in the worst way that I possibly could.  And it wasn't even fair to myself.  Okay, so I realized that all of a sudden.  Then I thought to myself, okay, when did this happen before?  When did I do this before?  When did I hear this before?  Where did this come from?  Because what is this?  Putting yourself down in the worst way you can possibly think of.  The most pointed, evil remark that you could possibly do.  Where did I come up with this?  Then I realized that when I was a kid, there was somebody who used to do this.  Now, at this point in my life, I don't care who did what.  All I want to do is fix myself.  That's it.  I just want to get better.  So I'm not here to like, it's, it's at this, and I really mean that at this point in my life, it really is about that.  So it's about fixing as quick as possible.  So I'm like, okay, so now I know the voice.  Now I know where it came from.  Now, how can I stop doing this?  Right.  How can I like, well, what, you know?  And so then I thought to myself, okay, what I need to do.  is i need to?  i couldn't.  this was so normal for me.  this was almost like dna like and i realized it was like common in the people that i was around.  uh when i was uh growing up this was a thing is to basically put somebody down in the worst way, in the meanest fucking possible way that you could possibly do, knowing that person very well.  And that's not a very nice habit to have.  But things like this, they get started in families, in groups.  They become part of the DNA of your own mind.  And you do them to yourself, and you do them to other people.  And so as soon as I realized this, I thought, oh my gosh, I am really saving up my best insults for myself.  For my fucking self.  And that is crazy.  I don't want to do that.  So as soon as I realized that, it was easy for me to not do that.  Because I was like, here's the way I did it.  When you discover something like this.  You need to trick your mind into ways that you cannot do this any fucking more.  Right?  How can you not do this thing anymore?  So I thought to myself, okay, if I think don't do this to yourself anymore, it's not going to work.  I thought, I know what I need to do.  I need to not do this to anybody.  And I thought to myself, who deserves who deserves To have somebody put them down in the worst fucking way they possibly could.  Knowing all their weaknesses and fears.  Who deserves that?  And I thought, nobody fucking deserves that.  Right?  So I thought to myself, okay.  It's not just me.  I don't want to just do this for myself.  I want to stop doing this to anybody.  And that was the secret thing.  Because once I had that mindset... That I did, like, essentially that nobody deserved this.  Then it was easy not to do to myself.  Because I was like, wait a second.  Like, if I just thought to myself, okay, I'm not going to do this to myself.  Then I would leave it lingering around in my mind.  As if this is somehow acceptable behavior to anybody or anything.  Now, of course, I don't do it to other people.  That's the trick here.  I only do it to myself.  that I know.  I'm gonna go back in my history and see this is the type of dangerous thing that seeps out into many aspects of life.  so I want to.  I want to see if I did in fact do this to anybody else also in my life it would have been a very natural thing to do because I did it to myself all the time.  so basically I now know that there is a tradition in my mind okay of Essentially creating a zinger, like a fucking zinger, using secret information and then burning myself to the ground.  Which is totally, once I say it out loud, it's so fucking ridiculous, right?  Like it's fucking ridiculous.  It's stupid, you know?  And so once I realize that, then I don't have to do it.  Like I almost feel like released right now.  And when you have these type of realizations, okay, things from childhood, it's not like other realizations.  This is the very first time in my life I realized this.  And so when that happens, what you tend to do is make changes in your life because it's part of the DNA structure.  It's kind of like if you take, let's say there's a building and you take the main beam out.  the whole building is going to fall down because it's not a good, without that being there, the structure is not there to hold it up, right?  So when you have realizations like this, some things in life, when you realize them, you have to keep reinforcing them, reinforcing them.  And other things, once you realize you're doing something really stupid that hurts yourself, you can just go, boom, I'm done with that.  Fuck that.  I'm not going to do that anymore.  It's very easy to do because you don't even, before you didn't even realize you were doing it, right?  So when you don't realize it, then it's invisible.  You can't see it.  But once you can see it, you start laughing.  You're like, oh my gosh, this is the dumbest thing.  Why would I ever do this?  And then you're like, well, I would do this because I was around other people who did it.  So if I don't realize this and fix it, not only do I fix myself with this, but I also... I'm a nicer person to other people because I don't have to do this stupid thing.  And we've all got these things.  We've all got these things, but they're very specific for every individual.  So this is why you have to start to listen to that quiet voice in your head.  What are you telling yourself?  What are you telling yourself?  That's my question.  And it's not easy to figure out.  So it's going to take time.  You have to like realize that you're talking to yourself.  You have to realize that what you're telling yourself is not a belief system.  It's kind of a habit.  You know, just like you might watch a TV show before going to sleep.  It's not because it's good for you.  It's not because you want to.  It's just a habit.  It's a bad habit.  Eating a chocolate bar, whatever.  Something that you don't want to do anymore.  So when you realize that it's a habit in your mind, you can change it.  it's not.  it's not.  it's not reality.  that's the key thing.  it's.  we all have these things that we tell ourselves that we do that it's the voice in your head that is doing this.  it has nothing to do with reality.  it's nothing to do with reality.  the voice in your head is a repeat.  it's almost like in a cave or something where you're listening to an echo.  you know you say hello hello hello.  you know there's an echo.  You're listening to this fucking echo.  And if that echo is no good, if that echo is not helping you, you need to stop doing it.  And you can.  But the only way you can do it is by listening to your own mind.  That's the only way.  Because there's no YouTube video that's going to tell you exactly what you're doing.  You have to listen to your own voice.  So that's what I encourage you to do.  Is to listen to that voice in your head.  And that voice in your head is essentially almost like thoughts.  So when you're kind of like meditating and you suddenly... Here's the way to do it.  Here's the best way.  Is whenever you have a suddenly change of feeling.  Where you suddenly feel bad.  That's something you should listen to.  What did you just tell yourself?  Now sometimes it won't be that easy to figure out.  And you won't know what it is.  But other times you'll be like... Oh my gosh.  Now, if I would have just heard the thing I said to myself and thought about that, I wouldn't have understood what really was happening.  Because it wasn't about the specific insult that I was saying to myself.  It was about what I just said.  It was like using the data that I have in my own memories against myself.  creating a fake narrative.  it's like totally insulting and is not even true just basically.  essentially what it is is like a kid who says the very meanest thing you could possibly say when he's really really angry.  right?  that's what I was doing to myself.  so once I understand that boom boom boom these are the type of realizations that can change your life.  all right guys thanks for watching.  and uh if you haven't already start sharing these videos man because youtube is shadow banning the out of you.  so the more you share them and email or whatever it is if you want to if you're afraid if you're too shy to like it publicly send it to your friends a facebook messenger whatever.  let people know.  if these things are helping you right let other guys in on it right.  And I'm already looking forward to meeting another crew here at the next summit.  I don't know when that's going to be.  But I'm kind of thinking Thailand for the next one.  But I'm not sure.  So anyway, I'm open to hearing what you guys have to say.  All right, guys.  Take it easy. ",
