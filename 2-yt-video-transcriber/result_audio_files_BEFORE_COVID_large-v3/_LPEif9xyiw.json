            "text": "Hey weirdos.  So you probably would never have expected this, and I surely never would have expected it, but I am now being censored and suppressed on YouTube.  And I don't think it's because I'm special or that my video is good, because I don't have many views.  I just have 2,000 views on this latest video I posted here, what Hong Kong protests are really like, what the media doesn't show you, part one.  I only have almost 2,000 views in two days, so that's pretty good.  But yeah, I don't think it's because of me or that I'm special or that my video is good.  I think it's just a general blocking, I think.  I think they're just blocking all videos that they don't really approve.  And I'll show you real quick.  So right now, as you can see up here on the top left, you see my mouse?  It's AU, right?  You see it?  YouTube AU.  That means we're in Australia.  And as you know, Australia, or maybe you don't know, Australia, Canada, the US, New Zealand, and Britain, five, those are called the Five Eyes.  So they're an intelligence community, intelligence alliance, you could say.  It used to be a secret, but it's been released, I think, ever since Edward Snowden.  any of these countries will not show my video at least not in the first hundred hits results when you search Hong Kong.  so I'm gonna search Hong Kong and watch.  so here you got Trump Hong Kong blah blah blah lots and lots and lots of stuff.  but you won't find my video even if my video has more views than other videos.  but clearly right now it doesn't Yeah.  So as you can see in my video, I don't know if you remember what my video looks like, but it has a picture of a guy with a mask and there's like tear gas everywhere.  And it's called what the Hong Kong protests really look like.  So I can keep scrolling probably for five minutes and it won't come up.  It's been washed.  Yeah.  Censored.  So if you didn't know that Google and YouTube censor videos.  Or they just make their algorithms such that any video that is not part of the videos that they approve or the videos that they think are acceptable for their narrative, for what they want to share to you beautiful people living in the Five Eyes countries, all you Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians, Americans, Brits.  So whatever your intelligence agency deems acceptable for your eyes and for your brain, you know, you can see that.  But a video like mine where, you know, I dangerously go to Hong Kong and walk around and talk to normal people.  Oh, that's.  no, that's.  That's not appropriate for your virgin eyes and ears.  I mean, it's much more appropriate for you to see these schoolgirls lining up here holding hands.  Because that's beautiful.  Having young kids being influenced into being part of the protest.  Kind of weird when you think about it.  Little kids.  I saw teachers motivating students to participate and the parents were not happy.  Let me tell you, the Hong Kong parents were not... happy that their teachers and the principals were Telling their kids what to think.  so as you can see my video has not popped up.  It's the one with the gas gas mask and tear gas and it says What Hong Kong really?  to restart my I Restarted my VPN.  Okay, so that's why there might be a minute might have passed here on the clock.  So I restarted My VPN.  And anyways, so it has been switched over to Azerbaijan.  I don't know.  Sorry, I don't want to say it.  Let's see what happens.  We typed in Hong Kong.  Same thing.  The exact same words.  Oh, look at that.  My video is on the first page.  And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  It's the sixth result.  That is amazing.  That is amazing.  That's actually really good.  It's really, really good.  It's competing with the big guys, man.  Polymatter.  He's a blogger.  He loves talking about China.  The Guardian.  Random.  Bloomberg.  I don't know.  But wow.  I don't know how it's so high up there.  But that's pretty much it for every other country.  that's outside the Five Eyes.  Let's go to Australia.  Let's make Australia part of the Five Eyes.  They're not part of that alliance.  Boom!  My video right there.  First page.  Look at that.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  So what I'm trying to say, guys, you're stuck in the matrix.  If you live in Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, America, you're in the matrix.  And I'm teaching you a way to eat the red pill, blue pill.  I don't know which pill is it.  Is it the red pill?  To get out of the matrix, just switch your country.  It's so easy.  So if I go to Canada, Five Eyes.  It's a Five Eyes country.  No video for me.  None of my videos, sorry.  That's what I meant to say.  My video is gone.  it's wiped it's cleaned.  you're now in the matrix.  you're not allowed to get videos like mine which are dangerous because i'm walking around hong kong talking to normal people and that's not good for your brain but you are.  let's look at this though.  people getting their faces kicked in that's that's okay for you that's healthy.  um but don't Oh, pro-democracy, yeah, see?  They always call it pro-democracy protests.  Yeah, no, they're not.  No, they're protesting for a lot of reasons.  It's not, not all of them are pro-democracy.  A lot of them are fighting for police, against police brutality and blah, blah, blah.  Lots of issues, not just democracy.  It's wrong.  Alright, let's go to Columbia, and it should be, my video should be, boom, it's really, whoa, oh my gosh, it's top four, that's incredible, that's actually unbelievable, it's because I'm getting 2,000 views in two days, that's a lot, and I think Google respects that, I don't know, I don't even know how I'm getting up, it's pretty good.  yeah anyways.  so when you're outside the five eyes you're just getting the good stuff.  man you're getting the good stuff.  let's go to france france.  are you part of the five eyes?  are you in the alliance?  are you in there?  no you're not.  you can see my video too france.  France is cool for my video.  So New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes.  You should not be able to see my video if you live in New Zealand or if you're smart enough to exit the Matrix.  Just change your location.  So sneaky sneaky.  New Zealand NZ up here.  You can see that.  And you will not see my video because it's so dangerous.  But you can definitely see this man get his ass kicked like his face is bloody.  My video is just a normal, like, I'm a normal guy.  I'm a teacher in China, and I'm just walking around Hong Kong.  And spoiler alert, I don't find anything.  There's literally nothing going on.  But I do talk to some people, and they have opinions that you never hear in these videos or on the mainstream news, which is pumping bullshit into your brain every single day.  They're pumping it out a lot.  I'm trying to be funny, guys.  I mean, it's like 12 a.m.  right now.  I'm exhausted from YouTubing so much.  I'm just obsessed with YouTube right now because 2,000 views in two days is so cool.  That's exciting.  So, yeah, New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes.  And, of course, the U.S.  is the boss of the Five Eyes.  They're the ones who call the shots.  So you will not be able to see my video either.  Isn't that weird?  I'm just like a normal dude.  There's nothing special about me, nothing special about my video, but you can't see it.  Maybe, I know it sounds weird, but maybe a CIA agent saw my video and was like, nah, nah, you ain't gonna, you ain't talking to our people.  You aren't allowed to be viewed in our countries.  You dirty new moves, you dirty little vlogger.  My dirty, my dirty content.  Too dirty for the five eyes.  Yeah, so 1 million percent proving that I'm being censored And that YouTube does censor.  So America stop your bullshit because you always you always point your finger at China like oh China you censor.  Yeah, so do you.  and there's literally no other site like YouTube's.  the only thing people use for alternative media like that's F'ed up.  China at least has multiple video things.  they have yoku They have a lot, actually.  They have Yoku, they have Bilibili, and they also have iQIY.  Those are three huge companies.  And then there's like Tencent Video, there's all these other, like, there isn't a monopoly in China, which is shocking.  Like, not shocking, but isn't that a contradiction that China doesn't have a video monopoly, but America does?  And America's supposed to be like the free... The land of the free.  It's so not.  So not.  And I'm proving it right now.  America.  And your Google Corporation.  You're super not free.  Let's go to another one.  Which one do you guys like?  I'm just going to read your mind.  And I bet you're saying India, right?  So let's go to India and see if they're part of the Five Eyes and blocking my video too.  Oh my goodness, they are.  India's part of it.  Yep.  Okay, can't see my video in India.  That's weird.  Totally thought India would not.  Look at that India.  No video for, none of my video for you.  And how about, let's go back.  Maybe, maybe my video just got blocked right now because I'm making this video.  Oh no, it's right there.  It's okay.  So Azerbaijan, you can see it.  Let's do one more.  So India is, okay, I guess India is part of the alliance because India is an ally.  I think Japan's an ally of the  U.S.,  right?  They're big allies.  So they might block it.  nope oh japan is not part of it.  that's weird.  japan and us are like pretty pretty buddy.  buddy if you know what i mean oh that i'm not.  no i don't know what that means.  actually i don't even know what i'm saying.  i'm just saying they're good friends.  um south korea is also really good friends with america.  they have a lot of army bases.  but boom my video is right there in south.  okay.  so it's weird that india has my video blocked.  that's so weird Bosnia.  Bosnia's gotta have my video.  come on Bosnia you got my back.  you got my.  yes you do.  Bosnia.  yes you do.  I love you too okay so super weird isn't it?  Finland Finland's got me.  come on Finland.  You're always neutral, right?  Finland's always neutral.  There you go, Finland.  There you go.  There you go.  You got me.  Finland's got me.  One, two, three, four, five.  Number five.  God damn.  Oh, damn.  Damn, that feels good.  Damn, that feels good.  Oh, okay.  I'm getting a little bit disgusting.  Ecuador's got my back.  All right.  All right, guys.  So there you have it.  Facebook censoring my video in the Five Eyes countries and India for some weird reason.  Yeah, India's in there.  Peace out, guys.  Much love.
