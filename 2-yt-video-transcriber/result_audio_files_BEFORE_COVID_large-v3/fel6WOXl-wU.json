Now since I made that video this guy or that guy has deleted a whole load of his videos and failed to respond to any of the points I made in my flat earth defense kit which says to me that that is slowly sinking in and in a few weeks hopefully he'll start to see sense.  Anyway this week I'm going to help somebody else.  This time a really nice and polite flat earther.  So let's get started. ",

            "text": "So this is a YouTuber called Harry Burden.  He's been doing some observations to test the idea that on a flat Earth the horizon should rise and on a globe Earth the horizon should drop as you gain in elevation.  And in order to do that he's taken two observations of the same tower.  One of those observations being 20 foot higher than the other.  Now, at first glance, his images certainly do back the idea that as you gain in elevation, the horizon will rise with you.  If you look at the water line behind, we can see that on the lower picture it is way below the top of the tower, but as he gains in altitude, there we go, it's right above the top of the tower.  Something that is impossible on a globe, but only possible on a flat Earth, leading him to make this conclusion, which is, of course, that the Earth cannot be a sphere.  So let's see if we can help Harry out, because on the surface of it, those pictures do seem to back up his assertion, and I can see how, if you already believe in the Flat Earth or there's a chance of it, that pictures like that might convince you.  So let's take a closer look at the picture taken at the lower elevation.  And we can certainly see at the lower elevation that the horizon is well below the top of the tower.  Compared to this picture, where we're 20 feet higher, where we can see that the horizon has clearly risen.  Now, obviously, I wasn't there when these observations were taken.  I can only stalk one person at a time, what can I say?  However, the first thing that jumped out to me was the fact that the top of the tower, that box, that cube at the top of the tower, seemed to be in the centre of both images.  Let's take another look.  Now that suggests to me that either on the lower picture the camera was ever so slightly tilted upwards, or on the higher picture the camera was ever so slightly tilted down, or both.  So I took a closer look at the pictures, and I identified these things here that I've labelled with the black arrow, these horizontal frames on the tower.  I'm going to call them stepperunas.  Now if I look at the picture that was taken at the lower altitude, I can count seven stepperunas.  But if I have a look at the picture that was taken at the higher altitude, I can count eight stepperunas.  Now, of course, the only way you can see more of the bottom of the tower when you climb in elevation is if you tilt the camera downwards.  So however honest Harry was trying to be with these pictures, and I do believe he was trying to be honest, there is no way at all that he could have had that camera level on both of those shots.  And that is your reason, Harry, that your horizon has risen in the background.  Now this is a second video I took off Harry's channel and here he's trying to show us that boats don't disappear from the bottom up because they're going over the curve of the earth but just simply because they're getting further away and the angle between the floor and the bottom of the boat is getting so small that it gives the illusion of things disappearing from the bottom up.  Now just like with the first video we've just seen of his he has some early success but can you spot why?  So I can see the bottom of the boat, and I'm going to remember that the surface of that table represents the surface of the water, which I'm getting closer and closer to now.  I can still see the bottom of the boat.  I'm getting very close to the surface of the water.  I'm getting even closer.  I'm getting a little bit worried.  In fact, oh, help me.  I'm drowning.  I'm drowning.  Help me.  I can't swim.  I'm under the water.  So there are literally dozens of this type of clip on the internet where people are moving a camera up and down to try and show that objects will disappear from the bottom up due to this weird sort of perspective thing.  But they've all got one thing in common, and that is always the camera has to go below the table that the object is sat on.  In fact, the only time a flat earther left the camera on the same surface as the object he was looking at was when ranty flat earth himself went down to 100 meter racetrack and he proved that things don't disappear from the bottom up just because they get further away.  Do you remember this? ",

But he's been honest enough to put it on his channel and open up the comment section asking for civil discussion.  But unsurprisingly, civil discussion is something that a lot of flat earthers really aren't capable of, and now this video has comments disabled.  So the video begins with Harry filming a boat which is approaching him.  Now you can't see all of the boat, some of it is blocked by the curve of the earth, although Harry uses the excuse of perspective, even though perspective for some reason isn't affecting the angular size of the width of the boat.

            "text": "Okay Harry, let me see if I can help you.  The whole reason flat earthers seem to think that things disappear from the bottom up due to perspective is because of a misrepresentation of something called the Rayleigh criterion, Now the Rayleigh criterion tells us a minimum viewing angle at which we can look at two points and still resolve them.  Essentially whenever light passes through an aperture it will diffract and cause a diffraction pattern.  Now there is a minimum separation distance that the diffraction patterns from two objects can get before we cannot resolve them and before they look like one object as shown by the diagram here.  And this equation here will tell us the minimum viewing angle that we need in order to be able to resolve two objects that are close together.  What you'll notice is that lander sign on top of the equation.  This stands for the wavelength of light.  Now, why is this important?  Well, normally when we do calculations with the Rayleigh criterion, we use an average wavelength of light.  But actually, the wavelength of light does make a difference to that viewing angle.  And if you were to take a red filter or a blue filter and put it in front of your camera when you're making observations like this what you should notice is a different amount of the bottom of the boat will become visible depending on the colour filter you use if that boat is disappearing due to perspective.  Now this is really easy to do.  you simply go to a shop and buy a piece of red plastic or buy a piece of blue plastic.  it's ultra ultra cheap way and when you analyse those photographs properly with a red filter and a blue filter you'll see that no difference is made to the amount of boat that is lost.  therefore ruling out the Rayleigh criteria and ruling out perspective.  And once you've done that, feel free to get in touch and we'll have a chat.  Good luck. ",
