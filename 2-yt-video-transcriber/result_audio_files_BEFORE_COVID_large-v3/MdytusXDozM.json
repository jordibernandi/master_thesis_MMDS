            "text": "Hello there.  The Prime Minister of Luxembourg may have thought it was a good idea to rubbish the UK Prime Minister, but some of his EU27 colleagues don't appear that happy about it.  You will all know by now that the PM of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel, decided to try and ambush the UK Prime Minister with a noisy open-air pro-Remain press conference when Boris Johnson visited the country.  But the UK Prime Minister decided that discretion would be the better part of valour and refused to attend the conference.  This left Bettel alone at the podiums and he resorted to mocking Boris.  Now, Remainers may find that amusing, but many people in the UK did not, so it could well help the Leave side more than they realise.  Not only that, but some in the EU27 were not that pleased about it either.  For example, Norbert R\u00f6ckgen, the chairman of the German Foreign Affairs Committee, said Xavier Bettel's speech yesterday did not serve the European cause.  His public venting ignored that a deal is still in everyone's interest.  Even without a deal, there will be a post-Brexit life, which means that right now, everyone needs to behave in a way that avoids animosity.  And it also caught some criticism from other Brussels sources, reports the Express.  And on the UK side, many people thought it was poor behaviour, with the Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, calling it an unfortunate media stunt.  Or is it really just that no-deal Brexit pressure is beginning to take its toll on some in the EU27?  Moving on.  It looks like Boris has managed to get the Irish border backstop removed from Theresa May's hated withdrawal agreement surrender treaty, reports The Guardian.  According to the paper, Boris Johnson's Brexit negotiators have so far only presented the EU with a draft of the withdrawal agreement with the backstop scrubbed out, UK government sources have confirmed.  There, he said he'd do it, and all it took was a bit of scribbling and erasing.  Now this will not go down well with Eurocrats, but it seems that the government wants to keep any proposals on the backstop it has under tight wraps, right up until the last minute at the EU Council meeting on the 17th and 18th of October.  Well, these are negotiations, aren't they?  And telegraphing our moves has only worked against the UK in the past, hasn't it?  Now, the Electoral Commission has assessed that two Remain campaign organisations, Wake Up and Vote and DBB UK Ltd, had incorrectly reported campaign spending for the EU referendum.  The Commission found that the two organisations had run a joint campaign called the Five Seconds Campaign, but had not declared it properly as joint spending, which would have meant them both reporting a higher amount of spending than they actually declared.  As a result, Wake Up and Vote was fined \u00a31,800, but DBB UK Ltd could not be fined, as it had already been fined for an earlier similar misdemeanour.  Louise Edwards, the Commission's Director of Regulation, said, Both Wake Up and Vote and DBB UK Limited had an important legal duty to accurately declare joint spending in their referendum spending returns.  Both failed to do so, meaning that voters looking at the reported spending had no way of knowing that Wake Up and Vote and DBB UK Limited had worked together on a campaign, or of how much either campaigner spent in total.  Question for the Remainers.  Does that now mean that all Remain votes in the referendum are null and void?  As that appears to be the argument from your side, doesn't it?  And now I've got two good questions about the city for you.  Firstly, can you tell me which country has the second highest daily turnover on the global foreign exchange markets?  And secondly, can you tell me which country has the second highest turnover in the global derivatives markets?  Well, cue the drum roll.  In both cases it is the United States of America.  Yes, because according to the Bank for International Settlements, the lead country in both foreign exchange and derivative turnover is the United Kingdom.  When looking at the daily turnover of derivatives, we see that the UK leads the way with just about $3.7 trillion worth of turnover every day, and that equates to about 50% of the market.  And although the US is in second place, it is not even close.  In fact, the UK was trailing the US back in 2016.  Think on that one!  And on the foreign exchange markets, the picture is even more stark.  The UK is well out in the lead and has about 43% of the market at $3.5 trillion worth every day, which is an increase of 6% on 2016, while the US has shrunk back.  This means that the UK has increased its grip on these financial markets, despite all the uncertainty.  the Remainers insist on heaping on the UK economy.  So don't tell me that the UK can't make it post-Brexit.  Anyway, what do you think?  Please share and comment, and thank you for watching.  please do like and share this video.
