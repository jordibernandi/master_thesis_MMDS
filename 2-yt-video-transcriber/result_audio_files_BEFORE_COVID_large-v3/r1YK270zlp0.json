My opinion is no.  I'm just going to say that.  We have some Emerson polling here, and Andrew Yang is at a 6% right now from November.  And some of the polling requirements for January debate go back to November.  Now, admittedly, there is a small narrow window where they're not accepting polls or releasing polls within this Christmas week.  And then he had like five days after that, like the January 10th, to get it done.  You know what I mean?  But we've had a very narrow window before, and the Yang Gang always meets its goals.  So we'll come back to this here in just a second, because this is pretty important.  But first, the DNC tightens eligibility requirements on January debate.  Remember when I told you guys a few videos back to be watching for whenever they say these are requirements for this particular debate or these requirements for this particular threshold or whatever, and then be.
