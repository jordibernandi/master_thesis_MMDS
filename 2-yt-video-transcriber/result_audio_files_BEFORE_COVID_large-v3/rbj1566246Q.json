            "text": "Hello all, here we are with another video and in this video I will be talking about the conspiracy behind Steve Harvey getting fired.  You will be shocked.  It has come to my attention from a truth seeker that Beyonce may be behind what's going on with Steve Harvey.  Okay, you all remember the leaked clip of Steve Harvey's stepdaughter, Lori Harvey, allegedly flirting with Jay-Z.  Let's take a look at that clip.  Let's take a look at that clip.  Thank you.  Now upon looking at that, let's also look at all of the events that had transpired thereafter, such as Marjorie and Lori Harvey taking an epic trip around the world.  Steve Harvey show being canceled.  Steve Harvey show little big shots being canceled, which will honestly suffer without him.  I mean, I made this like the way he treats women and his political views, but he is funny, just saying.  And then him starting to liquidate all of his assets.  But you know what?  Let's go back, back to when we kept hearing Lori being on the prowl.  She was once linked to Trey Songz, and they were supposed to be engaged, but they called off the engagement.  Then we hear about Trey Songz' new baby, so at least we know what was one of the reasons why they broke it off.  Then we hear that she was linked to Justin Combs, Future, and Meek Mill, and is now being linked to race car driver Lewis Hamilton.  I'm not sure of the outcome of that.  He is the British race car driver who was rumored to have dated Nicki Minaj and Lori Harvey and him were also seen kissing in the club.  Lori Harvey was told to have been driven into Lewis Hamilton's arms after Trey Songz was seen flirting with other women in his section.  Oh yes.  And I guess Lewis Hamilton just so happened to be available at the time.  I mean, I don't know.  Now let's go back to the present.  So then you hear that story of her flirting with Jay-Z before the late arrival of Beyonce, who seems to be late all the time at his events, who I was told became aware of what Lori was doing and she wanted to say something.  But Jay-Z and the others prevented her from doing so.  Then we go back to the events transpired with Steve Harvey.  But why go after him?  He had nothing to do with that.  But that's not all.  It was told that Jay-Z invited Lori to another event.  Take a look at this channel, whom I love.  I love his channel.  We should do something together.  I'm not even sure what, but I love your channel. ",

            "text": "Go look at this.  Now, Jay-Z, man, is in hot water once again, man.  It seems like Big Ho just cannot stay away from Lori Harvey, dog.

            "text": "So, as you saw in that video, it looks like Lori may have been newly elected as mistress number whatever.  know there seems to be a trend with him and his types.  he seemed to like women with long natural black hair aside for blue cattrall but she started off wearing black hair so did beyonce.  now with all of this being said that brings us back to steve harvey of allegedly being blackballed by beyonce.  now this is allegedly and not confirmed but it has been told that because of lori flirting with with obsessed beyonce husband jay-z She made some calls.  She, being Beyonce, made some calls to blackball Steve Harvey.  I guess cut her off from the roots, right?  And we all know she is who she is because of Steve Harvey's name and money.  I mean, that's not his biological daughter.  That's his stepdaughter.  I mean, I don't know, y'all.  This is really, really, really deep.  We all know about Kathy White, and if Beyonce is doing this, it makes you wonder about Kathy White.  I did a video talking about this.  Let's take a peek at that, too.  I will also leave the link below, or you can just click it at the end of this video.  whereas there was a 911 call that came from an apartment on 130 West 19th Street in Manhattan, where someone called and said she was sick.  No evidence of who called.  Anyway, they took her to Beth Israel Hospital, and she was later pronounced dead.  But let's go back a little.  Now, two weeks prior to her death, Kathy was contacted by a major tabloid that was investigating the Jay-Z connection.  She gave them a little information to go on, But according to sources, following her conversation with the tabloids, she called Jay and told them that she was going to go public with their affair for a price.  Then 48 hours after Beyonce's pregnancy announcement, she ends up dead.  Oh, but I want to go just a little bit deeper.  Okay, it was September 3rd, 2013.  Okay, I'm starting to wonder about these dates.  They seem to coincide with Beyonce's birthday.  Hell, Joan Rivers died on September 4th, right after her comment about Beyonce.  Just weird.  What are these, sacrifices?  Anyway, getting back to their bodyguard.  The police were called to a mansion where his naked Norman was seen lurking around the Jung's mansion.  It seems that Mr.  Jung and he got into an altercation and upon the police arriving, they tased him during this alleged home invasion.  They also claimed that he was seen swallowing something in his mouth.  He was then sent to the hospital and later died.  Be honest and Jay-Z never cared about his death because they claimed that they had to fire him for hiring a prostitute while on duty in Las Vegas.  Yes, in Las Vegas.  I know.  The reports also claim that after losing his job, he was in and out of rehab.  Now, these are only reports.  They haven't been proven yet.  And when you have as much money as they do, you can pay people to report anything.  It sounds like to me that this man was drugged and set up and his record padded by a crooked cop and a journalist on B&J's payroll.  Just saying.  I also believe that he had morals and got tired of seeing the terrible way Jay-Z was treating Beyonce and may have said something about it.  So Jay-Z shut him up real quick, just like they did Kathy White.  Just saying.  so let's talk.  are we looking at all of this wrong?  i mean i'm being hypothetical here.  could beyonce really be the killer and making dust to side chicks and claiming that she will up a?  i mean let's be real here beyonce.  entire solo career has been built around jay-z and the trials of their relationship.  I mean, she's like Taylor Swift when it comes to the songs she writes, picks, co-writes, whatever.  Because she went from being dangerously in love to crazy in love to drunk in love.  I know a woman supposed to stand by her man, but could her love go beyond love to being obsessed?  which isn't love.  Are we taking our songs lightly when she's been blatant all of this time of what she has done?  Regardless if she completely wrote them or not, after all, the best place to hide something is in plain sight.  I'm not accusing.  I just want you all to think who's really the killer versus just a player and a businessman and has 99 problems and a bitch ain't one.  Because if you look at there on the run clip, she was taking all of the shots and doing most of the dirty work.  The blow was on her, but she was being overlooked.  Was that also read wrong?  I don't know.  A woman fury can be dangerous, especially a woman who's obsessed.  She did sing to Jay-Z that she would die for him.  I mean, who's really scary, Jay-Z or Beyonce?  Again, I'm just hypothesizing.  Tell me what you all think below.  Okay, just yesterday, Beyonce and Jay-Z attended the Golden State Warriors game.  against the Toronto Raptors at the Oracle Arena in Oakland yesterday evening.  Now, the power couple were seated by the court side with a clear view of the gang.  Jay-Z and Beyonce were sat next to the wife of the Warriors owner, Jacob S. Lacob, and his formerly known as, you know, Nicole Curram.  She was seated right next to Beyonce, but the superstar didn't seem too fond of her.  Now, in the clip posted on Twitter, Nicole can be seen talking to Jay-Z.  I mean, she leans over Beyonce in order for Jay-Z to hear her properly.  Now, Jay-Z sheepishly responded without giving a lot of eye glance because, you know, Beyonce's sitting there and you know how jealous and crazy her ass is.  So he just talks out of the side of his mouth.  Now, of course, Beyonce annoyance is very evident and noticeable in the video.  And she looks irritated by the short conversation Nicole and Jay are having.  So that's when the possessive and crazy and I'm not even going to be happy when you see other people.  My gosh, you guys are seriously brainwashed.  Anyway, Beehive came to the rescue and, you know, they went after her social media accounts.  Anyway, however, getting back to the clip, it seemed that Nicole still, you know, was very persistent in talking to Jay-Z despite the conversation, you know, and despite Beyonce little glances and whatnot.  But she was quickly interrupted when the audience erupted into cheers.  Meanwhile, B, Hive, you know, her fans, her possessed fans, they went after her some more, giving her a little warning that, And, yeah, they even went as far as naming her the Becky with the good hair.  Oh, boy, this is ridiculous.  You know, I have to say, I mean, this is ridiculous.  I mean, I'm going to be real with you guys.  I said I was going to be neutral, and I am going to be neutral, but I have to say this.  This is getting way out of control.  Jay-Z.  was in Beyonce's spot before when she was heavily talking to Jack Galenihaw, and I may have mispronounced his last name, in 2014, and Jay-Z sat back and patiently waited.  So, for Beyonce to be acting bothered by this woman talking to her man, I mean, she get to the point where no one can talk to him, no female can talk to him, everyone have to be afraid, and she got the beehive losing their damn mind every time a female talk to him.  It's not even worth the stress.  I mean, my God, this is ridiculous.  She's obsessed.  And again, people, anyone who's obsessed, they're not in love.  Obsession is not love, okay?  It's not.  Ask anybody.  And I'm going to ask the question again.  Again, who's scared of who?  Just saying.  Who's really a killer?  I mean, you'll see Jay-Z losing his damn mind.  He don't make a gazillion songs and albums about her.  I mean, he might say a little something-something in some songs, but that's as far as it goes.  I'm just saying.  I'm just giving you guys the truth.  Y'all can go in on me like y'all always freaking do.  I don't really fucking care anymore.  YouTube don't pay me shit any fucking way, so whatever.
