Is there a feeling that you have right now that you should be able to expand your game offensively at all?  or is it still a waste of possession in your mind?  It still is because it's still my role to do what I'm doing, if that makes sense.  Mid-range and three-pointers aren't in that.  So I would say that it still is a thing.  I could develop it.  Great.  But then, you know, that's just for individual, you know, gain or whatever it is.  Again, for the team, you still have to just focus on what you think, well, what your role is.

These fouls that they're calling now if it's just this.  Each of those little things I think play more of a factor.  then I guess just someone shooting a three.

I mean, yeah.  I don't know, yeah, I guess I do, but it's, yeah, I like to just have a successful play.  That's just the bottom line of it.  And, you know, sometimes it is me scoring.  But then, you know, a lot of times it's like kicking it out to whoever, guards cutting or whatever it is.  So, I mean, that's all I'm trying to push myself to do is more just what is the right play as opposed to what do I need, like, I need to score this ball.  You know what I mean?  I don't think it's a confidence thing.  It's just more just, I think, my obsession with trying to get a successful play for that position.  English?  Just gave me no nod of approval anyway.  Steven, I think Billy and Sam have talked about y'all doing something quite fast this season.  It did look like y'all were getting shots up earlier in the shot clock.  Does that pertain to you two as well?  If you get a ball in the post, going up quicker with a move, is that something that plays into that as well?  No.  Not at all.  Now, sorry, we'll say if you're talking about the rim runs, if I catch you, like, if it's, you know... If you're in just, like, a half-court set... Yeah.  Half-court set, no.  I think that what they were mentioning more is just, like, us getting out on the break and then, like, kind of try and take advantage of any sort of mismatches that we may have or just if they're even not in load help or scramble situations.  I think they're talking about that more so.  You might be right, though, bro, but, like, yeah.  To your question, it doesn't affect me if I'm trying to, like, oh, he said to score it within this many seconds.  Let me throw this up real quick.  Like, no, it's more just, yeah, I think it's more just attacking any mismatches, kind of get them in scramble, no load or whatever.  I think it's more so that.  Did you feel like there was a hesitance on your part this season when it came down low because of the free throw situation?  Because you didn't shoot free throws particularly well this year.  Did you feel like there was a hesitance on offense in terms of going up, absorbing contact and getting to the free throw line?  No, I don't think so.  I mean, you know, going up, I mean, there's still, even though I missed them, there's still the huge benefit of getting fouled, which is being, you know, the team fouls and whatnot, even if you shoot it bad.  I mean, if I look at analytics too, it's still points per position.  It still probably works out relatively well.  And you see a lot of teams not actually fouling, doing that whole foul thing anymore.  I'm not sure.  I'm just going by what I'm seeing when I'm playing.  It's just like, you know, they don't seem to be targeting a player and just fouling them.  I'm not sure if it's to do with that or not.  But yeah, me with me, mate, I'm just like trying to go up regardless of the free throws.  Because again, it's still a huge benefit.  be even more of a benefit if I made it, if I make them, you know, that's like the best thing, but still, there's still some good benefit as opposed to me just like not being aggressive.  Now, if I'm not aggressive and whatnot, then yeah, that's a bad thing, but I don't think I wasn't doing what you were saying, like I was trying to go up and get contact and whatnot, yeah. ",

That's pretty much always been my approach.  I wouldn't say always, it's a bit of a rager before, yeah, a bit of a rager, but then I just learn to just change it.  because again, I mean, they're trying to call the game how they see it and I'm just trying to figure out, because every ref is different and they're in different positions, so I'm just trying to not make the same mistake.  So yeah, try and get advice from them too, best I can.  Assuming that he has sent you something, have you responded to any potential in-scanner trash-talking texts?  Oh, trash talk?  Nah, not trash talk.  It was all... Yeah, I think for the most part it was all love.  Unless there's, like, some, like, weird, hidden English, like, code that I don't know about.  He's just, like, a hidden joke.  But, yeah, it seemed pretty decent, yeah.  What do you think about them introducing it as in Turkish?  That's nice, yeah.

I'm not sure if another team did that for him.  So, I mean, it's really cool, and it's cool to hear, but I just couldn't change it.  Just like when we do it with Spanish, there's a, what does it say, Al Thunder on our t-shirts or something?  Yeah, so when they introduce us in Spanish, it's cool.  It's cool.  I feel pretty cool.

What do you think about scenarios like that where Jeremy goes to the five and you've got to watch you guys basically lose the series while you're on the bench?  I mean, it's fine.  I mean, again, like, we could... I thought it put us in a position to win the series, you know.  I'm not saying, like, it's this weird thing, like, you know, just because I'm in the game doesn't mean... you know, still going to have the same outcome.  Yeah, I mean, like, it's still, but, like, again, like, Burley thought that that was the best decision for the time.  I thought it was actually working really well, to be honest.  And so that's just how it was.  There was no real disappointment, apart from, obviously, losing the game.  But I think, like, this weird thing, like, I should have been playing.  It's not that at all.  Again, your time on the court, it's not a given.  and it shouldn't be expected.  You know what I mean?  The coach needs to feel like that, you know, put whatever piece he feels that's going to win us the game.  So, I mean, I don't go in there expecting to play.  You know, whatever time he does give me, so you've got to go in there and just give it your all in that time.  So I think more so since we lost the game, it's more how I could have done, what I could have done better with the time that I was already on there as opposed to, oh, I would have did this better.  Yeah.  There you go.  See that, mate?  That's the approval.  Fucking old mate, eh?  Thank you. ",
