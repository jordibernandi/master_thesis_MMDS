            "text": "What's up everybody, today I want to talk about something interesting that happened to me on the day of the impeachment vote.  So, it was the afternoon, I'm sitting at my desk and all of a sudden my phone starts beeping with an emergency alert.  Now I usually keep my phone on silent and I never get alerts for anything, so basically if sound is coming out of my phone, something's going on.  So I pick it up and it says, Snow Squall Alert.  I've never gotten a snow squall alert at one time in my entire life.  And it was so loud, like I thought it was going to tell me a freaking tornado or something was coming.  But snow?  We get snow here all winter long.  I mean, unless it's going to be five feet, there's not going to be a snow alert.  Snow six inches every other week here.  So to get an alert for a dusting, or in some places I think it was like an inch, is highly irregular.  First time ever.  Only time ever.  So I just want to clarify how odd this was before I go on.  But then it hit me.  What did Q mention just the day before impeachment on the 17th?  The presidential alert system with a two in brackets.  Now, I received this alert, which blasted through the room as if a meteor was incoming, not once, but twice.  On the day that you can argue the president needed our support more than ever.  The day the swamp set off to impeach a duly elected president for nothing.  now I believe this was a presidential alert to all patriots a snow squall or if you're going by color a white squall alert.  now I'll get to the significance of that in a minute but first I want to go back to the day before.  On this day, September 17th, or Qmas, as some were calling it, where Q mentioned the presidential alert system, he made a total of 17 posts, ending with the declaration that the first indictment will trigger a mass awakening of the population.  And that's what I've been saying the whole time that I felt our job was, to wake up as many people as possible over this time so that when big things do start happening, enough people are in the loop that can explain to the ones who are basically in shock what's going on.  What's going on?  But either way, big arrests or no big arrests, once enough people are awake, it really won't matter.  I mean, once the people are united, we can do whatever we want.  There's 329 million of us and like a couple thousand of them.  We have the power.  Vote in or vote out anyone in Congress every two and six years.  Now, back in 2011, at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, cognitive scientists had run a study on the social networks.  And what they found was that 10% of the population is what was needed to cause a critical mass for spreading information.  Basically saying that once an idea is accepted by about 10% of the people, that's typically when it'll explode to a mass audience.  Mass acceptance.  Critical mass being a term for the minimum amount needed to cause a fission chain reaction. ",

I get comments all the time from people all around the globe.  But just looking at right here in the United States, you've got 32 million people who think QAnon is a good thing, all right?  So it's about to pop off one way or the other.  And on top of that, you have the entire nation that just watched the president get impeached for something he never even did.  Tied to something the Swamp's lead candidate actually did do and laughed about it at a Council on Foreign Relations meeting.  I mean, this is the ultimate red pill at the perfect time, right as we're reaching Christmas.  critical mess in the great awakening and if there was ever a more cut and dry way to show your friends how corrupt washington is.  the council on foreign relations is the world government sub-control group.  it has provided every presidential candidate in recent history.  it really is our president not these figureheads.  2016 was supposed to be hillary versus jeb but during the primaries trump eviscerated jeb.  bush even called his family out on 9-11 the whole nine.  I believe that is when the panic truly began.  And by the time they knew what hit them, Donald Trump was president and they were scrambling to renew their FISA warrants and keep surveilling him for anything they could use against him.  We now know from the IG report that they purposely deceived the FISA court to obtain these warrants.  We know now, like Salisa Page, that Obama was monitoring all of it.  And we know that the dossier was paid for by the Clinton campaign.  so there's no denying when trump beat jeb bush a red alert went out all right culminating what we saw on december 18th his impeachment an impeachment that started pac in 2016 before he was even sworn in office.  one of the biggest criticisms of the process has been the speed at which the house democrats are moving if this is but seriously though seriously it's been going on for 22 months okay two and a half years actually there.  So Q continues in this post that the first arrest will verify action and confirm direction.  They will fight, but you are ready.  And we are ready.  And I believe this alert was the signal.  The signal to use this impeachment is a way to red pill the entire damn country.  All right?  You want to impeach our 63 million votes?  Game on, buddy.  Joe's clip right off the bat gives you a lead in the talk about the CFR, which is probably one of the best rabbit holes of all time to start someone's red pilling with.  Secondly, being that this debacle is all about Ukraine, is the perfect lead-in to talk about how George Soros' own leaked emails show that he funded violent protests there in 2014 as a way to overthrow their government and announce their president.  You know, the exact thing he tried to do here to Trump.  And so on.  This opens the floodgates to the great awakening.  The storm.  The white squall.  Which I'll now explain the significance of by going through one of my favorite Q-Proofs of all time.  Now, for starters, we all know by now that the president's alleged typos are almost always by design.  Smocking gun led us to this picture of what appears to be John Podesta and Valerie Jarrett at a smocking party.  Little Adam Schiff pointed to little kids from Schiff's area, and his double meanings is this.  It also led to Alice Little, the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland.  Covfefe turned out to be the Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act, and so on.  So back in December of last year when the president misspelled the phrase Scott Free with two Ts instead of one, of course the news did what they always did and they had a jolly old laugh about it.  But what Anon found was that Scott Free with two Ts was actually the name of Ridley Scott's production company.  the company which made White Squall. ",

What did they do, curiously, at the same time it was being released?  they held an impeachment vote so flimsy.  it's amazingly only one person defected and then straight exposed themselves as phonies by all voting for it.  they used their biggest weapon with zero ammunition and on the wrong report.  So now you have the Durham report, and at the very least, 32 million American Anons just waiting to get their hands on it.  Durham, who was appointed the very same day Q made their first post.  What a coincidence.  I think it's safe to say we know what team he's on.  And what was President Q Plus doing while the Swamp was trying to impeach him?  He was in Michigan giving one of his greatest speeches ever.  He even took a moment to talk about stealth bombers. ",

That helps.  Stealth.  It's actually called super stealth.  So I said, you mean they can't see, so you shoot at them, but they can't?  He said, they have no idea where we are, sir.  I said, that sounds good to me.  Nobody does it.  Nobody can do it.  We have the whole thing, and we've ordered a lot of those planes.  We've ordered a lot of great stuff.  And I won't tell you the story, but very early on, I thought we were going to have a problem someplace.  And one of the generals came up to me and said, sir, don't go.  Don't do it.  Why?  We don't have the ammunition.  And I said two things.  I never want to hear a president say, We never want to have a president here.  that again. ",

It's taking time and it's still going to take time because like Bobar was stating, it must be done right.  It must be done according to the rule of law.  It must carry weight.  It must be proven in the court of law and there can be no mistakes.  Good things sometimes take time.  And this, the destruction of the Illuminati could never have happened overnight.  It itself took hundreds of years to get where it is now with systematic planning and patience.  Their machinations are formulaic.  So they play the long game.  Dismantling what they've done is going to take time and it has to be done right.  Being impatient will only serve as a detriment to our cause.  What's being done right now requires the slow mass awakening of the public, which is what we're right in the middle of.  It required also the public to see the full extent of their corruption in the form of this atrocity that just occurred.  It required things like the IG report of 2018 to show them how the media is linked to the FBI and that the Clinton Foundation is tied to crime against children.  It took this IG report to show that the FBI has been compromised and completely weaponized.  The swamp runs deep and it's up to us to help buy these guys as much time as possible.  That's why 2020 is so crucial.  This has to be seen through to the end.  And now's our time to push the Great Awakening over the edges, right on the cusp of going viral.  It's that critical mess.  We need to turn this into the red pill apocalypse.  And while we're doing that, the White Hats will continue to leak information, whether it be publicly, like releasing the JFK files, whether it be with back channels, such as releasing the Q drops to us, whether it be soft disclosure to the public, like renaming the secret space programs publicly, The Space Force, whether it be just ceding information to people, you know, all of a sudden there's a lot of talk about possible cancer cures, possible AIDS cures, all these things seemingly coming out out of nowhere in a three-year period.  If you ask me, they're definitely leaking stuff to the public, and they're also doing it on paper with damning reports such as this.  The evidence at this point is piling up, and it will continue forever.  with the Doran Report.  It needed to be done like this to be accepted by the public.  It can't be rushed.  The enormity of what is coming will shock the world.  Where we go one, we go all.  I'm going to pull the whole thing down. ",
