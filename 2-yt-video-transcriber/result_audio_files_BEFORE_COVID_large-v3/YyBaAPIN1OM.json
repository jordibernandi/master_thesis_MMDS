So I'm back in church now, but for years, I was one of the millennials who left.  The reason was, when I started questioning, people came at me, much like you did, Ally.  They said that to question my pastor's authority was akin to questioning God.  Any disagreements we had about LGBTQ issues or about purity culture, I was just met with disdain, called a cherry picker, all the Christian insults people give each other.

Not As Gray is not about ushering in some hipster Christianity, but I am speaking out because for all the good that we do, I am so tired of Christians turning a blind eye, a deaf ear, to the harm that our bad doctrine can cause.  In my Lauren Daigle video, for example, Christians feel superior to me, saying they're brave enough to be counter-cultural and shout that being LGBTQ plus is a sin.  But no matter what your view on that, and I state my case for mine in this video, the truth is people leave Jesus' side or commit hate crimes or commit suicide because of the way Christians handle this subject.  As for purity culture, on the bright side, we are taught the beautiful truth that God reveals Himself and His divinity through the physical act of making love.  It is reflective of Christ and the Church.  However, again, God is great exists to tell the truth.  Can purity work?  Yes, but I dare you to read Linda K. Klein's Pure.  She researched the effects of this bad doctrine for 12 years.  Linda hates, quote, purity culture, but guess what?  She's still a Christian too.  And this one's funny. ",

In the book, Reading the Bible Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg acknowledges there are two camps when it comes to the Bible.  Those who believe God wrote every single word, basically moving the pen of his people.  Or those who believe the Bible consists of stories, history, divine intervention, quotes from God, and of course, the walk of Jesus.  I am in the second camp.  You, I believe, are in the first.  For me, if you'll allow me to explain, I see journal entries, I see allegory, I see stories, I see divinity as well, but take Song of Songs.  Would you quote Solomon when he says, your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride, milk and honey are under your tongue, and follow it by saith the Lord?  No.  Because this is clearly written by Solomon.  It's erotica.  It's something that he said to his lover.  The Bible is full of this.  I believe we are supposed to be taking chapters and books in their entirety and gleaning from the message.  It is not full of perfect people that did perfect things.  And therefore, I think it's dangerous to pluck out a verse here and there and preach sermons on it.  And those are just two schools of thought.  If you want to stay in the first group, fine, I respect that.  But I would ask you for the grace and understanding to allow me to be in the second group Because believe it or not, I read the Bible too.  And now for the most annoying argument. ",

And just so you know, I was actually initially offended by Nadia, the sarcastic Lutheran, because she cusses in sermons.  My initial reaction was like, ew, why is she doing that?  Why is she alienating people from her message just because she wants to curse?  And I heard God say, she's not talking to you, Brenda.  She is welcoming back people into the Christian community that need to hear that, to disarm them, to make them feel welcome again.  It doesn't matter if it goes over your head.  It doesn't matter if it goes over mine.  What matters is that we are sisters in Christ.  What God is calling us to do right now is to unify, to love one another and to listen to one another, to invite more people into the body of Christ.  I believe you and I share that mission and I would be happy to be your friend and to talk with you and I hope you feel the same way about me.  So that's it.  Love to you, Allie.
