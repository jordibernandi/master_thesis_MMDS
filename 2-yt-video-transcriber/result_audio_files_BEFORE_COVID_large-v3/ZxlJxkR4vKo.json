            "text": "Good afternoon, good evening, or even good morning.  I'm here to let you know that there is a case, a Brexit leave court case at the Royal Courts of Justice, and there is a media blockade, a complete media blockade.  There is also a throttle down from social media.  Normal everyday people just like me and just like you have raised with \u00a35 and \u00a310 etc.  and pounds even have raised \u00a3180,000.  I'd like to tell you this, that every one of our MPs knows about this case.  I have seen the documentation from the House of Commons Library that actually there's three pages discussing this case and putting links out to videos of myself and Robin Tilbrook talking about the case.  Now what's the issue and why am I putting out this message to you?  Quite simply, people, they are stopping any media coverage of this case.  The reason is because the case is a very good case that we left the European Union on the 29th of March 2019 by law.  Not just a normal everyday statute, an ordinary statute.  No, a constitutional statute.  And all Chief Justice laws in the Metric Martyr case and the Gina Miller case confirm that we are correct.  Now, the European Withdrawal Act of 2017 was 137 words.  It was simple.  to the point and it repealed the European Communities Act of 1972.  That particular act was elevated to constitutional status by the referendum, the second referendum that we've had in this country, reference this point.  and let me tell you saying people, we did leave on the 29th of March 2019 at 11pm.  They are trying to run us out of money.  They are trying to hide the facts from the public.  and What can I say?  This video is for you to understand.  Please go to www.defendbrexit.com.  Richard Tilbrook is a solicitor.  Two of the advocates, lawyers, barristers are from Lawyers for Britain.  They are highly capable barristers and the government have employed external QCs to try and defend this case.  It's very difficult to defend simple law.  So that's it people, please donate, please get the message out there and please contact the BBC, Channel 4 and all of the others to get this message out there because what's going on at the moment is pure propaganda.  What they are withholding is the news from the High Court that this case is there, that this case has much, much support, and that we left on the 29th of March 2019. at 11pm.  Thank you very much and with that I will say please visit the website defendbrexit.com and obviously all donations to this crowdfunding court case which will succeed.  Thank you, goodbye. ",
