            "text": "Interesting thing isn't it?  The thing being, why men stop dating?  Why would men stop dating?  Why would any man stop chasing so much lovely and gorgeous buxom women?  What has caused a certain group of men to run?  Run as far as they can.  Run further than that of a flock of seagulls.  Not an 80s band but the reality.  Is it because many have been burnt by previous relationships?  So the thought of going back into that sea.  Into that fishy briny ocean.  To date again.  Maybe the thought of that is not for them.  Maybe some find that dating is a mind eff.  A mind field of mind effery.  just games.  Maybe they find that in all of this dating, some women are just stringing them along, taking them for a ride.  Like a game of 21, many players playing for the same prize, if it is seen as a prize.  We constantly hear and see things of modern women boasting about getting free meals, boasting about filling their bellies off.  the goodwill of men, men they will never ever sleep with.  But they are hungry.  Very hungry women.  Banking on thirsty men.  But only one is filling their need.  Interesting.  You have to wonder how many women out there have made men take them to watch Avengers Endgame.  And the re-release of Avengers Endgame.  And she has never given him any.  That's not funny.  It's a random thought, but I guarantee you it must have happened somewhere.  Some would say it's the modern attitude of women, just the way they are.  This self-entitled thing about them.  This air of I am so great about them.  And the funny thing is, well it's not really funny because most men would never tell women of this or say this to them, is that a lot of that attitude and manly crap is very, very unattractive.  It's not nice.  Those actions make it very easy for men to say, you know what, I can't be bothered.  Other men, you deal with this nonsense.  You deal with this noise.  You deal with the headache and the stress.  I can't be bothered.  The juice is not worth the squeeze for as good... and as lovely as she may be, what comes with her is not worth the time.  You see, in dating, you can't look at men and women in the same light because dating for men and women is a very different thing.  The simple thing is there are choosers and there are ones wanting to be chosen.  Clearly, The men are the ones wanting to be chosen.  The women are the choosers.  Some would say that's not really the case, and no that's not the case but only for a very very small amount of men.  For most men, they are the ones waiting to be chosen.  Use Tinder as an example.  Guaranteed there are many women on there that have tons of men that have chosen them but they are swiping to see which man they want to give their time to.  It's always a game of choosing and being chosen.  So for many men, they can see this as a losing battle.  Especially if they feel there are men that do not have, let's say, what they feel is needed to compete with other men.  They feel they may not have the looks, the money, the confidence, the swagger, the ability to just talk to women and get what you want from them.  without crumbling and falling apart in layers upon layers of anxiety and nervousness.  see there are various reasons as to why men stop dating and as a man listening comment below as to what is your personal reason for no longer dating.  feel free to swear if you want to just rearrange the letters.  And then we get to this part here.  The part of the video that some men will understand and some men will dislike.  Why do I say that?  Because I believe young men should experience being around women.  Dating them, yes.  Marrying, no.  Living with, no.  But maybe dating.  And for lack of a better PG-13 word, intercourse as well.  Oh god.  What a boring word.  But you understand what I mean.  I do believe young men growing up should learn the skills of being around women and talking to them.  It is a powerful skill.  Now, yes, very dangerous for many men in the modern MeToo era, but still a skill I think men should have.  and then to be nonchalant about that skill.  It's actually a very simple skill.  Women are in no way as complex as you may think.  Once you understand certain rudimentary things about them, you can almost see the patterns before they happen.  Yes, they're all different individuals, but they're all the same in the same certain type of ways.  The reason I say this as well is because I could say, women are like black holes, dark voids in space that absorb everything.  Now for some men that is all I would need to say, because they fully understand what I mean already.  Some men understand the concept but because they have not experienced it, they understand certain meanings to it, certain understandings, certain examples.  But the men that have experienced it, they understand.  And many, vastly more than me, they would say, fish, fish, hold on.  Yes, of course, your experiences have been similar to that of a black hole.  But young fish, listen here.  My experiences with women have been that of a supermassive black hole.  Behold these tales.  Sit down, little fish, sit down.  The weight of these stories alone are crushing.  There are many levels to this.  And I say this as well because many men are still trying to learn certain things to understand how to maneuver better around women and for some to get inside of them as well.  But many men have various reasons for no longer dating.  Their reasons are valid to them why they have stopped dating.  A sad sad truth about it, a sad truth about all of it is there are many men that have stopped dating that never wanted to stop dating.  They very much enjoy the company of women.  They very much enjoy spending time with them.  But the harsh truth is that many men are aware of what comes with her.  For all the sweetness, so many come with bitterness.  And for many men that has turned them, in turn, bitter.  Enjoy yourself, but never lose yourself.  Here's to men that no longer date, and the reasons they have for their decision.  Here's to men that understand no matter what, the journey of life, of their own life, is and should always be the bigger focus.  Here's to men that understand why I say, Focus.  Observe.  Remember.  The world is yours.  Have a nice day. ",
