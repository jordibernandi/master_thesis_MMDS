            "text": "Shalom to the 12 tribe worldwide.  We are in the midst of the Unleavened Brand Feast and we had a wonderful Passover.  and this night the people came over today and we did work around here and we're actually putting in a garden here.  You see the garden boxes.  And we got a couple of new goats.  And there you see the chickens running around in there.  And on the other side of the house, we have another, I think, 15 or 20 chicks coming in.  We have like another smaller pen.  And we've always talked about the Torah is getting back in touch with the soil.  and with livestock and with the earth.  And so that's what's called living in Torah.  And by the way, so the reason for this video, and it's gonna be quick, is to show something about this line right here.  So you see this line that goes all the way across, and then you see this trench right here.  okay so we have a passage in the Bible where it says I think it's Paul who was talking and he says study to show yourself approved study to show a workman that needs not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.  All right, so a workman is like I'm doing now, I'm working.  And when we first came out and I was given the illustration of how to put this row in, we didn't have this line here.  And so as we were trying to make a straight line, we found ourselves like way out over here.  By the time we got down, we would have been probably at the end on that side.  So what we did was we put this line, all right?  And by putting this line, which is absolutely straight, then as a workman, I can use this line to stay straight and dig this trench.  See this trench?  Okay, so the Hebrew word for this trench right here is the word derek and it's related to the word zedek.  And it has to do with righteous or righteousness.  Study to show thyself approved, a workman that needs not be ashamed.  Rightly, that word, dividing the word.  So as we cut the soil, as we cut the soil, we want to make sure that we're cutting the soil right, which means correctly or straight.  So you'll see that that word also means straight.  And this right here is the path that as me, a workman, I want to be on the right path.  So I use this line.  So does anybody know what that line represents?  Parah.  Parah.  Hallelujah.  So the line represents Torah.  Before I had the line down, and I was making an earlier video, we actually, why are you laughing?  Because she was in the video.  You can show your face.  Get her on camera.  You were going pretty smooth.  Before we laid down this line, which is called sometimes, well, anyway, this line being straight, we were then going off of what we thought we were doing.  that was straight.  But now that we have the line laid down and we dig this right path, the path is now being dug right and the soil is now being cut right.  See how the shovel is actually cutting the soil.  So the shovel is cutting, and I know I'm cutting right because I'm staying close to the line.  And that line represents Torah.  Now, a person coming behind me, they don't have to cut a brand new line, right?  All they got to do is get in the trench that I've cut, and that cut is next to the line that Yah gave us, and everybody will be able to stay straight.  Hallelujah.  So Zion, there's all kinds of lessons once we start living in Torah.  There's more to reading the Bible than just reading it from a book.  You got to come outside and see it.  And so if you don't want to be ashamed of your work, You don't want it all over the place.  You don't want to be embarrassed.  You want to rightly divide it.  You see how much work it is.  I'm out here sweating, but it's easy for me to keep going straight as long as I stay next to that straight line.  It'll be easy for us to keep going straight with Yah as long as we stay with Torah.  Hope this little message encouraged Zion worldwide.  And from all of us who are still here during this week, it's been a fantastic week.  Tell the whole world, Shalom.  Shalom.  Shalom.  Hey. ",
