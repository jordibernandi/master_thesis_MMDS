Okay, so one big piece that hit was kind of interesting for me because they came out with the will that was signed coincidentally two days before his alleged suicide.  And what intrigued me on that was who was listed as the two executors, Darren Indyke, if I'm saying that right, and Richard Kahn.  And I looked at it and I'm like, God, Kahn, why do I know this name?  So I started looking through my notes and lo and behold, I had done a report called the St.  Thomas, Jeffrey Epstein, St.  Thomas Network Comms in an Elite School.  And we covered that, I think, either in episode seven or eight of our podcast, which is over on Hivemind.  So if anyone missed it, we covered that report there.  And Erica Kellerhouse is listed along with Richard Kahn and Darren Indyk, the two executors.  They are listed on Jeffrey Epstein's business on his tax returns under Gratitude America LTD.  So those two were the VP and president, and Erica Kellerhouse is listed as the secretary and treasurer, and she holds the documents.  So she's covered in my report because she is on the board of Antilles School, which is like the hub of this whole network.  So I thought that was kind of interesting.  And then, of course, they then report that Boris Nikolic is the successor executor, in case, you know, Kahn and Indyk can't fulfill their roles, who he happened to be a former Gates advisor.  Right.  And I haven't dug into him at all.  Have you, Edge? ",

He claims that he does not want to be the executor of the will, should Indyk and Khan not be able to follow through with their roles.  And we'll get into that in a second, because I know that Indyk has recently obtained a criminal defense lawyer as the investigation continues into co-conspirators.  So it's possible that Khan and Indyk may not be able to follow through with their roles, but... He's claiming he had no prior knowledge to being listed as an executor or a successor executor, and he doesn't want to carry through with that role. ",
