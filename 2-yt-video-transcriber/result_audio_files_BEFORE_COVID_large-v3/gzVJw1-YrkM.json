            "text": "Thank you.  The war is declared.  The battle come down.  Every time Donald Trump slags off London, the media acts like he's saying the moon is made out of cheese.  Is Trump right?  Is London turning into a shithole?  Well just like San Francisco, London has a massive problem with actual shit.  Due to overpopulation, London's sewer system has reached breaking point.  You see, it was only built to serve 2.5 million people, but London's population is now almost 9 million.  That means that whenever it rains, the system is over capacity.  And wastewater, untreated sewage, and runoff has to be flushed into the Thames.  39 million tons of sewage flows into the Thames every year, killing off huge numbers of fish and water-dwelling plants.  That's a lot of shit!  The UK is the world's 10th most congested country and London is completely overpopulated.  It's the second most gridlocked city in Europe.  London's population is higher than at any other point in history.  Getting a bit crowded now.  Like London.  which I spell S-H-I-T-H-O-L-A, shit hole.  During rush hour, it's totally normal for queues at every door of every underground tube to be eight people deep.  There's a net inflow of 60,000 people to London every single year.  That's the equivalent of adding the population of what otherwise would be a medium to large town in any other area of the UK to London every year.  Two thirds of that growth is due to immigration.  What's the solution to that?  More immigration.  The pressure of mass immigration combined with wealthy foreigners buying up property has made housing completely unaffordable for most Londoners.  The Qataris own more of London than the Queen herself.  Super-rich Russians and Chinese also launder their dirty money via the purchase of property in London, further inflating prices.  In London, we build... affordable homes, which are completely unaffordable for normal working people.  For them to become affordable, the average wage would have to rise 266%.  Homelessness is becoming so prevalent that metal spikes are being installed to stop vagrants sleeping in office.  block doorways and some residential tower blocks even have poor doors where lower income tenants are forced to enter through the back so that higher paying residents don't have to see them.  Property in London is so expensive that someone asked for \u00a3500 a month to rent a literal cupboard under the stairs.  That's about $750 a month to reside in Clapham, one of the worst hit areas during the London riots.  Thank you.  Living the dream!  London has such a rootless population, it's a rarity to meet someone there who actually grew up in London.  The city's vast, transient inhabitants all squabble cheek by jowl for limited space, earning Londoners the reputation of being some of the rudest people on Earth.  Journalist Shapiko Sandy wrote of how she saw a heavily pregnant woman ask another woman to give up her seat on the Tube.  It's creating a breed of dog-eat-dog traveller with a ruthless survival-of-the-fittest mentality.  Normal behaviour is suspended, it's each for himself trying to grab a seat even at the expense of pregnant women and those with babies.  Londoners are also notoriously time poor because of their god-awful work-life balance.  And they spend so much time on grindingly packed, slow and unreliable public transport that one company even suggested turning buses into mobile gyms.  Is there truly any Black Mirror-style hellscape that can compare with this?  Being shuttled through a dangerous urban sprawl while labouring on a human hamster wheel before being dispatched at your designated slave pod to do the bidding of your corporate foreign slave master.  Living the dream!  Londoners abject.  Terror, focusing on anything but their soulless careers for more than five seconds, even led one architect to propose something called the Endless Workplace.  Yeah, we're not obsessed with work enough, so let's turn every single major rooftop in the city into another office.  That'll make us happier, won't it?  And you're always busy.  Really busy.  Widening gulf between rich and poor, combined with London's increasing unaffordability, irreparably damaged social cohesion.  This led to soaring depression, suicide rates, teenage pregnancies and hospital admissions in poorer areas.  It also led to an explosion in violent crime amongst London's vast population of droogs.  A wave of stabbings have given London a higher murder rate than New York City.  Children and teenagers are responsible for half of London's knife crime.  According to Metropolitan Police figures, 73% of knife offenders and 53% of victims were from a black or ethnic minority background.  While leftists in the UK continually assert that Black Lives Matter!  Virtually none of them actually give a damn about young black lives being snuffed out on a routine basis.  Oh, they'll protest against Heathrow Airport because they claim air pollution is racist, but then go completely silent on the fact that black kids are slaughtering each other on the streets on a daily basis.  These are the same people who whined about Stop and Search being racist, which, after it was drastically scaled back by more than 50% thanks to the idiocy of Theresa May, led to an explosion in knife crime.  They campaigned to end a policy that actually saved black lives.  Who else vehemently opposed and vowed to reduce stop and search?  London Mayor Sadiq Khan.  He said he'd do, quote, everything in his power to cut it.  London's turning into a shithole under Sadiq Khan.  According to the Met statistics, since Khan took power, robberies are up 65%, knife crime is up 55%, rape is up 45%.  What was Khan's response when confronted with these statistics?  to claim that London was safe? ",

So, again, do you think that saying that London is not less safe now than when you took over was an honest thing to say?  I do.  You do.  So, gun crime is up, robbery is up, knife crime is up, rape is up, taking motor vehicle offences is up, residential burglary is up, knife crime with injury is up, knife crime with injury and robbery is up, and you think, honestly, that London is more safe now than when you took over as Mayor of London?

            "text": "Diversity is a strength.  According to the National Police Chiefs Council, London now has one of the highest rates of recorded acid and corrosive substance attacks per capita in the entire world.  There are 15 acid attacks in the UK every week, with three quarters of those taking place in London.  This compares with just two a month from 2007 to 2011.  The borough with the most acid attacks is Newham in East London, the most ethnically diverse district in England and Wales, and home to the second highest percentage of Muslims in the UK.  Newham also has a higher rate of tuberculosis than Rwanda and Iraq.  Diversity is a strength.  In some areas of London, pizza delivery men can't even operate without a real fear of being attacked by feral mobs.  Now some immigrant parents are sending their kids back to Somalia because they claim it's safer than London.  If your child is involved in a gang and there's nowhere for him to hide, you take him back to Africa.  It's safer there than it is in London.  When you're a parent sending your child back, it's a risk you're taking, but unfortunately some parents feel like it's also a risk leaving their kids in the streets of London.  As British-born gang members admit, they had to drastically increase their level of violence simply to keep up with Congolese and Somalian immigrants.  And the soundtrack to The Bloodshed is drill rap, the lyrics of which often brag about murderers moving up the league table the more people they kill.  John Cleese got hounded by the media for saying that London is no longer an English city.  But if being English denotes basic civility and respect, Who could argue with his conclusion?  An Asian journalist visits a diverse area of London.  Within minutes, we walked by three of the mosques, which were vibrant and filled with young men coming and going.  We passed a church, which was closed and decrepit, with a window that had been vandalized with eggs.  We squeezed by hundreds of residents busy preparing for the Eid al-Hadja holiday.  Girls in hijabs gathered around tables to paint henna designs on their hands.  All the businesses had a religious flair.  The eateries were halal.  the fitness center was sex-segregated, and the boutiques displayed modest outfits on mannequins.  Pakistani flags flew high and proud.  I never saw a Union Jack.  Yeah, sounds really English to me.  London is also full of upper-middle-class people who dutifully support mass immigration simply to avoid the tedium of having to raise their own children when it's so much easier to get a wage slave from Eastern Europe to do it.  And if they have to live 26 to a house because they're paid so pathetically, then so be it.  A team of enforcement officers have arrived at dawn to look inside.  Morning.  What they find is shocking.  There are 26 beds.  Living the dream!  I mean, their demand for cheap nannies and builders will force immigrants to live like rats in squalid conditions, but then they'll be sure to point their finger at Brexit supporters and call them racists until their Pret coffee is spewing out of their nostrils.  Who would be serving our coffee in Pret?  and then when given a choice will pay top whack to send their kids to the whitest schools possible, publicly preaching multicultural platitudes while privately upholding actual segregation.  But let's not be too negative.  The economy's still pretty good and there are plenty of job opportunities in London.  There was even an opportunity for Coram Butt before he went on to become a mass-murdering terrorist.  Butt, who had fake explosives strapped to his chest, before going on to knife numerous people to death during the London Bridge attack was hired by Transport for London as a security guard.  Diversity is a strength.  One of his roles?  Investigating suspicious packages.  Transport for London really knows how to put its money to good use.  They also shelled out on a poster campaign lecturing men how to sit properly.  Commercials showing traditional gender roles, junk food or physically fit women are all banned.  But an ad promoting tourism to Brunei, a country that recently tried to push through a law that would legalize stoning gay people to death, completely fine.  In the dystopian movie High Rise, the residents of a Thames estuary tower block are socially ranked by elevation.  Debauchery reigns supreme, whether that be amongst the drone-like masses at the bottom, the chattering classes in the middle, or the elitists in the penthouse.  That's a metaphor for London.  Most people in London can only tolerate living here by becoming co-caddled drunken degenerates.  Living the dream!  The Thames contains so much cocaine, eels are becoming hyperactive, and the middle class' fiendish demand for coke in turn fuels violent gang crime and murder.  Michael Gove was crucified by the London media for admitting to taking coke 20 years ago.  Because no one who works in the media in London ever takes coke!  What a ludicrous suggestion!  But Paul, if London is such a shithole, why do you live there?  Good question.  Basically every political event, interview, gathering or protest takes place in London.  I kind of have to be here because of what I do.  And don't get me wrong, there are some nice places in London.  London is full of great history and it's full of great people.  But people who've lived in London since birth all tell me the same story.  It's lost its identity, it's hurtling full force into a crime-ridden dystopia and the quality of life is on life support.  Samuel Johnson once said, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.  That was 240 years ago, and things have changed.  London is a globalist model for all future megacities, superficially tolerable for a minority of wealthy people so long as they're sufficiently drugged while segregating themselves from the full horror of the reality that surrounds them.  And for everyone else, the best they can hope for is to become indentured wage slaves for that very same wealthy elite.  London is a citadel of sin for bohemian upper classes.  But for most other people, it's turning into a complete shithole.
