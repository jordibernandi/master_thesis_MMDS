I didn't hear what you said.  I said, do you know him?  Do you know me?  Do I know you?  Yeah.  Should I?  I don't know.  You can ask me if you know me or not.  Should I?  You probably don't.  You wouldn't be asking me a dumb question like that if you did.  But you can go on about going back to work.  I'm just going to watch you guys.  Thank you.  I'll go back to work when I feel like it.  When you guys are done working, if you want to talk to me, I'll be more than happy to talk to you.  You can stand there, Andrew.  It doesn't look like you don't want to talk to me.  You walked up here talking to me.  Go back to work.  Let me tell you something, buddy.  Yeah.  I don't care what you think about that camera.  Get out of my face.  Somebody get this coward.  Or what?  Somebody get this guy.  Somebody get this coward.  A coward would do something about that.  I don't want to talk to him.  Get away from me.  Then you go back away.  You go back to work.  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  Cowards hold a camera expecting something bad to happen.  Leave me alone.  I'll talk to you when you're finished.  I don't need to talk to you.  Okay.  Call me a coward again, boy.  Coward.  Call me a boy again, coward.  Boy.  Call me a boy again.  Are you racist?  Why can't he disengage, man?  Thank you.  oh Hey, bud.  Hey, excuse me.  I'm going to need a name badge number or something.  Case number or something.  It's Silvera.  They're handling everything.  It's the detectives.  I don't have the case number on me.  Oh, you're Silvera.  Do you know who that is?  I don't.  You know what, like, are they narcotics units?  They're like a special unit.  They don't tell us anything.  Vice?  Narcotics?  What is it?  I don't know.  Okay, and your name and badge number?  It's Silvera.  Thank you guys for pulling them off.  Hey, I wasn't going to say nothing to you guys. ",
