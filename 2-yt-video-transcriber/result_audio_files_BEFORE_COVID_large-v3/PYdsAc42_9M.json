            "text": "2019 was a tumultuous year for law on YouTube.  This is its story.  Are you camera ready?  VivaFry, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber, I make vlogs.  VivaFry, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber, and it's vlog time.  For those of you who don't know me, I am VivaFry, a Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  I do these things called vlogs.  VivaFry, VivaFry, VivaFry, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  I am VivaFry, a Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  This is Pudge.  And welcome to the vlog, dog.  Barney, look over here.  There you go.  My videos are basically legal breakdowns, explanations, analyses of things that are going on in the real world.  And the first question that the court had to adjudicate on is whether or not they even had the power to adjudicate on what are prerogative powers of the parliament.  This judgment is the unanimous judgment of all eleven justices.  So a Canadian couple was arrested for impaired driving, both of them, at the same time, in the same car.  This is not going to be the most shocking part of this vlog.  You're not going to give me a statement as to what happened?  Not right now, man.  Under the Criminal Code of Canada, impaired driving doesn't mean that you actually have to be physically driving the car in order to be committing the offense.  But something else that this story perfectly illustrates from a legal perspective is when you are being arrested by the police... Stop talking.  When police are there investigating you, do not talk to the police.  You are not going to get them to stop investigating you.  Juicy smoo-yay.  Y'all never heard of juicy smoo-yay?  No one is going to accuse his attorneys of lacking creativity.  So what are Smollett's attorneys arguing here?  It's actually kind of interesting.  They are arguing that the city of Chicago is attempting to recover the costs of an allegedly false statement made by Jussie Smollett, the charges of which were all dropped against Jussie Smollett.  This perverse tactic is entirely at odds with the form, function, and prior use of the FSO and CRO.  which by design allow the city to impose penalties and recover costs where a party has violated the law.  This ever-deepening hole that Jussie Smollett keeps digging for himself.  And I have been accused of being overly empathetic to a fault, in that even in the hottest heat of battle, I can still see the humanity in my adversary and my enemy.  People, it is happening.  Groups are actually starting to sue YouTube.  Ow.  It's God punishing me for schadenfreude.  So PragerU is suing YouTube.  I got a copy of the proceedings and I said I have to do a vlog on this.  What could conceivably happen when the largest search engine owns the largest video hosting platform and can create algorithms which dictate or influence the information you get when using either of those platforms?  Just use your imagination.  A multi-billion dollar corporation gets busted breaking the law, enters into a nominal settlement, and shifts the onus of compliance onto its users.  In order to help you comply with the law, we're now required to ask you to mark all of your videos as made for kids or not.  And now YouTube, in having shifted the onus onto the content creators themselves, can now wash their hands of responsibility and say, FTC, don't come after us, go after the content creator.  They're the ones who misrepresented the nature of their video at the upload stage.  So apparently there's another YouTube lawyer out there and he wants to call me out on my analysis of the Nicholas Sandman judgment?  And one of my favorite YouTubers, Viva Farid, did some great videos about the case, but I'm going to tell you something.  His analysis was wrong.  What kind of YouTube lawyer calls out another YouTube lawyer?  And this Mansplainers Mansplainers Mansplainers is where LegalEagle loses the argument.  I don't mind being criticized and I don't mind disagreement.  In fact, I like critique.  It builds character and it contributes to the overall knowledge base.  Without critique, what are we?  I didn't want to do another one of these videos, but I got about 30 seconds into LegalEagle's most recent video on the quid pro quo Trump administration impeachment ordeal. ",

It took a whopping five hours for Gary Sondland to finally respond to Bill Taylor's smoking gun of a text confirming the quid pro quo.  The same red flag went off in my head as well, and it was only people in the comments section who brought to my attention that the five hours in between Bill Taylor's smoking gun of a quid pro quo text and Gary Sondland's response was from midnight to five in the morning, at the very least from what we see on the texts themselves.  Legal Eagle is a lawyer, I am a lawyer.  Any lawyer is going to tell you that when you receive a text, email, letter, any written correspondence that starts with as discussed very rarely is what follows actually as discussed.  Hearsay can be much better evidence than direct as we have learned in painful instances and it's certainly valid in this instance.  No, no, no, no, no.  And although these hearings for the most part are nothing more than political grandstanding and political theater, they are nonetheless educational to watch from a legal perspective.  Never is hearsay evidence better than direct evidence.  Period.  Typically people understand hearsay evidence as being someone told me something and now I'm telling it to you without having that person say it directly.  And that understanding of hearsay evidence is accurate enough for all intents and purposes.  But hearsay evidence is either a written or verbal statement made out of court but presented in court to prove the truthfulness of that statement.  And it is generally considered to be inadmissible.  On a scale of one to 10, how interested are you in understanding the respective positions for and against the impeachment of Donald Trump according to the constitutional legal experts?  Scale of one to 10, five being the highest.  We heard witnesses of fact.  testify, and the other day we heard the constitutional legal expert witnesses testify on law.  And the object of their testimony was, are the facts as we currently understand them today sufficient to warrant articles of impeachment against the president?  In my last video, I talked about the need for the appearance of objectivity of any expert testifying on a subject.  And to that end, I dissected why it was that Representative Matt Gaetz was going after the expert witnesses for having contributed to the campaigns of Obama, Elizabeth Warren, and Hillary Clinton. ",
