            "text": "Hey guys, I want to come on here and talk about this article that I was sent.  And the reason I'm going to do it is because I've already had a number of different people in the comment sections making mention of Cesar being an actor and possibly scamming 90 Day Fiance and having a fake storyline.  And so I went over this article and I've already talked about it in some of my videos, the fact that A lot of people when they get into the realm of reality television, they'll sign up with talent agencies.  It looks like Cesar may have done it before getting on there, but that's not unusual.  When people want to be in the industry, they sign up for talent agencies.  I remember, and I'll keep this short, when I did some modeling back in the day, I was on a modeling website, and as a part of that modeling website, they would help you find certain gigs that were related to the modeling industry.  And it may not have been print or runway or clothing modeling.  They would give auditions for extra than movies and reality shows that were coming up and things like that.  But that doesn't necessarily mean you're an actor per se.  Reality television is partially reality, but it's also manipulated reality because often the relationship dynamics that people get into are real reality.  However, they have manipulation scenes throughout the show for ratings because everything goes for ratings.  So just because it may seem like it's fake doesn't necessarily mean that it's fake.  But I hope that helps people to understand that just because he's on a talent site does not mean that he's not this pathetic to actually think that this woman from the Ukraine isn't scamming him.  When people have... hey guys i just want to give a quick shout out to everybody who subscribed to me on patreon and who continue to support via patreon.  if you want to become a patron and support you can click the link in the description box and become a patron to support the channel.  you can also support via paypal or through cash app and the links to those will be there as well.  if you choose to support Via Patreon, you will get access to exclusive live streams, exclusive content, and any other content that I put there that is not on YouTube.  And again, thanks and a big shout out to everyone who already subscribed.  I've been saying for a while that just Russian and Ukrainian women in general, they're kind of raised and bred to be scammy men.  Now, I don't know if that's true.  That's not my culture and I don't deal with them.  But those are some things that I've heard.  But according to... This soap dirt blog, they're basically claiming that Cesar is saying that he met Maria, who we all know doesn't like him.  We know he hasn't met her in person.  Cesar claimed that he sent Maria $40,000 over the course of the five years that he's known her, which comes out roughly to $800 or $900, give or take, per month.  They're also alleging that he may claim that he paid, he spent $450 to send her some flowers and an email based on that website, Anastasia Date, that he met her on.  Now, they have a screenshot.  this talent profile and this is what they're saying.  is there evidence that he is scamming 90 day fiance with this storyline which he doesn't necessarily need to really do?  that I mean the most people aren't getting big fame off of 90 day fiance so it doesn't really make any sense why he would do that.  I don't really see Cedar and Maria's storyline going anywhere, because Maria isn't going to really be involved with Cedar.  I do believe that Cedar is getting scammed, but whether he's scamming 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 is another story.  Now, what I really will say of this scam... is this Explore Talent Profile, and this is what I really want to get into, because at this point, I'm not even concerned about if TLC is getting scammed.  We're getting scammed by having to read this talent program.  We're getting scammed by having to read this talent profile.  But I want you guys to look at this, because we're going to read over it.  First of all, he says he's 42.  Apparently, he's actually 46.  They quote this... the article.  so I'm thinking this whole profile has to be a scam or it has to be very old in which he didn't even use it which it wouldn't apply.  but one thing is is that when you sign up for any website Because the passage of time occurs, whatever you put your birthday in, it's going to, as you have a birthday and a year pass, it's going to update your birthday.  So why am I looking at a profile that says Cesar Mac is 42?  Now, unless initially he lied about his birthday, which if you're actually seeking work on a talent website and you actually get jobs, you can't lie about your age because they're going to ask you for at least your ID, which is going to reveal your real age.  So this whole thing is suspect to me and I really believe they're using it to garner attention.  I don't think that he's using this profile.  They could have fabricated this profile, but whatever.  It then says that his ethnicity is mixed.  If y'all, like really, if somebody don't get whoever made this profile, let me tell y'all, I'm so tired of black people online talking about their mix when they know, mix with what?  What would Cedar be mixed with aside from blindness and remedialness and low self-esteem?  That's the only thing that he would be mixed with.  Like if he don't get out of here, then if you go down to his body type, it says athletic in his dreams.  That man look like he's nine months overdue for birth, meaning that he should have gave birth nine months ago.  He looks like the penguin off a spawn, and he's sitting up here talking about he has an athletic build.  Then there's a bunch of these old pictures on here that's supposed to be Caesar.  Clearly, that doesn't represent him.  That's why I'm trying to wonder where they got this from.  They would have had to, like, just make this fake profile on here, which, like I say, again, it wouldn't work for an actual talent agency because they really do ask you for your ID and your social security number.  So, because if you're getting paid, they're recording your information because taxes, right?  So he wouldn't afford to be able to make up a profile lying about his age and his build anyway.  You think that they're not going to know if somebody's sending them this profile and he's in here without a beer belly?  And he's actually looking athletic.  And then they meet him in person.  And you see the seether that's on 90 Day Fiance before the 90 days right now.  There ain't no way.  So at this point, I'm questioning the accuracy of this soap dirt article where they're claiming that this is a talent agency that he signed up for.  I really want to know, why would you sit up here and put this on here?  What's also interesting is that when you go on to the Explore Talent website and you do find a page that says Cedar Mack on it, it'll show you the image much like what you saw in the Soap Dirt article.  And it has this picture.  So it appears to be somewhat of a profile.  But once you click on that profile, this is what really showed up.  You don't see a profile.  You see a blank thing.  And then it says similar talents for Cesar, Raleigh, North Carolina, male.  black hair.  age range 40 to 49.  So I'm not sure what's going on with this website.  All I do know is that what could possibly be happening is that Soap Dirt may have wanted to be bringing some new information to gauge viewers.  However, this whole profile is suspect to me if it isn't the fact that it says he's a 42-year-old man while they're reporting that he's 46 and the fact that a profile won't actually show up when you come on the website.  That's enough to make me question it, and I don't understand why they didn't question it, especially if they want to be taken seriously at a website and a blogger.  Now, what I will say isn't a scam, though, is the fact that he does have a nine-month overdue pregnant belly.  What isn't a scam is that he's clearly not mixed.  He's catfishing us, really.  If that profile is real, which it doesn't seem to be, then we have to raise the question as to why is he lying about his age?  Why is his page not adding to his age like it should be?  Because the page shouldn't stay at 42 years old, even if he made it when he was 42, which based on the pictures, maybe he was 42 and he didn't weigh as much.  And then now that he's 46, he weighs a lot.  But in any case, his age would still be updated every time he had a birthday on that website.  So that's what's suspect as well.  But I don't know.  You guys let me know what you think.  I don't like that pregnant belly.  I'm tired of black people saying they're mixed when they're not.  But that's what I think about it.  You guys get in the comment section, weigh in, let me know if you think that's legit or if you think it's... suspect.  thank you for your support.  like comment subscribe share the video and i'll see you guys in the next one.
