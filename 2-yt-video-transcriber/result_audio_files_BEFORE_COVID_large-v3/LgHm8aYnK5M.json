            "text": "Hello.  I was going to make a video about the Notre Dame fire on that day, but I was too angry, so I read a good book instead.  And frankly, I was already still angry about this.  Hagia Sophia, the Church of the Holy Wisdom of God, the Logos, the Second Person of the Trinity, the Lord Jesus Christ.  the greatest church and the greatest building of its day, until the fall of Constantinople.  And yes, I still call it Constantinople, out of respect, because the Byzantines may have lost it, but at least they put up a good fight.  If they ever rename Paris to better reflect its new, um, inhabitants, I will use the new name and save the old name to talk about the past, out of respect for the people who built it and preserved it, until their crummy descendants gave it away.  The same if they rename France when the descendants of the Franks finish giving it all away.  And I wish that those defenders of Constantinople had had TNT.  They could have evacuated the place, and desanctified it, and blown it to kingdom come.  This would have been better than the desecration of its being turned into a mosque.  Did you know that churches in France are being desecrated at the rate of two a day?  Is that good?  Who is doing that?  And if Notre Dame is rescued from the flames, only to be rebuilt at great expense, for what?  To be desecrated ultimately by being turned into a mosque?  The intermediate step will be desecration by turning it into a multi-faith, multi-culture center.  Well, it would have been better just to let it burn.  I'm Hengist Mountebank, and this has been an unpopular opinion.  And if your civilization is committing suicide, you might enjoy my book, A Little Life in You Yet, because France does have a little life in her yet, and she is worth saving and making great again.  But she's going to need a lot more French babies.  And your country, too, is worth saving and preserving and making great again.  And making babies, future generations of your own people, it's worth it.  You're worth it.  Infertility can be beaten at the personal and national and civilizational scale.  Thank you for watching.  Thank you. ",
