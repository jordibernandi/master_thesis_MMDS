            "text": "Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Oftentimes, it seems that consciously or unconsciously, a narrative is reinforced that the opioid crisis impacts only one type of community, that it's limited to people of a certain income, geography, race, culture, et cetera.  But the truth is that it impacts all of us.  In New York City, Bronx residents die of drug overdoses at a higher rate than any other borough.  And, you know, for this reason, I would like to submit to the record and I seek unanimous consent to submit to the record this New York Times article that displays the urgent need for Federal opioid response Without objection, so ordered.  in urban communities.  Thank you very much.  I am concerned that when it comes to truly prioritizing and solving the opioid crisis, the President is saying one thing but doing another.  Last month, President Trump declared a, quote, national emergency concerning the southern border of the United States under the National Emergencies Act.  And, you know, my colleagues wanted to talk about the southern border with relation to the opioid crisis, so let's talk about it.  Because even at the time that he declared this emergency, he said himself, quote, I didn't need to do this.  But he did.  And at the time the President declared this emergency, the White House issued a statement that, quote, he would be using his legal authority to take executive action to secure additional resources, and he has transferred millions of dollars even from FEMA to ICE.  The statement said that the administration had identified funding that could be transferred from other agencies as well.  This includes up to $2.5 billion that he's transferred from the Department of Defense and up to $3.6 billion reallocated from military construction projects.  So that's one national emergency he's identified.  But about a year and a half ago, the president issued a declaration indicating that opioids also constitute a public health emergency.  Director Carroll, to date, how much funding has the administration transferred from other agencies to address the opioid public health emergency? ",

But I do think that despite the fact that I disagree with how I mean, disagree is a mild term, but disagree with the President's course of action, I do think that we here in Congress have responsibility as well.  The Public Health Emergency Fund has only at most $57,000 in it.  and it has not been really funded congressionally in a long time.  So I think that that is an area where we can accept some personal responsibility.  But also it is hard to ignore the private sector's benefit from the opioid crisis.  Drugmakers have poured close to $2.5 billion into lobbying and funding members of Congress over the last decade.  Mr.  Carol, do you believe that private sector lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry could be playing a role in the opioid crisis? ",

You did mention the public health, and I wanted to just mention something that CDC has done that I think has been very helpful.  We've been working with the CDC and DEA to make sure that just like if there were an outbreak of a contagious disease, when there's an outbreak, of overdoses in one cluster area.  The HHS, through the CDC, is working on creating a hot team to deploy immediately to those areas.  And through the public health funds, that is one of the things that they are doing.  So I just wanted to mention CDC.  Sure thing.  If there is an outbreak in your district. ",
