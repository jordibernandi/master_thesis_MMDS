Numbers are reality, neither flat nor arbitrary nor imaginary nor irrational.  They are actually points or locations that fold out into a 3D shape defining space and time literally. ",

When you look at this symbol, you immediately see it's composed of two aspects.  One is this lazy eight, or the infinity symbol, And the other is the red pyramid at the top.  The infinity symbol is the equation for the physical world we live in.  It's a circuit or a pathway of motion.  Six numbers that form a hexagon.  Thus, such diverse phenomena as light polarizing, beehive, Saturn's north pole, and snowflakes are all versions of this hexagon.  These shapes form pathways for any matter in motion, which is never straight, but always at an angle.  Nothing in the physical world ever moves in a straight line, not a bullet shooting, not lightning coming down out of the sky.  Everything is a coil, even a photon coming from a distant star proving relativity exists.  Our body is called this mortal coil.  Our DNA is a coil, and it's no coincidence that it matches our equation perfectly.  I want you to keep in mind when you're watching this magnet spinning around, there's no energy going into this coil.  It's totally turned off.  And I'll continue.  Your blood cells are a torus.  DNA is a torus.  Magnetic fields, galaxies, all toruses.  That's why a tornado is more powerful than an atom bomb.  It's a one-way living systemic electrical machine, a self-sustaining jet.  You might say a flying saucer.  And with it, it's possible to create a localized space-time implosion, a controlled desktop black hole.  That magnet's still spinning.  There's no energy in the coil.  This is the final technology, the Philosopher's Stone, a reactionless drive unaffected by any weight that it carries.  It's a true model of an atom, and with it I have the key to the periodic table.  So simply put, this Taurus does it all.  It's a blueprint for a perfectly efficient magnetic field generating coil, a spaceship, a surgical tool, a supercomputer, and even a high fidelity speaker all in one.  Are such things possible?  Frankly?  Yes, they are.  And my team is ready to develop them at any time.  What you see here was just from the most primitive approximation of my work.  But the truth and reality of our project is it suffered from a tremendous lack of attention.  It has been peer reviewed by some of the best names in science.  But because of our unwillingness to sell it out for private interests, it remains in the hands of exhausted volunteers like myself. ",

Many of these patents deal with energy generation.  And there has been an abuse of the National Security Act that has permitted the seizure of these documents.  Now, this report by Stephen Aftergood should be headline news in all the world's media.  It has not been.  We have to ask the question, why?  Who is collaborating with this kind of secrecy?  that would leave us in a condition where the entire world is melting down with pollution and poverty and Mideast oil wars, one after another, when the solutions already exist but have been confiscated?

            "text": "But what's the connection between all these sciences?  And the answer is simple.  It's doubling.  When you follow what these numbers are doing, you get doubling.  And why might that be significant?  Well, our cells double to create us.  We have one cell, conceptions 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.  Musical scales are doubling.  The binary code for computers is doubling.  Nuclear reactions, squares and square roots, all doubling.  Doubling is motion at an angle, or what's called angular momentum.  It's the whirlwind and treadmill of creation.  It spins the atoms in our body, the Earth on its axis, the solar system, galaxy, the whole universe.  And so what causes this doubling?  What is it that's being transmitted and received?  And that's where that red pyramid comes in.  This pyramid is representative of what we call flux fields.  We have electricity.  at the center of electricity is magnetism.  At the center of magnetism is a flux.  It's a higher dimensional energy known by many names such as dark energy, tachyons, monopoles, gravitons.  We call it etheron energy.  It's the energy that's keeping us conscious and alive, and it's not a static or stationary energy.  It's a pulse.  It's a surge.  It's the beating heart of all existence.  It's the ultimate fundamental particle in the universe, and I know how to harness it. ",

            "text": "Now, in the early days, let's go back to the time of Tesla.  They were observing with usually DC power systems, direct current as opposed to alternating current, which we use in our homes, which Nikola Tesla invented or came up with.  that would have this effect where a certain amount of energy would go into a system, more would come out.  It wasn't really accepted until Dr.  Casimir, a physicist named Casimir, and the Casimir effect, where this was published in mainstream physics journals, by the way, proved that there was this zero-point energy field, that there was this energy that was left even after you cooled down all the atoms and all the activity in the universe down to absolute zero, which is a specific temperature.  And there's still this energy there.  And that zero-point energy field, as it turns out, is embedded everywhere in space.  Not outer space, here in this room.  So that every cubic centimeter of space in this room, for example, has enough power to run at least the United States for a day.  A cubic centimeter.  So it's an enormous field of energy.  So running our planet on this energy field would be like taking a thimble out of the Great Lakes or something of water.  It's a rounding error.  However, as JP Morgan famously was reported to have said to Nikola Tesla when he had a car that had a little antenna on it that was running around where the batteries were charging themselves, JP Morgan said, if we can't put a meter on it, we don't want it.  Big bankers.  Now, 100 years ago or 90 years ago, to today, nothing's really changed in terms of the geopolitical financial macroeconomic exigencies.  And that's the huge problem. ",

We're only rediscovering this energy grid, and it seems to be that these ancient cultures built all their sacred temples and sites on these nodal points of this energy, of this giant energy grid around the world.  And this is what you find with all the ancient sites, right?  And there's Adam's calendar, look, right there.  Bang!  And The Pyramid Right Above It.  So This Is Phenomenal Because Then You Find This Clay Tablet And This Is Real.  This Is Not Even A Sitchin Translation.  This Comes From The Shoin Collection In Oslo And It Says In Distant Days In Those Days After Destinies Had Been Decreed After An And Enlil Had Set Up The Regulations For Heaven And Earth Enki The Exalted Knowing God By The Rules For Heaven And Earth The Fixed Rules He Set Up Cities.  My God, what are they telling us here?  They knew that there was an energy grid that covered the earth and that this energy grid was somehow echoed in the sky.  The rules for heaven and earth.  This was mimicked in the sky.  And there's a lot more information I can share with you about... physical evidence that there is in fact this energy grid in the sky.  It is also now evident that the Anunnaki were the ones that put this energy grid in the sky.  Two days before I left to come here, I got a phone call from a guy that knows how to measure this stuff.  He has no idea that I'm talking about this.  Out of the blue he told me, You know what?  I started measuring these weird energy grids above the North Pole and above the South Pole.  They're about 20 by 20 kilometers.  And I found scattered fragments of it around the world.  It's like it's the remains of some ancient energy grid around the planet.  The rules, the fixed rules for heaven and earth.  And then suddenly I discovered that David Wilcox has been talking about these rules that are encoded in the emblems of the Air Force and the Army and whatever.  in the military and they refer to these bands around the earth as the rules.  They don't know where they come from, but they've always been there.  Well, guess what?  The Sumerian tablets just tell us where they come from and who put them in place. ",
