            "text": "In the Flat Earth community, a popular experiment is to shine a laser from a low height across a body of water, and see if that laser is visible on the other side.  This seems like a reasonable test.  If you put the laser and the camera both at three feet above the water, and they are, say, six miles apart, then the laser should be hidden behind several feet of the curve of the Earth.  And yet, there are all these videos showing people doing this test, sometimes over much longer distances, and sometimes with the laser and the camera even closer to the water.  And yet in all these videos, you can see the laser.  So what does this mean?  Is the Earth flat?  No, of course not.  The laser is simply bending around the curve of the Earth due to refraction.  We've all seen refraction.  It's the bending of light towards more dense air.  Generally this goes one of two ways.  There's bending upwards if there's some low warmer air like a hot road or water that's warmer than the air.  or it will be bending downwards, which is what happens normally as lower air is generally denser than higher air.  This downwards bending is amplified if the lower air is cooler, like if the water is cooler than the air, which is normally the case during the day and in the evening.  In this case, with light bending down towards cooler, denser air, the refraction can bend the light around the curve, and so you can see the light from a laser that would normally be hidden.  But if we've got these two cases, light bending up and light bending down, then why do the tests always show the laser visible?  Well, they actually don't.  If you follow these tests, you'll see people are constantly unable to spot the laser, which they quite correctly blame on the weather.  For example, there's a recent test in Brighton where the light was bending upwards, but they could not see the laser.  Now we've got another test asking, can the intense source of a laser one meter above the water be recorded 9.5 kilometers away by a camera one meter above the water level?  And the answer is yes, of course it can.  Why are you even doing this experiment?  Don't you watch YouTube?  We've seen time and again that lasers are often visible over water when geometrically they should be hidden behind the curve.  So there should be no surprise.  What's actually going on when you see a laser when you think you shouldn't?  Well there's two things to consider, refraction and beam divergence.  I wrote a refraction simulator and the refraction simulator basically does what it says, it simulates refraction.  We have a picture and we have a temperature profile and then we simulate where all the beams of light go and this shows us the resultant image.  and you can move the temperature profile around, and you can make it colder or warmer, and you can see what effect that has.  I have a setup for the Bedford level, which is the site of the experiment I just referenced, and I can load that here, Bedford level boat.  This is a bridge which is six miles away.  There's a guy in a boat.  He's about four miles away.  I'm actually gonna move him.  I'm gonna select him here, man in boat.  I'm gonna move him out so he's also at six miles.  So he's just about where the bridge is.  Okay, so you can see he's being squished there, but you can still see him.  Now, the viewer here is only 4 feet above the water, so really you shouldn't be able to see him.  In fact, if we turn off refraction, you'll see that he is in fact down below the horizon.  We can move him around, move him back here, and you can see he's actually there, moving back out to 6 feet.  I'll just put that in exactly 6 miles away.  And we can raise the viewer height so you can see what's going on.  We can go higher so we can actually see the guy down by the bridge over there.  But let's move him back down.  one meter that's about three feet.  so let's go down to about three feet and recently I added lasers to the mix turning refraction back on here and I can switch these on down here.  by default it will set a laser at the camera.  so here's where the camera is here's where the bridge is.  the laser is at four feet here, the camera's at three feet, we can move the laser, I don't know, the laser's at five feet, we can move the laser down, we can move it up, but this is kind of boring, because we're just shining towards the guy in the boat, let's flip the laser direction, which will put the laser, woo, put the laser at the bridge, or the guy at the boat here, makes it at the furthest object, I'm gonna reduce the power of this laser, It's a bit too bright and you can see here's the laser in the boat.  It's at 1.7 feet.  I'll make that three feet.  so it's same as in the experiment.  So we've got a laser six miles away.  We have the viewer the camera at three feet We have the laser at three feet and they're quite visible.  So why is this?  this thick green line here is the line of the laser and which, you know, you see, you're looking at it here it looks like it's actually going too high, you wouldn't be able to see it.  and what's actually happening though is the laser spreads out.  it spreads out by one milliradiant which is a thousandth of a radiant which is just a small fraction of a degree which isn't really very very much.  it kind of looks like a lot here in this side view but that's because this side view is very very compressed horizontally or stretched vertically depending on which way you think of it.  and if I turn on the zoom and if I set the zoom factor to one which means this is the actual size you'll see things look very very very flat.  The Earth of course doesn't curve very much because it's so big, so over six miles there's hardly any curve.  It looks pretty much flat.  We can zoom in to reveal the curve and we can see.  this is the spread of the laser beam.  if I change the angle of the laser you'll see the green lines in the middle and there's two green lines, one on either side.  this is showing the divergence of the laser and as I said it's been magnified because we were magnifying the curve.  so we can see what's going on.  so if I go back down to one it would actually look like that which you know it looks like a straight line but it's actually diverging very very slightly anyway.  so this laser beam starts over here and it goes in this direction and the bottom of it spreads to here and the top spreads to here.  so if it's angled down a little bit so it's down more like it was before.  the top of the laser beam could be going way over the camera but the bottom of the laser beam is just touching.  the camera just managed to make it around the curve of the earth and you can see down here.  you can just see that beam start to come in.  So the divergence of a laser beam actually has quite a significant effect in that it makes it very, very easy to see the beam no matter what direction you're pointing it in, like up or down, because there's always going to be some light path which goes just over the curve of the Earth.  let me just get rid of this real quick.  just move it over here and I'll move this into a so you can see it a little bit better and I'm going to zoom in a bit more.  So here's the camera and here's where the laser is.  Both of them are three feet above the ground.  And even though the laser beam is shining up like this, there's still a light path which goes from the laser to the camera.  And you can actually see that by moving this around here until we get to the laser.  So this yellow line here is a path that the laser takes.  Now, if we zoom down a little bit more, if we tilt down a little bit more, you'll see the laser will actually get brighter as the center of the beam goes closer and closer.  Now, why is it reflecting around?  Well, it's because the water is cooler.  And I've got this little graph here which shows this very, very slight cool water, then slightly warmer air, and then just moving.  This is hardly anything.  This is about a tenth of a degree.  It really, really does not take very much at all to get the actual results that we're looking for here.  Now, of course, if the air was even warmer, then you get even more refraction because it's more visible.  But if the air is just a little bit cooler than the water, the water is warmer, then we don't see the laser.  So very, very small variations can have quite a big effect.  We can see the laser here.  Move this over here.  You can't see it.  You can see it.  You can't see it.  And this, I'm just moving basically about a tenth of a degree either way.  And it's only in the bottom 10 feet or so.  And it could be even less.  I can focus down on the bottom one or two feet.  And just very, very small, very, very small adjustments in the temperature.  So because you don't actually know the temperature all the way along this path, all the way along this six mile path, it's actually quite difficult to figure out what's actually going on and actually what you see in terms of what.  the refraction is a better indication of what the temperature is along that path than the actual measurements you would make, say, at the start and the end of that path.  You see here I put the laser in the boat and the reason I've got this boat here is that the original Rowbotham experiment back in the 1800s didn't have lasers.  back then of course, they just had guys in boats.  So what they did is they got a guy in a boat and he He started out here, and he just rode his boat all the way over to the bridge, and they looked at him from a telescope set three feet, it might have been two feet above the waterline, and they found that they could actually see him the whole way, and this was because, of course, of refraction.  It's exactly the same thing here, a very slight difference in slightly cooler water, or much cooler water in some cases, lets you see around the curve of the Earth because it's bending the light down.  So that wasn't a very good experiment back in the 1800s and the laser experiment right next to the water is not a very good experiment either.  So what should you do instead?  Well, you should use bigger things and you should use higher viewpoints.  Get away from the random deviations of the laser being a few feet either way above the surface of the water, just grazing the horizon, and try to look at the bigger picture.  Use mountains and use tall buildings.  For example, can you see all of Catalina Island from Santa Monica?  No you can't.  Can you see all of San Jaquino mountain from Malibu?  No you can't.  Can you see all of Toronto from across the lake?  No you can't.  Can you see the curve of the Earth from a plane from 35,000 or 40,000 feet?  Yes you can.  So these laser tests are fun and interesting demonstrations of refraction, but they're very misleading if you pretend refraction isn't happening.  To get the real big picture, you have to rise above refraction. ",
