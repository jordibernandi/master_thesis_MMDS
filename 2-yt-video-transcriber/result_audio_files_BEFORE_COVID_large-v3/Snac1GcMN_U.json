            "text": "At Answers in Genesis, we like to use the seven C's to summarize biblical history and present the gospel in the context of all the biblical history.  I see that at the Creation Museum in our literature, curriculum, books, and DVDs, we also have it in different tools that you can use to share that truth, that history, and the gospel.  One of the engaging tools we use to do that is this cube that'll walk you through the seven C's.  And as you walk through the seven C's, you can teach about the Bible.  Then we do some apologetics and then maybe present the gospel, depending on who you're talking to.  Actually, that's the primary goal.  This is a type of thing you'd have sitting on your desk at work, maybe.  Keep it in your book bag as you're traveling around.  Share it with people.  Keep it at home on the table for the kids or family members to see and to talk about what it's all about and to walk them through biblical history and to share the gospel.  So I'll walk you through it very quickly to show you an effective, engaging way to share the truth of God's word from beginning to end and the gospel summarized in biblical history.  The first thing we have is creation.  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and it was a perfect creation.  Originally, it was perfect in that there was no death, no suffering, no blessing, no disease.  God gave us what he wanted for us, which was perfection.  But of course, God warned Adam, our representative, the first man, that if you sin, death will be the consequence.  And that leads us to the second C, which is... Corruption.  Man's sin bringing death and suffering into this world.  And guys, that sin changed everything.  It broke the whole of creation.  Romans 8, 22 says that the whole of creation groans in pain because of man's sin.  And this second seed, the corruption, it explains why we see death and suffering, bloodshed, cancer, and brokenness in this world.  And really, these first two seeds explain the paradox we view in life of love and hate in this world.  joy and sadness, life and death.  The beauty and the good things we see, those are remnants of the original perfect creation.  The brokenness, the death, the bloodshed and the cancer and so forth, that's the ugly reality of man's sin.  So this history explains really one of the fundamental answers to questions I think most humans have at some point in their life.  Why is there death and suffering and life and joy and so forth?  And then from the corruption, we had there actually in that event the first presentation of the gospel in a sense.  It's a looking forward to the coming Messiah.  After man's sin and God comes and confronts them with their sin and starts giving out the consequences for that, God tells the serpent, there'll be enmity, there'll be strife between your seed and the woman's seed.  That you will strike the seed of the woman's heel, but he will crush your head.  And that is the first looking forward to the coming Messiah who will defeat the enemy and defeat sin and death through what he'll do in his life and his death and resurrection.  We'll get to that here in a bit.  But from the corruption, that takes us to the next C, which is catastrophe.  In this event of the catastrophe, we have a global judgment on man's sin.  You see, sin has so permeated mankind that it says that man's inclinations were only evil all the time.  And God sends a righteous, holy judgment of that sin.  But there was one man who found favor in God's eyes, and that man was Noah.  And God has Noah build an ark of salvation for him and his family.  And really, that whole event of God's judgment and the ark of salvation is a picture of Jesus Christ.  You see, at this time, there was a global judgment with one way to be saved, through the door of the ark.  And that's a picture of Jesus, because there's another global judgment coming later on by fire, and there's one way to be saved.  Jesus said, I am the door.  If by me any man enter in, he shall be saved.  Jesus said, I'm the way, the truth, and the life.  No man gets to the Father but by me.  Again, this is pointing to the focus of all of history, which is Christ.  And then from catastrophe, that leads us to confusion.  Now, this event is important for numerous reasons.  This event is where, after the flood, God had told Noah and his sons to repopulate and refill the earth, to spread out and fill the earth.  But we see man's sinfulness pop up on the scene pretty quickly.  Instead of spreading out, filling the earth, they rebelled against God's command.  They stayed together.  They built a tower to make a name for themselves.  And God comes and judges their sin, and He spreads out humanity, and He gives them different languages and spreads them out all over the world.  And that event tells us a couple things.  Number one, it shows us how we get distinct people groups today.  By splitting up the human gene pool to isolated genetic pools in different places, different traits become dominant in different populations and take over those populations over time.  Also, it explains the different cultures that develop in those different places.  What the history does show us ultimately is that all people can trace their family tree back to Noah and his sons.  Before that, every person who's ever lived can trace their family tree back to one man, one woman, Adam and Eve.  That means, biblically speaking, there is only one race that's supported by real science.  We all descend from Adam.  And by the way, that's also why we are all sinners in need of a savior called the last Adam, Jesus Christ.  And that leads us to the next C. And that C will be Christ.  Now, how you make this transition can be a little bit up to you.  There's a lot of history to try to summarize in there.  Probably being concise is the best bet.  What I like to do is to say, after the confusion in the Tower of Babel, when the people were split to different groups, God called on one of those groups, one person in particular, Abraham.  He tells Abraham to follow him, that he'll make Abraham a great nation.  And essentially, he promises Abraham, the Messiah will come from your line, from the nation I bring about from your descendants.  And so we use that transition to go from Abraham, the promised nation, the Messiah that comes from that nation, to in the fullness of time, Christ is born.  Because the entire Old Testament is pointing to this event.  And so, at this time, God becomes flesh.  And this is fulfilling numerous prophecies throughout the Old Testament that point to Christ.  And Christ lives a perfect life, which we could never do.  You see, to pay the sin debt, it had to be a human who paid the debt.  But the debt had to be a perfect, infinite payment.  But we can't be perfect nor infinite.  And that's why we needed God to do for us what we could not do.  God puts on flesh, lives a perfect life, and then He dies on the cross.  When Jesus died on the cross, he paid the debt we could not pay, that perfect sacrifice, the infinite debt we could not pay on our own.  He took God's wrath on our behalf, and then he died and rose from the grave, defeating death.  Those who have put their faith in him, repent of their sins, have their sin debt paid for by what he did on the cross, and we get credited to us his righteousness.  What a great exchange.  We see all that happened at the cross, death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.  And then that's not the last one.  The last C will be consummation.  One day, Christ is coming back again.  And He will return the world back to a perfect state with a new heavens and a new earth.  No death, no suffering, no bloodshed, no disease.  It will be perfection.  We will live with our Creator God and exist with Him and glorify Him and worship Him in perfection and existence we can't fully fathom.  But also with that coming consummation, when Christ returns, there is the final judgment to come.  And bottom line, every person who's ever lived spends eternity somewhere.  And there are only two choices, heaven or hell.  And there's only one way to get to heaven, through the perfect, infinite sacrifice Christ paid for us on the cross.  He defeated death, rising from the grave.  If you repent of your sin, turn away from your sin, put your faith in Him alone, then you'll be saved for now and for the coming judgment.  That's how we can use the seven C's cube to give a good summary of biblical history, also where history is going in the coming consummation, and to present the gospel in the context of biblical history.  Hopefully this video is encouraging to you, it's equipping, and that this can be a really good tool that you can use to teach the truth of God's word from the beginning and to share the gospel effectively.
