Africa never invade another country.  That was done by... No nuclear bombs?  Yeah, that was done by UK.  UK got more blood on their hands than any other country in the world.  No factories or armaments?  So, at the end of the day, Africa is peaceful people.  You know?  I want to notice that people sit together and they eat together.
