            "text": "Hello there, I'm a news reader reading the news and here is some of that news.  A lot of states are banning abortion before women even know they're pregnant.  Maybe even more states by the time this video comes out.  And we'll be talking about that at a later date because it's very important.  But right now, we're gonna talk about something that's also important that people don't talk about nearly enough.  Because here's some more news.  Sex.  Wait, people talk about that all the time.  Trafficking.  Sex trafficking.  It's bad, and also stopping sex trafficking would be a good thing to do.  These are all pretty non-controversial thoughts.  I'm saying because I didn't include the apparently controversial statement that sex work is fine and protecting sex workers is good.  And yet, if you recall, the government's attempt to curb sex trafficking in the form of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, aka FOSTA and SESTA, pissed a lot of people off last year.  But despite this, it was indeed made into law, as signed by our commander and totally never contributed to sex trafficking or abused his power to victimize women in chief, Donald Trump.  And after that, no one really talked about it.  Even though a lot of people said the bill was rushed and had a lot of bad consequences, we all just sort of moved on.  And wouldn't you know it, now we're getting stories not only about sex work becoming more dangerous.  in the year since SESTA-FOSTA was passed, Police recorded a 170% jump in reports of human trafficking in San Francisco last year, but we're learning that that huge spike appears to be connected to the federal shutdown of sex-for-sale websites.  The goal of this law was to curb human trafficking, but it seems to be having the opposite effect.  It's as if the thing happened that those people said would happen.  The law made things worse, you guys.  It's an ineffective, harmful, and trashy law.  If the law was a movie, it would be a 2007 shock comedy starring Dane Cook and Hitler.  And if you're not exactly sure why it's so damn bad, well, it's a darn good thing you're watching, because I'm gonna totally explain that.  When, you ask, feverishly?  Right now, is the answer.  With a segment that I fracking love to call, Hey, uh, this is broken.  So, the main point of this bill was to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, something that makes online services immune from liability for the actions of their users.  The amendment would make Section 230 not apply in cases of sex trafficking.  So if a website like Craigslist, for example, is found running classifieds that turn out to be part of a sex trafficking ring, they could be held accountable for this.  So why is a seemingly helpful measure aimed at stopping sex traffickers actually a bad thing?  It probably has something to do with these bills being... bad.  And... Wrong.  And also very bad.  Not just for one reason, but a whole bouquet of them.  Like a potpourri centerpiece made up of cigarette butts and animal teeth.  It's actually impressive how grotesquely opposite these bills are from their intent.  See, many of these websites help keep sex workers safe by allowing some transparency and agency and building safe communities.  More on that later, but also, SESTA and FOSTA actually make it harder to prosecute sex traffickers.  This is according to a fringe advocacy group known as the United States Department of Justice, who sent a letter to Congress explaining that wording in the law would create a more specific burden of proof and will therefore limit their ability to go after these criminals.  This, of course, didn't stop them from pushing it through.  They also go on to note that, quote, it would extend to situations where there is a minimal federal interest, such as commercial sexual interactions between consenting adults, something we will get to in a moment.  So, due to the broad reach of this new bill, websites are simply shutting down all of their classified sections.  This is hitting niche sites the hardest, where they have less legal resources to comply with the new standards.  Now, to be fair, And hey, balanced.  This isn't always a bad thing, as the classified website Backpage was found to have deliberately covered up ads run by child sex traffickers, and was rightfully body slammed by the beefy grasp of the law.  But the feds didn't need SESTA, FOSTA, to take down Backpage for that, and in fact did that before it was signed into law.  In fact, had SESTA-FOSTA already existed, there's a good chance the back page would have still existed as a non-digital, harder-to-notice entity, and the CEO would have never been caught.  Are you seeing the problem yet?  As a New York Times interview with a sergeant in the San Jose Human Trafficking Unit highlights, eliminating the digital marketplace for sex trafficking forces criminals and victims back on the streets.  which is a way harder place for police to keep tabs.  In other words, closing down these websites doesn't solve the problem so much as it moves it back into the harder to reach nooks of society.  Meanwhile, the law also caused every classified website to preemptively shut down due to potential liability, websites that could have been used to track and identify child trafficking.  So, on a purely logistical level, SESTA-FOSTA does the opposite of what lawmakers want it to do.  It makes child traffickers harder to find and then harder to prosecute once they're caught.  And it's existed for a year now, causing measurable problems.  This alone should be enough to repeal this law.  But, But let's say you also give a about the well-being of sex workers in general, something I highly recommend you give a go.  Seriously, try it sometime.  It's wonderful.  Well, it turns out that this SESTA-FOSTA bill also makes consensual sex work between adults a waking hell.  Because remember when I just said that classified websites are shutting down and sending sex trafficking back on the streets?  Well, that's also the case for any kind of sex work.  And if you know anything about anything, you might suspect that doing sex jobs can be extremely dangerous in certain conditions, specifically when the sex worker doesn't have access to a community or the ability to screen clients or work indoors and near others for support.  These are all things that were traditionally a big problem, often forcing people to work for pimps or escort services that varied in quality.  The internet, however, gave sex workers the ability to not only become self-sufficient, but form a community where abusive clients could be flagged and avoided.  With such a digital database, a person like Patrick Bateman, for example, wouldn't be able to lure women into his house to listen to ironically themed pop songs.  This baseline level of safety is what SESTA-FOSTA has now taken away from sex workers.  It's made their occupation more dangerous, especially if they're a member of a more marginalized community, such as transgender workers.  So again, and I can't stress this enough, this new sex trafficking law that's been in effect for a year now not only fails to stop trafficking, but makes it harder to stop while also shitting on an entirely separate group of people who already have a tough job.  It's a colossal boner, but not the good kind.  So, hey, uh, this is broken, you guys.  Specifically, the way we're approaching the sex work industry as it relates to sex trafficking is extremely broken.  Like, no matter which view or bias you're coming at this with, it's objectively not working.  So how do we fix it?  Where do we start?  Well, besides repealing SESTA-FOSTA, one step would probably be to figure out how much of a problem trafficking actually is.  Because currently our statistics are strangely wrong and outdated.  For example, the extremely common statistic that 300,000 children in America are victims of sex trafficking each year, something quoted by news outlets like CNN, Time, as well as many politicians, is super wrong.  Those numbers came from a combination of data from the 90s mixed with literal guessing from the researchers involved.  This was even confirmed by the Justice Department, who sponsored a 2013 report saying, The current best estimate we do have brings the number down to about 30,000, which, to be clear, is still too many children!  Like, we don't need to inflate the numbers in order to make this a problem.  There's no number that makes child sex slavery not tragic and terrible.  But it's insane how little we seem to actually know compared to how many fake statistics are being thrown around.  During a hearing concerning Craigslist classified ads, one study was cited saying that online child trafficking had risen by as much as 64% in some states.  That study was also based on guessing to the point that even the group that conducted the study said it was dubious.  Another popular statistic is that most prostitutes start at the age of 13, a number that's based off interviews with only 200 people found by organizations that specifically deal with victims of sexual abuse.  And that last study is very telling, because it gets us to the second thing we need to fix.  Too often does our society intermingle the concepts of sex trafficking or sexual abuse with the entire industry of sex work.  And by compartmentalizing the two into one lump group, we're not only hurting consenting sex workers, but making it impossible to work with people in their industry.  to catch the actual criminals.  Like, imagine if a plumber killed your family, and you swore to seek revenge.  but also decided that every plumber was evil and tried to arrest every plumber you saw, not only is that unfair to all the plumbers, but you would also have no plumbers with access to the coveted plumber industry to help you on your plumber hunt, leaving you ineffective and completely full of shit.  Because of the lack of plumbers.  It's a plumber joke.  Somewhere, we got it in our heads that if a person is willingly selling their bodies for sexual purposes, that person is exclusively troubled in some way.  They're either a criminal or a victim, and are often treated like both by law enforcement.  It creates a baffling situation where consenting sex workers are treated like victims in some cases, while actual victims are treated like villains in other cases.  In Sweden, a totally consenting sex worker lost custody of her children because her occupation was considered self-harm.  The kids were then given to their father, a man who ended up stabbing the woman to death when she visited them.  In the States, there was a recent case of 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown, an actual victim of child sex trafficking, who resorted to killing the man who bought her for sex, stealing money to give to her pimp, and was subsequently thrown in jail for 15 years before someone realized that, hey, Maybe this is really up.  These stories, while seemingly different, are symptomatic of a society that doesn't have any idea how to tell the difference between consensual sex work or sex trafficking, and doesn't seem to care to tell the difference.  It's no wonder that victims might not see the authorities as a viable place to turn.  And so the more we lump all sex workers into this dark corner, the more we smush the consensual sex acts with abuses like child trafficking, the more we use phrases like teen prostitute to identify victims, then the less we're actually solving the problem we're claiming to be concerned about.  It comes down to this.  If we wanna help victims of sex trafficking, we first have to also accept that there are a lot of people out there who would just rather fuck for money than wash dishes or, I don't know, We're on a YouTube channel.  It's a rough occupation, not unlike working at a factory or being a soldier.  Other things we definitely don't want kids to do.  But we also don't lump all soldiers with child soldiers.  We don't lump all factory workers with child labor.  This is where we get to the often seen and very important phrase, sex work is work.  It might sound like an empty slogan, but recognizing sex work as just another boring ass job is an important step not only to destigmatize sex workers, but actually help stop sex trafficking and slavery.  Because if we actually decriminalize sex work and treat it like an occupation, that means regulating it.  It means making sure the workers are well paid and safe and have all the benefits they deserve.  It makes sure that no one is doing it out of sheer desperation or force.  And by doing that, it gives the people who are being trafficked for sex a safe and legal way out.  It gives people who witness child prostitution or illegal activities a way to report it without fear of arrest.  People might be against this because it means opening the door to sex work as an acceptable occupation, but the door goes both ways, if you know what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is that this would ensure that no one is stuck on the wrong side of the figurative legal door, if you catch my drift.  My drift being that making sex work legal would create a safe means for people to leave the occupation if they so wish.  And hey, If you're truly worried about the idea of people resorting to prostitution in order to pay bills, well then maybe you should look into policy that would help the impoverished instead of punishing people with fewer options than others, you clay-hearted ghoul!  Keeping sex work illegal isn't helping anyone!  But you don't have to take my word for it, because this is also the conclusion of Amnesty International, who published a policy on protecting sex workers, which starts with decriminalizing the occupation in order to ensure that no one is exploited or coerced.  In countries where sex work has been decriminalized, there's been no reported increase of sex trafficking, and even a little evidence of a reduction.  So what's stopping us?  Why are politicians so slow to talk about this issue?  How come?  when SESTA was passed last year, every 2020 Democratic nominee voted in favor of it despite it being terrible?  All of them.  Even the nominees who are coming out in support of decriminalizing sex work still have a long history of not giving two shakes of a rat's dick.  So at least they are starting to support it, but they don't really want to.  Nobody wants to talk about sex work or come out in defense of it.  So we have to make sure they do.  Hopefully candidates like Mike Gravel will bring it up on the debate stage, forcing the candidates to debate it and take a stance.  The idea of decriminalizing the occupation is at least becoming popular enough to say aloud.  At least it is becoming a talking point for the next election, maybe.  And we'll hopefully keep going in that direction until we're actually willing to do something.  something that's, I don't know, meaningful about this instead of rushing some half-assed bill into law.  And speaking of the president, there are sex work activists like Stormy Daniels who are now on our radar.  The taboo is going away and we're seeing some progress because if the POTUS can get pissed on for cash, allegedly, not proven, then really anyone can and should.  So thank you, Mr.  President, for being pissed on for cash, allegedly, maybe.  Who knows?  So there's hope.  But there will also be a huge pushback, or at the very least, politicians trying their hardest to ignore the problem.  No one in power is really talking about repealing SESTA-FOSTA.  And while maybe it's on a subconscious level, I think a lot of people in the government would rather keep things the way they are now, even if it's hurting a lot of innocent people.  Why?  Well, because by decriminalizing something like sex work, you'd also be decriminalizing a very lucrative industry for people who have normally been marginalized in our culture.  People we were happy to hand wave as criminals in our pop culture and casual conversations, and therefore justify any terrible shit that happened to them.  I think there are a lot of powerful people afraid of, like, LGBTQ folks and single working women getting that same power as them.  Because if the sex work industry becomes even a little mainstream, that is a huge industry.  So, no.  There are going to be people who will not want that.  Because if we legalize sex work, it would almost be like the country is changing into a more sex-positive place designed to actually help those who might be exploited or ridiculed under the shroud of taboo.  And that would be very scary for the people happy to exploit and ridicule.  Also... Sex is great.  Everyone you know is doing it.  Including your parents, who are... into all sorts of freaky stuff and probably having a dripping thrust sesh right now.  If you're of teenage, they might even be doing it in the other room.  So there's some news for ya.  Soak in that for a while is what your father just said to your mother in the other room.  He was talking about his cunt. ",
