I've had a chance to talk to a number of circular seers in regards to their wife and the challenges they face being a wife of a circular seer.  And unfortunately, it often becomes very depressing.  And the reason why is very simple.  They have to listen to the same talk for six months, same jokes, everything.  They don't have any home many times.  I remember a circumstance telling me once that the biggest challenge his wife has is when they would go stay with friends who had children or who had a home.  their wife would often become somewhat depressed because she does not have it.  He said, my wife doesn't even have a little flower garden she can plant.  And so this particular brother was at Bethel.  And he says he was so glad that when they got to Bethel, his wife could have a permanent room.  Because it's traveling overseas, man, you know, some nights, some weeks, you know, you have friends who got soft bed, friends who got hard bed, dog come in the bedroom with your kids coming in, looking through the door and stuff.  And so they give up all their privacy.  And it's very interesting because these are some of the most diehard people in the organization.  They've given up kids.  They've given up a lot of things.  Over the years, though, the attitude, unfortunately, has changed somewhat.  Years ago, they used to allow the circuit overseers to have a trailer.  They could pull it behind their car, and that gave the wives some type of permanency.  I was at Bethel with a guy.  When he got accepted to Bethel, him, his father, and mother, they all were regular pioneers.  When he got to Bethel, the society, within less than like a month or so, they invited his parents to go and do the traveling work.  So they had a trip, like a little Winnebago.  They would pull behind their car.  And they had it for probably about a year or so.  And then they got a letter from the society saying, no more.  You're going to go back to staying with your friends in their homes.  And so for circuit overseers who didn't have a circuit overseer apartment, because every congregation around the world doesn't have a circuit overseer apartment.  Some do, but a lot of them don't.  And so they got thrown back into the homes of friends.  And once again, it creates a challenge for a lot of the circuit overseers. ",

The problem is the elders wait until the last minute because the service is coming.  He's going to ask, did y'all visit all the disfellowshipped people?

And so after he checks the fields service time and the financials, many times he will use that to formulate what he will be speaking about the week that he's there.  And they have what's called a local needs part where he will basically talk about the local needs of the congregation.  And then it will expand when they go to the circuit assembly where they'll talk about the local needs of the circuit.  And so once again, you see literally management in place.
