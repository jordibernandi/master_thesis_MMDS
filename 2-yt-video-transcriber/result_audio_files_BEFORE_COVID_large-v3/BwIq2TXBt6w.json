            "text": "Thank you.  Shalom.  This week, with the conclusion of the festival of Sukkot and the completion of the reading of the book of Devarim, Deuteronomy on Simchat Torah, this Shabbat we begin anew the yearly cycle of weekly Torah readings from the beginning once again.  This week's Torah portion is Bereshit in the beginning, the first Torah portion, first parasha in Sefer Bereshit, the book of Genesis.  And so it begins.  Just as we now begin a new year, just as we've been renewed and we've been given an opportunity, hopefully, following our heartfelt and sincere repentance, an opportunity has been given us to be recreated as new beings, beginning the year with a fresh start, so too, all of creation is now brought into existence, from nothing.  Parashat Bereshit, it's our chance to forget about everything we thought we knew and start again.  This is the time to look for Hashem in the world, and also the time for each one of us to ask, where in the world am I?  Where in the world am I?  What in the world am I doing?  in the world?  I see skies of blue, clouds of white, bright blessed day, dark sacred night, and I think to myself, what a wonderful world.  What is my part in the creation of this wonderful world?  In verse 5 of chapter 2 we read, All the trees of the field were not yet on the earth, and all the herb of the field had not yet sprouted.  For Hashem had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the soil.  What is the connection between rain, Hashem not having yet sent rain, and a man to work the soil, for all of these to be mentioned together in this verse?  Rashi teaches us that while everything else in creation had already been completed by the sixth day before the creation of man, nothing had blossomed forth yet, nothing had sprouted, all the trees and plants and herbs stood at the edge of the soil, just below the surface, until that Friday, because it had not yet rained.  And why had it not yet rained?  Because there was no man to work the soil.  There was no one to appreciate rain, to appreciate its benefits to the earth.  But when man came and understood the world's needs, he prayed for rain, and the rains came, and all the trees and plants burst into blossom.  Man made sure the world's needs were met.  That's part of man's job.  In a manner of speaking, G-d created an incomplete world.  Everything needs to be completed, the ultimate tikkun, rectification, fixing, of every aspect of creation is facilitated by man, and thus he is a full partner in creation.  This is the meaning of the words of the verse of chapter 2 and verse 3, God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on it He abstained from all His work which God created to make.  This is an unusual expression, which He created to make.  He created it to make?  What does that mean?  Hashem created everything in this world in order for a person to make them, to finish them.  Man has to plow and plant, fashion vessels and tools and clothing, he has to knead and bake and cook.  Why?  Why isn't everything prepackaged and ready made?  Why did Adam have to pray for rain?  Hashem designed the world for man to understand and acknowledge that everything was created for His sake, so that He, man, will sanctify Hashem's name through the things of this world, through every aspect of this world, through every aspect of creation.  That's the real fixing and completing of creation, and that's the real purpose of creation.  Everything is just a little underdone, so that man will come and finish it.  For Himself, G-d didn't need to create this world.  It was only for the benefit of man, so that we would know who G-d is.  So therefore, open up your hearts in the deepest way.  Without man in this world, without someone recognizing the G-d in it all, the earth has no real purpose, and remains incomplete.  Man is singular in all of creation in that man alone possesses the power, the ability to bring it all to fruition, to bring it all together, by acknowledging and thanking Hashem.  So why did Hashem create the world?  All for the benefit of man.  After creating everything in this amazing, beautiful, unique world, after creating all the physical creatures from the earth, G-d created man too from the earth, his body from the earth, but breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.  and endowed him with understanding and with speech.  He placed man in a garden, and he would be the gardener.  As we learn in the Mishnah in Tractate Sanhedrin, a person is obligated to say, the world was created for me, meaning on my account.  In other words, I am the gardener.  I have to assume responsibility.  I have to take care of this world and see to it that its needs are met.  So man's role in creation and in the upkeep of the world is not just important, he is the very reason for creation, yet he was last to be created.  On the one hand you could look at it this way.  G-d prepared everything in advance for man, a perfect world, laid it all out like a feast before him.  On the other hand, our sages relate, it can also be said that G-d created man last of all so that if he becomes arrogant and conceited about his importance, the order of creation should remind him that even the mosquito preceded him.  And there really is no contradiction.  Hashem prepared all of creation to receive Him, that all should be ready, man should be aware that he has the potential to reach great heights.  And it was for His sake that all was brought forth, and if He does His part in the upkeep of the world, He is even more important than the angels.  But that's only when He does His part.  If he becomes arrogant and forgets Hashem, then he can view the mosquito which preceded him in creation as his superior.  By the end of the parasha, everything has gone south.  What a disappointment.  Humanity forgot Hashem altogether, and the world became totally, incorrigibly corrupted.  Creation was veritably polluted by man's evil.  In chapter 6 we learn, Hashem saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every product of the thoughts of his heart was but evil always.  Hashem regretted having made man on earth, and He had heartfelt sadness.  Of course G-d's decision was not to destroy the world and man altogether, but to restart.  So when Hashem saw the wickedness of man, was He surprised?  Did He not see that coming?  And can Hashem indeed have heartfelt sadness?  He is not a man who feels sadness.  And for that matter, what does it mean that He regretted having created man?  Rashi teaches us that this regret means that G-d mourned over the destruction of His handiwork.  And then, citing from Midrash Rabbah, Rashi adds, This I wrote to refute the heretics.  A heretic asked Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha, Do you not believe that the Holy One, blessed be He, foresees the future?  Rabbi Joshua replied to him, Yes, of course I believe that.  The heretic retorted, But it is written, And he had heartfelt sadness.  Rabbi Dashua replied, Was a son ever born to you?  Yes, the heretic replied.  And what did you do?  he asked.  He replied, I celebrated, I rejoiced, and made everyone rejoice.  But, said the rabbi, did you not know that he was destined to die?  The heretic replied, at the time of joy, joy, at the time of mourning, mourning.  Rabbi Yahshua said to him, so it is with the work of the Holy One, blessed be He.  Even though it was revealed before Him that they would ultimately sin, and He would destroy them, He did not refrain from creating them for the sake of the righteous men who were destined to arise from them.  In other words, Hashem took His chances looking forward to the righteous who would perform good deeds, however far and few between them they may be, so He created the world for the sake of man, but more specifically for the sake of the righteous, which we are all called upon to be.  As I like to say, we are called upon, and this is our most sacred task, to validate creation.  Several times in recent lessons I've mentioned the concept of the fallen angels.  In chapter 6 verse 4 we read the Nephilim who were on the earth in those days.  A couple of weeks ago in our message for Yom Kippur I mentioned that the root of all the mistakes we make is that we don't believe enough in ourselves, in our right to be here.  We are not so sure we belong in this world.  Our sages teach that when G-d created the world there was an opinion expressed by some angels that it's not a good idea to create man, that he'll only be a disappointment, as indeed he was by the end of parashat B'reishit, and he would never live up to his potential, that he won't be able to get it right.  It's a complicated story on many, many levels of meaning, but to make a long story short, G-d kicked these angels out, they are the nephilim, the fallen angels.  G-d didn't listen to their opinion, continues the teaching, because he believed in man.  Nonetheless, because it was voiced, that negativity made an impression on the universe.  It's a nagging negative voice of self-doubt at the edge of our consciousness that says, we're not good enough, we can't do anything right, G-d doesn't need us in this world.  This voice challenges man's existence, and really it's the voice of self-destruction that leads to failure that trips up a person.  power of negativity, a voice that says, I don't fulfill any purpose in this world, I am nothing, my actions don't matter, I am so insignificant that it doesn't matter what I do.  And the deepest secret we taught is that all our mistakes, which are just temporary disconnects from our higher consciousness, our G-d consciousness, all our mistakes come from the fact that we don't hold ourselves in enough esteem, we don't realize how holy we can be and how much our positive actions make a difference in this world.  And actually the world was created for man.  All our mistakes come from not realizing the great value of our lives in G-d's eyes, and what we are supposed to be doing in this world.  And when we listen for Hashem's voice in our lives, when we search for Him, when we make the right choices, then we are proving that Hashem made a good decision in creating man, and we are validating creation.  And the main thing always, always, always to remember is how important it is to be a man on this world, how the world was created for the sake of man, how man is the center and purpose of all creation, how righteous behavior can uplift, can complete and finish the creation process, and ultimately validate creation.  Everything depends on man.  But if he goes to his own head, he might as well view the mosquito as being more important.  Here is an interesting take on that, because there is that nagging voice of negativity, and with just the right amount of false modesty, an inflated ego that leads one to abrogate responsibility, one can invert every truth in the world and call it truth, even if it is the opposite of responsibility.  Take for example the voluntary human extinction movement.  Did you know that there is a human extinction movement and the organization is called the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement?  It's an environmental movement that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind.  VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation.  VHEMT promotes the idea of living long and dying out as a species.  Their slogans are, thank you for not breeding, and live long and die out, as opposed to the Vulcan, live long and prosper.  Vehement has a serious problem with humans.  These folks are so concerned about the environment, climate change, resource depletion and the like, as we all should be, and therefore we should learn and teach future generations to be responsible with this earth.  But they say the real issue is people.  There are no members of the organization who expressed interest by becoming a volunteer, logging on to the forum at Live Journal or Yahoo groups or Facebook.  To be a volunteer means deciding not to have children.  As one forum poster wrote, the worst environmental crime any individual can commit is making more people.  One site explains that for vehement believers, it's a decision for the planet, for species that aren't human, for frogs and lowland gorillas, polar bears and albatrosses.  But wait a moment.  When Hashem declared in chapter 6 and verse 7, I will blot out man whom I created from the face of the ground, from man to animal to creeping things and to birds of the sky, for I have regretted my having made them.  The obvious question is, if man was worthy of destruction, what did the animals do?  Why should they be destroyed as well?  Rashi offers two explanations.  He cites the Midrash which relates that the animals too became totally deviant and corrupted in their ways, breeding, unnaturally, outside their species.  This powerful teaching illustrates the nature of man's role in this world.  He sets the tone for all creation, and all take their cue from him.  He is indeed the gardener as well as the destroyer.  But the second, starkly simple explanation that Rashi offers is even more compelling and germane to the folks of the human extinction movement and their volunteering to exit the earth in favor of frogs, gorillas, polar bears and albatrosses.  Rashi says simply, everything was created for the sake of man, and if man is finished, what purpose did these have?  Man, meaning you and me, continues to be the purpose of creation.  We need to truly take responsibility, not the easy way out, and we need to deal with it, as summed up by the prophet Isaiah in chapter 45 and verse 18.  For so said Hashem, the Creator of heaven, who is G-d, who formed the earth and made it, He established it, He did not create it for a waste, He formed it to be inhabited.  I am Hashem and there is no other. ",
