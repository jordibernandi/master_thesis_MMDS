            "text": "but anyway My primary goal of attending was to do everything I possibly could to prevent that and keep things from getting violent.  So I set out to Florida to do everything I could to counter this hate group.  They wanted us to lose our cool, and I wasn't about to give them the satisfaction or to let all of our efforts to expose and counter their hatred to ultimately culminate in a win for them.  I realized I couldn't guarantee a peaceful event, and there was a small chance that I could even end up in a body bag.  But I reached out to Jim Helton from the Tri-State Freethinkers and the former National Field Organizer for American Atheists for advice, considering his extensive experience with boots-on-the-ground activism and protests.  I also worked with five different group chats coordinating different efforts leading up to the event.  On the online side, the Atheist YouTube community shined a light on this group and their calls for violence.  The Twitter community worked to archive their footage and flag any calls for violence across different social media platforms.  and there were two different local groups that were organizing the protest on Saturday.  One had a protest permit and had been working with the cops to make sure that things went smoothly with no legal issues.  The other had recruited private security and medical personnel provided by the Sawgrass Community Defense Group.  The two groups joined forces to have the biggest impact.  The field organizers of both protests welcomed me in, and honestly, they're the ones who deserve most of the credit for the event's success, and I can't thank them enough for all their hard work and meticulous planning.  Now, before the event, I created a video and posted it to both event pages, discouraging the protest attendees from violence of any kind, and created flyers to distribute outlining what we were there to accomplish, what we could and couldn't do legally, and how we aimed to keep things peaceful and have the biggest impact.  Peaches and oranges!  I love your channel back there.  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate that.  With groups on both sides of the street, we encouraged people with kids or safety concerns to protest from a safe distance across the street.  At first, we were worried about dividing the group up, but this actually gave our protest even more exposure.  And every few minutes, cars would drive by and honk or wave a rainbow flag out their windows.  The cops didn't want to have anything to do with the hate group, but due to safety concerns, there was a police presence watching from across the street at McDonald's and in the urgent care center next door.  We were very careful to follow all laws and cooperate with the police.  An undercover cop approached me once to ask how things were going, but the police were never called at any point during the protest by either side, nor were they needed to be.  The LGBTQIA plus community really knows how to turn up.  Even in a conservative town with scorching hot Florida weather and a forecast of rain, they all came with super positive attitudes, lots of enthusiasm, and a plethora of super creative signs.  At one point we stood and read off a list of the Pulse nightclub shooting victims, and it was pretty powerful.  Leroy Valentin Fernandez, 25 years old, we stand for you.  Yes!  Jason Benjamin Jaspot, 19 years old, a teenager!  As for the conference itself, while it's hard to get an exact number of attendees, based on the building size, number of cars in the parking lot, the number of people that we saw coming and going, and from a tally of the crowd in the live video feed, if I'm being generous, I would put the number of attendees right about 150, 170 max.  if I'm being extremely generous, and that's counting kids who didn't really have a choice of being there.  Before the event, they estimated 300 people would show up.  As a conference organizer myself, judging by the size of that room, there is no way you could even get 300 people in there without violating fire code.  But even 150 is a really alarming number.  That's a pretty massive gaggle of bigots.  And their livestream had about 500 people watching, before YouTube removed the videos for terms of service violations because of the hateful calls to violence.  But seeing as there were over 300 downvotes, The number wasn't all that impressive.  People in the live chat opposing the church's message of hate were getting censored and blocked immediately by the church, which is ironic coming from a group that claims that atheists have to rely on censorship because we don't have good arguments.

In fact, quite a few of the protesters there were actually Christians, and many had loving Bible verses on signs.  Another stranger who walked up on us tried to preach to me, which was a little annoying, especially given my extremely religious background as a missionary kid, missionary youth pastor, worship leader, etc.  But while I make a lot of videos promoting science over faith and dogma, the protest wasn't the time or the place for a heated religious debate pitting philosophy and science against religious apologetics.  So I just smiled at him and walked away.  I was there to support the LGBTQIA plus community, not to have a debate about epistemology.  In the end, the protest was a huge success.

We stood there in firm opposition, pushing a message of love and tolerance.  I count that as a huge win.  And in terms of numbers, we knocked it out of the park.  It's hard to get an exact number for how many people attended the protest, but we had about 50 to 60 on one side of the road and 30 or so on the other.  Plus, most people came and went throughout the day.  One of the Facebook groups had 125 marked as going, 449 interested.  The other had 82 marked as going, 285 interested, but there was some overlap between the two groups, so it's hard to get an exact number.  If I had to estimate, I'd say between 125 and 150 people protested the event in person, not counting all of the honking cars that drove by with rainbow flags streaming out their windows.  To all of the organizers and to everyone who turned up to protest, I want to give a heartfelt thank you.  I also want to give a huge thank you to Data Jack, William Arnold, Adrian, Peter, and Kevin for your generous PayPal donations to help me cover my travel costs, as well as to all of my patrons for your ongoing support of my channel.  This was going to be one of the tightest months for me, but thanks to you, I was able to be there in person at this event and to help take a stand against hatred and bigotry.  Y'all freaking rock, and I'm really humbled by your support.  Lastly, I want to talk about where to go from here.  This group is currently losing the battle of ideas.  They've already lost multiple YouTube channels, Facebook pages, and PayPal accounts for terms of service violations and calls for violence.  A sheriff and local pastor was recently forced to resign after preaching that it was the duty of the cops to kill gay people.  The media is in our favor.  The narrative is ours.  But all of that will change if we resort to vitriol and violence.  Remember that while this group is spreading hate against the LGBTQIA plus community and it's justifiably infuriating, and while this religious organization's message and messages like this embolden their followers to engage in violence, we can't stoop to their level or they win.  Protest the events.  Flag their videos, Facebook posts, and tweets whenever they call for violence, and call them out wherever you see their hatred.  But do it tactfully.  The best move in chess is often the move that they least want you to play.  They want us to become enraged and violent.  We're not going to give them the satisfaction.  And if you see other groups in other circumstances that you simply disagree with but aren't extremist organizations like the NIFB calling for violence, don't instantly resort to deplatforming or attempts at censorship.  Learn how to counter their position with logic, reason, and science.  In the process, you'll enrich yourself and help others.  Now, in the next few days, I have a couple treats for you.  First, on this trip, I may or may not have dressed up in a giant pumpkin costume at one point to troll Pastor McMurtry.  Don't worry, I was very safe the whole time.  If you don't know what all the pumpkin stuff is about, watch my previous video for the full context on that.  You can get full access to that video right now if you're one of my patrons.  And second, I'm gonna be breaking down a street interview that I had with Pastor Steven Anderson and exposing his horrible, hateful message. ",
