            "text": "Greetings, my friends.  Once again, I was just scouring the regular news, and an article appeared that picked the Holy Spirit radar within me.  The Lord said, research this.  Well, that's what I did.  You see the picture, the thumbnail here, Jesus with the Bible, Word of God being open, and all the prophetic things just jumping off the pages.  This is where we are right now.  We're in the last of the last of the last days, and prophetic things are happening that are huge, wide open, out in the open, and hidden, like this thing that the Lord showed me that I'm about to share with you.  In California, the most wicked state and the most wicked country in the entire world, America.  Yes, you heard me right.  America is the most wicked country in the entire world.  It used to be the apple of God's eye along with Israel.  It used to be a strong Christian nation.  It's now a festering, wicked cesspool.  As I've shared you over and over again and showed you in yesterday's sermon over the weekend, how almost exact number of percent of evangelical Christians believe in all the wicked things that the world believes in right now.  So this sign happened in the most wicked state, in the most wicked country in America, and the most wicked city.  within the most wicked state, which is Los Angeles.  It's close with Los Angeles and Frisco, but L.A.  gets the nod.  It's the most wicked city in America, in my humble opinion.  A 144-year-old fig tree instantly collapsed during a pagan festival in Los Angeles.  And again... This was once a pearl in God's eyes.  A miracle was.  And this tree, by the way, was a fig tree again.  And think about the parable of the fig tree.  A tree that does not produce good fruit, God will curse it and cast it into the fire.  And it will just be burned into dust.  And that's what will happen to people who reject Jesus Christ, God's only son.  They will be cast into the fire, into hell.  where they will spend eternity suffering.  It's no coincidence.  it's happened, my friends.  And the number 144 obviously picked my interest.  Well, obviously to me, a lot of people don't understand, but the Lord showed me. ",
