            "text": "Freshman Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar are the first Muslim women to sit in the U.S.  House of Representatives, a big step for inclusiveness in government.  But they also support Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, the movement to boycott Israel, also known as BDS, while Omar has been condemned by her own Democratic Party for anti-Semitism, and Tlaib has made widely criticized comments related to the Holocaust.  Now, even as they push a resolution in Congress to boycott Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, the Congresswomen are also making plans to come visit Israel and the West Bank.  Israel technically bans entry to people who promote the BDS boycott movement.  That's controversial even in Israel.  Some people say it limits open debate.  But what you won't hear in the media is that many countries, including America, forbid visas to individuals who are entering for the purpose of overthrowing the government, which is exactly what the leaders of BDS say they support.  Definitely, most definitely, we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine.  But on the other hand, Israel is a free country, and people can't learn if they don't come and see Israel for themselves.  They can't see the coexistence between Jews and Arabs in every profession, including judges and members of Knesset, or the work Israelis do in arts, technology, human rights, and more.  What do you think Israel should decide?  Let us know in the comments. ",
