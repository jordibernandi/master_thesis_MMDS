No part about this process of recapturing our destiny is going to be easy.  Every bit of it is going to take courage.  And so folks that say, well... I'm being courageous by planning for violence in the streets.  They're not being courageous by planning.  They're not being courageous by buying the MREs.  It would take courage to get out on that street with your face and pass out leaflets.  and speak to pastors by about white wellbeing and try to bring people to our cause.  It takes courage when you are sitting at that dinner table with your family and your in-laws and you say, you know what, enough is enough.  No more of this anti-white nonsense.  I'm not gonna stand another minute of it.  I'm not gonna hear another anti-white comment and put up with it.  That is what takes courage.  It takes courage to say to your family members, you know what, if you're going to be anti-white or to say to your friends, if you're going to be anti-white, I want nothing to do with you.  It takes courage to say what you believe at your work.  When you know there's the potential of losing your job, it doesn't take courage to believe that someone else is going to fight a civil war for you.  It doesn't take courage to believe that someone else is going to pull off some act of sabotage like I heard in a Doolittle recording that the \u2013 Some little act of sabotage somewhere is going to somehow destabilize the whole  U.S.,  and then who's going to sweep into the scenario?  Who?  What entity?  But someone will, and then suddenly you'll have your conservative United States back.  That's not how it works. ",
