I must also ask you about, of course, the two big bits of news at the moment, not only, of course, the Tory leadership, but also the arrival of Donald Trump in the country.  35 minutes ago, due to touchdown at nine o'clock, Air Force One, it turns out, does arrive on time.  And he's already left in Marine One.  Just before he landed, though, he'd hit back at Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, who'd been rather critical.  of Donald Trump, a quite extraordinary language, I thought, in the Observer newspaper yesterday, in which he referred to Donald Trump as being like the fascists of the 20th century.  Donald Trump has retorted with Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly nasty to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom.  He's a stone-cold loser who should focus on crime in London.  not me he said he can't reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent mayor of new york city de blasio who's also done a terrible job only half his height he adds.  in any event i look forward to being a great friend to united kingdom.  i'm looking very much forward to my visit.  landing now your response.

I think that Mr.  Khan demeans his office, demeans the nation.  what he has said is quite wrong and deeply improper.  so i think for the president to hit back and say that he's a failed mayor of london which is true with spiraling knife crime deeply congested roads a general incompetence in city hall is fair enough.  so i'm backing mr trump in this route.

Some things are wrong.  Napier in Sindh tries to put an end to suti, the practice of widow burning.  Again, burning widows is wrong and wrong.  We shouldn't be taken in by moral relativism.
