Last week we revealed that the police were investigating whether a UKIP candidate in the forthcoming European elections committed an offence when he said this about the Labour MP Jess Phillips in a video now taken down by YouTube.  There's been an awful lot of talk about whether I would or would not even rape Jess Phillips.  I've been in a lot of trouble for my hardline stance of not even raping her.  I suppose with enough pressure I might cave.  But let's be honest, nobody's got that much beer.  The Labour MP told us about the impact that those comments had on her. ",

Claire says, this Carl Benjamin interview on your programme today has made me cry.  He sounds just like my rapist, making people believe that it's all a joke and that women are hysterical.  and call says how can you can allow an individual to stand for them after him using the word rape and claim it was a joke?  it's disgusting.  John says Victoria you're one thick woman.  imagine having a conversation with you and you can't understand context.  Geraint on email called Benjamin's right not to apologize for his joke.  why?  because there's no point.  as he knows his apology will not be accepted and his joke will still be used against him by his political opponents which include the supposedly impartial BBC.  Royston says, I love you for confronting the creature that is Carl Benjamin.  I'm a male survivor of years of violent rape.  Thank you, Victoria.  Peter on Facebook, I will never vote for UKIP again.  Carl Benjamin talking to us in an interview recorded just before we came on air.  By the way, in the interview he gave one answer in which he pointed out that several comedians have made jokes about sexual assault, which is true in some cases.  We took that short bit out because we couldn't find evidence that all of the people he named have done that.  If you want to get in touch to talk about that interview or the family courts, many of you still are, we will read some more before the end of the programme.
