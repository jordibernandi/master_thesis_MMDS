            "text": "What happens when you ignore a man on vacation?  He has a meltdown and reacts like a child.  So let's catch you up to date, shall we?  For the last week, I have been in Florida and experienced Disneyland for my very first time.  And during my vacation, I received two emails from the one and only Lord Voldemort himself, a.k.a.  Onision.  I'll set us up as an appointment at the gym.  Needs to happen.  ASAP.  No special training, just you and me in the ring.  Now again, mind you, I am on vacation.  I'm not dealing with YouTube.  I'm not making YouTube videos.  I have nothing planned.  I don't have any of my video equipment.  I don't really care.  This is time for me.  This is my vacation.  My first time ever experiencing Disney World.  So what do I do?  I ignore it.  Well, here's the thing.  If Onision contacts you And you ignore him, you are in for a rude, destructive, dysfunctional, chaotic, but most of all, entertaining meltdown.  Because holy moly lemon squeezy, did he have one of the biggest meltdowns I have ever seen on his Twitter timeline about me.  And the crazy thing is, I didn't even say anything.  I already sent you an email requesting a boxing match within the next two weeks.  You've been making hate videos about me and my family for eight years now.  Figured if your words mean anything, you'd love to box me.  Who wouldn't?  Question mark.  Unless, of course, you've been fake this whole time.  Like how you've made countless videos going after my marriage of about seven years still going as a surprise.  You were wrong and then apologized.  Come on, let's put an end to this.  Box me and you can finally move on with your life and stop obsessing.  Greg, I do not care about your current ongoing marriage.  And you're right.  I did apologize for something that I did years and years ago because it crossed the line and it's something that I would never, ever do again.  And I wrote you a pretty heartfelt email apology, apologizing for one specific thing.  But here's the trick about Greg.  If you apologize for something specific, let's just say I spilled milk on Onision's dining table, right?  I spilled a glass of milk and I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry.  That means that I must be sorry for all of the other things I have ever said or done to Greg.  And that's sadly not how it works logically.  You see, I can apologize for something specific, but it doesn't outrule the fact that I'm still going to criticize you and I'm still going to respond accordingly when you do screwed up things and you say screwed up things and you do crazy, crazy behavior and you exhibit it on YouTube.  That's just what I'm going to do because people like it.  Now here's the thing, you would imagine that this would stop.  After two emails he emailed me, I did not respond to him.  I didn't care to respond to him.  Again, I'm on vacation.  So I guess I did the worst possible thing imaginable, which I didn't know.  this was it.  I didn't respond to him, to those two emails.  And during my vacation, he made a video about me challenging me to a boxing match, titled Dear Mr.  Repzion, which he just, as of yesterday, removed off of his Onision Speaks channel.  It's no longer there.  ironic is not like you make videos about me and then you always seem to remove them after you don't get the reaction that you want from me or if I do respond I Pwn you so bad in response that you again end up deleting it.  So I think we're on like the fifth or sixth video where you've made about me and like addressing me specifically and then you delete it and I don't know how many more we're gonna do of those, but like, it's getting- it's pretty entertaining.  We're getting close to the double digits now.  But I digress nonetheless.  Yes, that rhymed.  I ignored him.  On vacation.  That's literally all I did.  I made a Twitter response video.  If you don't follow me on Twitter, you probably should, because it's Onision Goldmine.  But I wasn't gonna make a response to him.  I'm not gonna get into Onision-related content when I'm on vacation.  I think anybody can understand that.  But with my no response to him, and him considering me ignoring him, which I was... he had a twitter meltdown and by all means this is one of the biggest meltdowns i've ever seen from him on his twitter timeline and we're gonna go through it today.  it is of epic proportions.  are you ready folks?  i know you're ready.  have a soda.  you're gonna need it.  repsion is a balding greasy looking tiny beta male bee who in reality is scared of his own shadow.  Nut, nut, nut.  And then he makes fun of his tattoo that he got printed on his arm saying, do not engage, which was in reference to Onision haters.  Like he got a do not engage tattoo that says do not engage because he's not gonna engage with haters.  So now he's making fun of himself.  You think insulting me balding is like gonna stop me from making videos?  Like is that all you got, buddy?  Yo Repsion, will you ever grow... Balls, let me know.  We'll gladly meet you in the ring and break you in front of all your dumb fans.  Onision doesn't want to fight a total stranger.  Coward!  Repsion refuses to fight a dude he's been diddling off for eight years.  Lost it at diddling off.  Loser.  Beep.  Beep.  Now, I don't know about you, but this is a pretty, like, crazy, juvenile, like, a 12-year-old.  reaction to somebody ignoring them is pretty darn pathetic, if you ask me.  Now, while I'm on vacation, I was seeing this and I was just laughing.  This is pure hysterical.  because it keeps going on, and it gets significantly worse, and then it does a complete switch on his timeline, and then he reacts, which you'll see, this gets better.  So this is where it gets really just like, whoa, what just happened, right?  He does, oh my god, it follows me, ew, ew, ew, because I guess he just now realized that I had been following him from the last six months on Twitter, because he unblocked everybody on Twitter, so I wanted to follow him on Twitter, so I followed him.  In fact, he was just a few months ago bragging about how he never blocks anybody, And then after this specific tweet about me, he completely makes his entire Twitter of 280,000 followers private so that you have to request a follower and it's for Patreons only.  So now his Twitter is behind a paywall because of me.  Because one, I ignored him.  Two, he found out that I was following him.  But imagine that power that I have over this person that I can make him completely private his entire Twitter of 280,000 people just because I ignored him.  Look, Greg, I don't know if you're trying to, like, be more secure on your Twitter timeline, but it's not gonna work, because there are still people who follow you and send me things that you tweet out, so all the stuff that you say right up here next is stuff that I saw, despite your Twitter being private.

So this next part of his Twitter meltdown is an odd one.  I don't really understand the correlation other than the fact that my last name is Salzbach, which is like German and I did my DNA tests and I'm only like 10% German.  I thought I was a lot more, but I'm only like 10% German.  But apparently he didn't know that I was German.  And after he found out, this is after he made his Twitter private, that I have a last name that is German, he decides to condemn all and everyone in Germany and anyone who is of German descent or related to anyone in Germany.  No, I'm not making this up.  This is weird.  And he says, my advice to all Germans, move to France, England, or Italy, any country that isn't the source of the world's greatest evil.  For the record, German is an insult.  Ah, poor Germans.  They're the real victims, I guess.  By the way, there are tons of Germans who still dislike Jewish people.  You would know this had you talked to German people who understand Germany.  Same with the southern accent.  Sounds like slavery to me.  Thank goodness I come from a country that whooped the Germans and from the north that whooped the south.  Long line of racy people kicking butt in my blood.  I angered the Germans, uh-oh, please don't send me to camp.  When I hear German, all I think is Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.  Maybe I was an American soldier in my past life.  And just FYI, if I'm pronouncing things wrong, it's because I don't want to say the full word because YouTube don't like it.  By the way, this dude I wanted to box, I would love to see his neo-Nazi GF see her German boyfriend hit the mat.  It's America versus the transphobic Nazis.  What?  So I'm just going to say in response to these weird, weird tweets is that it's really odd that you associate anyone who is German as a Nazi and yet make jokes about, you know, the Halo cost, which is fine.  Like you can make as many jokes about the Halo costs that you want.  I have no problem with it.  It's fine.  But then you condemn me and my girlfriend for making jokes about the Halo cost.  So why can you make jokes about the Halo cost or things in regards to Germany?  But if we do it, it's not okay.  And the slump in everybody who is German as being horrible people is just not the case.  It's a real part of history.  And the fact that you try to condemn an entire country, much less all of the people because of some horrific thing in the past, then you might as well condemn everything else, because every past in history has one that is not very colorful and peaceful.  If you go deep enough and back enough, that's what you're gonna find.  Special thanks to Rebecca, one of my first people to buy my Onion Boy related t-shirt.  If you haven't seen, here's what it looks like.  It is linked down below in the description.  If you really wanna make an onion angry, I recommend you buy one of my t-shirts, tweet it to me on social media, or if you really wanna rustle some jimmies, tweet that shirt.  with a photo of yourself to Onion Boy.  But hey, Greg, if you want to do a boxing match, what I will agree to is you need to get a Toy Story figure, specifically Woody from Toy Story.  Get it like about a 12, this is about 12-incher right here.  I got this at Disney World.  Isn't he cool?  Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.  Commence Star Command.  And we will have a Woody versus Buzz Lightyear fight.  How's that sound?  That sound good?  I think that sounds cool.  Because if you really want to settle our differences, we can have a toy figurine fight.  That's more my style.  Plus, you could finally meet me in person, Onion Boy.  Wouldn't you want that?  I mean, we live in the same state.  Hey, I'm down to grab some pasta.  if you really want to talk, you know, settle our differences and sit down and have a chat.  I'm more than willing to do that.  But somehow I don't think that's on the table considering that you ended a friendship with multiple people because they took a photo with me.  If you're that petty, well, there's no good news in the future for you.  Thank you. ",
