            "text": "What's going on America?  This is Kevin from Kevin's Corner.  I'm out here with the dog of color and the white dog of privilege.  And just got done watching Lisa Fox give her live explanation of what went on with the Jesse Smollett case.  Yeah, I guess it's time for her to come out and do a little damage control considering the heat is coming down on her because people just, they're not buying it.  And so... we need to find out why she was uh able to give jesse smollett to slip out of all the trouble.  apparently she was like look look jesse i'm gonna leave the back door open to the jail.  uh head out there's gonna be a guy guarding the door.  his name is fatso.  just um just say the fat man sleeps alone.  that's the key word.  he'll let you go.  um yeah just let him let him slide.  and so this lady does this interview and she i guess streamed it live.  and she has some crucial questions uh questions that I have as well.  Like, for example, why in the world would this lady, I think her name was Tina Chin, decide, hey, you know what?  I'm just going to be a concerned citizen and call up Lisa Fox, my buddy, and ask her what's going on with that Jesse Smollett case.  Apparently, she was concerned about all the leaks and stuff coming from the media, the different information that was coming out about whether he was cooperating or not.  So I guess as a concerned citizen, she decides to call up her old bud Take time out of her her busy day to just check in on the Jesse Smollett case.  You know, yeah, that's my job.  And just so happened.  I'm.  I'm a former chief of staff for Michelle Obama, who Jesse Smollett was cool with.  And so I guess she had this conversation with with Tina Chin.  And then also mentioned that a family member of Jesse Smollett called her as well.  And I'm thinking, huh, that's odd.  Now, according to Lisa Fox, this is something that happens all the time.  People just reach out to her.  You know, I need to talk to you about this because they don't have a relationship with the police, she said.  So they called her.  So the interviewer, because hopefully she she's trying to get to the bottom of this.  She asked the question, well, what family member?  Who is it?  Well, just a family member.  Which one?  Cousin?  Aunt?  Niece?  What, mother?  Well, just a family member.  That's a crucial piece of this puzzle because could that family member have been Kamala Harris?  I'm just saying.  Rumor has it that they're related.  But nonetheless, she goes on and she moves into the part of this interview where she's trying to justify why in the heck she decided to make this decision.  So here's the thing that bothers me.  She never mentioned anything about jesse being guilty.  she wouldn't answer that question.  she comes up with this bogus explanation saying that well we wanted him to go through the diversion program.  and i'm thinking well what what diversion program is this you're speaking of?  so we're trying to minimize people who have minor offenses going through the whole process where we come to a determined conclusion.  So when you go through this program, apparently you don't have to be deemed guilty or innocent.  It's just I'm going to go through it just in case, I guess, just for fun.  And because we don't want to drag it out, waste resources, time and money, we're going to send you through this diversion program.  And she said, this is normal.  They do this all the time.  And I'm like, whoa.  Well, I guess that Chicago is the place to be for criminals.  I mean, calling all criminals, calling all criminals.  If you just get to Chicago, you done made it to the promised land.  That is where you can commit crimes and don't have to confess of guilt or innocence.  Just put together a little deal where you do some community service.  Maybe pick up a couple pieces of paper.  You know, play with the kids at the park.  Push a couple people on the swing.  Yep, being a nice guy, see?  And then you bounce.  You get all your stuff is sponged and everything.  And so the lady asked her, you know, well, if you had all the information, why didn't you prosecute?  She said, was there anything wrong with the case?  And Lisa Fox, yeah, Lisa Fox was like, nope.  You know, my investigators did great work.  So that means nothing was wrong with the case.  It wasn't like they lost a witness or the information was jacked up.  She just determined to do this for Jesse.  Now, of course, the lady was like, well, don't you see how this can look a little suspicious?  Yeah, I can see how it might look a little suspicious.  But, you know, I'm really introducing this new way of dealing with crime.  And I wanted to make sure we're maximizing all of our resources properly.  Because we got all these other things going on and murders and stuff.  And I'm thinking to myself, well, obviously, Jesse didn't care about your resources because he took up a whole bunch of your resources.  And yet you're now talking about, well, I'm doing this for him because of all the resources.  Now, the lady also mentioned you knew this was a high profile situation here.  So this ain't no normal.  We're just going to bend the rules for him by doing that for him, knowing he's famous and he's connected.  And so are you.  You don't think that made some suspicions just kind of rise up and some people say, hmm, if this wasn't juicy Smollett, would the same situation happen?  Would I be given the opportunity to do that?  I'm just curious.  And see, here's how I look at it.  She basically wanted to get him through this program.  Without him having to confess or be proved to be guilty or not innocent.  But here's the deception.  He is going around acting as if he is still innocent.  And that is the problem.  So was the press release by his lawyer who's talking about that's why you're not supposed to judge people before all the facts come out and try them in the court of public opinion.  Well, here's the problem.  We didn't get a chance to even try him in court.  So what are you talking about?  The lady, Lisa, would never say whether Jesse was guilty or not.  The lady asked her several times, do you think he's guilty?  Well, he wasn't found guilty in the court of law.  But do you think he's guilty?  I think that we had enough evidence to go to court over.  do you think he did it?  i think that we had enough evidence to go to court over.  she never said yeah i believe he was guilty whereas all the other people who saw the evidence is mad at this.  they said oh that dude did it he is full-blown guilty.  so that still then doesn't justify if you got a guilty case.  and he decided remember juicy decided to do this in public.  I'm like the old school parent that says, okay, you know what?  I'm not going to wait to get home to whoop you if you put on a show in public.  If you want to put on a show in public, I'm going to tear you up in public.  We can both be the star of the show.  I'm going to go ahead and put you on public display since you was out there acting a fool, running up and down the grocery aisles, knocking stuff over, all that stuff.  Yeah, okay, you want to act up in public?  No.  No, I'm going to embarrass you in public because you just embarrassed me in public.  Jesse was all on TV.  He was all doing the shaking his butt on, you know, I'm the gay Tupac and all that stuff.  And then full blown brought all this national attention to himself by declaring all of these falsehoods and blew this thing up bigger than it could have ever been.  He wanted that attention.  So because he did that and wanted all that attention and brought it to himself, he should have been tried in public and bring that attention to himself.  So what is she talking about?  She tried to weasel around snaking and all that stuff, but we all know that that was some home cooking.  Now, if I'm a prosecutor, my question to her is, I need to find out who that family member was that you spoke to.  So you've been listening to Kevin and Kevin's Corner.
