            "text": "We know in our bones this election is different.  The stakes are higher, the threat more serious.  We have to beat Donald Trump.  And all the polls agree.  Joe Biden is the strongest Democrat to do the job.  No one is more qualified.  For eight years, President Obama and Vice President Biden were an administration America could be proud of.  our allies could trust and our kids could look up to.  Together, they work to save the American economy, to pass the historic Affordable Care Act, protecting over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.  Now, Joe Biden is running for president with a plan for America's future.  To build on Obamacare, not scrap it.  To make a record investment in America's schools.  To lead the world on climate.  To rebuild our alliances.  Most of all, he'll restore the soul of the nation.  Battered by an erratic, vicious, bullying president.  Strong, steady, stable leadership.  Biden, president.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message. ",
