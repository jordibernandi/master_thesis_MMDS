            "text": "Well, Trump is, you know, I think there are, a number of illusions about Trump.  If you take a look at the Trump phenomenon, it's not very surprising.  Think back for the last 10 or 15 years over Republican Party primaries, and remember what happened during the primaries.  Each primary, when some candidate rose from the base, They were so outlandish that the Republican establishment tried to crush them and succeeded in doing it.  Michelle Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum, anyone who was coming out of the base was totally unacceptable to the establishment.  The change in 2016 is they couldn't crush it.  But the interesting question is, why was this happening?  Why in election after election was the voting base producing a candidate utterly intolerable to the establishment?  And the answer to that is, if you think about that, the answer is not very hard to discover.  Since the 1970s, during this neoliberal period, both of the political parties have shifted to the right.  The Democrats, by the 1970s, had pretty much abandoned the working class, and the last gasp of more or less progressive Democratic Party legislative proposals was the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act in 1978, which Carter watered down so that it had no teeth, just became voluntary.  But the Democrats had pretty much abandoned the working class.  They became pretty much what used to be called moderate Republicans.  Meanwhile, the Republicans shifted so far to the right that they went completely off the spectrum.  The two of the leading political analysts of the American Enterprise Institute, Thomas Mann, Norman Ornstein, about five or ten years ago, described the Republican Party as what they called a radical insurgency that has abandoned parliamentary politics.  Well, why did that happen?  It happened because the Republicans face a difficult problem.  They have a primary constituency, a real constituency, extreme wealth and corporate power.  That's who they have to serve.  That's their constituency.  You can't get votes that way.  So, you have to do something else to get votes.  What do you do to get votes?  This was begun by Richard Nixon with the Southern strategy, try to pick up racists in the South.  The mid-1970s, Paul Virick, one of the Republican strategists, hit on a brilliant idea.  Northern Catholics voted Democratic, tended to vote Democratic, a lot of them working class.  The Republicans could pick up that vote by pretending, crucially pretending, to be opposed to abortion.  By the same pretense, they could pick up the evangelical vote.  Those are big votes, evangelicals, Northern Catholics.  Notice the word pretense.  It's crucial.  You go back to the 1960s, every leading Republican figure was strongly what we call now pro-choice.  The Republican Party position was\u2014that's Ronald Reagan, George H.W.  Bush, all the leadership\u2014their position was abortion is not the government's business.  It's a private business.  The government has nothing to say about it.  They turned almost on a dime.  in order to try to pick up a voting base on what are called cultural issues.  Same with gun rights.  Gun rights become a matter of holy writ because you can pick up part of the population that way.  In fact, what they've done is put together a coalition of voters based on issues that are basically un-tolerable to the establishment, but they don't like it.  And they've got to hold those two constituencies together.  the real constituency of wealth and corporate power, they're taken care of by the actual legislation.  So if you look at the legislation under Trump, it's just lavish gifts to the wealth and the corporate sector.  the tax bill, the deregulation, you know, every case and point.  That's kind of the job of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, those guys.  They serve the real constituency.  Meanwhile, Trump has to maintain the voting constituency.  with one outrageous position after another that appeals to some sector of the voting base.  And he's doing it very skillfully.  It's just as a political manipulation, it's skillful.  Work for the rich and the powerful, shaft everybody else, but get their votes.  It's not an easy trick.  And he's carrying it off.  And I should say the Democrats are helping him.  They are.  Take the focus on Russiagate.  What's that all about?  I mean, it was pretty obvious at the beginning that you're not going to find anything very serious about Russian interference in elections.  I mean, for one thing, it's undetectable.  In the 2016 election, the Senate and the House went the same way as the executive, but nobody claims there was Russian interference there.  In fact, you know, Russian interference in the election, if it existed, was very slight, much less, say, than interference by, say, Israel.  Israel, the prime minister, Netanyahu, goes to Congress, talks to a joint session of Congress without even informing the White House to attack Russia.  Obama's policies.  I mean, that's dramatic interference with elections.  Not whatever the Russians tried.  It's not going to be anything like that.  And in fact, there's no interference in elections.  that begins to compare with campaign funding.  Remember that campaign funding alone gives you a very high prediction of electoral outcome.  It's again Tom Ferguson's major work, which has shown this very persuasively.  That's massive interference in elections.  Anything the Russians might have done is going to be you know, peanuts and compare.  As far as Trump collusion with the Russians, that was never going to amount to anything more than minor corruption.  Maybe building a Trump hotel in Red Square or something like that, but nothing of any significance.  The Democrats invested everything in this issue.  Well, turned out there was nothing much there.  They gave Trump a huge gift.  In fact, they may have handed him the next election.  That's just a matter of being so unwilling to deal with fundamental issues that they're looking for something on the side that'll somehow give political success. ",

            "text": "Goddamn.  Goddamn.  That was 8 minutes and 56 seconds of pure brilliance.  He nailed it.  He nailed it in every way.  So he's saying, here's the dynamic at play here.  The Republicans are in a very bad position of having to serve their real constituency, which is the mega wealthy and corporations, while at the same time getting enough votes from the public.  So you can't just go out there and say what you're all about, which is tax cuts for the rich and deregulation and things of that nature and endless wars, which helps the military industrial complex.  So what do you have to do?  You got to go out there and get a ragtag group of voters together.  And how do they go about it?  Well, first of all, Southern Strategies, the old school playbook, it's still in effect to this day.  So they go after the Southern white racists, the neo-Confederates, you can call them.  That's one group.  The other group is evangelical Christians.  Then you have the cultural reactionaries who they go after.  And then, you know, uh... gun lovers.  so they try to scrap together they hit a bunch of very specific issues culturally to signal to these people like oh i'm with you i'm on your side.  and then those people they extrapolate and they almost project onto the republicans what they want them to be.  so not only does this guy agree with me on guns he's also looking out for me and he's gonna like cut my taxes and stuff.  and the reality is of course 80% of the Republican tax bill, Trump's tax bill, goes to the top 1% over a decade.  So it's not like, and Chomsky points out, that's not an easy trick, man.  And I always said the Republicans are good at marketing and they're good at making their case, because they are.  They take these just incredibly disliked positions and they find a way through sheer confidence and bluster in marketing to win elections.  That's not a simple thing to do.  That's very complex.  And Trump is the best example of it.  Now, the one thing I think Chomsky misses there is not only is it the ragtag group of, you know, the base, which the elites are actually scared of the Republican base, but they need them for the votes.  But not only does Trump get those people, Trump's cherry on top of a trick is the fake populism.  which I think got him over the top, because it was those 70,000 votes in the Rust Belt that really turned the election over to him, and I don't think he would have been able to win without the fake populism, and without Hillary being objectively terrible and not doing any kind of populism, and just running on cliches and almost expecting like she's entitled to win.  So the cherry on top was the fake populism that got Trump over the edge.  Now, in terms of the Democrats, God, he nails it again.  He says, and the Democrats are helping the Republicans effectively.  Not that they want to.  That's what ends up happening because they put all their eggs in the wrong baskets.  The thing that they spoke the most about, the thing that they focus the most about recently is Russiagate and is the Mueller report.  And then the Mueller report did not give them exactly what they wanted.  Now, you could say it's an open question on obstruction of justice.  Fair enough.  I think it's clear Trump probably did obstruct justice.  But the other thing that's clear is Mueller says no evidence of collusion.  Not there.  So when you focus on that nonstop, and then it comes up giving you not really what you were looking for, Yeah, that's going to end up helping Trump, I think.  And whether or not they want to admit it now, whether or not it's immediately reflected in the polls, especially if they keep doubling down on that.  And why are they doing it?  That's the important part.  It's not just because, hey, they're not that smart.  That's not the only reason why the Democrats are fucking this up massively.  But it's because they fundamentally cannot focus on the issues that they need to focus on to win elections.  Because for Democrats to win elections and focus on the right issues would mean they're holding themselves to very specific policies and very specific things that they're fighting for to help the people.  Now, ultimately, establishment Democrats don't care and don't want to help the people because they also have allegiances to corporate America and to their donors, to the elites.  So, think about it, because now the Democrats are in a similar position to the Republicans.  The Democrats, the establishment Democrats, need to keep serving the powerful and the elites and the corporations.  But they also have to try to win elections.  How do you win elections while still maintaining your loyalty... to your funders, the elites.  How do you do it if you're a Democrat?  Well, they're trying to find some way to walk that tightrope, and the answer they came up with is... Let's just talk about Mueller nonstop.  Let's just talk about Russiagate and say collusion nonstop.  And that'll maybe help us win an election by ignoring the main issues that people struggle with.  Healthcare, the economy, wages, endless war, extreme poverty.  Let's ignore the main issues people struggle with because we can't help them on that that much because we're beholden to the establishment too.  But we still want to win, so what are we going to do?  I don't know.  Make a mountain out of a molehill in this side issue of the Mueller Report and Russiagate.  Make that the number one thing.  And then that is, it's not going to work, dude.  It's not going to work.  So thankfully, thankfully, the cavalry is on the way, though, because we do have, you know, a new class of young Democrats and a couple of presidential candidates, Bernie Tulsi and some others, who will focus on the right issues and actually care about it.  That's the good news.  The bad news is the dominant strain in the Democratic Party is still the establishment wing.  And so that dynamic that Chomsky's talking about is still alive and well, and it's beyond frustrating.  And like he says, no kind of election interference comes even remotely close to Israeli election interference.  I would also say Saudi election interference, but most importantly, corporate election interference.  Where corporations just buy the government through campaign funding and then get what they want and the regular people get screwed.  And if you're not talking about that as worse than, you know, $100,000 in Facebook ads from fucking some Russian troll farm, then you're being misled or you're a dunce.  So if you don't take it from me on Russiagate, then take it from the world's most prominent living intellectual, political intellectual.  That's Noam Chomsky. ",
