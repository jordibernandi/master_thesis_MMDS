Fundamentally, the problem with that withdrawal agreement is that it would keep the UK locked in the EU's... I think viewers at home don't necessarily understand this.  It would keep us locked in the EU's trading arrangements and in the lunar pull of EU law without being able to have a say on that.  That's why it's totally unacceptable. ",

Her question about no deal being a million to one chance is rehashing old words.  That was the position when Boris Johnson took over from the Ramonin trait of Maybot, who was never going to leave the EU.  He likely only made that statement to keep the Ramonas off his back because back then they would have had enough time to block a no deal Brexit.  which they might not have time to do now, and obviously a deal relies on the EU giving us a much better deal than they tried to before.  Boris reiterates to her that the withdrawal agreement is dead.  There is more life in the Maybach government right now than there is in the EU withdrawal agreement.  I think Boris Johnson knows that the only acceptable way to leave the EU is on WTO terms.  When Boris points out some of the issues included in the backstop that would keep us under EU law with no veto power, the spunk trumpet host once again tries to interrupt him.  claiming she already knows all this, but Boris is talking to the viewers, not her, so he finished what he had to say.

It was reported weeks ago.  if we leave with no deal, then the EU does not get our money.  I'm sure Macron and Merkel have known this since they dot.  The 39 billion is a condition within the EU withdrawal agreement.  If we don't sign it, then the 39 billion is not due, so I'm confused as to why that seems like such a shock to this EU spunk trumpet.  Even after he tells her everyone knows the money was a condition of the deal, she still bangs on about him telling Macron he won't get the money.  You dumb bitch.  Macron knew this from the moment the deal was agreed by the EU, before Maybach failed to get it through Parliament.  As Boris said, that money will be used by the UK to deal with any situation that occurs after a no-deal Brexit.  Beth can't handle that though.  She goes on the usual mainstream media route, bringing up the same old scare stories about medicine and food.  This bitch has clearly been living deep inside that Project Yellowhammer report that is over a year old and was created by the biased civil service.  It has about as much credibility as the BBC.  I don't know why Boris Johnson didn't just say, no, there won't be any of these shortages.  It's all nonsense.  We are leaving the EU, not the planet.  Countries will still want to trade with us, and let's not forget how much food retailers throw away every single day.  We already don't use what we have in the stores now, so I'm sure in 10 years we won't be talking about the UK's 2019 famine.  It's just ridiculous.  Let's move on. ",

I think the public might want you to be straight about the realities of what a no-deal Brexit could mean for their lives.  I think what the public might want us to do is to get ready for a no-deal Brexit for two reasons.  The first is that that is the best way to ensure that we get the deal that I think we can get.  But the other reason, obviously, is so that if and when we are forced... by the obduracy of our European friends, to come out on October 31st without a deal, that things are as smooth as they can possibly be.  So I'm full of confidence about it.  I do think that, you know, there's going to be a lot of work still to be done before October 31st, but a huge amount is being done, as you know.  We are reaching out to consumer groups, to businesses across the country the whole time.  And when we come out, we will then have substantial opportunities that we haven't had before.  Opportunities to do things differently in our economy.  Opportunities to cut taxes on investment.  Opportunities to regulate in a different way.  Opportunities to do free trade deals around the world.  And that is something I think we can all look forward to.  The people who are going to be responsible for no deal are not in the UK. ",

This woman is an idiot.  Did Maybach release Yellowhammer when it was a relevant document?  Did Blair release relevant documents about the Iraq war bullshit?  Of course they fucking didn't.  So why would Boris Johnson do it?  because commie cumbuckets like Beth decide she wants to see them?  She is hung up on these food and medicine shortages because right now, there is nothing else they can really scare the masses with.  It's really annoying though that Boris does not call out this complete bullshit.  Instead, He tells her the government are taking steps that the public would want them to do, either to get a good deal or be prepared when we leave on a no-deal Brexit.  I think most people want a no-deal Brexit right now, Boris.  MPs want a deal, no one else.  Boris finishes up pointing out the benefits Brexit will bring to the UK.  Boris did completely ignore her question about not wanting to be Mr No Deal.  I think Boris knows he's already Mr No Deal, but he won't say that because he's trying to keep some of his MPs on his side who might be sitting on the fence right now.  Boris knows the deal on the table right now is done, so it's up to the EU to come out and bring some new terms to the table, which they won't.  So he will blame them for a no-deal Brexit, although I expect it's what him and his inner circle want to do, but he can't be overt about it yet.  If he had a bigger majority government, he would be far more blatant with his no-deal talk.  But I also think in that situation, the EU would be crawling over for a deal under the terms we set.  It's the Ramonas in Parliament that have given the EU the upper hand in negotiations.  Boris Johnson is trying to take that back, even with the Ramonas still trying to undermine the UK at every turn.  This is why he called them collaborators.  If he had a bigger majority, the traitor MPs would be pissing in the wind.  Well, this woman has to be one of the most biased, snarling, spitting imbeciles I've ever come across in my life.  Her contempt for the Prime Minister is unrivaled.  I think she should join the fucking BBC.  Well, I'm going to end the video there, guys.
