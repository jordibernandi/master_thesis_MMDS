            "text": "The retail recession hits Australia Fair.  Let's have a look.  Hello everyone, I'm Florian Heiser and welcome to another episode of Heiser Says.  I thought I'd do something a little bit different today.  I went down to the Gold Coast the other weekend with my wife and family.  We decided to go out and go shopping.  We thought we would have a look at Australia Fair.  Now Australia Fair is in the northern portion of the Gold Coast.  in Southport and it has quite a history it's also a little tired and I noticed something when I was walking around.  I'd noticed a lot of shops that were not really empty but were repurposed for other uses.  so I grabbed my phone and I decided to record some footage just to put something together to share with the audience really to to get you all to talk about retail centers around Australia.  now I watched the dead mall series in America.  There's a whole bunch of YouTubers where they go and they film these dead malls and they put it all to music and they do a really good job.  This is not that.  More so because I didn't take any of my special equipment.  It was just on my phone, so you need to forgive the camera shake.  And our malls are not as, well, not as drastically affected as those in the United States.  We have a very high square meter rate per population, but not as high as the U.S It's just crazy over there.  So Australia Fair was originally built in 1983 and it was known as Scarborough Fair and it was anchored by a Franklins.  In 84 it incorporated a cause and came out.  so it had three anchors which was reasonable.  In 89, it doubled its size, extended through the Narang Street Mall, and, you know, it had the calls Woolworths and Franklin's there as retail towns, as well as Kmart.  So it had four of them.  Now, there was a mall next to Australia Fair, which no longer exists anymore.  It kind of died.  I know this area because my mother had a hair salon further up Marine Parade.  So during primary school, I would come and play, and we'd hang out at Australia Fair in the mall.  But in 1990, so it was renamed to Australia Fair on the 10th of April, it cost $300 million to complete.  At completion, and I'm quoting this from Wikipedia, Australia Fair had the largest concentration of specialty shops in the southern hemisphere.  It was the only shopping centre in the Gold Coast, let alone the nation, with three supermarket chains at the time, Woolworths, Coles and Franklin.  In 1991, the 52,000 square metre shopping development is the first of its kind in Australia and one of the largest in Queensland.  I remember visiting then as a child with my parents on holiday from Victoria.  We went here and we had a look.  So in 93 there was an extension to introduce a six-center cinema.  In 95, Fashion Boulevard and Broadwater Food Court.  In 97, 98, the extensions were completed and the cinema was expanded from six to ten.  So, 98 to 99, Colonial First State bought it into a joint venture ownership of Australia Fair with MPEC.  2001, Gordon Fu purchased Australia Fair from Colonial First State.  And 2002 to 2007, sorry, 2004, 2.7 million was spent on upgrading to the flooring, directional signage and amenities.  So just remember that they spent 2.7 million to upgrade the amenities.  We're going to look at some of those here.  So what I thought we'll do is we'll just jump here to this video footage that I recorded and I'll just talk over it.  So this is the across the street from the parking.  So you can just see, you know, the center, it's looking a bit tired.  It hasn't been cleaned.  It's quite dirty on a lot of the facades here.  And I mean, the style, it's, it's aging.  so you can see some of the discoloration on the panels there and just the old office building typical gold coast palm lights and this is where palm trees this is.  when we went inside i noticed a lot of these type of spaces.  so this was a huge retail footprint there.  that's just either used as an eating area and it was all closed down.  so it's not being leased out.  you know it's not being leased.  it's used as just dead space here we can see here.  a bit further up you've got this book swap there and That was interesting.  They're repurposing these empty shops, trying to make it more alive and more vibrant.  But I was just shocked at seeing this much floor area.  They're empty.  And literally just across the other side of the mall there, you had another shop completely closed up.  Completely closed up with the hoarding there.  And they've put signage on there and a bit of decoration.  But I mean, that's another large retail tenancy that is completely empty.  And further up the mall, you've got more of these where they've allowed other tenants to put installations into the space.  Another little shop, completely empty.  So it's not as depressing as the United States.  Here we go, we've got another one.  And this is, you know, we had the large eating area that was completely closed off because this was a Sunday when we were going on to visit.  And you can see here, this is another tendency, which is the lounge.  Now you can sit and relax in peace.  You've got to supervise your children.  But it's literally crappy fake carpet, tiles popping up, and some garden chairs there.  That's the lounge.  I mean, they need to do something to these spaces at a low cost.  Here is one of the amenities.  This was the parents' room, and this is one we all know, and you can see Frederick and the kids playing, and they play pen with absolutely nothing in the pen.  Remember, they spent $2.7 million upgrading the amenities.  I think they forgot that one.  So here we are, we're walking further down the mall and you can just see how, you know, it's obviously the architecture of the time is coming through.  and forgive the camera bump.  I do have a handheld thing.  I'll get that later.  And we can see as we're approaching or turning the corner here, there's more shops in the distance that are just empty and everything's, you know, for sale and I'm panning way too quick.  You know, and you've got, you know, the escalators going up and down to the car park.  And here we have another empty shop in the distance.  And again, to my right, another empty shop.  You know, where they have enclosed in with hoarding and put all the advertising for the center there.  You know, in the center there, they're trying to hide the fact that these tenancies are completely empty.  Completely empty.  You know, are you seeing this more and more in the shopping centers around?  Is this a sign of the recession that retail is hitting, particularly for the smaller ones?  I was just surprised how many of them were like this, that they had to close in.  Where am I going here?  Well, here you go.  And then I've walked further on and I discovered another one just with the hoarding up there.  So it's a good opportunity to invest in hoarding, perhaps.  You know, we had a mix of people there.  Now, this was across the end of the mall, across the road.  And this is some of the offices there.  And frankly, it was a very, very sad and, shall we say, somewhat depressing space.  And we're just looking at the approach from the car park here.  And then we'll go back and we'll have a look at the walkover.  And you can see here's the car park space here.  with some of the medical precincts, but they are also planning with transitions.  So there are a few, you know, a dental clinic here and some offices that are obviously closed at this time.  But there are a few empty tenancies as well over here.  And you can see it's just feeling very tired and old.  Further up, you've got another, like a hidden away tenancy.  And through to the left, you'll see the connection over to the mall to the rest of the center.  And we'll walk through that and it's getting quite.  Its age is starting to come.  There's definitely some maintenance work that needs to be done.  There's some tiles popping here that, you know, need replacement.  Some cracked ones on the floor.  And here I found, you know, there's a gymnasium to the left, which is probably giving it a fair bit of activity.  Here a little tenancy just completely, you know, hidden away.  Hidden away there.  I don't know how much foot traffic you'd get from people coming from the car park, maybe from the gymnasium, but that would be a hard one to activate and a difficult one to make any money.  And this is in Southport where a lot of apartment buildings have come up and a lot more activity has happened.  And this is the approach.  We're walking across the connection over the street here.  And we can just see the, I mean, you can see what they've done is they've plugged up all of the louvers with just some little core, hollow core.  And it's all weathered and starting to rust.  The paint's chipping off.  I hope none of that.  paint's lead-based.  You know, because people are holding their hands there.  And you can see it's staining here.  Its age is starting to show.  To show, it certainly is.  You can see here, I noticed over here, I mean, look at all the, just the peeling and it needs a bit of love.  We go through into the center here.  And here on the right, where I just was, there's another empty tenancy.  It's closed up.  I was surprised how many of them were closed, even at this time on Sunday.  I'm used to, in Brisbane, all of them being open.  And here's Rachel in this large play area, another play area for children.  Which is great as a parent.  It's fine.  They've got stuff to play with.  The kids were having a ball.  But that's not really going to make them any money.  Are you going to go there as a parent just to play in this little space?  Another one.  Empty.  Another hoarding.  And here we have an approach to right.  there is the cinema.  You've got Hungry Jackson, a few food premises there.  So the upper story of, because it's a two-story complex, the upper story was the one with the larger number of empty tenancies there or spaces that have been converted to these additional uses.  Food bank advertising.  And I have a look here at just the planning to see what the quality is in there.  It's all the fake plants and the stuff in there.  That's not too bad, at least they've kept it clean.  And this is the book swap, and I just have an image there to show you.  It's where you go in and swap a book, and there's Otilia playing.  You know, the kids were having a ball.  The book swap was an odd one. ",
