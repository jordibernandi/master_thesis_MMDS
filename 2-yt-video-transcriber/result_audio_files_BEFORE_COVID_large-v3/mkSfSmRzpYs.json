I mean, between marriage, love, finance, kids, everything under the sun.  We didn't want it to encompass just relationship issues or topics.  Right.  So, yeah, we're about seven episodes in.  It airs every Wednesday.  They show you subscribe where you listen and all that good stuff for podcasts.  So, so far, it's been great. ",

Like, we do have listener letters.  People will write in and will give our advice, but we never want to put ourselves on a pedestal as if this is what people should aspire to do.  However, we do feel like it's important for us to show you can be an individual, you can support each other, you can goal chase, you can dream chase, you can have children, you can be a mom, you can bounce right back.  There's so many things that I want to show people, and my husband and I want to show people that we can do, that it is possible.  Is there a pressure around it?  A little bit.  But we don't get too involved in that.  We feel like we're also content creators.  Our YouTube channel, this really started with us trying to, as content creators and as actors, put our reel out there.  What better way to do it than on social media?  It's free, people have access, and now we've accessed so many people, and it's become kind of like this movement for us, inadvertently, that we didn't plan for, but we accept the challenge. ",

The biggest issue, I think, with a lot of relationships is having the outside noise that drowns what it is.  you two have decided on.  If this is what you decided on because it works for both of you and it makes you happy... Why?  Do it.  Do it.  So I would never sit here and judge and say, maybe it doesn't work for Daval and I to have an open relationship, but the farthest thing from our minds is to judge anybody who does decide on it.  I've heard that it's an oxymoron.  Why have a marriage if you're going to be open?  And in what terms is it open?  Is it just open sexually?  Is it open, you know, in terms of having a whole entire other relationship?  I know there was a show on, was it TLC?  Yeah.  Sister Why?  Seeking Sister Why? ",
