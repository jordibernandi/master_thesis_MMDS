            "text": "Just under a year ago when I saw Infinity War, I went and saw it with my mom, and there's, you know, the after-credits scene with the pager, and in the middle of everybody that stayed for the scene.  I'm like, Carol!  My mom had no clue who Carol was.  About a week before Captain Marvel came out, we were watching a Captain Marvel trailer, and I was like, that's Carol.  And she was like, that's Carol?  I was like, yes.  Hello everybody, it's the Princess, and I saw Captain Marvel.  Funny story about this shirt.  Sarah and I went to Disney with some of our queer friends, and I got, hmm, not terribly sunburnt, but sunburnt enough that I only had a tank top for the next day and didn't want to exacerbate the problem.  So we went to Disney Springs, and this was the only shirt that I even marginally like.  You can't see the bottom of it, but there's a little red patch that I like a lot.  So I bought this and then sat through the rest of Saturday having people ask me time and time again if I had seen the movie yet.  Every cast member that had already seen it pretty much said the exact same thing, where they were all telling me that you get some backstory about some of the characters from earlier Marvel movies and it was pretty good, they all really liked it.  So I went into the movie pretty optimistic.  I've been optimistic about this movie since they announced that it was going to be made.  My review has been split into pros and cons.  I made a list.  We're going to start with A couple pros go into the cons, and I think I'm going to try to end with a couple more pros, just so that it ends nicely.  I will admit that I was one of those people that was like, I don't know so much about Brie Larson, and I regret thinking that at the very beginning, but, you know, you live and you learn.  And now having seen the movie, I, um... love Brie Larson.  I just haven't appreciated her correctly and I want to make up- I want to make reparations for that because she's great!  I like her a lot!  I'm not saying that I'm attracted to her, but I'm kind of attracted to her.  The costume designer of Captain Marvel probably didn't, but hopefully, recognizes that queer women and queer people that are attracted to Brie Larson don't need her in the earlier Captain Marvel, Miss Marvel costumes.  You put her on screen, you make her kick Jude Law's ass, and we fall in love with her.  Wouldn't you know it?  I saw somebody on my Instagram feed talking about not really knowing who Carol is and that's like a problem for them.  My counter to that is that Carol doesn't really know who Carol is.  I'm not bothered by the identity crisis because Carol has a lot of figuring things out to do.  I thought the writing was pretty solid.  There were like, you know, maybe a few little mishaps here and there, nothing that immediately comes to mind specifically because I don't remember things very well, but I didn't really have a problem with most of the writing and thought it was, you know, pretty good storytelling.  Not like fantastic, perfect storytelling and writing or anything, but I also don't think it needs to be.  It's a superhero movie and even people that don't particularly know who Carol is or care about Ms.  Marvel or Captain Marvel, they're gonna go see it because it's a Marvel movie.  That just happens.  If you have seen my video about Still Star-Crossed, you know how I feel about Lashana Lynch.  I love Lashana Lynch.  There wasn't enough of her for me in this movie, and that's not really even like a critique or a judgment.  I personally just wanted more Lashana Lynch.  So, you know, there's a lot of talk about Captain Marvel being, like, military propaganda and it's this weird gray area that I don't completely understand for reasons.  And I don't think I necessarily went into the movie with that mindset.  I tried not to because I'm trying to judge Captain Marvel the way I would judge literally any other Marvel movie rather than hold it to a higher standard.  And the movie itself really is not very heavy in the military propaganda.  It really actually doesn't have a lot of good things to say about the military.  The whole point of Captain Marvel is that Carol rejects the imperialistic group that she's been brainwashed into thinking that she's a part of, and that makes her more powerful.  Even the things that it has to say about the Air Force are not great.  I kept forgetting that Ben Mendelsohn was in this movie and then all of a sudden he just shows up and I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, that guy!  Director Krennic!  Right!  He's in this!  I very much appreciated his Australian accent.  I liked that a lot.  And I think he did a really good job with this character.  I wasn't expecting the twist with the character and I did really like it.  I think the only reason that I have any kind of hesitation to say that is because Disney as a company has kind of been leaning towards this kind of twist, but specifically with their villains.  The character that Ben Mendelsohn plays kind of plays with that trope, but doesn't do the same thing that Hans does, so... I'm good with it.  Coulson was there.  I love Coulson.  I love Phil Coulson.  I watched Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  for probably like two or three seasons before.  I probably went to England and forgot about it, but I watched because I loved Coulson so much, and so seeing Coulson alive in the MCU again was great.  And spinning off of that, Fury was an actual human being.  I like Nick Fury.  He's great.  I think especially like in The Winter Soldier.  He's like a major part of that movie, and it's fascinating.  And I also think that for the most part, Marvel movies do not treat Nick Fury as a human being.  He is just the director of S.H.I.E.L.D He's kind of a shadowy figure, and that works for some of the Marvel movies.  But I like that.  this movie humanizes him and gives him maybe not a fully fleshed background, because he is still a very secretive person, but the fact that he like sort of almost gives little details about himself, definitely makes him more of a real person and not just a shadow and a spy.  And where he gets the name for the Avengers, I cried a little bit.  So here are my cons list.  There was already an issue of people wanting Monica in the movie as Captain Marvel because she was Captain Marvel before Carol, and I kind of know why they didn't do that.  And I kind of know why they gave Maria a daughter named Monica, but I kind of also think that Maria could have been Monica.  I'm not angry that she wasn't, and I'm not angry that Monica was a child, because that means that Monica eventually grows up.  Monica is probably only a couple years older than me at the most.  It's a complicated feeling.  So the thing is that this movie does not focus on romance.  Sarah makes the point that the movie does not point in any direction as to who Carol is sexually or romantically attracted to, because she's not.  And I think a big part of that is the fact that Carol has no idea who Carol was.  I mean, she's like dropped on an alien planet alien to her.  She's dropped on an alien planet that she can't remember ever being on, doesn't know anybody, can't remember any of her past except for like the little flashes that she gets in dreams, but she doesn't have any way to make sense of those things.  Since Carol isn't really focused on who Carol is going to kiss, the movie isn't either.  And I recognize that.  There were a few times in the movie where I was like, this woman is queer, 100%.  There are just a lot of things that I think people could pick up on, whether or not it is something that the movie necessarily wants you to focus on, and I hesitate at that point to say that it's, like, baity, because if the movie really isn't about any of that, is it really baity?  It just almost feels like it is because I... maybe I'm projecting and that's okay.  If I recognize that I'm projecting, it's not the fault of the movie.  I think most of where I'm coming from as far as the movie possibly being a little baity is the fact that I know Marvel and Disney and that they rely very heavily on the Chinese film market, and so they will never really say whether or not Carol was queer.  I will give the movie the credit that it is due in the fact that, like, it really does not focus at all on any kind of romantic or sexual relationship with Carol, and a lot of that has to do with the fact, again, that Carol doesn't know who Carol is.  So for years people have been complaining about color grading and lighting in Marvel movies and how a lot of Marvel movies tend to be very dull on the color scale.  I think Captain Marvel kind of falls back into the more dull color scale and I think I am almost positive that the like the set designer or anybody that was doing like lighting work was probably white.  And I say that because there was at least one point for every single dark-skinned actor in this movie that I just could not see them.  They were not lit very well.  There is a scene where Lashana Lynch, who is very dark-skinned, and Brie Larson are sitting at a table in front of a window in New Orleans, and I honestly cannot tell you what happened in that conversation because all I could see was the foliage outside behind them.  So the thing about living in the South is that you very quickly recognize that the sun is bright.  What you really shouldn't do, especially when you have somebody so dark-skinned, is film it in front of a window that becomes overexposed, because then all you can see is the white light from outside and the foliage around them, and you can't really see the actress, at all.  You can only see the white actress sitting right across from her, and that is distracting, and I think kind of an oversight.  Jaiman Hunsu also is in this movie, and he plays a character that he played in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie.  There were also times where the scene was so dark that I could not see him standing next to Jude Law at all.  There's no reason for them to be that dark.  I should be able to see Jaiman Hunsu if you're gonna put him in the movie.  I really didn't follow or care about Jude Law's character very much.  He was there.  Ronan.  Let's get into Ronan.  For the love of God, Marvel, just find a good use for Lee Pace, please.  Lee Pace is such a lovely man, and then they do this to him, and I'm just like, you don't make me care about him, and that is a travesty.  So in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, Ronan is the main villain, and I don't know if you remember that because he's completely forgettable.  Ronan definitely fell very far into the deep cavern of forgettable Marvel villains, and once again kind of does.  And it's a shame because Lee Pace plays Ronan!  I think Ronan actually fits better into the narrative of Captain Marvel than he did into the narrative of Guardians of the Galaxy, but I still think that he didn't really do anything.  I think more so than Jaiman Hansu's character, Ronan just kind of felt weaseled in to be like, hey look, he intersects with another Marvel movie!  Let's put Lee Pace in this movie!  And I can get with that sentiment, but not so much the idea that like he's just kind of there.  Back to the rest of my pros.  Got a new character out of Gemma Chan.  I quite liked her character, even though I wasn't supposed to like her.  Here's the thing about that.  I like Gemma Chan.  I kind of already complained about this, but wow, Carol is pretty queer.  Maybe Carol doesn't even know that she's queer, but I do, and that's kind of what's important.  I really liked the music choice.  I mean, we had Nirvana and, no doubt, 90s music that I really like.  Goose is the true star of the movie.  Everybody loves Goose.  Everybody loved Goose, like, before the movie came out, and now that the movie's out, everybody really, really loves Goose.  The fact Carol is the most powerful when she denies that her power was given to her and takes control of it for herself.  Yeah, two thumbs up from me on that.  Also this is very little to do with Captain Marvel, but the endgame scene.  the day before this trailer came out I had tweeted that like I wasn't ready to relive all of Thor's trauma and then Marvel gives me I like this one.  You got the protector of the lesbians and the goddess of the lesbians and they are Best friends forever.  I really, really enjoyed the movie.  I would definitely go see it again.  I really, genuinely love Carol.  Those are all of my thoughts on Captain Marvel, I think.  Thank you so much for watching this video.
