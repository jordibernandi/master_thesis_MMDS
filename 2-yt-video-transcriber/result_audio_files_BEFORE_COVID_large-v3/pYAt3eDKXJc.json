            "text": "Senator Harris, first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House.  We need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together.  I believe I am that candidate.  We have to bring justice back to America for all people and not just for some.  I spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom speaking five words, Kamala Harris, for the people.  And it was about all the people.  We need someone on this debate stage in November who has the ability to unify the country and to win the election.  The issue really is not what is the fight.  The issue has to be how we go and win.  Women are not paid equal for equal work in America.  We passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, but fast forward to the year of our Lord, 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American women 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.  There's a whole collection of work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and therefore the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved.  It is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s.  People are having children in their 30s, often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents.  which requires a lot of work.  Many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family or whether they are going to give up a paycheck.  that is part of what that family relies on.  So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women's lives today.  When black women... are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America, when the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death, when black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be, where you been and what are you going to do?  And do you understand who the people are?  Donald Trump got punked.  He has traded a photo op for nothing.  He has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea's nuclear program.  He has conducted foreign policy since day one, born out of a very fragile ego.  Part of the strength of who we are as a nation, and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure, is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.  What Donald Trump has done, from pulling out of the Paris Agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including, most recently, the Kurds.  Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation.  It's unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who, during the Obama administration, spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama.  That's ridiculous, Senator Harris.  That's ridiculous.  Who has spent full-time Criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party when Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower.  fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the Democratic Party.  What we need on the stage in November is someone who has the ability to win.  And I have taken on Jeff Sessions.  I have taken on Bill Barr.  I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh.  I know I have the ability to do that.  In this election, justice and the various injustices people are facing, regardless of where they live or their race or gender, are very much on the ballot from economic justice to reproductive justice to healthcare justice to educational justice.  And I truly believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will then unlock the potential of the American people and the promise of America.  And that's the America I believe in.  That's the America I see and that is why I'm running for president.  Thank you, Senator Harris. ",
