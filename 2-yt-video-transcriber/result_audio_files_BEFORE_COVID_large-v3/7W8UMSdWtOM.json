            "text": "When somebody else knows more about yourself than you know of yourself, then you have volunteered slavery all over again.  The real reason why I believe black people truly won't fight back with white folks is because of religion.  In our mind, we keep forgiving white people because in our head, subliminally, we see Jesus.  The thing about being conscious and truthful is you gotta be tough.  You gotta be ready to get violent because people are always gonna try to take advantage of you.  Because if you're winning, they're losing.  And those guys cheat and you don't.  So you gotta be, they gotta know not to play with you.  They gotta know, you can't really think that you're just gonna have an opinion without some muscle.  The entire civilization is built on keeping the black man and the black woman apart.  Right now, every white population in the world is at minus birth.  Every single one, all right?  What are they going to do then?  They need our bodies.  In the 60s, they banned martial artists.  They had registration of people's hands and feet because it was something they didn't quite understand.  And plus, when people came from the armed forces and started using karate, it was dangerous at that time.  You know, we're suffering from, like, high blood pressure and swollen ankles and everything.  Like, what fight are we going to take on?  And people be like, yo, Black Power, put your boots on this white man's neck.  And I be like, man, you can't even strap your boots because your ankles are swollen.  You can't even wear boots.  In neighborhoods that are of a more upscale, financially affluent society, white, Jewish, et cetera, they are infused with fertility clinics.  While in our societies, the ones that do not have that elevated level of economics, black and brown, impoverished communities have abortion clinics.  Process schools have to be preserved.  And you only preserve that which is dead.  The fear of the little white girl taking down her new kids on the block poster and putting EZE up over her bedroom set was something that had to be addressed.  Africans have defended territory, defended ideals, and defended themselves consistently over thousands of years, including in the United States.  To be a successful colonizer, you not only colonize and you dominate the people physically, you have to dominate them psychologically.  The first revolution Gil Scott-Hellen tells us is the revolution in the mind. ",
