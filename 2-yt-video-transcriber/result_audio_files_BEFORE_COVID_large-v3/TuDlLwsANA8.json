No other country in the world allows you to come into their country illegally and stay.  this is my country.  we let europeans over a long time ago without anything and they took from us and they moved us from our our land and lose us on reservations.  but so i'm just saying this you know if europeans can come over here and take what they want why can't anybody else?  and plus the immigrants that are coming up and the immigrants And the immigrants that are coming up here, this is their land, too.  They're indigenous to this country.  North America, they're indigenous to this country.  Very correct.  No, no, very correct.  Come through the front door.  But that's the matter.  Show what you came from the front door.  I know you're not American, but I'm just saying.  Did you just assume that I'm not American?  No, you're not indigenous to this country.  You're Asian.  But I would love to come through the front door.  That's fine.  You know what?  You're right.  We brought refugees over.  I don't mind about that.  I don't mind about that.  Actually, Europe started taxes.  So anyway.  What about the fact that it's the United States that's devastating South of Central America?  What about the fact that it's the United States that's devastating Central America and forcing people up here?  Completely irrelevant topic.  It's not irrelevant at all.  It's the United States that's causing these conditions.  That has everything to do with immigration.  Everything.  That's why people are... Why would people flee with their children?  To Greece?  They are coming to Greece.  Yes.  People are fleeing.  You're brown just like me.  People are fleeing.  Actually, you are.  People are fleeing from the... You're Mediterranean.  I am.  I mean, I don't even know what you are.  Are you African?  Are you Asian?  Are you European?  I don't know.  Tell me.  We're American.  The point is people are fleeing the conditions that the United States created.  That's why people are coming here.  What about that?  We should do what?  Continue devastating those countries? ",

So you can't say that.  I get it.  I get it, what you're saying.  But you have to be technical when you say what you want to say.  If you're against, I agree with you.  But I did think you were Asian.  I thought you were from India.  So, but... That's a person.  That's very racist.  Why am I racist?  Why?  I love Indians.  Like, you know what?  I love everybody.  You know what?  Because I don't care.  Like, I'm chill.  If you call me that, like, I... It's like everyone's so emotional, man.  Everyone gets so freaking emotional, man.  It's like, relax!  It's so funny that everybody does get emotional, but the fact is that European and anybody that is not indigenous to this country are immigrants.  Correct.  So white people... When my father came over here, he went through the process.  He paid the fine, and he paid the dues, and he had to wait.  I know.  I don't think it should cost.  Why should it cost?  Why should it cost to come into somebody else's country?  Because everyone has to pay their dues.  Does it cost us to go to Europe?  No.  No, but to live there and make money there and work there in the country?  Absolutely.  Let me ask you something.  Are you going to work in the fields?  yeah you're gonna work in the field.  i would if i had to and i would declare citizenship.  would you?  would you i work construction?  what do i need to do in the fields?  okay well i'm just saying what's the difference?  i pay my dues i pay my taxes every time my paycheck i pay my taxes.  congratulations exactly good yeah.  so what is the problem with everyone paying their taxes?  nothing.  Why would people make that journey with their children knowing what could happen?  They are fleeing something that we caused.  So we caused the conditions by which they are fleeing to come.  We absolutely created those conditions.  That's why they're fleeing.  That's why they're risking their children's lives. ",

What happens, just like she said, if we call the United States, because we're not going to call it America.  Don't get that on video.  We've got a little more, but come on, keep going.  If the United States and they're coming over because of what we cause why wouldn't we let them in?  they're not here just to move in they're here to get to for a safe haven.  they want to be safe.  no i completely agree.  i completely understand and i work with illegal immigrants and i work with them.  i'm around them in the construction business in new jersey in new york.  There is no other way around it.  It's around.  I am completely fine with them.  I talk to them.  I shake their hand.  It's all good.  But I would love for them to come through this country, through the front door, pay their taxes.  How can they when things are so devastating and the process is so long in conditions that we, once again, that we call?  How can my family do it when they're coming from Greece and Italy?  Where they fling devastating, life-threatening conditions.  with you in an earthquake.  I mean, I don't understand.  Okay, so my question to you is, what is your solution for them?  If their country is so bad and devastated, what is your country?  Maybe America can help that country out.  Exactly.  You made a very good point.  Maybe we could work together with these countries.  It's not working together.  We have caused it.  So we need to stop causing it.  That is totally out of my power.  I don't know if these countries can work together.  It's not out of Trump's power at all.  Yeah.  That's his fight.  Did you see what he tweeted today?  I don't have Twitter.  I'm not on social media.  I don't fucking support his own stuff.  But he said if these people don't want to live in cages and don't want to live in these concentration camps or whatever camps they are, then don't come to this country.  So basically, he doesn't care.  He doesn't care what United States, not America, because they're from America, too.  They're American, too.  The people from the United States... actually cause them to come up here.  Right.  So I don't support screwing up other countries and getting all these wars and doing all that.  Right.  But we we only have today and we only have the future, really.  So I feel like There should be efforts and there should be help in building and helping those other countries. ",

Are they criminals?  Are you saying the people, the immigrants are criminals?  No.  Okay.  Wait, so, immigrants?  Yeah.  No, that's not what I'm saying.  So the people south of the border, they're illegal?  Not necessarily.  Because, like I said, Europe sent their criminals, the people that they didn't like, over to the United States.  I'm just saying.  You know, what's good for the news is good for the gander.  So if Europeans can come over here, then the people from South America, the indigenous people, which this is their land, can come over here.  We actually have to leave.  I'm sorry.
