            "text": "Let me give you an idea of what the transgender movement, the ideology, is really all about.  A transgender person in Canada by the name of Jessica Yaniv, former name Jonathan Yaniv, was born a biological man and now identifies as a woman.  But this person still has male genitalia.  And he is still attracted to women, he says.  He calls himself a proud lesbian.  So this transgender person, Yaniv, forced an immigrant woman in Canada to close down her business after the immigrant woman declined to wax Yaniv's testicles, and he sued her for that.  The immigrant woman, who was an esthetician, could not afford to fight the lawsuit, so she had to shut down her waxing business.  But Yaniv, the transgender person, sued the esthetician for a violation of his human rights.  Because according to the transgender ideology, transgender women aren't men, even though they're biologically men.  They aren't even transgender women.  They are real women if they identify as a woman, even if they were born male and have male genitalia like Jessica Yaniv.  This is what the transgender ideology is all about.  And so, according to the transgender ideology, biological men who identify as women have a human right to use the law to force women to touch their testicles even if the woman doesn't want to.  That is what the transgender ideology is all about.  Now, thank God Yaniv lost this lawsuit yesterday with the tribunal in Canada declaring that Yaniv cannot force estheticians to touch his genitalia without consent.  But don't kid yourselves.  The transgender ideology lost this particular battle, but they're not giving up on the war.  Because meanwhile, the feminine product brand Always that sells menstrual pads announced today that they are removing the Venus symbol, which is the symbol for females, from their pad packaging to be more inclusive of transgender men who have periods.  I swear to you, I am not making this up.  Now, you might be thinking, only women menstruate.  Only biological women have periods.  I can't believe we're at the point that I actually have to say that only women have periods, but that is what the transgender ideology is all about.  It's not about tolerance.  It's not about compassion, because we should be extremely compassionate to people who suffer from gender dysphoria.  It's not about inclusivity.  It's not about acceptance.  It's certainly not about biology or science.  No.  The transgender ideology is nothing more than political manipulation that will inevitably lead to government-mandated speech control, thought control, and the destruction of objective truth.  Only men have testicles.  Only women have periods.  And if we don't stop this transgender ideology, soon it could be illegal to say that. ",
