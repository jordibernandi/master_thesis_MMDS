            "text": "For one thing, there were plenty of problems during the Chavez years, but on the other hand, poverty was very sharply reduced.  Educational opportunities are greatly expanded.  There are regular polls taken of Latin American countries by the major Latin American polling agency, Latino Barometro.  It's in Chile, not at all sympathetic to Chavez.  Take a look at their polls through the Chavez years.  Venezuela ranked right at the top, along with Uruguay, in public popular support for democracy and popular support for the government.  There was a reason for that.  There was election after election, referendum after referendum, carefully monitored.  The Carter Monitoring Foundation, among others, determined that the Venezuelan elections were among the most free in the world.  Okay, that's a record of how the population felt, and there were reasons for it.  There were serious errors.  Actually, I've been criticizing for years.  One was failure to change the colonial economy.  The U.S.  has been running Venezuela for a century, since it kicked out the British under Woodrow Wilson.  When oil was discovered, the U.S.  expelled Britain.  unceremoniously and essentially took over the country.  And since then, it's been pretty much dominating it.  Lots of hideous atrocities, don't have to go through that.  But one effect was that the economy was almost entirely based on oil.  Now, one of Chavez's errors was not to change that.  The economy is still overwhelmingly based on oil.  It was not diversified.  A second Here I'm quoting the chief opposition economist, Francisco Rodriguez.  That's a spokesman for the opposition, serious economist.  He says a serious error of the Chavez government was not to put aside reserves during the period of high oil prices, rather to expend the reserves.  They were spent on social programs and others inside the country.  They were spent on internationalist efforts to, say, provide cheap oil to Haiti, which obviously could barely survive, and many others.  Also, despite the crazy talk about socialism, he left the capitalist class untouched, allowed them to enrich themselves.  In fact, during this whole period, to that limited extent, the critique you mentioned is correct.  What all that meant was that when the After his death, a couple of years after, the oil price declined, and the government did not have reserves on hand to try to deal with the crisis.  So they had to go to the international credit markets.  I don't have to tell you who runs them, so you can guess what the reaction is.  Then came the sanctions, which are harsh, brutal, devastating the population.  I'll again quote Rodriguez, the chief opposition economist and a serious economist, he points out that the sanctions have turned a crisis into a humanitarian catastrophe.  And by now, the latest sanctions literally bar the government from almost any resources.  It's an effort to starve the population into submission.  Now, Maduro, his own policies have been awful in many respects, economic repression and others.  But this is in the face of constant subversion.  Talk about the media again.  For ever since the beginning of the Chavez years, the media have been virtually an open voice for the anti-Chavez opposition in ways that are almost unimaginable.  So for example, in 2002, at the beginning of the Chavez years, there was a military coup.  There was a coup which threw out the government, threw out the president, dismantled the parliament, threw out the Supreme Court.  The US, of course, openly supported it.  Take a look at the media, the New York Times.  They applauded it.  They thought, hey, this is wonderful.  We're getting back to freedom and democracy.  Well, the coup was pretty quickly overthrown by a popular uprising.  Has anyone ever withdrawn their praise for the military coup?  And after that came years of subversion, sabotage, internal problems and errors, some of them very serious.  I could say that I was personally one of the people who was actually very active in opposing human rights violations.  But to disregard the achievements of those years and the popular support for them, not only in the polls but in elections, a fair election after election.  That's ridiculous.  And by now, the media barely even pretend to be covering the situation.  Their opposition, the New York Times, the Washington Post, it's true, the European major media, they're simply journals for the opposition.  That's what they describe.  There's a lot to be said.  There's no time here to go into the full details, but It's a really atrocious situation.  And what is happening, as you mentioned, is a soft coup, a stranglehold, which will lead to somehow the overthrow of the government and the return of Venezuela to the kinds of circumstances that you see in the other U.S.-run countries of the region.  You want to look at atrocities, crimes, and so on.  Simply look at the countries that the U.S.  has maintained where it's maintained control.  The Central American countries, Colombia, which is the most dangerous country in the world for union activists and human rights activists.  Again, there's just no time to go through the details. ",
