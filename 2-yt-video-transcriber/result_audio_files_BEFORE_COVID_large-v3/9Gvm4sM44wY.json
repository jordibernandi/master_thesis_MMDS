You're allowed to film anything that you like from where you're standing.  The only thing that I would ask is make sure that you're not actually in the driveway as the things are opening because we don't want you guys to get hit.  Sometimes we fly out of there pretty quick.  Can I ask you a question?  Sure.  Why do all your officers have blacked out tinted windows all the way around?  Is that standard for police officers or what?  On the cars themselves?  Yeah, on their personal vehicles.  You guys are above the law like that or what?  No, not at all.  And why do you allow them to have tinted windows?  I haven't actually gone through the parking lot to check whether the windows are tinted or not.  I don't know if they've got any kind of medical excuses or anything like that.  That's something that I have to check up on.  Would you like me to check up on that?  That's a ridiculous excuse.  You know why?  Because your patrol cars don't have tinted windows all the way around them.  They ride in them all day long.  Okay, would you like to make a complaint?  I would.  Okay, absolutely.  I'll send a supervisor out to get your information.  We'll go ahead and take a complaint for that.  I'll just do it online.  I'm not giving you my information today.  Okay, all right.  It is a problem when you guys are pulling people over for breaking the law about the tinted windows and whatnot.  You guys are also doing the same.  Fair enough.  How do you feel that you guys are above the law?  I already indicated that I don't think that we are.  No?  Do you have tinted windows on your vehicle?  I have tinted windows on the back of my vehicle. ",
