For a lot of trans people, it makes them question their interests, their expression.  I second-guessed myself a lot growing up because there were a lot of things I liked that were stereotypically boyish that I was very much into and still am into.  I think there's a room for everyone to like what they like, express themselves however they want.  I think that people can understand and get over their biases and their assumptions about how gender stereotypes work.  I think it allows not just trans people but cis people as well to put aside their fears or their generalizations and express themselves in a more truthful manner. ",

I prefer to wear jeans, t-shirt and a jacket usually and that in no way means that I'm less trans or less of a woman.  everybody has a different self-expression and it is really a very bad and inaccurate way of judging somebody's gender identity.

The medical profession is a bit behind on this and I think they need to get a bit more aware of issues regarding trans and non-binary people.

And I thought that was quite a strange assumption to make.  that just because I'd said I didn't want bottom surgery but I would be non-binary because I'd always said that I was like a binary trans man.  It was great that she kind of recognised that gender was a spectrum and that not everyone attending the clinic would be a binary trans person but to assume that a binary trans person wouldn't want bottom surgery or someone not wanting bottom surgery would be non-binary I thought was kind of a bit of a jump to make.

People need to pretend they are something that they aren't.  They need to perform to different standards of gender, different expectations of masculinity and femininity that cisgender people would not be held to in that kind of situation.  There's also been a lot of experience of having to jump through hoops.  It almost feels like you're having to do like an exam or a test to prove that you are trans enough and to kind of have to live up to society's expectations as opposed to being true to yourself, which should be the whole point of this process.

Because if somebody has crippling gender dysphoria and they feel this way every time they look in the mirror and every time they walk out of the house, of course that is going to then give anxiety and possibly depression and other things.  And irrespective of whether a deed poll has happened, a trans person deserves to have their chosen name and their chosen pronouns respected.  When I personally went to the GP and told them about my name change, they refused to update any documents without a deed poll and even then they took a very long time to do so because they didn't see it as something that was that important.

You don't need that.  You're a man.  Men don't need those.  And then I have to go into detail and explain, no, it's because I'm trans.  I do need those.  Some men do need those.

And I mean, I was only 15 at the time and I was having to research how I should be taking care of my own health when I kind of hoped to go to a professional and they would explain that to me.  So after, again, I started hormones, I was basically checking in with my doctor, making sure that they'd received my prescriptions, was checking up on when I was having lighters come through from the gender clinic to them.  so I was basically acting like a middleman the entire time.
