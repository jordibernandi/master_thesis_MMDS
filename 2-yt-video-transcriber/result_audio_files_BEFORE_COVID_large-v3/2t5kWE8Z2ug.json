Because it's like when we talk about consent, sexual assault, things like that, we often have a conversation where it's like, well, why didn't she leave?  Why didn't she say no?  And we're never like, well, why did he do it?  You know what I mean?  And we know most men don't do it.  So I think if you, for starters, you might want to work as a man on... reading your partner.  Does someone seem uncomfortable?  Can you tell if a person is uncomfortable?  I think men can.  Absolutely.  And if you can't, you want to examine that.  You know what I mean?  That you don't need to avoid someone because you think you're not going to know, you're going to totally misread the situation. ",

And that's how we find ourselves in this situation, is when you prove that you have power, that you're a powerful man, by what you can do to other people or what you can do in the world, I think that's a problem.  So I think a good man today is someone who is self-reflective, who is committed to integrity in his relationships, who can make amends.  I think there's real strength in that.  And I think that's pointing towards the kind of masculinity I want to see in the future.  When we give men the freedom to be flexible in who they are, you're strong when you need to be strong, and you can be tender when you need to be tender, and you don't have to just be this hard shell all the time, I think that's when we're going to see real change in men.
