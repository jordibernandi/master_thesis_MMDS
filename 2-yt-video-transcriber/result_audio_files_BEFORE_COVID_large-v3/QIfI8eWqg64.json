            "text": "History provides me with no shortage of mad lads who have more than earned their title but in this instance we have a warlord.  Now that alone already makes someone quite a mad lad.  but what makes this one special is he was probably one of the first ever shitposters and he had a really fucked up sense of humour.  I'm going to pronounce every single name in this video wrong.  The dog meat general, Zhang Zhongchang.  But before we get into the mad lines... Yeah, you guessed it, it's Raid Shadow Legends.  The hottest mobile game of this year, Raid Shadow Legends has been downloaded over 10 million times in just three months and best thing is, it's free to play.  This very detailed and fun game has over 400 champions for you to collect, all with different special abilities and different builds.  Right now my favourite champion is the Crusader.  Because... You can play through the storyline solo, fight other players in the PvP arena or you can get friends to join your clan and go on raids.  I find this game really fun as do a lot of people because Raid has nearly a perfect score on the Play Store.  There is now also a rewards program for new players where you can get daily login rewards for the first 90 days.  So save me from queuing up at the Job Center and click the link down in the description where you'll get 50,000 free silver and a free epic champion as part of the new player program.  The Tories are still in power.  Please don't make me go back to the job centre.  Click the link.  Zhongchang was born in Shandong, China in February of 1881.  He was born into poverty and in 1911 he ended up joining up with a criminal gang and he became a bandit.  The gang overall managed to rise to power by offering their services to Jiangsu's military governor as mercenaries to. ",
