            "text": "Hey, fam, I want you to like, share, and subscribe to our YouTube channel, youtube.com.  forward slash Roland S. Martin.  And don't forget to turn on your notifications.  I got to play this video, y'all.  So we saw this video.  First of all, I didn't realize somebody black lived in Montana.  That's one.  That's one.  There's a sister named Angela Whitehead.  These cops from the Billings, Montana police department.  Walked into her apartment without asking Angela's permission.  They didn't knock on the door.  Woo!  Check out Angela.  You cannot come in my home.  I did not give him permission to come.  Thank you.  It's an altercation.  There was no altercation.  I don't give a damn what you heard.  I don't give a damn what you heard.  You understand what I'm saying?  No, because this is my home, and this is my property, and I'm telling you to leave my home.  That's what I'm telling you.  This is my house.  I pay these people.  You crazy?  I show head coming up in my house?  You must be crazy coming up in here talking about.  you heard something.  You heard me talking.  I talk loud and I'm aggressive.  And guess what?  You did not knock on my door.  There's no weapons here.  There's nothing going on here.  And you are violating my rights, sweetheart.  Now, tell me that I'm fucking wrong.  You can't, because I'm not wrong.  You do not, you do not come in my home without my permission.  Period.  I don't care what you got.  I don't care what you got.  Because guess what?  If I hadn't just came in the house from smoking a cigarette, this door would have been closed and your ass would have had to knock.  You do not fucking come in my house without my permission.  With your white ass, and I'm black, and I'm scared of you.  So guess what?  I don't care.  I don't want to hear it.  I don't want to hear it.  That's why you're screaming.  I'm screaming because you're in my space.  This is my home.  This is where my kids live.  How do I know you wasn't coming up here with a fucking gun?  Black people killer?  How do I know that?  I don't.  So guess what?  I'm aggressive.  I'm being hostile like you guys call us because you came up in my home.  Stop playing.  You got the wrong black girl on the right day, baby.  What do you want?  What do you want?  Goodbye.  I know my rights.  They cannot walk in my home.  Because if this door was closed, they would have had to knock.  Don't ever do that again.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  Okay, y'all.  Y'all ended the good part out.  All right, let me go ahead and do it, okay?  It's a brother who's off.  Oh, I can't believe.  y'all ended the good part.  Oh, man.  It's a brother who's off screen.  He's trying to be reasonable.  She's like, shut up.  My house.  Let's go back to the cop.  She's jumping the cops ass.  brother start talking.  You'll have the good stuff out.  it was a brother who's trying to calm her.  she was like No, she said I run this house Dog.  she said it Did she really?  She said, I pay the bills.  She's like, Kevin, shut the hell up.  Yes, she did.  That's my cousin.  I played with her.  She's a member of my family.  Oh, but she was, you heard a noise.  Oh, God.  And you're going to walk into the apartment?  Knock, knock.  Knock, knock.  Just walk in.  Two policemen.  Hey, now.  We know who need to run for Congress from Montana.  Right?  And that'd be her campaign video.  But they stood at the video and they didn't say anything.  And then they left.  And then they left.  No, and at the end, you didn't hear the other part at the end where the cop said, ma'am, you really should take his advice.  Listen to him.  She's like, hell no.  Out.  We need to replicate that.  She was right.  Actually, that's why they just stood there because they were trying to figure out a way to gracefully to deescalate and just walk out.  Eventually, they just backed out.  They had no business.  You just a walk up in somebody's house.  You heard something.  He said, I got kids.  You heard me talking loud and I'm aggressive.  I love her.  I want to clone her.  I want to replicate her.  I'm telling y'all.  That's my spirit animal.  Did you tweet that out, that video out?  Oh, hell yes, I tweeted that out.  That's why I saw it.  I need to retweet that.  Dog, I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  And what I love about it when she's like, shut up!  Yeah?  She told her brother and I, he was trying to like, officer, everything, you know, it's, you know, officer.  Yeah, he was playing Mr.  Bojangles, and she wasn't having it.  Nope, no, she wasn't having it.  She said, I'm in my house, I'm scared.  I got kids, you got a gun.  I'm black, you white.  No, and you know what?  And the reason... The reason I wanted that on, the reason I wanted that on, because I'm serious, black people have gotten fed up.  And here's the other piece, and we talk about these shootings and stuff, black folks are tired in this damn country of having to be on our P's and Q's, change our tone, and wear a damn suit when we driving, okay?  Because we have to sit here and deal with some bullshit, okay, from folks every single day.  And I'm sorry.  I'm calling like it is.  We're tired of it.  We're tired of having to change everything about us to accommodate folks who are largely white who can't deal with the reality.  Okay?  I have seen... There's a video of a white woman.  Cops pull her son over.  White woman comes to the scene, cusses the cops out.  I'm talking about up and down.  This is the cop the whole time.  Ma'am... Ma'am, I understand.  Ma'am, you can't show me a black mama who would come to the scene.  The cops would say, you interfering with law enforcement.  She might have been shot.  I'm just saying that so Angela had enough.  Angela probably started to have your land video.  And she probably said everything else.  And then she also knew, you're in my house.  You crossed that threshold.  No warrant, no knock.  And that's why they had to back out.  Because they couldn't do resisting arrest.  They couldn't say this is only conduct because she was actually in her house.  She said, the door is only open because I was out there smoking my cigarette.  Otherwise, the door would have been closed.  And you would have had to knock.  And you would have had to knock.  And you would have had to knock.  All I'm saying is... And there were some big cops, too, man.  They were like 6'2\", 6'3\".  And they hadn't missed a meal.  Oh, hold on.  Wait, wait, hold on.  I think I found it.  I think I found it.  I think I found it.  Go to my iPad.  Go to my iPad.  I'm telling you, I'm going to give a fuck about what you're talking about.  Shut the fuck up.  Now, you shut up.  I don't care what he's talking about.  This is my house.  I pay these people.  You crazy?  I told y'all they cut the good stuff out.  I told y'all.  Kevin was talking.  Kevin was talking.  I ain't shut.  My advice to Kevin.  She aggressive.  Zip it.  You know?  Jackie.  Jackie.  Jackie Clark.  Jackie Clark, your job is to get Angela on the show tomorrow.  She was on Joe Madison's show this morning.  Your job is to get her on the show tomorrow.  We got to give Angela an image award.  Oh, yeah.  We got to give Angela an Image Award.  All right, y'all, we got to go.  I knew y'all would go.  Normally, we play some crazy-ass white person who lost their mind.  But Angela, Angela, Angela right there.
