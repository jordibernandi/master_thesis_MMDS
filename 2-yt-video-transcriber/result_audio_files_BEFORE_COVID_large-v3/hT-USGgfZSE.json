            "text": "I'm Roy Potter, a former U.S.  Army Lieutenant Colonel.  Welcome to the Potter Expositor.  Hi ladies and gentlemen, I'm Roy Potter and this is the Potter Expositor.  It is the 3rd of May 2019 and I'm recording this because I wanted to make sure that the quality, the sound, the picture and all of that is sufficient, actually better than sufficient, for the message that I have.  As most of you know, I've been calling on President Trump to ensure that he supports the first, second and fourth amendments at a minimum with aggressiveness.  And I have been very disappointed that he has not done that.  In the last few days, as most of you may know, There has been a step up in the censorship program by the leftist media, which also, I might add, if all of you will recall, I've been saying this for a long time, is supported by the CIA, the intelligence community.  The mainstream media and the social media Media platforms are, in fact, tools of control and propaganda by the intelligence community, all of it, from the CIA to the FBI to the Department of State, and even extends over to the Five Eyes and others, Five Eyes being, of course, the intelligence agencies of the United States and those belonging to the British Commonwealth under the British crown.  I won't name them here.  By now, we should all know what they are.  The point is, is that the censorship has now gotten to the point where even mentioning someone's name, specifically Alex Jones, Laurel Loomer, Paul Watson, InfoWars, or Milo Yiannopoulos can cause you to be banned as well.  This is beyond 1984, beyond Brave New World, beyond anything any tyrant has ever thought of instituting.  And if they did think of it, the only thing that kept them from doing it, of course, was the availability of technology.  They could keep them from talking in the town square, for instance, by arresting them, you know, like they did Jesus, for instance.  And that's really where we've come.  The leftist Marxists who control the IC and the coup against Trump and against us, the American people, control the mainstream media and the social media platforms.  The Chinese model has been instituted here.  We thought it might take longer, but it's actually well entrenched at this point, and it's just a matter of time before it gets worse.  They can attack your bank accounts.  They have, like MasterCard, made it so that if you're buying from any of those prohibited individuals, they can close your account or prevent the purchase or whatever.  We're also learning that they're monitoring our texts now and our phone calls for anything that might be deemed hate speech, which they define.  In other words, hate speech to them is anything that you say where you disagree with them.  This is very serious.  This is very serious.  And I've seen it coming and so have others for a long time.  It's prophesied in the scriptures.  I don't really care if you believe in the scriptures or not.  I'm talking about basically the Old Testament and the New Testament.  But it was talked about in there.  A lot of people are talking about this mark in your forehead and in your hand.  If you don't have it, you won't be able to buy or sell.  But God has a mark in your forehead as well if you read Revelations.  And what does that really mean?  Well, we talked about chips and we've talked about the barcodes.  We've talked about the nanotech that can track you, even your phone.  But in reality, while those might be tools of the evil side to accomplish their purposes, the real mark has to do with whether or not you have the law of God written in your heart and in your mind.  As I explained in a video some time ago, The ancient Israelites, and even the current Jews, although I think they've lost some of the understanding of this, wore what they called tzitzit, to remind them of the commandments.  It was usually put on a thing called a talit, which is a prayer shawl or a mobile tabernacle, a worship tent, more or less.  And tefillin, the tefillin also being called phylacteries, and they involved a band that was worn with a box on the head, and another one that was worn on the forearm about here attached to the hand.  What those symbolized were to have the law of God written in your mind, and this one in the arm is close to the heart, because it's kind of hard to wrap the heart, so they would do it on the hand.  So it's having the law of God written in your heart and in your mind.  Conversely, satanic followers have Satan's law written upon their hearts and their minds.  And that is where the, by their fruits you shall know them, comes in, really.  That's where it is.  I'm not saying that there couldn't be outward or even technological symbols and equipment that can further the cause and the identification process.  But in reality, that's what we're talking about is whether or not we are for God or we are for Satan.  Being for free speech, for the perfect law of liberty, for the right to be armed, to protect yourself and your family, to have the fruits of your own labor.  to be able to associate with whom you will, those are all gifts from God, and that is the law of God.  Now, there are some restrictions, of course.  You don't want to associate with people on a regular basis that can pollute you.  But at the same time, God will judge you by your works, by your faithfulness, by your fruits.  And that's really what it's about.  And those fruits will come from within the heart and from within the mind.  For it's not what a man takes into his mouth that defiles him, but that which comes out of his mouth, because that comes from the heart.  Remember that?  So I want to go on YouTube today.  And if they ban me, I don't care.  I think you know that that's how I felt for a long time.  I want to give my undivided, my total support to Alex Jones and Infowars, to Laura Loomer, who has done so much and suffered so much, and unfortunately has been abandoned by the very people she supported.  And I'm talking about Donald Trump.  As I've said for a long time, Donald Trump... expects loyalty, but he hasn't given it back.  And a lot of his supporters have been left as casualties along the roadside.  Now in battle, as I've talked about before, a commander can't be involved in the small fights of squads, even platoons or companies.  I'm talking about like a division or a corps commander.  He has to look at his objective and use his resources to obtain that, not take part in the local fights.  And I can't explain that any better than that.  But that's the principle.  I understand President Trump may having to do that.  But I don't know why he will not more forcefully go after supporting and defending the First, Second, and Fourth Amendments.  Because that should really be his objective.  And I've called for it for a long time.  And there have been some other people on, and I won't name them, on YouTube and on other sites that have said, my call for him to do that is all rubbish.  Well, if they silence you, my friends, you'll think otherwise.  And we're not far from that.  These are the most important things that he can do.  And as of today, other than tweeting about this, the things that Jack Dorsey, Zuckerberg, et cetera, have done, there's been no action.  I know that he has a lot of fronts to fight.  I understand that.  But if he loses this one, all the others won't matter.  So again, I want to give my complete support to Alex Jones at InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, I saw her cry today on Alex Jones because she has sacrificed so much and has been left as a casualty in the middle of the street naked.  And I don't say that in a disrespectful way.  I mean she's given all she has and there's nothing more to give.  They've taken it all from her.  Remember, those who do not have the mark of the beast can neither buy nor sell.  We could be talking about a real embodiment of a devil, of a Lucifer, of this adversary.  But I'm gonna remind you that Satan, I'm gonna use that name, was a created being, not a begotten being.  In other words, He was created by God, and we are supposed to be, sometimes I wonder, sons and daughters of God.  Those are begotten creatures.  I'm not going to argue about how that difference occurs, but what I will say is this.  It was the created creature that was created by the hands of God, be his children or otherwise, that demanded the throne of God.  that he have God's glory.  Do you not see the technology and those who control it are now in that position?  Very serious times.  Very serious times.  This may sound presumptuous on my part, but I think it's necessary, okay, to President Trump and to all of us.  God chastens those he loves.  Let me say that one more time.  The Father chastens, disciplines, corrects, and sometimes that involves a partial if not complete abandonment, those he loves.  It's hard to understand.  I've been there.  Laura, I understand.  President Trump, if you don't do what's right, I think you're trying, but you've got to change some of your tactics, some of your timetables on your goals or at least examine those that you associate with, those that you have your strongest alliances with because as I said you can be a Saul or you can be a David.  you can be Koresh or you can be the king of the Assyrians and the Babylonians.  what wolf you feed is what you will become.  God chastens those he loves.  It's time to get on the war path, President Trump.  Do not allow the sacrifices and the sufferings of those who have stood for the Constitutional Republic, for the perfect law of liberty.  And in Laura Loomer's case, she may not think so.  I'm sure in one way she does.  The kingdom of our Eternal Father.  So once again, I want to publicly state, and I've said it several times, but I just want to make sure that it's out there because I don't care what they do to me.  Not much more they can do, really.  And the title of this, I am at one with Alex Jones, InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laurel Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos.  You might say, Roy, Milo?  You're contrary.  He still has a right to his free speech.  And as long as he's not pushing his lifestyle on my children and yours and on the world, what he does, he can answer to God for.  That's my message for today.  A little longer than I thought, as usual.  I always take more time than I really want to.  But I felt like I had to make this statement.  God bless you, Laura Loomer.  You've done an awful lot.  You've put yourself out there, and you've suffered a great deal.  You've given more than the widows might.  You've given all you have.  And it's not in your power.  custom in your belief system, the way I'm going to say it here.  But blessed are you who have lost your lives for my sake.  For if you've lost your lives for my sake, you will find it out here. ",
