Why is this more valuable than that?  You can just draw attention to the very famous diamond water paradox.  It doesn't make any sense that diamonds would be more valuable than water, since water is more essential to life.  What's going wrong here?  And how can we actually figure out why things are valued this way and that way.  It's a bit of a puzzle, really.
