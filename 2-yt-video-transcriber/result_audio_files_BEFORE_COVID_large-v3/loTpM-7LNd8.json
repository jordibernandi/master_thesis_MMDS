            "text": "Bad news pays.  I'm on a foundation board, the MacArthur Foundation, which dispenses large sums for research.  And I can tell you that a lot of scholars and a lot of institutions secure money for research by producing bad news about population, about resources, about environment.  For another thing, there's a demonstrable fascination with, there's a proved public preference for bad news because what's bad news to somebody is good news to many.  The listener or the reader to bad news can say to himself, well, at least I'm not as bad or as bad off as those fellows.  And then the printer whose printing machine broke down or the builder who bid too low or the salesman who lost a sale or the farmer who lost a crop or the While Catter who drilled a duster, he can see his problem is not so bad after all.  After all, bad news is good news.  The reader does not want to read about some rich man who's healthy and happily married.  That might tend to make the reader feel sorry for himself.  But if the rich man is divorced or diseased or loses his money, that's more interesting reading because then the reader can feel himself to be better off.  There's always somebody in any hospital ward just enough worse off to help us feel comparatively fortunate, and noisy news serves that purpose.  And thus the plane crash, which does not involve you, the billionaire in bankruptcy, the charity boss caught stealing, the movie actor charged with murder, these will continually on page one For as long as the fire which burns them warms the rest of us.  By our own emphasis on all of the bad things, crime and inflation and pollution and floods and fires and discords and disaster and discontent, by our persistent preoccupation with negatives, we tend to unsell ourselves and our impressionable offspring on a way of life which is the envy of the rest of the world.  And repetition is effective.  Repetition is effective.  Repetition is effective.  Bob Barker asked a game show contestant for $500, named two famous brothers who made it possible for men to fly.  Without a moment's hesitation, the contestant replied, Ernest and Julio.  Self-government requires self-discipline all the way to the top and all the way down to us.  Then, then we may lead the world as we once did.  For our nation's first 150 years, we led the world not with guns, not with butter, not with money, but by example.  The French threw off the yoke of their dissolute aristocracy.  England initiated sweeping democratic reforms.  Mexico, Central America, South America freed themselves from Spain just watching our example.  On this rebellious planet, storms are a part of the normal year-in and year-out climate of life.  We earn the sweet by and by by how we deal with the messy here and now.  Sometimes the storm takes the shape of an economic holocaust or a prolonged drought, sometimes internal civil strife, sometimes a military confrontation.  You know, Churchill said that the war years were England's finest hour.  And we face a new testing time every lifetime.  Some of us have been professional observers of several lifetimes.  We remember Epidemic TB and the crash of 29 and the Dust Bowl and Hitler's Holocaust and Pearl Harbor.  We resent challenges, but we're no longer panicked by them.  A few years ago, our anxiety focused on the hideous force of the unharnessed atom.  But now, in retrospect, we can see that the A-bomb was a disguised blessing.  We Americans are outnumbered by potential enemies seven to one.  War with bayonets we couldn't win.  The big bomb was and remains the equalizer that cuts the limitless hordes down to our size.  Now we can see that an old wise old mighty entrusted this hideous instrument to our tiny fraction of the planet's population first, not for our destruction but for our deliverance.  Times don't change.  Time goes in circles.  The atom bomb altered the potential strategy of war, but we are never without war.  for very long.  In the 3,500 years of recorded history, fewer than 8% of those years have been warless ones.  It's been barely, my goodness, it's been barely 138 years since we were at war with ourselves.  So storms are part of the planet's normal climate, and eternity is being prepared somewhere, a perfect place, and we have to demonstrate here whether we deserve to be there.  And if there were perpetual sunshine, there'd be no victory.  So it's testing time again, and from everything I have seen, man alive, we're passing this test again, and with our colors flying.  Members of Congress huff and puff and hold hearings and strike poses.  The media makes it an opportunity to rake some muck and somebody's go to jail.  In between the Teapot Dome and Enron, we have endured two big wars and assorted lesser ones.  During each, a frightened segment of Americans were convinced that our country was going to hell.  It never did.  Many times it went through a little hell, but it always came out on the other side of the crucible, heat-tempered and better than stronger and more prosperous than before.  I discover in my travels that America is falling in love again with America.  If the future appears darker than it is, it's because of the slimy bugs on the windshield of the world, the social misfits.  If I can leave you with only one thing, may it be this.  Don't let the headline writers rain on your parade.  My goodness, if you could pick a place in the whole world to live.  It would have to be this place and it would have to be this time.  You are where everybody else in the world so wants to be.  My goodness.  There's resiliency in this country that we have not yet begun to use.  As Mark Twain is said to have said of the music of Richard Wagner, it's not nearly so bad as it sounds.  Good day. ",
