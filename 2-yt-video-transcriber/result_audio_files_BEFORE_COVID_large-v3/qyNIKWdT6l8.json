            "text": "On Facebook, I always get advice and get information from my players on where to go and what to do.  And one of my players, one of the players on Facebook was like, man, if you're in Jamaica, man, you got to go see the ganja fields.  I'm like, okay.  I'll put that on my to-do list.  So anyway, I'm with another cab driver.  He's taking me around.  We go to this place called the Dolphin Cove.  That was closed.  It was about to be closed because we went there too late.  So now I want to get into something because I went to a place called Mystic Mountain.  I went to Dunn's River.  I went to all the sightseeing tourist spots.  So now I want to get into something.  I got the cab driver.  I'm like, okay, take us to some spots.  And this was one of them hustling cab drivers.  See, a lot of the cab drivers, they have little deals with people at resorts and other places where they bring in customers.  They get a little cut on the side.  They have those type of deals going on.  So the cab driver was taking us to different spots.  He took us to some little river place where a guy has a raft.  I didn't really want to do that.  So he took us to another spot.  He was like our little tour guide.  He was like, okay, over here, this is the elementary school.  Over here to the right, that's another waterfall.  Over here to the left, that's our water plant.  So he was just, he was being my tour guide.  And I said, I want to go to some, somewhere where they're selling sugar cane.  So he took me to the sugar cane guy, bought some sugar cane, ate some raw sugar cane.  That was cool.  And I made the mistake of, Of saying to this guy.  I said hey.  Where the ganja feels.  Let me give y'all some advice man.  If you are in Jamaica.  Don't ever.  Ask nobody.  Where the ganja feels are.  Don't ever do that.  Don't ever ever ever ever ever.  do that.  Because they will show you.  And the thing is.  Even if you.  And I'm not a weed smoker.  I've never smoked a joint in my life.  I don't fuck with that.  I don't do weed at all.  Even if you are a weed smoker, you don't ever ask for it.  Because if you stand out on the street, somebody will come up to you and ask you if you want to buy some weed.  It's that simple.  If you post up, you just walk outside, wait about two minutes, somebody will walk up.  Hey, you want that purple?  You want the OG kush?  They'll ask you if you want weed.  So you really don't have to go out and solicit.  But the thing is, I asked this dude where the ganja fields were.  And when I asked him that, this motherfucker starts smiling from his ear to his ass.  He's like, oh, you want to know where the ganja fields are?  And I'm like, yeah, I just want to, you know, I'm just sightseeing.  I've never seen a ganja field before.  I just want to go by and see it.  Oh, right.  You want to see it, right?  Okay, I'll show you.  I said, okay, now this motherfucker is grinning real hard.  So in his mind, he thinks I'm talking in code.  He thinks that I'm just in a low key coded way saying that I want to buy a big supply of weed.  I haven't picked this up yet.  I'm still thinking as a tourist.  and I'm thinking he's thinking that I'm thinking as a tourist.  So he's like, OK, we're going we're going there right now.  So we go up this hill.  We make a left turn up a hill.  And this hill is real hood up in this neighborhood.  See, the thing about the hoods in Jamaica, the hood is up in the hills.  It's real gully down in the lower part, but when you go up them hills, it gets even gullier.  So we're going up this hill.  We're going up in the mountains.  And the farther we go up into the mountains, the more slums and shacks we see.  There's recording studios here, and there's... a little makeshift bar where people just create a shed and start selling beer out of the shed.  I mean, it's real, real, real hood.  So we're going up, up, up into these mountains.  And I'm like, well, damn, this is, I'm like, I'm thinking that we're just going to drive by a field somewhere, see some weed growing and just drive off.  I'm thinking that, but we're going deeper and deeper up into the damn mountains of Jamaica.  We go so high up.  Now we're on a dirt road.  Now we done got to a point where the road ain't even paved no more.  And I'm like getting a little nervous now.  Like, cause I got my chick with me, the cab driver, he's still grinning.  And I'm like, yo man, we really don't have to go up here.  You know, he like, no, no, no, let's go.  We're almost there.  We're almost there.  So we go up this damn dirt road.  And now we're seeing goats all over the place.  There's little mountain goats, billy goats, whatever.  We see goats everywhere.  That's how high we up.  And we see banana trees.  We start to see orange trees, coconut trees.  We see all this shit.  So we're going up this dirt road, up on a mountain still.  Now I'm getting a little suspicious.  I'm like, okay, this is getting a little extra.  So we pull up to this shack.  There's some dudes outside playing domino.  So the cab driver gets out.  Starts talking to one of the dudes playing dominoes.  They talk for five minutes.  So the cab driver comes back to the car.  Some dude hops in the front seat with him.  I'm like, okay.  I'm like, what's going on, man?  Oh, we're almost up there.  We're almost up there right now.  So now we got this other dude in the car.  We go up the hill some more.  Up the dirt road, we see more goats, more coconut trees.  So now we're at the very top of a mountain.  This is a mountain.  There's a broadcast tower.  right where we are.  We pull up next to a broadcast tower.  That's how high up in the fucking mountains we are.  Well, we can see the whole damn island of Jamaica damn near.  I can damn near see the Cuba from where we are.  We're high up in the mountains in the middle of nowhere.  Pull up to somebody's houses next to the tower.  Some people come out the house, some women.  Then the guy who was with the cab driver went in the house.  Some other dude came out and these women are looking crazy as hell.  I'm like, okay, this is too much.  I'm thinking that we're just going to drive by a field and look at some weed and drive off.  Now all these people are involved.  So now I'm like, okay, they think that I want to buy some drugs from their ass.  And I keep saying that I don't want to buy no drug.  I just, I don't want to buy shit. ",
