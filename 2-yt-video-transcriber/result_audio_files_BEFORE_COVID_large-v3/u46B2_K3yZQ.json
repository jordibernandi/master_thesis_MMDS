And neighbors have said, you know what, it's not gunshots that they're hearing.  They're familiar with hearing that maybe when there's a hunting activity per se.  So they've asked us, you know, can you find out what's going on here?  We went to several agencies.  We went to DPS, or rather DOT, and they said it's not them.  They're not doing any construction work.  We did go to Duke Energy.  They told us they're not responsible for Even reached out to military bases like Seymour Johnson Air Force Base just to see if it's maybe in their flight path in some work that they're doing.  It's not them either.  So we did go to the National Weather Service because one neighbor suggested maybe it's just thunderstorms that we're hearing.  But the meteorologist there, the experts say.  There haven't been thunderstorms recently, so Mother Nature can't be blamed for this either.  So at this point, we are going to keep asking questions of local agencies until we can pinpoint what that sound is, what's causing the shaking of these homes.

            "text": "All right, your question, where did God come from, assumes that you're thinking of the wrong, obviously it displays that you're thinking of the wrong God, because the God of the Bible is not affected by time, space, or matter.  If he's affected by time, space, or matter, he's not God.  Time, space, and matter is what we call a continuum.  All of them have to come into existence at the same instant, because if there were matter but no space, where would you put it?  If there were matter and space but no time, when would you put it?  You cannot have time, space, or matter independently.  They have to come into existence simultaneously.  The Bible answers that in ten words.  In the beginning, there's time.  God created the heaven.  There's space and the Earth.  There's matter.  So you have time, space, matter created a trinity of trinities there.  Time is past, present, future.  Space has length, width, height.  Matter has solid, liquid, gas.  You have a trinity of trinities created instantaneously.  And the God who created them has to be outside of them.  If he's limited by time, he's not God.  The guy who created this computer is not in the computer.  He's not running around in there changing the numbers on the screen, OK?  The God who created this universe is outside of the universe.  He's above it, beyond it, in it, through it.  He's unaffected by it.  And the concept that a spiritual force cannot have any effect on a material body, well, then I guess you'd have to explain to me things like emotions and love and hatred and envy and jealousy and rationality.  I mean, if your brain is just a random collection of chemicals that form by chance over billions of years, how on earth can you trust your own reasoning processes and the thoughts that you think?  your question where did god come from?  is assuming a limited god and that's your problem.  the god that i worship is not limited by time space or matter.  if i could fit the infinite god in my three pound brain he would not be worth worshiping.  that's for certain.  so that's the god that i worship.  thank you.
