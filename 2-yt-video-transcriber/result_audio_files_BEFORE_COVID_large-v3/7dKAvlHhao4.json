And in my opinion, he's one of the best.  He's one of the best First Amendment auditors out there.  He is from Georgia.  He is a fellow Georgian.  He doesn't get talked about a whole lot.  He doesn't get mentioned in videos.  He doesn't get comments about him on other folks' channels.  He just simply does his own thing.  He is not caught up in the drama.  He doesn't bash other channels.  He doesn't talk about people like they're dogs.  He just simply does his own channel.  And I'm going to bring this guy to you.  It is time.  The time is now.  He has 10,000 subs.  He should have more.  But I'm going to tell you guys, he is not about anything but police accountability and government corruption.  That's all he's about.  That's all he is about.  He, in my own opinion, is one of the best.  He is one of the best.  He is a genius when it comes to dealing with corruption.  He is a genius when it comes to dealing with police accountability.  And I got a crazy cat.  She's radical.  She is the radical cat.  The radical Callie.  Yes, she is.  She knows what I'm doing.
