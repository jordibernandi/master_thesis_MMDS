            "text": "Yeah, yeah.  Thank you for that question.  You know, the last day's language of the Holy Spirit is dreams.  We say, well, it was just a dream.  What do you mean, just a dream?  Who knows what angels had to fight through to break into your world.  To give you their thoughts and you just say it's just a dream.  I think the church needs to stop saying it's just a dream.  I mean, what if every teenager had a destiny dream?  When you were a kid?  that would hold them in their teenage years because you're just, they don't know who they are.  We need, this is the language and the culture of heaven.  And so our whole world actually, our whole world is dream.  We got this quote.  If you hang around the dream king, you get into a dream stream.  You join yourself to a dream team and you do the Martin Luther King thing.  Every dream is a potential movement.  Sometimes we get a dream.  we think it's just for us.  I talked to Todd today.  He just adopted a child, a baby.  It came out of a heroin, parents or whatever it was.  And immediately I thought, Todd, I see hundreds and hundreds of thousands of babies being adopted because of your story.  Because a dream is like a seed.  And you stick with that dream long enough, it becomes a tree.  And you influence the world.  I'll maybe tell a little bit about that story.  But this is, in many ways, the call was born out of a dream I had with Benny Hinn.  I'm starting to rock.  Dreams are so profound.  they give you divine intelligence.  I get the dream.  It gives you the secrets for deliverance.  You get inner healing in your dreams.  I had a dream once.  I was wailing in this dream singing, when I find you, I find healing.  God was healing me in a dream.  You all know this.  And the more you treat it as holy, the more you get.  He who has, more shall be given.  So our whole ministry, actually, almost every day we meet together, we say, do we have a dream?  And because we do stuff with our dreams rather than saying it's just a dream, we treat them as smart bombs, as intercessory assignments that change the world.  So the call began in many ways with a dream of Benny Hinn.  And what happened was, in 2003, I'd started something called Pasadena for Christ.  And the first day I started this full-time, I was invited to speak to a group of Taiwanese kids, high school group up in the mountains.  And the first night, the presence of the Lord was very strong.  You could feel people just weeping and kids.  And that night, these kids came to me and they said, hey, we want to do an all-night prayer meeting.  I said, cool.  So the kids prayed and the preacher slept.  And I have a dream, though, because God loves me.  And he gives to his beloved in his sleep.  Come on.  Why should we waste a third of our lives without the language of heaven bombarding us?  Seriously.  And in this dream, I'm on stage with Benny Hinn.  And Benny Hinn says, Lou, you're done with the ministry.  So I step down off the stage, but I'm filled with joy.  I wake up thinking that is really a pizza dream for sure.  I mean, what is that?  Benny Hinn.  Never even had met Benny Hinn.  So the next morning, I remember having the message that would bring revival.  It didn't work out.  It worked out according to the dream.  So right before I get up to preach, suddenly one of these high school kids stands up and starts to prophesy, and the Holy Spirit invades the place.  And kids, this is 2003, pre-Toronto.  Everyone is being slain in the spirit, laughing, shaking.  I'm thinking, this is so rude.  I didn't get to preach.  And literally for two hours, I'm sitting there thinking, what is going on?  Because I was not Pentecostal.  I had no idea what this stuff was.  And finally, I just left.  And I went to my cabin and laid down and said, what was that?  And the Lord brought the dream back to me.  Benny Hinn wrote a book called The Anointing.  When the anointing comes, you're done with the ministry.  But it's a joyful occasion.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  The deal is this.  God spoke to me.  This will never be about your preaching.  It's what I'll do when kids pray.  Little did I know those kids were the Christian club leaders in their high schools.  They begin to invite me and prayer begins to break out among the high schooler kids.  Little did I realize that that would be the beginning of a movement called The Call.  It started with a dream about Benny Hinn and the power of kids praying and revival comes when people pray.  And it all started with a dream.  Thank you for the question.  So let me teach you this.  We've started a whole movement called Bound for Life for the ending of abortion.  We're really in a critical moment in America.  I think adoption is going to explode across America.  I think right now we are in a window of time.  We're at a window of time for a shifting in this thing right now.  It all started, and then I'll get on this thing, but I get excited about it.  You hang around the dream king.  If you hang around Jesus, you're going to get dreams.  And you ask for all the time.  If you join yourself to a dream team, the dreams that it gives to is too big for you to fulfill.  You've got to have a team.  Rather than just having dreams myself, I would like to create a dream community around me.  Give permission to the people in your fellowship and church to dream dreams and give them access to you because housewives can change the whole world if they've got a big mouth telling the dream.  God gave us a series of dreams that we had to walk the trail of tears with the natives if we were going to deal with the issue of abortion.  I won't go into the story, but it's amazing how this unfolded.  A young man fasted for four years, a Daniel fast, no meats, no sweets, and dreams of thousands of people in D.C.  with a piece of life tape on their mouths with the word life.  You've probably seen those.  We did that 12 years ago, January.  We stood there in front of that Supreme Court, and we've been standing there for 12 years.  Because it was brilliant wisdom.  Because nobody can argue with silence.  In fact, the National Organization for Women Leaders said this is brilliant strategy.  Why?  It's silent prayer for those who have no voice.  The media took it up and blasted it all over the world.  They don't like what we stand for, but they're actually promoting the movement because we got authority over the media by divine revelation.  Put a piece of life tape on our mouths.  As simple as that.  Praying.  Put a life band on.  Because of a dream.  I've pondered this.  What if, when we stood there in front of the Supreme Court 12 years ago, what if I thought that that life tape dream was just a pizza dream?  Most people would not have done something like, but I believed it was God.  Sometimes we need to really soberly look at our dreams and take each symbol and polish them and say, what are they saying?  Because there's a treasure of revelation hidden but wanting to be found.  Come on.  It's stunning.  Oh, in fact, let me just pray for you right now because wherever I go, I pray for people to get dreams.  Is that okay?  One time a lady came to me, she says, I've never spoken tongues and I've never had a dream.  I said, okay, let's pray.  Lord, give her a dream and have her speak in tongues.  She came back the next week.  I said, do you have a dream?  She said, yes, she had a dream.  I was speaking in tongues and I woke up speaking in tongues.  Lift your hands and I'm going to pray.  God, loose the dream language of heaven on the community of heaven on earth.  In Jesus' name, release dreams.  I want you to reach up.  You don't have to feel it.  I receive.  In the name of Jesus, we receive, we expect to hear the voice of God.  Raise up a whole new level of prophets.  Because we've treated this thing as holy, we begin to tap into a whole new dimension of wisdom and revelation.  In the name of Jesus.  Come on, let's shout to God for that.  Amen.  You may be seated.
