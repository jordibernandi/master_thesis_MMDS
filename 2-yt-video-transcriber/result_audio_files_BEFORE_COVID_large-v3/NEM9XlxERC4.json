            "text": "Psalm 37, 29.  The righteous will possess the earth and they will live forever on it.  Now this text was written after man had sinned and imperfection set in on the earth.  And yet God says that the righteous will live forever on the earth.  How can we be sure that God's purpose will not change?  Because he tells us so.  In Numbers 23, 19, he tells us that what he determines, he will carry out.  So Jehovah will get at the root of the problem that we have.  But how is he going to do that?  Well, what would you do if you discovered that your house was infected with vermin?  Would you burn your house down?  No, you'll preserve your house.  You need it.  But you'll get rid of your problems.  You'll get rid of the vermin.  Many humans have failed to show appreciation and respect for God's gift to the earth.  They've created the problem we have.  They overload his systems with toxic matter, radioactive waste, undegradable materials, and so forth.  In fact, I was just reading this past week that they went down to the very deepest parts of the Mariana Trench, that's the lowest part on the earth, miles below the surface of the waters, and they discovered garbage there.  Plastic bags, empty cans, wrappers.  Because led by greed and selfishness, mankind has upset the balance in nature.  And Jehovah has vowed to remove to destroy, to bring to an end those ruining the earth.  It states it plainly in Revelation 11, 18.  And he's going to do it before it's too late.  He will not allow man to damage the earth so much that it will be impossible to repair it. ",

            "text": "So, the footage that you've just been watching is a speaker named Nathias Ali, or at least that's how he's introduced.  I don't know the exact spelling.  He's introduced as being a Bethelite at Fishkill.  and this is actually footage from the Atlanta International Convention, and it's in a talk called, it's actually part of a symposium titled Creation Reveals Jehovah's Love, and this particular talk is dealing with the earth, and basically the whole point of this symposium is is to talk about how wonderful creation is, the earth, animals,  etc.,  humans, and without giving any really sophisticated reasoning, scientific reasoning, to just say that this is all the product of creation, and therefore we ought to praise Jehovah, specifically in the way that Jehovah's Witnesses would like you to praise Jehovah.  So... That's the background to what we've just been hearing.  I stumbled on this footage when I was preparing my rebuttal to the Friday of the convention which I'm currently in the middle of doing and I've just decided to break off and show you this footage because I think by itself it just perfectly sums up what the end game of Jehovah's Witness theology is.  It's about the annihilation of anyone who disagrees with them.  And when you buy into that kind of reasoning, when you let it sink in and you kind of normalize this theology, it enables you in unguarded moments to come out with the sort of language that Matthias has just come out with on a platform in front of Thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses who for the most part will just be nodding along because that's what they've been raised to believe.  Whether they would quite have the guts to walk up to total strangers when they're doing their car witnessing or knock on the doors of total strangers and say, you are vermin unless you agree to join our religion.  A vermin that will be destroyed at Armageddon.  Or you can be likened to vermin, if we're going to be totally precise.  I doubt that they would have that bravery, to be honest.  It's also interesting that Nathias talks about plastic at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.  I saw something flash up on Twitter when I just tweeted this video.  Disputing that it might not have been plastic, it might have been something else.  The guy who saw these objects just assumed that they were plastic.  But let's just assume that they are plastic.  There's clearly a problem when it comes to plastic in our oceans.  And this is a problem that governments need to urgently address.  But you simply cannot point, as a speaker representing a religion at that religion's kind of annual convention, you simply cannot point to plastic and say, this plastic has been deposited by everyone who doesn't agree with us and everyone who doesn't follow our religion.  There's no way in the world that this plastic or any of this plastic has ever belonged to Jehovah's Witnesses.  How can you possibly know that?  There's eight and a half million Jehovah's Witnesses in the world, and you're telling me that not a single gram of plastic in our oceans has ever passed through their hands.  How can you possibly know that?  It's not necessarily an issue of individuals, although there's a lot that individuals can do.  by reducing their use of plastic.  But it's mostly a problem of poor management in countries, particularly developing countries, where the litter gets collected from everyone, regardless of their religious beliefs.  And rather than being properly processed, it just gets dumped and it finds its way into the ocean.  So it's a very... It's very ignorant to kind of lay the blame at everyone who are not Jehovah's Witnesses.  Even if you could lay the blame at everyone who are not Jehovah's Witnesses, why do you deserve to be slaughtered just for dropping plastic in the ocean?  I don't... I think that the punishment far outweighs the crime.  But again, this is the sort of nonsense that you get stuck in when you allow yourself to accept these kind of doomsday fundamentalist beliefs.  And I'm glad that they've found their way into such kind of vivid language about vermin.  so that I can show you guys, and hopefully you might share this video so that others can see, oh, this is what Jehovah's Witnesses are really about.  If you don't agree with us, you're a pest, you're vermin, you need to be eradicated.  Jehovah's Witnesses don't like to admit it, and they certainly don't have the bravery to say that to people's faces, but that's what they are required to believe.  So just wanted to share that with you.  I'm now going to get right back to preparing my rebuttal for the Friday of the convention, but I hope you've enjoyed this video, and as always, thank you so much for watching.  Thought it's over, I fell from the top of the world But it's finally over, finally over.  I've got to last one minute just to get out of life So I keep it together, thinking it's not forever. ",
