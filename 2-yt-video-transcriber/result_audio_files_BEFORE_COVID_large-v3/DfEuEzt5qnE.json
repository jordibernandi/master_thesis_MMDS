            "text": "Good afternoon everyone.  Blessings.  It's Amanda and Chris.  I have Chris with me.  We wanted to do a video together and a thank you video for, yes, for all of your prayers and your support.  And your donations.  Chris is very appreciative.  He's actually overwhelmed.  I bring him your cards, your letters, your emails, and I read them to him.  And I tell him, I read him your comments.  And it's really been uplifting him and encouraging him and the two of us.  And we so appreciate all of you standing in the gap for us.  Okay.  In this battle, it is just incredible to see how the people of God have come together in order to support us.  It is amazing to watch the Lord work as we see Chris get better and better.  He's improving every week.  I was sat in on his physical therapy session today.  He is improving and getting better with walking.  They have him with a cane and people guarding him right now when he walks.  They're working on balance with him.  And they're working on getting himself dressed, right?  How to get dressed.  And they're also working, speech therapy is big.  So we're going to ask you to please pray for his speech right now.  That the Lord restores his speech.  You see, you heard him say yes.  The words are poking through.  Praise God, we're hearing yes.  And yeah, and okay.  are poking through in the middle of that.  So right now, Chris's brain is trying to reconnect with his mouth is what's happening.  And so he wanted us to film so you could see the background, his nice view that he's got.  He wanted you to see his view, and this is why we're faced this way, so you can see the view also in his room.  But the people here have been wonderful at the rehab, and they have been amazing in helping us to navigate this and helping us get through this.  So Chris really wanted to come on so you could see that he is improving and that we will see what the Lord brings because in April he may have to go back into surgery for his skull.  As you can see the side of his head right now, there's no skull.  There's only skin.  And so that will be the next hurdle as we go through this process.  But I did tell him the Lord said that he is rebuilding him.  And he is restoring him and making him into a new man.  And a new creation to do his work and his will.  By the time he comes out of this.  Right?  Yes.  So we're also very grateful to you.  that have just been an amazing support to us.  And we feel it.  I feel when you guys pray.  I mean, there is so much prayer going up.  And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask Chris here to pray for you all because the Lord knows his heart.  So I'm going to ask him to pray for you all out there who have been so kind to us that the Lord blesses you.  So I'm going to ask you to do that right now for me.  Okay?  Okay. ",

And we thank you for your continued prayers and marching in this battle with us as we go through this.  And we promise to keep you updated and that you will walk through this with us and you will see the end product with us.  So God bless everybody.  We love you all.  Keep the faith. ",
