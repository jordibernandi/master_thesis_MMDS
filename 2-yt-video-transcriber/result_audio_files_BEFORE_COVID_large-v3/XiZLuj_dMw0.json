            "text": "What I have here are two of the most memorable and important guns used in American history.  I'll start with this one.  This right here is what's called a short land pattern musket.  It is a smoothbore.  It's got a barrel of 42 inches.  And in fact, if we look at it, it's actually got the crown crest of England.  It's got GR, which stands for the Latin Georgius Rex, or King George.  This is for the Tower of London.  And it was actually made in England.  It was the English musket that was used in all of their colonization and it was also what was primarily used by the colonists in America.  And so when the American war for independence started, this was primarily what you would find over the mantelpiece in their homes.  So when Lexington and Concord happened and the church bells started ringing, this is most likely what they would have grabbed to meet and assemble to push off the British oppression and tyranny.  If we look, it's got a flintlock right here because that's how it worked.  It was a flintlock musket and it would strike here, ignite the powder, and exactly like how you would see it in the Patriot or one of those movies, it would fire.  Now, if we look down the barrel, it's got a big old barrel and that's the size of the ball that it would have fired.  So this is, you know, a marble about that big that's coming at you and that's why they all lumped together because they were so inaccurate.  That if you were trying to just stand out there and shoot at one guy, you would be there for days on end trying to get just one guy.  So they said, you know what, we'll be nice to each other and we'll all line up next to each other to make it really easy.  Thankfully that all changed by the time we got to this.  This right here was the main battle rifle for the American forces during the Second World War.  It's called an M1 Grand.  or an M1 Garand depending on whether or not you're American or Canadian.  And that's interesting because it was actually designed by Canadian immigrant to America whose name was Garand.  As you can see there's actually no magazine because it actually used a clip that was inserted into the rifle itself.  General George Patton, one of the most famous American generals during the Second World War, called this M1 rifle, he said, in my opinion the M1 rifle is the greatest battle implement ever devised.  So as you hear a lot about guns and gun control in the news, I think it's important to remember that these are tools that can be used for both good and bad.  And in American history, we can see that they have been used for instruments to bring freedom to America and to secure liberty for America and the world. ",
