            "text": "oh We're looking out for you.  We're looking out for you.  We're with Copwatch.  We're looking out for your protection.  We're with Copwatch.  So I guess they've seen a self-suspect in the park over here.  Oh, wow.  Where is it?  No.  We've seen her before.  Just stay back here, okay?  We'll get your phone.  Hey, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, it's all good.  Well, we'll get it back in a second.  We'll get it back in a second.  I need my phone back.  Y'all might be looking for nothing.  Don't worry, man.  Don't worry.  Just keep calm.  You didn't hang up.  You're not being heard.  We know you're right here.  Let's get out of here.  It's all good, bro, bro.  Goodbye, Mike.  I don't know.  Yes, we do know why, but you hang back and we'll explain.  He can explain to you when we're done.  Well, I don't want to know why he's getting detained for.  Y'all didn't even invite him or nothing.  Sounds like they're calling for backup.  More officers.  That was Sam.  And I want to call you today regarding that banner.  You got blood too?  We are making blood.  We are making blood.  Danny.  Can you follow me?  Okay.  That's about done.  I thought I said that wrong.  How long have you been out here?  How long have you been out here?  How long have you been out here?  We got school cops here too?  Guess they're gonna bring a, uh... victim to ID the person.  We have multiple officers here.  I know why he's getting detained, though.  I've been asking this whole question.  I haven't even said anything.  So y'all just going to look?  Just look?  Could we know why he's being detained?  Yeah, well, you know if you're willing to knock that door open, because he's planning to do this on the vehicle.  I've been asking that question.  What they got?  They got someone in the window?  They got someone in the back snitching?  They got someone snitching?  Like, you're making him stand straight?  Someone's snitching.  Somebody's snitching.  Let me catch the snitch.  Let me catch the snitch.  Hold on, let me catch the snitch.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, you need to put the pitch back down.  Put the pitch back down.  All right.  Yeah.  Dancer.  Woo!  We my niggas are.  We know, we know.  It's me choosing ants.  Go on.  Did they reach your rights?  Did they reach your rights?  Hell no.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  Y'all niggas got your phone?  I wonder why the community hates them.  I got nothing but still questions.  Can I get my phone back and nobody get entertained?  That's all I'm asking.  Earning the hate.  Look at me, I'm not stupid.  I'm talking to y'all.  Are y'all there?  Earning the hate, one person at a time.  I'm a mother, bro.  Like she said, though, I'm her mother.  Y'all, I sit in the forehead, I slither.  I... Oh, let me stop it.  No, can y'all take this little shade away from me?  I don't want to know why he's being detained.  Can I get my phone back?  Can I get my phone back?  My little bro is being detained with no Miranda rights.  Can I get my phone back?  He's been walking with my phone.  We got a whole bunch of people hating cops.  That's what they do.  Hello.  What's up, Pigeon?  How are you?  Pigeon, for real?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Did this close at night?  I was looking for park hours.  Did it close or just sale?  It's always open, man.  Is it?  Yep.  Yeah, I've never been here before, so.  Sort of funny, it says no golf on the sign.  It's just like a standard park sign, I guess, right?  Bye.  Bye.  Okay, what's your name?  Samuel.  Let's turn the camera on.  Was there someone that had a phone from Samuel for the picture?  Samuel!  Stole pigeon.  Hello?  I'll give you a different number.  Go ahead.  He's going to be your neighbor.  He ain't trying to get your phone.  He's going to be your neighbor.  He ain't going to take your phone.  I just asked.  They said they're going to keep it for now.  I'll give you the incident number.  And if you want, I'll have somebody come over that knows what's going on.  I don't know anything about it.  Why are you even here then, man?  I saw police cars and stuff.  It's hard to look at it.  Who's in charge of the phone?  You over here.  Okay, that's who's in charge of the phone.  Well, I'll give them an event number if the detectives decided to keep it.  I don't know what's going on, so maybe it's related to whatever their event number is.  I'm thinking already he's explaining why they have this man's phone.  uh he's like why this man called his dog.  There you go.  Here's the event number.  Your phone was impounded as evidence.  Again, you're going to have to contact one of the detectives to figure out what exactly they're investigating.  But there's the phone number for Mid-City Division.  Okay?  Thank you.  They ain't even supposed to take your phone, bro.  Thank you. ",
