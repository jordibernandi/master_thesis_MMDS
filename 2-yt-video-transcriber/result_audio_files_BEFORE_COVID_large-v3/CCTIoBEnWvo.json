            "text": "I used to be an undocumented immigrant.  Now I get the opportunity to give back.  This is a door that's open for me.  I was raised in America.  I don't remember Mexico.  My parents brought me over when I was two years old, but I knew that this was my home.  It was very scary because just in the back of my mind, I could always feel someone looking over my shoulder.  I could get deported at any moment.  When I graduated from high school, I was applying to schools and I got a full ride, but I wasn't able to get the scholarship just because I wasn't an American citizen.  My stepmom applied for me to get my green card.  And from there, I had to go back to Mexico to do the whole process.  My dad told me, you'll be there for three months, and you'll come back.  It turned out to be two years.  I didn't know how to call my parents, didn't have any money.  I didn't know when I was going to be able to come back to the States.  I got a job and they were paying me a dollar a day.  But with the money that I would make, I would support my grandma.  Every moment when I was there, I was like, I'm never coming back.  Yeah, I'm going to get denied.  It was a dark place that I was in.  The happiest moment of my life was when I got my documents.  I cried.  I cried tears of joy because this.  I dropped it off to the immigration officer and he said, welcome to the United States.  I felt that I had a home again.  I made it, you know?  I just felt like this wolf in a cage, just ready to start life and start living.  I knew that I had to start over, and starting over meant going back to community college.  I would think about when I was in class all the time, like, I'm doing this for my little baby brother.  I'm doing this for my mom and all her struggles, for my parents, because they had never gone to college, for all the times that they cry, for all the times that they had no money.  And that's why I was like, you know what?  I'm good enough, and I'm going to do it.  When I walked across the stage, it felt surreal.  This was something that I wanted my entire life.  And I was super proud of myself because I was like, I did it.  It all just hit me.  When I was getting my diploma, I was like, this is it.  This is a new phase in my life.  Maybe I can help my parents, or maybe I can help people find their path and their way in this world.  The app that I'm developing is called La Voz.  It would help immigrant people assimilate and learn the language quicker.  How do you ask questions to a police officer?  What are your rights?  What are the government services that are out there?  We could put it in the app.  is something that I wish my parents had, because I feel like language allows people to access opportunity.  I think that's the purpose of my life, is to give others the opportunity to speak out and give them the building blocks to fulfill their potential in life, because this is what I didn't have, and this is what I wanted to give to other people, is a voice.  Where am I going?  Oh my God, hey!  Oh my God.  Like, what's going on? ",
