Secondly, the idea that the universe was fine-tuned for life carries with it all kinds of theological problems.  To say that life is impossible without the parameters the universe has is to say that the supposedly all-powerful Abrahamic God does not have the power to put life in a universe with different parameters.  Another problem is that it implies that this God is himself not a form of life.  Certainly, God himself does not need a finely tuned universe in order to exist, because his existence doesn't seem contingent upon any universe, if he's timeless and spaceless, as the apologists tell us he is.

Chance is clearly unlikely, but I think design is also less likely than necessity, simply because of Occam's razor.  Design assumes the existence of a mind that can control the universe.

Reason says that certain conclusions necessarily follow from certain premises.  What's free about that?  If I believe that Paris is in France, and France is in Europe, I don't freely choose to believe that Paris is therefore in Europe.  I can't help but believe it, because if I believe that the first two premises are true, I can't make any sense of the conclusion not being true.  If I were to take the liberty of freely choosing a contrary conclusion, then I wouldn't be reasoning.  I would just be believing random nonsense.  Reasoning is not free.  Justin himself defined being rational as believing in something with good evidence, but how is that free?  If you believe in something because you're following where the evidence points you, you're not freely choosing to believe in that thing.  You are letting the evidence choose for you. ",
