            "text": "All right, good morning, good evening, good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, citizens of U2's Pastor Dow.  You know, I'm driving right now to a particular destination to pick up some heavy equipment to get a job done.  And I'm sitting up here looking at the countryside.  I'm watching the construct of the landscape.  And the first thing I'm thinking about and comes to my mind is this.  Let me title this right here.  Are you ready for the chaos?  Are you ready for the chaos?  I don't think that many of you are prepared for the chaos.  And I think for a fact, when you look at what's going on in this world, we all can sense that there's something greatly wrong.  We can't put our finger on it exactly what the event is, but we can sense something is greatly wrong.  I'm looking at how they have this system set up.  and they got it set up just fine.  They got it set up so that you can trust the government, the government officials in your local county, parish, township, city, or whatever it is, but you have nobody that you can actually lean on and trust because you're not building strong relationships.  I'm just talking about just being even friends and stuff because when we look at some of the things and the inventions taking place in the past, like natural disasters and most people use that as an opportunity to loot, rape, rob, kill, murder, take advantage of others' misfortune.  And it's obvious that's in the human nature.  If you're in the population centers in them cities, who do you really truly got that you can band together with and that y'all would defend each other's person?  I mean, think about that for a second.  This is something seriously needed to be talked about.  Who are you?  Do you have a group of people, men, women, children, that when things go awry, things go wrong, that you can actually protect and defend each other?  Am I making any sense?  Because see, I'm out here right now and homes are spread out.  they've got at least 20, 30 acres between them.  And then of course, when we get into a little township, they're just like any other housing community, really close.  But we all know that there's an unruly spirit in human beings.  And we all know that bad people, they are gonna band together and run together.  And you know what they're gonna do?  I'm gonna tell you exactly what they're gonna do.  They're gonna come in a mob.  And they're going to go door to door.  And they're going to take anything that you have.  And there will be no police to come to your rescue.  There will be no 911 to call because there's going to be so much chaos going on.  They're busy.  They ain't got time to worry about Mr.  Smith or Miss Jones.  They don't have time for that.  There are bigger fish to fry.  They have a soul divided in this country right here, but united behind them.  And we can't even tell if we're coming or going.  I think it's just a bad, bad deal and a bad situation.  And you think about this.  Have you ever really thought about what takes place?  And have you seen what takes place whenever there is like, let's say a blizzard getting ready to come.  First thing that people do is run to the store and empty all the shelves.  And then they get to fighting over a case of water, which if they were listening to me some time ago, they should have already had food storage.  They should have already had clean water stored in the home.  It's not important though until catastrophe hits or chaos.  You know, when you refuse to prepare, I think it's the heightened sense of selfishness because of your refusal to prepare.  that you have the arrogancy and the audacity and the unmitigated gall.  You've got it in your mind that you could just go and eat up everybody else's resources.  that was sound enough, sober enough to prepare while you have been selfish, self-centered, self-focused, and self-absorbed, and you've done nothing.  You expect for them to be benevolent, to open up their home and give you of all that they have simply because you chose to be stupid, ignorant, dumb, dormant, docile, demoralized, and demonized.  Think about that for a second.  I don't know, is this you, is this not you?  Are you with me in this?  Do you comprehend me within this?  Most people don't have two or three months of food.  Most people don't have enough water.  They don't get clean water.  I think it's really truly time, no matter where you are, that you really truly start preparing yourself for the chaos because it ain't a matter of if, it's a matter of when, and it is coming. ",
