But it's fitting that I'm in Jerusalem right now because Kurdish Jews have a special link to this city.  In fact, tens of thousands of Kurdish Jews live right here in God's holy city.  Dr.  Mordecai Zaken is an expert on the history of the Jews in Iraqi Kurdistan, and he joined us recently.  to share their incredible story.  Take a look.  Well, Moti, thanks so much for joining us today.  You are the perfect man to have on with us here on The Watchman because so much is going on with the Kurds right now, especially in Syria.  Okay, let's start with a little bit of the history of the Kurdish people.  Who are they and where are they based? ",
