This budget is an absolute disaster.  It is an insult to the working families of this country.  And I have to say, it really does expose Donald Trump for the fraud that he is.  Over and over again, candidate Donald Trump, when he was looking for votes, promised the American people that he would be a different type of Republican.  I think we all remember that rhetoric, that he would be a champion of the working class, that he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security.  I remember those speeches like it was yesterday. ",
