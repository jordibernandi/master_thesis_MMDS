            "text": "Hello everyone.  I hope you're all doing well.  First of all, before I kick this video off, I just wanted to quickly take a moment to welcome those of you who are new because I noticed that I've gained a few thousand subscribers or so over the past month.  So again, to those of you who are new, hello, my name is Brittany.  Welcome to my channel.  In today's video, we're going to explore the drastic decline in the happiness rates of young men and women today.  Now, some of you watching this video might completely disagree with this statement.  You might find that you're perfectly happy in your own lives, but unfortunately for many other young people, this is simply not the case.  Even without the studies, I'm sure that like me, many of you have come to a similar conclusion.  Whether it be at school, at work, in your social circles, and especially online, the atmosphere of our society has been permeated by a sense of purposelessness, lack of meaning, defensiveness, anger, and overall emptiness.  Some resort to strategies like humor, shit posting, or a materialistic partying lifestyle to disguise their true feelings.  But these methods are often less than effective.  In this video, we're firstly going to examine some of the ways in which the unhappiness of the youth has become apparent.  And afterwards, we're going to explore some of the possible reasons behind this unhappiness.  For starters, the use of antidepressants is on the rise.  12.7% of the US population over the age of 12 took antidepressant medication in the past month.  64% is the increase in the percentage of people using antidepressants between 1999 and 2014.  Furthermore, women are twice as likely as men to take antidepressant medication.  Having read this information, most of us are likely to conclude that in general, women seem to be a lot unhappier than men.  And for the most part, this actually does seem to be the case, except when it comes to American men who are out of work.  A wide swath of white American men are down in the dumps, their dire mood showing up in everything from mortality statistics to national politics.  Working-age men who have dropped out of the US workforce were found to be more stressed and sadder than their peers in both poor and rich countries.  The unhappiness gap between out-of-work men and those with jobs is also much wider in the US.  On the flip side, a recent UK study suggests that women are, for the most part, unhappier than men until they reach the age of 85.  Good news, ladies!  A life of fulfillment and happiness is right around the corner.  as soon as you turn 85.  A new study from the UK's National Health Service found that women are unhappier than men for most of their lives until they hit their 80s.  The study also found that women were more likely to report consistent unhappiness at almost every age, especially in their late teens, early 20s, and in middle age, but that rates of mental illness were rising across the board, with youth mental illness rising almost 50% since 2012.  The dramatic rise in the use of antidepressants is unfortunately just one of the perceivable indicators of youth unhappiness.  You also have a sharp increase in alcohol addiction, drug addiction, and in the suicide rates.  From 2007 to 2017, adults ages 18 to 34 saw a 69% increase in alcohol-related deaths and a 108% increase in drug-related deaths.  As for suicide, the suicide rate among people ages 10 to 24 years old climbed 56% between 2007 and 2017.  Upon reading this article, my very first thought was that surely social media must have something to do with the rise in suicide rates.  And in fact, later in this article, it's mentioned that some mental health experts agree.  Some mental health experts suggest that social media use among teens might be fueling the increase in mental health conditions and leading to greater suicide risk.  And some early studies have linked smartphone use to anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation among adolescents.  And this leads us to the first reason why young people seem to be so unhappy nowadays, due to a decline in both mental and physical health.  Starting with mental health, more American teens and young adults appear to be struggling with mental health issues, and experts believe a number of cultural trends may help explain why.  A new study found the percentage of teens and young adults with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues has increased sharply over the past decade.  The same pattern was not seen in older adults.  While the researchers didn't study the reasons behind the trend, they have some theories, such as shifting cultural trends over the past decade, including increased use of electronic communications and digital media, may have had a larger effect on mood disorders among younger generations compared with older generations.  Quote, recently there's been a number of studies showing that those who spend more time on digital media are more likely to be depressed and unhappy.  Now, obviously, social media can in no way be blamed for all of the world's anxiety and depression issues, but it certainly does seem to play a significant role.  Well, of course, some people might be lucky enough to find a warm and welcoming, cozy online community like a gamer community or a book club, for example, There are, on the other hand, countless toxic communities, just like at Twitter.  These days, the entire website seems to consist of nothing more than artificial outrage, virtue signaling, people insulting and lying about one another, articles about how the world is going to end in 12 years due to climate change, how we all need to start eating bugs, drinking cockroach milk, not thinking too much, giving up our right to privacy, and living in pods.  Just imagine a young straight white man scrolling through Twitter being confronted with article after article telling him how inherently racist, toxic, and privileged he is.  And further imagine a young girl scrolling through her Instagram feed rife with filtered posts boasting lives that seem far better than her own.  People with more followers, more money, prettier faces, better bodies.  Is it in any way surprising that such an atmosphere will lead to anxiety, depression, and an overall sense of discontent?  As for physical health, it's no secret that millions of Americans are fat, not just in America, but many in the West in general.  In the US, the nation's obesity rate is approaching 40%, after holding around 34-35% between 2005 and 2012.  I'm sure there are some people out there who believe that having a population that's 40% obese isn't a cause for worry.  After all, the media does go on all day long about how there's beauty at every size, health at every size, no matter how obese.  But the truth is that this narrative of obesity being just as healthy as a normal weight is a deadly lie.  Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately 100,000 to 400,000 deaths in the United States per year.  Just a few of the health problems associated with obesity are heart disease, diabetes, cancer, gout, gallbladder disease, and breathing problems.  So while the media can continue to peddle the narrative that being obese is a wonderful thing, I highly doubt that if you have such diseases or are at risk for such diseases, that you're a happier person for it.  Not to mention that if you are obese, it restricts your mobility and energy levels.  And as for the studies, they actually do say that exercising makes a person far happier.  Instead of logging extra hours at work in hopes of getting a raise, maybe you should just hit the gym instead.  as it could make you just as happy as that extra money.  an interesting new study published in the lancet found that people who are physically active have a greater sense of well-being than those who are inactive and that active individuals feel as good as inactive people who earn twenty five thousand dollars more per year after mental and physical health.  the second reason why young people seem to be so unhappy nowadays is due to a lack of meaningful companionship.  You go surveyed 1,254 Americans over 18 about friendship and loneliness.  And at 30% millennials were the most likely age cohort to say they felt lonely often or always.  By contrast, 20% of Gen X respondents said they felt lonely often or always, and only 15% of baby boomers gave those answers.  Millennials were also the most likely to report having zero friends, 22%, zero close friends, 27%, and zero acquaintances, 25%.  If this wasn't a devastating enough statistic in itself, not only are many millennials lonely and without friendships, They're not getting married or even dating very much either.  According to a study from the Pew Research Center that compares millennials to the silent generation, Born roughly from 1925 to 1942, millennials are three times as likely to never have married as their grandparents were.  Furthermore, just over half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34, 51% of them, said that they do not have a steady romantic partner, according to data from the General Social Survey released this week.  Now, for some of us, being alone isn't the end of the world, at least for a time.  We're more than content to spend a few years here and there, working on ourselves, on our careers, but at the end of the day, we are social creatures.  We don't want to live alone and we certainly don't want to die alone, despite the fact that certain asinine articles are trying to convince us of the opposite.  Companionship is important in every medium.  whether it be familial, a friendship, romantic, or even professional.  And this is yet another way that I think that social media can possibly be damaging, because it mimics companionship.  While of course we can certainly befriend people online, it really doesn't even remotely compare to the real thing.  To having real people by our side, sharing all the experiences, both good and bad that life has to offer.  I discovered this firsthand when I met those who I befriended online in real life.  That said, I'm in no way trying to bash online friendships.  I definitely think that they too can be fun, helpful, and consoling.  I think it only becomes slightly dangerous if online friendships are all we have.  The third and most important reason why young people seem to be so unhappy nowadays is a lack of a meaningful purpose in our lives.  A lack of a goal to strive for, both in the material sense and the spiritual sense.  In fact, as many as 30% of today's youngsters believe they are stuck in a rut, with 84% claiming they are failing to live their best life.  To be honest, when I read this study, it didn't really come as a shock to me, although of course it's still extremely sad, nine out of 10 young people is pretty much everyone.  I'm sure that many of these young people have their own jobs, perhaps even some of them their own houses and cars, but at the end of the day, what really do material things matter if we aren't personally doing something that we find significant and fulfilling.  If material things alone had the ability to make us happy, then all the rich, beautiful, and famous people would be happy all the time.  But the truth is that many of them seem secretly miserable.  If we look around our society at the moment, I think that happy is one of the last words I would use to describe it.  Rather, it's more akin to a large room where everyone is shouting at each other, arguing about who is the bigger victim and therefore should be given the most free handouts.  We put on false airs, claiming that our society is progressing, but beneath this claim all one will find is increasing tensions among those with different ideologies, threats of conflict, the breakdown of the family unit, the atomization of communities, rampant degeneracy, a floundering faith in our political and spiritual leaders, and the looming stench of totalitarianism.  All in all, we seem to be wasting away in a stagnant and soulless dystopia.  Naturally, I have my personal beliefs as to the fundamental reasons behind this decay, which can be found in the second part of having a meaningful purpose, which is having a spiritual purpose.  I realize that many of you watching this video now likely don't believe in God.  Perhaps you're averse to even hearing about God.  And in this case, the best advice that I or anybody else really can give you is to find meaning in the material realm.  Eat healthy and exercise.  Watch over your mental health.  In the same way that eating unhealthy has an effect on your body, mentally consuming unhealthy things has an effect on your mind.  Go out into the world and make real friendships.  Find people who will be there, for example, to celebrate your birthday with you rather than to just send you a happy birthday tweet via Twitter.  Add structure to your life, a tangible schedule that you can track your progress on, and work towards building up skills that will lead you towards a career that you not only like, but that you personally find meaningful.  Perhaps consider dating, and if you find the right person, attaining fulfillment through getting married and starting a family.  But for those of you watching who are Christian, or who are simply curious to listen, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I believe our society's abandonment of God is the primary reason for its decay.  Before I get to the end portion of this video, I'd like to first quickly turn your attention to a very interesting clip by Yuri Bezmenov, a former KGB informant who eventually defected to Canada, because in it he talks about the fate of civilizations that made the choice to abandon religion.

The moment they lost religion, As simple as that.  They disintegrated.  Nobody remembers about them anymore.  Well, distant.  The ideas are moving society and keeping mankind as a society of human beings, intelligent, moral agents of God.  The facts, the truth, the exact knowledge may not.  All the sophisticated technology and computers will not prevent society from disintegrating and eventually dying out.  Have you ever met a person who would sacrifice his life, freedom, for the truth like that?  This is truth.  I never met a person who said, this is truth and I'm ready to shoot me.

            "text": "Having watched this clip, it becomes all the more worrisome to learn that today, only 38% of Brits identify as Christian, the lowest proportion in the poll's history.  And on average, 69% of US adults were members of a church in 1998 to 2000, compared with 52% in 2016 to 2018.  For me, and for many others, there would be little to absolutely no purpose to our lives without God.  Knowing God is real brings a moral framework to our lives.  It gives meaning to our actions and it presents each and every new day as an opportunity for merit.  As it is for those who don't believe in God, happiness is for us, of course, a wonderful and desirable thing, but it's dangerous to make it the primary goal in our lives because seeking happiness can often devolve into being self-serving and strictly seeking personal pleasure.  There's a genuine purpose, and believe it or not, often even a genuine joy in serving God.  In fact, a recent study by Pew Research Center compared the lives of religious people and non-religious people by analyzing survey data from more than two dozen countries including the United States, Mexico, and Australia, and found that religiously active people are typically happier and more civically engaged.  Researchers found that more than one-third of actively religious adults in the U.S.  describe themselves as very happy.  And in 12 of the countries analyzed, those active in religious congregations were found to be happier by a statistically significant margin than those who are unaffiliated with religion.  That said, nowadays in particular, with how degenerate and frankly anti-God our society has become, it's certainly not easy to be a Christian.  Despite the studies saying that religious people are on average happier than non-religious people, it definitely doesn't mean that our lives are all rainbows and butterflies.  But if happiness doesn't come to us in this life in the way that we might personally want it to, ultimately we are comforted by the knowledge that if we trust in God and remain faithful to him, happiness will come to us in the next.
