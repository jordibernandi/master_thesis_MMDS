It's very evil to sit there and just make jokes about it.  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has a strict guideline to get in, and they're not allowing Chubby Checker in.  He has the number one song in the world, The Twist, from 1959, and he's been voted multiple times to be number one.  There is definitely something going on there, and can you please look into that and figure out what's going on and why he's not inducted?  whatever point of diverting people.  That's just something you guys do.  Great job, Alex!  We're going to be talking about the attack last Tuesday on the World Trade Center, as well as the attack on the Pentagon being a federal operation.  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!  You'll never defeat God!  You'll never win!  Come here.  Count Dracula to Von Helsing.  Come here.  Come here.  I'm not here doing anything but opening the blinds to wake people up.

What do you think, the lizard people are, Chuck?  They're demons.  They're frickin' interdimensional invaders, okay?  I'll just say it.  Make fun of me all you want on CNN or wherever, but everyone already innately knows this.  These people are not frickin' humans, okay?  Hillary Clinton is a goddamn demon.  All I know is psychopaths operate.  They're not human.  I don't like them.  Okay?  You know, I don't want this to have ever happened, but I wish it was real instead of fake.  That is 100 times more scary.  Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake, with actors, in my view, manufactured.  It's more than these dead poor children.  You got to go with your gut, man.  My gut tells me I've never felt this freaked out.  It just is the fakest thing since the $3 bill.  And you better get ready for more of it, folks.  Anderson Cooper turns.  He's supposedly there at Sandy Hook in front of the memorial.  And his whole forehead and nose blurs out.  Anderson Cooper has got some explaining to do.  Because I know blue screen when I see it.  They clearly used actors.  I mean, they even ended up using photos of kids killed in mass shootings here in a fake mass shooting in Turkey.  So, yeah, or Pakistan.  I will sit there on the air and look at every position and play devil's advocate.  Was that devil's advocate?  The whole thing is a giant hoax.  The whole thing was fake.  The Sandy Hook hoax.  The whole thing's fake.  Yes, because I remember in... even that day, I'll go back from memory, then saying, but then some of it looks like it's real, but then what do you do when they've got the kids going in circles in and out of the building with their hands up?  I've watched the footage, and it looks like a drill.  Walking in circles, in and out from the news cameras, and they come right out, a minute later, it's the same ones.  You got parents laughing, watch this, and then method acting.  Something serious is going on.  Definitely something going on there.  Uh-huh.  I mean, what's going on here?  There's something going on.  Something, though, is really starting to get suspicious.  We're going to look into it because there's something going on.  that's really, really bad.  This needs to be investigated.  It makes me like Trump more, obviously, that they ended up reaching out to us to have him on the show.  I will not let you down.  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.  Here's my message to President Trump.  It missed more of your calls than I'd like to, sir.  I wish I always had the phone glued to me when you called.  Donald Trump gave me a call, and I told him, Mr.  President-elect, you're too busy.  We don't need to talk.  Alex Jones.  Alex Jones, nice guy.  Alex, the parents, one after the other, devastated.  The dead bodies that the coroner autopsied.  And they blocked all that, and they won't release any of it?  You got coroners that start laughing, and I don't mean uncomfortably.  I mean, like, laughing.  And we know they were set and ready with that tragedy.  There is something.  What do you think's happening here?  Children did not die.  Teachers did not die.  It's fake.  You have to see what's going on.  Blue screens, it's fake.  There's something going on.  Again, we don't know what's going on.  There is something going on.  I believe in treating people like I want to be treated, the golden rule.  Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.  So I'm passing the savings on to you.  Super male or super female vitality.  Rare earth, deep earth crystals that are incredibly powerful that no one else has as a source for their iodine.  And that's pure muscle.  I've gained a ton of muscle.  I know I personally am getting prepared.  We're offering some of the biggest specials ever.  I make sure it's the very best product.  We don't make a huge profit on it, but I think we just sell more and make a bigger profit from our operation.  That's how capitalism works.  Roy Moore, 30 plus years ago, told women, some of them who might have been under 18, they were pretty.  Well, you know, and I mean, I mean, all the time I'll sit there.  I've got three daughters, but I'll sit there, you know, at a play or whatever, tell girls, you sure look nice.  It's Hollywood.  They're the ones all doing it.  That's like a Texas thing.  They say don't even do that.  Like, hey, sweetie, how you doing?  I'll say to, you know, like, waitress, come over.  How you doing, darling?  Yeah, you can't.  And like northerners go, what the hell?  That woman just called you darling.  Yeah, you can't say darling.  That's what you do in the South.  You can't even.  And these are women on Facebook.  We don't even know knew him.  And then he's, of course, denying it all.  I should have.  Well, you know, no one's.  You just know this is the next for everybody.  This is it.  Oh, they make it so uncomfortable that if you're with your kids at the park, you're not supposed to talk to other people in their families if you're a male.  But then meanwhile, they allow the sexualization of children.  Yeah.  It goes on and on and on, and that's how the new world order is coming about.  We'll come back and join us soon.

Because I know blue screen when I see it.  They clearly used actors.  I mean, they even ended up using photos of kids killed in mass shootings here in a fake mass shooting in Turkey.  So, yeah, or Pakistan.  I will sit there on the air and look at every position and play devil's advocate.  Was that devil's advocate?  The whole thing is a giant hoax.  The whole thing was fake.  The Sandy Hook hoax.  The whole thing is fake.  Yes, because I remember in... even that day, I'll go back from memory, then saying, but then some of it looks like it's real, but then what do you do when they've got the kids going in circles in and out of the building with their hands up?  I've watched the footage, and it looks like a drill.  Walking in circles, in and out from the news cameras, and they come right out a minute later, and it's the same ones.  You got parents laughing, going, ha, ha, ha, watch this, and then going, method acting, going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I lost my son.  I buried my son.  I held my son with a bullet hole through his head.  I know grieving parents do strange things, but it looks like he's saying, okay, do I read off the card?  He's laughing.  The fact that they're having people script things and that answers are being scripted is incontrovertible.  Something serious is going on here.  Definitely something going on there.  I mean, what's going on here?  There's something going on.  Something, though, is really starting to get suspicious.  We're going to look into it because there's something going on.  that's really, really bad.  This needs to be investigated.  It makes me like Trump more, obviously, that they ended up reaching out to us to have him on the show.  I will not let you down.  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.  Alex Jones.  Alex Jones.  Nice guy.  Alex.  The parents, one after the other, devastated.  The dead bodies that the coroner autopsied.  And they blocked all that and they won't release any of it?  You got coroners that start laughing, and I don't mean uncomfortably, I mean like laughing with the state police when they're giving press conferences.  People who've been coached, people who've been given cue cards.  We know they staged stuff, they've staged it before.  And we know they were set and ready with that tragedy.  There is something... What do you think is happening here?  I can tell you children did not die.  Teachers did not die on December 14, 2012.  It's fake.  You have to see what's going on.  Blue screens, it's fake.  There's something going on.  Again, we don't know what's going on.  There is something going on.  Donald Trump gave me a call.  And I told him, Mr.  President-elect, you're too busy.  We don't need to talk.  But we still spent over five minutes.  He said, listen, Alex, I wanted to talk to you to thank your audience, and I'll be on the next few weeks.  He's not calling other media.  He's not meeting with other media.  He's not talking to me.  He wanted to directly talk to you and thank you. ",
