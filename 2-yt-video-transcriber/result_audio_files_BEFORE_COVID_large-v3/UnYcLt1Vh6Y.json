            "text": "In 1776, our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility.  It was the idea that people, no matter who they were, would simply have the possibility of thriving.  We have not ever totally actualized this ideal, but at the times when we have done best, we have tried.  And when forces have opposed them, generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces.  We did that with abolition and with women's suffrage and with civil rights.  And now it is time for a generation of Americans to rise up again.  For an amoral economic system has turned short-term profits for huge multinational corporations into a false god.  And this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the well-being of we, the American people, and the people of the world.  and the planet on which we live.  Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem.  We, the American people, must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility.  We must say no to what we don't want and yes to what we know can be true.  I'm Marianne Williamson, and that's why I'm running for president. ",
