            "text": "Hey, what's up guys?  I'm Dr.  Boyce Watkins from Your Black World and the Black Business School, and I want to say hi to everybody that's here.  And I also want to give a special shout out to Black London.  We had an event in London, and you guys may know this, but I'm going to tell you, Black London is a very special place.  It's probably my favorite place on earth.  No disrespect to my people back home in America, but I think the people in Black London just really have something really unique going on in terms of Uh, the fact that it turns out sometimes they're just kind of ready for certain things that, uh, that African-Americans where we still have to work through these things.  Um, uh, when I go to London, I see a lot more, um, people that are just really well put together, uh, uh, super sharp, um, you know, uh, strong families, uh, et cetera.  And I, and I think a lot of it has to do with, um, the fact that they, they don't, they're not as stifled by the slave culture as we are as African-Americans.  A lot of people, um, I spoke to a guy in London last night and he actually gave me an insight on this with that thought about, and he said, you know, in London, a lot of us have only been, our families have been here for 50 years.  So we don't have a long 400 year relationship with London the way, um, black people do now.  that's not true for everybody, of course, but, but his family and a lot of other families.  And I thought about that and I think that's a good point, but what's interesting is that, um, I think that we, as African Americans should pay attention to what's happening in places like London, because.  There's a lot of interesting racism that happens there.  In some ways, it's a little more stifling.  I would say that, for example, I don't see as much of an entrepreneurial spirit within the Black London community because I think that there are all these rules, regulations, and very subtle racism, systematic racism that really kind of slows down their progress.  And I think that we're all in the same struggle.  And I encourage those who are open-minded to really understand that.  Right.  So that's just my quick thought there.  Um, but I, I love, I love it here.  I mean, when I come here, it feels like a second home and, um, and, uh, and I just, I just, I just love it when I get to see you guys in person and, uh, the next city I'll be in is Chicago, by the way, which I mean, come on Chicago.  That's, that's my city.  So, uh, you can go to drboychicago.com.  If you'd like to join our investing seminar, we're going to be in there for the entire day.  Um, it's going to be seven hours long and we're going to cover.  all aspects of investing.  When you walk out of there, you'll be very comfortable with investing and what that entails.  Now with that said, um, let's jump into the conversation real quick.  Um, I saw, I was asked about this, so I thought I would address it.  Um, there was a video that popped up, uh, with a, uh, black family that just got into some real, real, just, you know, like plantation shit, uh, you know, at Disney.  I saw this video, and I don't know what the background is in terms of why things popped off like this, but I saw a man punching out his own sister and then knocking his mother to the ground.  His mother was on a roller scooter, and the sister was kind of a big woman, and apparently she'd spit in his face, which we know.  that's not cool, spitting people's faces, but at the same time, um you know this man at disney world of all places.  it was in toontown or something where the little children are.  um and this dude is just wailing on these disney.  oh excuse me we're wailing on his sister and his mother.  and then there was another lady there and i don't know if she was related or not.  i know they all came together you know.  so there's a lot to unpack with that and i'm not gonna sit here and try to psychoanalyze every detail because i don't know these people i don't i don't know you know why they were fighting or anything like that.  But a few thoughts that come to mind.  Number one, the fact that they all came there together and they were all friends or in family members before they arrived really almost makes that situation a microcosm of of that slave mentality that we have as black people.  You know, sometimes the people we want to fuck up the most whose asses we want to kick the most are the people that we proclaim to love 24 hours early.  You know, and you guys have seen it.  You guys have seen it play out in public.  You've seen it play, even play out in my space, you know, in terms of what I do.  I've had, you know, situations where I've been like, wait a minute, I thought we were cool.  And now you want to kill me.  Like, I don't understand that.  How does that happen?  And it makes me think about the fact that they say, you remember that Martin Lawrence movie, there's a thin line between love and hate.  So a lot of times the people that we hate the most and want to hurt the most are the people that we love the most, you know, because maybe we're re-traumatized and don't know how to handle the trauma Or whatever the case may be.  So that's what I. that's one thing that I saw.  Second thing is, you know, I think this relates to the first actually in our families in general, not that most families would do this.  I mean, this was just some trifling shit.  Like, let's just be clear.  This was extraordinarily trifling.  Right.  This was not even to say this wasn't black culture.  This was something else.  Right.  Um, but you know, we've all had, we've all seen it though.  We've all seen, you know, black people killing other black people.  We've all seen, uh, you know, uh, a husband and wife or baby mama, baby daddy drama, where two people claim to love each other to death, you know, three months ago, got each other pregnant.  And then three months later, they're like, ah, fuck that motherfucker.  I can't stand that nigga.  He ain't shit.  And she fucked that bitch, man.  She do it.  But you know, seriously, you know, it's, it, it makes us look stupid.  I'm gonna tell you the truth.  Just honestly.  I'm taking OG status here.  It makes you look silly when the person that you were ready to fight for, you were ready to fight me over that person three months earlier.  You were ready to fight the world for that person three months earlier.  You told the whole world you loved that person three months earlier.  Now you're trying to reconvince me that this person is a terrible person, that they're a mortal enemy.  Well, just be clear.  how you address, how you talk about people that you used to be close to.  is a reflection on you.  It makes you look flaky.  You know, because what I mean, in my opinion, if you're really staying on code and understand consistency and loyalty and stability, then you're going to be pretty consistent across the board in terms of, you know, if I loved you in 2017, I'm going to love you in 2019.  Doesn't mean things can't change.  Doesn't mean I can't have some hard feelings about certain things that might have happened.  Doesn't mean things could not have evolved.  but I should be able to explain that evolution to you.  I should say, you know, I love that brother, he's really cool, but yeah, you know, sometimes things don't work out and we did business and it just didn't go so well, but I wish him the best, right?  That's kind of a mature response.  The ridiculous response is, you know, I want to punch out my own best friend, relative, whatever it was, baby mama, whatever, because that person upset me, right?  So I think that the ability to resolve disputes It's something that we as a community collectively must, we need to become masters in that shit.  Why?  Well, because our original masters, our slave masters spent 400 years teaching us how to want to kill each other, right?  They spent hundreds of years teaching us how to want to promote our own genocide.  You know, they spent hundreds of years teaching us how to do greater harm to ourselves and to each other and to our own flesh and blood.  that we would do to the people who actually are harming our community.  And so I think the ability to resolve conflicts is really important.  If anybody wants to learn something from crazy situations like that, you know, one thing you should learn is that a house divided will always fall.  And if you want to know why black folks have trouble establishing and maintaining our institutions, whether it's our families, our businesses or whatever, it's because a lot of us can't get along.  We get mad.  We get triggered.  Next thing you know, we cussing each other out, punching each other out, you know, taking each other out, whatever.  Because you're taking that pain that you have and you're you're throwing you're puking your you're you're puking your pain onto your brother, onto your sister.  And and I just think we got to kind of address that.  We got to deal with that.  You know, you know, I talked to a therapist or two about it.  And and one of the things that one of my therapist friends said that that was really interesting.  She said there's a lot of pain in their family.  And and I agree with that.  I think I mean, obviously, you know, usually when somebody acts out like that, it's due to some sort of pain, some sort of trauma.  Now, where I, you know, my position was and this is the next issue I think we can unpack on this.  My issue is that a lot of us feel pain.  A lot of us feel hurt, feel mad.  A lot of us go through some shit.  We all do.  But you do have a choice in how you respond to that pain.  And I've heard this.  I've seen people say, well, the only reason I punched out, man, was because she did this and that.  Yeah, but you still chose to punch her out.  You didn't choose to be traumatized, but you do get to choose how you respond to that.  Because I'll tell you, this punk-ass dude punching out his sister and his mama, my God, what is wrong with you?  When I see that, a couple things I know for sure.  Number one, he ain't got no strong father in the house.  I bet every penny on earth that that black man, big ass dude, look like he's in his 20s, maybe 30s.  This big ass dude, I bet you anything.  he does not have a strong father in the house.  Because there's no man I know who would go punching out his mother and his sister with his daddy around.  I just don't see that.  So, you know, I think this idea that somehow whatever trauma he's gone through would justify that kind of behavior, I contradict that by saying, look, I bet you if a prison guard put a billy club upside his head, he ain't going to be punching the prison guard back.  If he punches one more time, they'll knock his ass out.  And so to me, a lot of times when you get those punk ass men that want to go beating up on women, when they confront a real man, they get took down quick.  And so when those men finally jumped in and got on his ass, he wasn't doing all that shit.  And that leads to the next point.  I was watching this thinking, why were the Disney security guards not on that shit?  I mean, you got little children watching these grownups act like children, act like violent children.  Because I mean, it wasn't just the man that was acting a damn fool.  It was the women and everything.  I mean, one lady said, hold my baby and pushes the baby stroller to the side and the baby strollers just rolling and the baby sit there like what the fuck what the fuck's going on like like the baby don't know where.  the baby's literally rolling into oblivion while the baby's mama is trying to have a fight.  that makes me think about another video.  i saw where a girl was on a bus and she saw another girl.  she wanted to fight and she said hold my baby and she throws her baby into the hands of somebody.  she don't even know.  she literally threw her baby into the hands of some lady who's like whoa And then she goes and starts wailing on this other girl.  And it's crazy.  I mean, some of us out here acting butt naked, crazy, seriously.  And I was watching, I said, wow, this is a boondocks episode waiting to happen.  When I saw that, I said, oof.  And I will say that overall, even though most of us would not have done what that family did, A lot of us as black people, I think we can relate to that a little bit because maybe we know somebody who would act out like that.  Or we've been in ghetto ass situations like that and tried to rise above it.  But maybe sometimes you did, sometimes you didn't.  I know sometimes when I'm in ghetto ass situations, I can rise above it.  Sometimes I get ghetto too.  Sometimes being around base behavior brings the worst out of me.  It makes me into a man that is different from the man that I'm supposed to be, right?  So ultimately, That whole fight at Disney World, I think, was sad for a lot of different reasons.  I think Disney needs to apologize to the people that were there.  They need to, you know, talk about their security.  Somebody could have got hurt.  Somebody could have got killed.  You don't know that man got a gun.  If he crazy enough to punch out his mom and his sister, it's not too much of a stretch to think he might have a weapon, right?  And the fact that it took them that long to get back to the situation is downright shameful, you know, So those are my thoughts on the situation.  I'd love to hear your comments on it.  There's not much else to say.  I just kind of watched it and I just got very, very sad, you know, just kind of seeing that.  I don't like to see black men behaving like little bitches.  It does not appeal to me.  And he was a bitch, you know.  I don't care.  I just, you know, I mean, even if a woman hit you, I just don't think you have to hit a woman.  I just don't believe that.  I think there's ways to handle it without getting violent.  But if she didn't hit him, if she just spit on him or whatever, no, you can't just go cracking people in the face and all that stuff.  And I'll tell you, a lot of what you see sometimes from the bitch-ass men is the result of a fatherless community.  And also, ultimately, a lot of this stuff goes back to white supremacy.  The cage that the white man keeps you in causes you to act like an animal sometimes.  We act like animals toward each other, not all of us.  Again, most of us wouldn't do what this guy did or what this family did.  But a lot of us have been in situations where we have done harm to each other because of the trauma.  And what mass incarceration did was it took the fathers and the mentors out of the community.  So when you see a man beating up on a woman in public and then some other bitch-ass man holding the camera and filming it as it's happening, just know that's the result of a fatherless community, which happened primarily due to the Bill Clinton crime bill and mass incarceration epidemic.  a lot of your strongest black men are in prison.  And in fact, when I go to London, one of the things I notice and observe is that, I'll be down in, I'm literally gonna be done in less than five minutes.  So one of the things I observe when I'm in London is I see a lot of strong, intelligent black men, well-dressed black men, sharp, good jobs, making good money, doing well.  And I don't see that as much.  when I'm in the States, I see, I see solid brothers in the States, a lot of solid brothers in the States.  But you know, I, when I come here where the mass incarceration epidemic didn't quite happen, but I think it could happen somewhere because the crime rate is going up, the murder rate in London is going up.  Uh, but I, but I see it, I just see a different kind of black man.  You know, I see, I'd see a different kind of black family.  So these things that you've been put through have affected the structure of your families at a, at a molecular level.  and it's going to impact us for several generations.  So those are my thoughts on it.  I think it's shameful, dastardly, embarrassing, ridiculous, and just really sick to observe that.  And I was very, very sad about it.  But anyway, if you want to see the videos out there on YouTube, I'm not going to show any clips because I'm trying to glorify it.  I think it's interesting to kind of talk about it and analyze it and we can benefit from it.  But yeah.  So anyway.  All right.  So sorry.  I didn't mean to, I didn't depress anybody with this conversation, but But as you guys know, this is the home for intelligent black people.  And the world is your university.
