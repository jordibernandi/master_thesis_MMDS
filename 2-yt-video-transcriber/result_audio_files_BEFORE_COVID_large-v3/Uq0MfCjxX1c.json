            "text": "On January 27th, Honest Reporting joins the global We Remember campaign in memory of the six million Jewish lives that were stolen because of hate and propaganda.  The Nazi regime intentionally used misleading or false information to foster anti-Semitism and dehumanize the Jewish people.  It was most effective when it tapped into pre-existing prejudices.  And we continue to see examples even today.  In the 1920s, the V\u00f6lkische Beobachter, the People's Observer, was the official daily newspaper of the Nazi party.  It disseminated Nazi ideology and published stories of the evils of world Jewry.  Der Angriff, the attack, was a paper founded by Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's chief propagandist.  It frequently published anti-Semitic cartoons by Hans Schweitzer.  Other Nazi publications included Das Reich, also published by Goebbels, Der St\u00fcrmer, referred to as one of the most anti-Semitic papers of all, and Das Schwarze Korps, an SS publication that promoted a law to ban relations between Jews and non-Jewish Germans.  After Hitler's rise to power in 1933, all of the mainstream German press came under complete Nazi editorial control.  Less than ten years later, the Holocaust began.  Today, in a time of rising anti-Semitism, the media's responsibility for accurate reporting with full context is greater than ever.  This Holocaust Remembrance Day, please help us make a difference by signing our petition asking the media to officially adopt the international Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism.  Because we remember the six million Jews we lost at the hands of baseless hate spread by Nazi mass media. ",
