            "text": "This bipartisan Democrat bill provides $100 billion over 10 years for states to establish reassurance programs with federal restriction.  That program should only apply to individuals enrolled in Obamacare plans.  There's some issues in this, too.  Finally, this bill does not include language affirming the longstanding consensus that federal dollars should not be paid for abortion services.  I know we disagree on this subject a lot of times, but we're talking about abortions.  I don't want my tax dollars going for that.  I mean, we start talking about the idea of being able to kill a baby after it's born.  I don't want my tax dollars going for that.  I know, but this bill doesn't have language to stand that.  You start talking about ACA, you can go off the rail and start talking about ACA and start saying all this.  I mean, my gentleman from California a while ago saying as an employer that he complained about health care prices.  Well, let me tell you, as a current employer, you ought to pay those health care prices now with ACA.  My employees that I have currently, because I'm still an employer, their biggest complaint that they have about ACA is that their coverage sucks.  It doesn't cover anything.  Their premiums are off the chart because it does nothing.  You want to talk about ACA prices?  Let's do something about it.  We start talking about bipartisanship.  I'm a gentleman from New Mexico.  What have you proposed that's actual serious about a bipartisan approach?  I want to fix it too.  No one in this place doesn't want to fix it.  We want to fix it, but all we see is just Republicans are bad and Democrats are bad.  No, if I did, I would already tell you.  You already had your time to talk.  At the same time, we start talking about it.  I said I wasn't going to yield to you.  You can shut up now.  Point of order. ",

If somebody was offended by the five-letter words which I used, I don't consider that a curse word, and I would apologize if anybody would think those words are offended or offensive.

So, absolutely, but I don't consider that a curse word, and so I apologize if it came across that way.  What I was saying, and when I was interrupted, is we was talking about ACA, and ACA, A lot of people want to talk about it, good, bad, or indifferent.  It's healthcare.  It's what we have.  If we want to get serious about trying to fix it, then I'm all about it.  Because I have 200 plus employees that are struggling each day with trying to pay for healthcare.  And the only thing that's happened since ACA was introduced is it's skyrocketed their insurance, it's skyrocketed their cost, and their premiums are completely unaffordable.  The number one complaint that my HR department gets right now is how worthless their healthcare is.  If we want to talk about fixing it, fine, let's talk about it.  But we always say the Republicans this and the Democrats this.  What have we done?  Set point fingers at each other and try to get political scoring points.  We do it.  All we've heard over there is Republicans this and all you get back is Democrats this.  But where does rubber meet the road?  Where do we actually come together and say, hey, let's do it the best for the health care?  I mean, we're talking about medical prices, talking about drug prices, and we talk about everything else in between.  I'm serious about it.  I want to fix it.  I mean, I grew up on eating health care, and a lot of things can be fixed on it.  Where do we want to start?  I'm willing to work with you all.  That I yield back. ",
