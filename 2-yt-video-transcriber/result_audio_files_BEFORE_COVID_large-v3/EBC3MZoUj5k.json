He's left a big, gaping, Super Dave-shaped hole in the heart of Stuntman fandom.  No one will ever replace him.  But I am happy to introduce you today to an up-and-coming Stuntman wonder man.  his name is superhuman.  he's so superhuman.  he has an extra M yet so humble no capital letters.  Wow I found superhuman just recently and I love him and my daughters love him too.  so I was happy when he agreed to allow me to introduce him to you and excited to see that he likes our own videos.  If you're wondering what the Whoop Whoop is about, you have to see his standard introduction. ",
