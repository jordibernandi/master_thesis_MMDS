            "text": "Hi brothers and sisters, it's Pastor Tim Henderson.  Well, I want to talk about the Ten Virgins today because I think that many of you are confused.  And I know theologically there are differences of opinion on this parable, but I'm going to read it for you from Matthew 25, the parable of the Ten Virgins.  Then the kingdom of heaven shall be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.  Five of them were wise and five were foolish.  Those who were foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them.  But the wise took jars of oil with their lamps while the bridegroom delayed.  They all rested and slept.  But at midnight there was a cry, Look, the bridegroom is coming.  Come out to meet him.  Verse 2.  Verse 3.  So I'm going to go to my notes.  I'm going to break this down for you.  So the first word is, Then, in that passage, in chapter 25, verse 1, the first word, then, referring back to chapter 24, clearly places this parable in the time preceding and during the king's return to earth.  There's a difference between the rapture and the second coming.  So that's where a lot of people get really confused and mixed up.  And the Olivet Discourse, and this is referring to the period... after the rapture of the church.  So it clearly places this parable in that time preceding and during the king's return to earth.  Jesus likens the kingdom of heaven at that time to 10 virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.  Five of them were wise and had oil for their lamps.  The others had none.  while waiting, all fell asleep.  The five wise virgins represent true disciples of Christ in the tribulation.  The lamps speak of profession, and oil is generally acknowledged to be a type of the Holy Spirit.  The foolish virgins represent those who profess to hold the messianic hope, but who have never been converted and thus do not have the Holy Spirit.  The bridegroom is Christ the King.  His delay symbolizes the period between his two advents.  The fact that all ten virgins slept show that outwardly there was not much to differentiate them.  At midnight, the announcement rang out that the bridegroom was coming.  In the previous chapter, chapter 24, we learn that his arrival will be heralded by awesome signs.  The virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.  All wanted to appear ready.  The foolish ones, lacking oil, asked the others for some, but were sent to buy some.  The wise ones' refusal seems selfish.  But in the spiritual realm, no one can dispense the Spirit to another.  Of course, the Holy Spirit cannot be purchased, but the Bible does not use money.  the literary figure of buying salvation without money and without price.  While they were gone, the bridegroom came.  Now this is what you need to know.  In the Syriac and the Vulgate versions, it says that he came with his bride.  It says he came with his bride, and that has been taken out.  Brothers and sisters, I love all the translations.  This is why we study.  We go back to the original Hebrew and the Greek and the original scrolls.  And if you go back to more ancient manuscripts, there are things that you get.  I'll give you an example.  When Jesus was in the garden and because we just had we just had Resurrection Sunday.  When Jesus was in the garden and they came for him to arrest them and they were asking where he was.  The translations that we have often today says that Jesus says, I am he.  That's not what the original scrolls say.  They say, I am.  And three to six hundred men fell as if they were dead.  When the Creator speaks, things happen.  Jesus was identifying himself as the I am that God identified himself with Moses as.  He is God.  God the Son.  He always was God, and he was fully God and fully man, right?  He always eternally self-existed.  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  He left glory, laid down his glory, was wrapped in flesh, born of a virgin.  He was born.  He had to learn to suck, swallow, crawl, walk, do all the things we had to do.  He never sinned.  He was tempted, just like we are.  He knows us, and he shed his precious blood on the cross of Calvary to pay the debt.  the ransom price, once and all for our sins.  He died, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  You believe on him, you are saved.  That's what Ephesians 2, 8, and 9 says.  For we are saved by grace through faith, not of ourselves.  It's the gift of God.  It's not by works, lest anyone should boast.  We are not saved by works.  We are not kept by works.  We are saved for works, however.  So now, While they were gone, and so the Syriac and the Vulgate versions say, this is important, that he came with his bride.  Remember the time period that we're talking about here.  And this is where a lot of people get tripped up.  That fits the prophetic picture perfectly.  The Lord Jesus will return from the wedding with his bride.  We are soon, brothers and sisters, this is exciting, the body of Christ, the ecclesia, everyone, Jew or from the nations, the Gentiles, who believes on Jesus.  It's the ABCs of salvation.  Admit you're a sinner in need of a Savior.  Believe on the redemptive work of Christ on the cross at Calvary with the shedding of his precious blood that he once and for all, all sufficient, paid for our past, present, and future sins, died, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  You are saved.  See, call on the name of the Lord.  Romans 10, 13, all those who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  And so that fits the prophetic picture perfectly because then we're caught up and I believe we have a stop off at the judgment seat of Christ, the beam of seat.  That is not a condemning judgment.  And I've shared before the vision I've had of that.  Things that I, you know, I would have thought, wow, I'd be rewarded for burned up like hay, wood and stubble.  It's really the motive of what we're doing and things that I would never given anything to was so expanded.  And I don't know a word.  Sometimes in the spirit, when the Lord revealed stuff, I don't, man, it is bright in here.  I don't even have the lights on.  Something's going on with the bright.  I don't know if you can see it, but there's like just light all around me.  Praise God.  Um, Thank you, Jesus.  Anyway, I just feel the presence of the Lord strong.  Thank you, Lord.  I magnify your name.  Anyway, wow.  So we get caught up and it's not to condemn us.  Romans 8 once says, there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.  But those things that were wrong, but what that bema seat, the things that are like precious that are going to be expanded are little things that some people never even think of.  The person who prays.  and obeys the willing of the Holy Spirit to intercede and does it out of the heart of love, love for Christ.  That's powerful.  When you say hello to someone or you take the moment, you recognize that they're hurting and you care about them.  Praise God, that's powerful.  Anyway, it fits perfectly.  So we stop off at the Bema seat, and then we go to the wedding.  We go to the wedding.  We're actually married.  And that week, that seven-year tribulation period, we are in the bridal chambers with the Lord.  And then after that, the wedding feast.  And I've seen visions of a banquet hall.  But remember, we get married first.  We get married first and we go into the bridal chambers.  And so I believe that people are having visions and dreams.  I know I have things post the rapture, even post that beam of sea and post the marriage.  But we get married.  So then Jesus comes back and the original transcripts say he comes back, verses 10 to 12, that he comes back.  So I'll go back to what this version says first.  But while they went to buy some, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast.  And in the Syriac and the Vulgate, it says he came back with, the bridegroom came back with his bride.  That should be in there.  This fits the prophetic picture.  As I said, the Lord Jesus will return from the wedding with his bride, the church.  The wedding takes place in heaven, Ephesians 5.27.  I want to read that to you.  So let me find that.  And that he might, this is Jesus, and that he might present to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish.  And how was that done?  By the precious blood of the Lamb.  Hallelujah.  Our faith in him.  Praise God.  Because 2 Corinthians 5.21 says, God made him who knew no sin to become sin that we might become the righteousness of God.  We are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  Our sin was imputed to him.  He became sin and his righteousness was imputed to us.  Therefore, he's going to present us Hallelujah.  And we'll have glorified bodies then.  We will have no sin nature because when we're raptured, the imperishable is made imperishable.  And that is just glorious.  So now where was I here?  Okay, so... So then the faithful remnant of tribulation saints, we know that there's going to be tribulation saints, will go in with him to the marriage feast.  The marriage feast, isn't that a fitting designation of the joy and blessing of Christ's earthly kingdom?  The wise virgins went in with him to the wedding or wedding feast, I should say.  And the door was closed.  It was too late for anyone else to get into the kingdom.  When the other virgins came seeking admittance, the bridegroom disavowed knowing them a clear proof that they had never been born again.  The lesson Jesus said was to watch because the day and hour of his coming are unknown.  Now that has application also.  For us, we don't know exactly when the rapture is going to happen, but we do know the season.  But not knowing the day nor hour, in this case, is really post the rapture.  And that's where a lot of people get confused.  Believers should live as if the Lord might come at any moment and our lamps trimmed and filled with oil.  That's for us now.  That applies for us now.  What does that mean for us now?  Believe on the Lord Jesus.  Hallelujah.  Believe on the Lord Jesus.  The ABCs, admit you're a sinner in need of a savior.  Believe on him and his redemptive work on the cross at Calvary.  that 100% justifies us.  The nanosecond we believe and we call on his name.  That's it.  Well, I hope that that helps clarify the questions that I keep getting about the ten virgins.  Remember, that's Matthew 25.  That's post.  That's post.  That's during the tribulation period.  And there will be those who come to faith in Yeshua HaMashiach, in Christ Jesus, the Messiah, during that period.  I don't believe a lot of Gentiles will come during that period.  I truly don't.  Because that's a time of Jacob's trouble.  That period, we're close to the end of this dispensation of the church age.  But again, when you go back to... There's so much that we miss when we don't understand the Hebrew and the Greek and go back to what the original said.  And I'm not... Listen, you can read the King James, the New King James, the NIV, the NASB, the ESV.  The Amplified, if people read it and they believe on Jesus, they are saved.  And so that's what's critical, right?  That's what's most important.  So we want to occupy and redeem the time.  But because many have asked me about the Ten Virgins, I wanted to answer that question for you.  Well, God bless you guys and have.  and awesome rest of your day.  Actually, let me bless you.  May the Lord bless you and keep you.  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.  May his countenance be lifted on you and his shalom, his peace, which passes all understanding.  Nothing lacking, nothing missing, complete, whole, and perfect.  be yours in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, in the name of Jesus Messiah.  I pray and I bless you.  Brothers and sisters, I'm telling you, there is such a light that is just infiltrating this room right now.  I got to go and just praise the Lord.  I just, I'm compelled to praise the Lord.  I want you to know God loves you fiercely and passionately.  I love you too. ",
