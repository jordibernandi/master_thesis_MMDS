            "text": "What's going on, America?  This is Kevin from Kevin's Corner, and I'm about to say something that's going to come across real insensitive.  I might come across a little major pain-ish.  So, I just watched a video.  I saw it on MSNBC, and they were showing that these protesters that were at an ICE facility, blocking this man from being able to get in to do his job in his parking space, decided to rush to his car.  and not move.  so of course what does he do?  he stepped on the gas hit a couple of them and then the rest of the ice agents ran out and start um pepper spraying the people to break up the crowd.  now before i give my opinion on this let's watch and tell me what you think.  James!  James!  James!  James!  so now i don't know what y'all saw.  first of all the ice agent got fired.  i guess already i don't know what y'all saw.  But let's just go through a series of events.  First of all, these liberals, these Democrats in the liberal media is tearing the country completely apart, completely apart.  Now.  I'm watching NBC and they're talking about just the way ICE is going to handle peaceful protesters.  This is just ridiculous.  Now, these people are sitting there blocking this man from getting in to do his job.  He pulls up first.  They're sitting down in the way.  They get up, run to his truck, starts banging on the truck, yelling, talking about shame, shame, shame.  They're in front of the truck.  They're on the side of the truck.  Now, I'm not sure if you've been following current events, but the last couple of weeks, ICE agents have been shot at.  There was an attempted terrorist attack on one of their agencies.  All of these things taking place.  Now, this man, at this point, instead of if there was real peaceful protesters, they'd have set their butts right there and stayed right there.  Once they got up and rushed his car and surrounded his car and was in front of his car, now all of a sudden there are potential threats.  So he gives them, he didn't just go mowing through them.  He gave them enough time to get out the way of the vehicle.  Boom, boom, boom, slight bumps.  They're still in front of the car, jumping on top of the car, banging on the car, talking about the whole world is watching.  Shame, shame, shame, and all these things.  Now, if he was a police officer, And you told someone to get out the car and they start driving forward.  I mean, or rather your police officer and these people start rushing up to your car.  You fear for your life.  OK, so at that point.  You're going to say, well, I'm going to err on the side of.  protecting my own life.  I don't know what their intentions are when they run up to my door, when they jump on the front of my car, when they're pushing the car side to side, yelling shame, shame, shame, and the whole world is watching.  You know what?  My first goal and priority is to get myself out of this.  I ain't gonna just mow them down, but I am gonna get my boop boop and get out the way.  But now they flip it and say that it was an ICE agent's fault because these knuckleheads don't want to let him come in and do his job.  And if they were peaceful protesters, they would not block him from getting into his job.  This is not a quote unquote boycott.  This is no picket line.  You know, they're not on strike.  Talk about don't come through here.  You're breaking the line.  This was this man's job.  And they're in the front of him, not letting him get through, but then became aggressive towards his car.  And yet they fired the ice age.  And then his buddies come out and pepper spray their butts.  because now they're pushing the car.  They don't know what these people's intentions are.  First goal and objective, protect our ICE agents.  Get your butt out the way.  If you're really peaceful and you're not trying to get a soundbite or a clip of people, and then you could blame them.  They were rushing, running us over.  You would have got out the way, let him go in and then resumed your peaceful protest.  But no, no, you can't go in and do your job.  And if this is the way the left is going to act, it's going to be problems coming down the stretch.  I'm letting you know that.  And the liberal media is supporting this garbage along with the Democrats.  Now, you've been listening to Kevin and Kevin's Corner.  I was mad.  I watched it.  I'm furious, furious.
