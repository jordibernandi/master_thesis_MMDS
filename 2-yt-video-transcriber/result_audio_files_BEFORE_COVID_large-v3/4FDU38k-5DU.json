Got two days to do it again.  Anyway, this is simple guys.  Look at this half of a globe.  These lines are all the same length, above sea level.  When you connect them, you get a level line.

So I was pretty much trying to explain to Nathan why Google Maps does not show that the Earth is flat.  And so obviously they started a little game called What's My Fallacy?  The problem is though that fallacies don't tend to work if the argument is incomplete.  so if i say something like if the earth is round then up is not the same for everyone.  that is not fallacious in any way.  nathan would call that being the question.  however i've not begged the question because i've only said if a then b. i have not said b therefore a And that was going to be my first premise, but I wasn't allowed to finish because I've got these forbidden words.  You can't say spinning.  You can't say globe.  You can't say round.  You can't say gravity.  So essentially, you're forbidden from making any kind of rebuttal to Nathan Oakley on Nathan Oakley's channel.  But I'm on Fight the Flat Earth's channel, so I can basically make any rebuttal to Nathan Oakley without getting interrupted. ",

An example of this would be if we were on a globe and I was in one country that's on the opposite side to a country that another person is in.  we would have different ideas of what up is.  Premise B. Height is about the relationship between two points but only on one axis, and that would be the upwards axis.  Premise C. Some definitions of level just mean having no part higher than another part.  And lastly, Premise D. is elevation literally just means height with respect to a level, like sea level. ",

So as she reaches down, the book and her shoes disappear, purely by chance but very handy as it matches the example I give.
