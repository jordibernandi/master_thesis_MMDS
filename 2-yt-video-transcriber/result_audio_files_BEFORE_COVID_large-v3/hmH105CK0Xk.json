            "text": "Y'all may think that I'm like gloating when I get to point to things that prove that I'm right.  Well, that's not the case.  I just want you all to understand.  I generally like know what I'm talking about when I speak on something.  One of those things that I tend to bring up is the fact that most actors and actresses have zero connection to the source material in comics, which is why they don't care about crapping on legacy.  Recently in an interview, uh, and wonder con, I believe Alexandra ship, who plays Storm in X-Men, had some odd things to say about the character.  Let me say, for consistency sakes, they still have not done an accurate depiction of Storm.  I know many people liked Halle Berry being casted.  I didn't.  That's not to say that she didn't do a decent job with what she had to work with.  I'm just saying that Storm ain't some light-skinned mixed chick.  She's a dark-skinned chick.  with lineage from frigging Africa.  I get why Ship was casted because technically she's a younger version of Halle Berry, but that just speaks to the fact that they jacked up in the first place.  But back to the point, after being asked by a reporter about Storm and the X-Men being brought sort of into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ship said that she wouldn't like it even though fans have called for it.  Her answer has little to do with, you know, the character or the comics.  It seems to more so rely on her being dissatisfied that she doesn't have a prominent role.  She says, and I quote, I would and I wouldn't like it because Storm barely has anything to say as it is.  I don't know about you all, other actors, but like we never talk.  So it would be really nice if we weren't piled into yet another jam packed cast in which you only see me in the back of the shot like fucking Sasquatch.  Storm is one of my favorite characters, and of course I love for her to have a tad more of a prominent role, but I understand why she's not.  Nonetheless, her answer was really lousy in terms of the character's legacy.  She doesn't care about that at all.  It seems to be more about her being irritated at the fact that she doesn't have enough lines.  I just did a video talking about how these characters are nothing but like stepping stools for the careers of these actors and actresses.  The vast majority of them don't read comics.  Most people don't read comics in the first place and probably didn't even dive into them when they landed the role or the gig.  But when she said this, It was most interesting.  Shipp says, and I quote again, no, no, I don't think Storm needs T'Challa and I think she needs her own movie.  It doesn't have to be B, it just needs to be made.  A woman does not need a man in order to give her validity and she has also been around longer than him.  There's a couple of things to unpack here.  First and foremost, yet again she proves she doesn't know what the hell she is talking about.  Like I said in another video, these actors and actresses use the clout they gain in filling these roles to promote the social and political agendas that they have.  This one, I don't need no man.  Nearly every main male character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or any movie has had some sort of like love or romantic interest, but for whatever reason she thinks it's offensive for Storm to have one.  She said this in response to a question about fans calling for T'Challa and Storm to be lovers like their little stint in the comics.  Me personally, I don't want this to happen because I didn't like when it happened in the comics.  It was forced.  It was lousy.  Marvel, for whatever reason, feels like.  they have to ensure that all of their black characters are connected and they team up and they know each other like every black person is just close to other black people like that.  They don't treat the white characters like that at all, but go read the comics over the last couple of decades.  They always make sure to team up all of these black characters.  It's like, damn, just because they black, bro, don't mean they gotta kick it all the damn time.  So I wouldn't want to see it on screen because it shouldn't have happened in comics, at least to me.  But because it happened in comics, I couldn't be too mad if they made it happen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  But that has nothing to do with T'Challa giving Storm validity.  Like, damn, bro, that's not what this is.  It's a frigging love interest.  It ain't nothing special.  Romance tends to be part of main characters in some way, shape, or form.  There's nothing knocking a woman for having a love interest, nor is it a shot at her.  The fact that she sees it this way is a tad insane.  But let's talk about the objectively wrong part of the statement.  That is, she had the nerve to say that Storm came first.  Again, yet another complete disconnect from the source material.  No, she didn't come first.  Black Panther existed a full decade before Storm was even a thing, becoming arguably the first notable black superhero.  To salvage this, you'd probably say that she was referencing their screen appearances.  But that doesn't make any sense because they are talking about putting her in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that of which the X-Men have not been a part of.  Hence the question in the first place.  No, what I think happened was that she conflated the screen appearance with the actual character.  So she actually believed that Storm came first.  That's because she has no idea what she's talking about.  I have these sorts of conversations with these normies online all the time.  They get a little... get all pissy at me.  on twitter.  they make critical errors like this like all the time because they need something to be right for the argument to be valid no matter how wrong it actually is.  look i get it alexandra you want storm to be more of a primary character than a secondary one but you lay a complete egg by speaking on things you clearly don't understand.  though you should because you're you know sort of filling this role all to promote your sort of feminism, right?  It is not insulting for Storm to have a love interest with a man, nor does it diminish her contributions or craps, you know, on her.  Not in itself, at least.  I cannot say enough that these are two of my favorite characters, Storm and Black Panther, that is.  And I didn't like them marrying each other.  With both of their connections, you know, being from Africa, I was perfectly fine with them acknowledging each other's existence.  But the marriage stuff 30 years down the line was just whack.  But Alexandra's beef has nothing to do with the source of material and everything to do with some nonsensical idea that suggests it's insulting for her to be in a relationship with a prominent black man.  Get a grip. ",
