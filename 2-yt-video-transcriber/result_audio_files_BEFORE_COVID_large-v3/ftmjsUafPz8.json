            "text": "You're looking at a grizzly bear.  Picture taken in Wyoming.  Probably this year.  Now, I live in southwestern Colorado.  And many people think there aren't any grizzly bears here.  In fact, if you do a little research, what you're going to find out is that we've killed them all.  And they're now all in nice little droids and boxes.  That's according to the mainstream dialogue.  Wildlife officials declared the grizzly extinct in Colorado in 1953.  Isn't that nice?  This is after decades of slaughtering them for sport to get paid by the government.  These little critters, which have no business being in the company of humans and vice versa.  So if you see a grizzly bear, please stay away.  But the Marion Man that battled the grizzly and lived in 1979, and it is now, this September, the 40th anniversary of the last grizzly bear killed in Colorado, southwest Colorado, just a few miles from here.  This Marion Man shoved this arrow in the grizzly's neck, and the story is amazing.  They were up above 11,000 feet September 1979.  And he had just enough time to holler.  no before a huge bear sacked him like a 400-pound linebacker sacking a 190-pound quarterback.  The next thing he knew, the bear was on top of him, chewing his lower right leg and right shoulder.  Now, he eventually \u2013 you have to read this story.  It's insane, and it just came out in another book.  I read this book that came out in the 90s about this story, and it's well worth the read.  Go get it.  He actually saved his life by jabbing this into the jugular vein and then secondarily pulling it back out and stabbing the bear up in the armpit.  Then they had a 14-mile trek out of the woods in two 7-mile legs, which took almost a day.  That's what happens in the wilderness when you get attacked by a bear.  But there is another camp that believes that Colorado is grizzly bear habitat.  Yes, grizzly bears live here, and there's a picture of one in Steamboat Springs in 2011.  But if you read the comments down here, Wildlife biologists and other things say that's impossible.  The grizzly bear and the black bear.  Here they are side by side.  And currently the idea is that color and size can be misleading.  You got to look for a combination of characteristics and it's hard to tell them apart in this region because many black bears have a blonde phase.  But these bears are only around 200 250.  And these bears are more like 400, 450.  Much bigger bear.  Much bigger claws.  Long, shaggy hair as opposed to short hair.  No hump on the back on the black bear.  Hump on the grizzly.  Curved in face on the grizzly.  Rounded face on the black bear.  Plus small claws.  These are the characteristics of of black bears and grizzly bears.  The prints are quite different.  On the grizzly, it is a more wide front pad as opposed to the curved notch here.  But the hind print is very similar in both cases.  But the disc profile is very easy to spot versus the straight.  Small, round, puffy ears versus prominent, hairless ears on the black bear.  Short, dark claws versus gigantic claws.  Now why are you even watching this video?  Well, Topknot and I were at the river with Angus and we were working on the weir the other day.  And Angus came out of the woods and said he just saw a very large bear.  And you're looking at that bear.  I want you to take note of the length of hair on the bear, the size of the paws, and the color.  And the color of the cubs.  There's a tan cub and a light brown cub.  Now this is in our front yard, just yesterday.  Look at how blonde the back of this bear is.  And look at how it looks like a werepig.  Standing upright.  Just like a human.  It's very creepy.  But I believe that the werepig is a white version of this bear.  And there we see him again.  Upright.  And he's curious because the drone is now a few hundred feet away from him.  Take a look at that.  Action photo.  Boom.  Boom.  And then we can see the massive... size of this animal.  And what is that?  Is it a hind leg or is this a giant beaver tail?  And the two baby cubs.  And there's the bear standing again.  I'm giving you all the photos.  It's worth it.  There's the bear walking into the woods.  In this picture you cannot see a hump.  There's the bear standing again.  They stand when they're curious, and there's a drone flying within 100 feet of this bear.  So he was very curious as to what was going on.  We were curious because he was just in the front yard, and we thought he might be a grizzly, and we didn't want to get eaten.  And then again, this profile, you see a major dished face, which is a characteristic of a grizzly, but no hump.  Totally blonde.  Now some say that old black bears get that dished face.  And here again.  Now this bear is at least six feet tall.  If not higher.  I wasn't there, but we're about to go to this exact spot.  he was standing tomorrow.  Make some measurements on these trees and determine if we can find any prints in this locale.  We didn't go today because we Just saw the bear 12 hours ago there.  And here in this shot, not visible, but a very dished face.  Again, I'm just discussing the characteristics of the grizzly.  And here is a great picture of the bears feeding on mama.  And very hairy ears, unlike the black bear, which has a shorter hair.  This is a very fuzzy hair and a very long hair growing off the body of this animal.  Very long-haired cubs, too.  And it's becoming clearer and clearer to us that this bear might be a hybrid grizzly black bear variety that has not been particularly located.  Here, take a look at the hump on the back here.  And the extremely long hair.  And there's a few more pictures that have... Make it look a little more grizzly-esque.  That's an interesting picture there.  Sitting up to feed one of the cubs is right underneath of her.  And this is all happening a thousand feet away from us, which is amazing.  Because you want to go there, but you also want to survive, so you don't want to make the wrong decision.  You be the judge.  You want to see some more of these pictures?  I'd be happy to send them to you.  If there's anyone in particular that strikes your fancy.  Look at the size of this bear standing in the woods.  And it was standing for most of the time.  Simply because there was a drone flying around in its general vicinity.  And then here is my telltale Conclusive evidence that this is not a black bear.  This is a bear standing vertical now here with huge back haunches, huge forearms, dangling claws, which are visible right there.  That is a visible claw right there.  Black bears don't have any visible claws.  Not only that, there is definitely a hump on this bear.  That is a hump on the bear.  like swimwear.  That has been our wildlife experience over the last 24 hours.  And that is an amazing event that we witnessed.  Although, albeit by only Angus saw it live, I'm sure we'll have more encounters with his bear and her cubs this year because they're living in our front yard and they do have a, pretty large range, but they tend to circle back in these same places.  And we have the only river for seven miles.  So they're living on this river and feeding.  Guys, I hope you got something out of the video.  Black bear or grizzly bear?  You make the call.  If you think it's a grizzly or a hybrid, we're going to continue this research.  Leah is very interested in the topic.  There has been Grizzly bear research centers in Pagosa Springs for decades.  This is the 40-year anniversary on the last grizzly killed.  And we think we found something.  A new species of animal.  There she blows.  A hybrid black bear grizzly bear.  We'll call it the tan bear.  You can call it the werepig.  We're going to be doing a A video on the werepig coming up soon.  I don't know why I can't enlarge this.  And we should go out on an enlarged bear here.  We should do it.  You be the judge.  Is this just a hairy black bear?  Or is it a new subspecies of bear in my front yard?  Subscribe to the channel if this is interesting.  Share this with a botanist or other people that are interested in wildlife.  We want to get to the bottom of this.  We might be starting our own rock southern Colorado rocky mountain hybrid bear wilderness research center.  I know where this bear has been.  I'm going to collect hairs.  We will do DNA.  Stay tuned.  Be safe.  We love you. ",
