            "text": "What's going on, America?  This is Kevin from Kevin's Corner, and it's Monday.  Just another Maddie Monday.  Oh, that's my fun day.  Oh, it's not Sunday.  Oh, you know that, you know, so anyway.  So I guess the NAACP Image Awards took place and Chris Rock got up and said some hurtful things about Jesse Smollett.  I guess they told him prior to going out.  Hey, listen, no jokes about Jesse.  That will be equivalent to saying, I dare you to go out and talk about Jesse.  All right.  Because in Chris mind, he's like, look, man, I'm a veteran at this.  You're not going to stifle obvious comedy.  I mean, that crap was funny and Chris had to take advantage of it.  Yeah.  And see, here's what I get upset about.  First of all, I don't think there's very few humans on the planet with the exception of now maybe Jesse.  What's his name?  Jesse Jackson.  I guess they had a rally in Chicago and Jesse Jackson came out, supported Kim Fox for for just letting the bird fly away.  And it's disturbing because I'm sure Jesse and all the rest of the people for the NAACP awards all feel that Juicy Smollett was guilty.  However, it burns me up when people try to overlook corruption because it benefits their team or they identify with the race of that person.  So now all of a sudden, these black organizations, the Rainbow Coalition, whatever that means, and the NAACP, who ain't done nothing in years for black folks, cosigning corruption by bringing this dude and allowing him to even be nominated for the award and the host apparently was like i hope he wins.  that is like saying all right if i'm italian and and and uh al capone gets nominated for the man of the year even though everybody knows he was in corruption.  and i say you know what.  since you can't prove it bring al in and we hope al wins.  You know, to me, you're an enabler.  And not only that, you're showing an obvious bias to turn away and overlook some corruption because that person's either black, Italian, white, or male, female, or just simply a part of your political affiliation.  You can't make exceptions to the rules just because it benefits your party.  That's all I'm saying.  So they told Chris Rock not to come out there and say jokes, and he couldn't help it.  He couldn't help it.  He came out in Chris Rock fashion and he let Jesse have it.  But what makes me mad is I guarantee they didn't tell anybody, don't go out there and make Donald Trump jokes.  They probably might encourage that type of behavior.  But all of a sudden, they want to protect Juicy.  Now, my question is why you want to protect Juicy?  I think they not only want to protect Juicy, but they want to protect Kim Foxx.  Because if the pressure comes down on Kim Foxx and the feds get involved and start snooping around, I'm talking looking through the cupboards.  lifting up the bed sheets and stuff like that, they might find that she's connected to some other people and then it might escalate.  And I don't think they want that to happen.  So they're trying to nip it at the bud right now in Chicago by bringing out Jesse Jackson and all of them talking about.  she did a great job and she followed.  proceed.  Nah, man, you know how you know this crap was bull.  Is if this is something that's common that you do, why would you need to send out a memo asking people to find examples of it?  You should have examples laying all around.  If I'm sitting there like, you know what?  We have come up with Coca-Cola and we got the best Coke around.  And I'm telling you, you're going to love this Coke.  You're going to love it.  Well, is this the first time you you've introduced this Coke?  No, we got tons of Coke like this.  I mean, it's just it's laying all around.  Could you go get me one?  No, no, I can't go get you one right now.  Give me a couple of days.  And as soon as I walk away from the interview, hey guys, listen, I need y'all to find a whole bunch of these cokes.  The one that I just got up there and told everybody that we have tons of them.  Please go find any of these that you can get to show an example of this coke.  Well, sir, I mean, there's none laying around.  I don't, I don't care what you got to do to find the darn cokes.  So my point is, Obviously, this isn't a practical or a common theme within her office, or you wouldn't need to send out a memo asking people to find some other examples of this.  You should have it right there.  Soon as she did a little interview, she should have been like, OK, we got Jim, Frank, Pete, John, you know, Kipper.  We got all these people right here.  Yeah, these are all examples.  But she didn't do that, which shows me that she did something extraordinary for him.  And I think we all need to get to the why.  And all of these people is trying to run interference, talking about what difference does it make?  I mean, you would have got the same conclusion.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The difference is it still gives Jesse room to run around and parade and say, I didn't do nothing wrong.  I maintain my innocence and I'm standing by it.  And I'm now still the poster child of a victim and all that stuff.  No.  You embarrass Chicago, you embarrass everybody by staging this hoax, and you need to be brought to account publicly.  Don't sweep that mess under the rug and then talk about, well, he's not guilty or innocent.  It's just, he's in limbo.  He's in limbo.  How about you guys just deciding your own brains, whether he's guilty or innocent, and we'll leave it at that.  That's good enough for us.  It's not good enough for me.  I want to see the trial.  I want to see the evidence.  And Kim Fox needs to be brought right in front of somebody and be accountable to this garbage that she did.  Now, you've been listening to Kevin and Kevin's Corner.
