            "text": "so i decided as a thought experiment just like we did with the gold article on if institutions decide to really sink their teeth into gold that i would do the same thing for silver.  so what i did was i i first started with the total amount of above ground silver that's in investable form coins and bars.  So we excluded all the silver that's been used in industry, jewelry, silverware, electronics, all that, and all the known silver that we believe exists in some type of investment form.  And I basically plugged that figure into the same kind of tables we did for gold and just listed the percentages and the amounts.  If institutional investors wanted to invest just 2% of their assets into the silver market and buy physical silver.  2% seems to be the figure that a lot of these institutions would devote to any particular asset.  And I took some at 5% as well, because some may want more.  There may be a dedicated precious metals fund, for example, that would want more than 2% exposure to silver.  So I put even 5% in there.  And then with this chart, what I really felt I had to do was highlight in red the percentages that were above 100% of all the known above ground investment silver that exists, which according to the CPM group is about 62 and a half billion ounces.  So it sounds like a lot of silver, but when you look at the table, it's just completely and easily overwhelmed by the amount of cash these institutional investors have.  If they show any interest whatsoever, it could just completely overwhelm the silver market. ",

            "text": "Yeah, you know, when I look at some of these figures, it just reinforces everything for years.  I've always thought that we're going to see triple digit silver.  $150 silver really isn't that much of a stretch considering it was $50 in 1980 and it's still below its 1980 high.  To me, that's just like a no-brainer.  What hasn't happened yet is we haven't seen an event when it comes to currencies and the banking system and the markets.  We had a scare back in 2008 when it came to the system.  What we haven't seen is any panic yet.  And once people start rushing over toward gold and silver, the amount of funds that can flow into it is just astronomical.  And three times the 1980 high sounds absurdly low to me.  I really think we're going to see something much higher than that.  But I think $150 silver is actually a no-brainer.  You know, one of the things that I don't think you did in here was try and calculate any price projections.  But what you do show is that there's basically, you know, just mutual funds have enough current.  If they were just going to put 2% of their assets into silver, it would be more than 16 times the amount that all of the above ground investable silver is currently valued at. ",

In the graph above that, you show that if just 2% of mutual funds, pension funds, investment banks, life insurance, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds, if they tried to take 2% of their assets only, put it into silver, that would be 42.5 times more than the value of all of the above ground silver that there is.  That requires like your silver would have to be over $1,000 an ounce for that to happen.  They can't buy, you know, they're trying to buy at this price.  They're trying to buy 42 and a half times the amount of silver that exists. ",

They'll be buying.  That's the issue.  In a bull market, people are buying, not selling.  And so everybody has their price at which they'll sell something.  But in a bull market, there's going to be a lot more buying than there's going to be selling.  And so the problem is actually even worse than the tables outlined.  and some of the objections we got to the article.  by the way some of the people in the comments were saying well this would never happen.  and you know pension funds for example aren't going to buy silver.  well i disagree with that because we know some pension funds already are buying gold.  They're already buying gold.  That's a non-interest bearing asset.  They're still buying it.  So it's not a big step for some of these pension funds to want to be in silver.  And you have to keep in mind also, Mike, that if the stock market is falling and they're losing on that and gold and silver are rising, they're going to have a double incentive to move at least some of their assets over into gold and silver.

Gold and silver have been the best performing traditional assets of this century.  Cryptos, a lot of cryptos have way, way, way outperformed gold and silver.  But as far as traditional assets goes, stocks, bonds, commodities, number one, this century has been gold and silver.  They've returned much higher performance than anything else.  With a track record like that now, going back, we're getting close to two decades.  They're starting to go into gold.  They're going to be going into gold and silver in a big way sometime soon.  Back in the 70s, nobody was recommending to put gold in your portfolio.  that really didn't happen until the gold bull market was over with.  that happened in the 80s and they used to say put 20 or 25 percent of gold.  then it became 10 by the 90s by by the 2000s.  nobody was recommending you don't put gold in your portfolio.  so by the time it started rising again and went from 250 all the way up to 1900 the professionals were not recommending gold during that period of time where it had such spectacular performance.  And the bull market is basically back on again.  It's rising.  This time, there's enough history behind it to where all of these big funds are going to wake up.  And I do believe that a tremendous amount of the value they currently contain, these trillions upon trillions of dollars worth of value, is going to come chasing these tiny piles of. ",

But, you know, the opportunities here are bigger than just about anything.  And the nice thing is down here.  at the prices that we're at, there's a floor under both gold and silver.
