            "text": "Hello and welcome to Philosophy Vibe, the channel where we discuss and debate different philosophical ideas.  Today we're going to be looking at some religious ethics and focusing on the theory of natural law.  Natural law was advocated by St Thomas Aquinas.  The central idea behind natural law is that human beings have an innate power to understand good and evil.  God has written moral law into nature and he has created all humans with the ability to know what morality is and to recognise what is good and what is evil. ",

            "text": "Good question.  Well Aquinas got most of the grounding for natural law through the works of Aristotle.  Aristotle believed that everything in nature was constantly changing and moving and this movement was all towards its specific purpose or Delos as Aristotle referred to it.  Yes Aquinas agreed with this.  He agreed that God created the world in this goal-driven manner where everything was following strict natural laws to fulfill its specific purpose.  Okay, Aquinas said this was the same for humans.  Human beings are themselves moving to their Delos.  He refers to Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia.  You could say it's like a heaven or a state of bliss, true and pure happiness.  So Aquinas believed eudaimonia was only achieved in the afterlife, but it did not stop humans pursuing this and moving towards it.  and we move towards eudaimonia by pursuing what is good and avoiding what is evil.  if we as humans always strive to pursue good and avoid evil we get closer and closer to our purpose and to reaching eudaimonia.

The main purposes of life, what near enough all humans want and what all humans are drawn towards.  He distinguished five basic goods that he referred to as primary precepts.  The primary precepts include... Life.  So the preservation and promotion of life.  Reproduction.  So the continuation of the human race.  Education.  This is more so education of one's offspring, so they will know how to continue the human race, live better lives and even protect you when you get old.  Worshipping God.  Aquinas saw how we innately seek God.  We try to understand and make sense of our lives as a whole.  And finally, law and order.  This promotes justice and allows us to live in a functional, well-maintained society where humans can grow, develop and be safe. ",

Educating your offspring is a primary precept.  School is something that follows the primary precept and therefore follows the natural law.  School is therefore good.
