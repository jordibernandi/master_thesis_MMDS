            "text": "All right there, everyone.  Over 7,000 jobs have been lost, cut.  They've disappeared forever.  It's CNN, the Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Vice, and a number of other ultra left-wing so-called news organizations.  That's what we'll be talking about on today's video.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  You know, the old Mr.  Rogers song, a beautiful day in the neighborhood when... Ultra left wing progressive globalist news organization begin to sputter and nosedive into oblivion.  That's my version of the song, at least today.  That appears exactly what's happening in a number of left wing news sites over the last year.  Greetings everyone, make sure to smack that bell and subscribe button.

We're gonna look at just how dire things are for CNN and the Huffington Post in particular and why, why these left-wing news organizations are failing and why we can expect that the worst is yet to come for them.

When we look back at the year 2019, we may in fact be seeing, we may have seen the beginning of the end for left-wing news outlets that were once considered invincible a mere few years ago.  What Business Insider found out was a devastating pattern of layoffs that have been going on for the last 10 months that represent really nothing less than a media bloodbath.  In this year alone, over 7,000 media jobs have been lost in just the last 10 months.  According to the Business Insider tally, they found that there have been 7,200 media jobs cut over the course of this year.  Now, just to put this in context for you, okay, by comparison, it was estimated that some 5,000 media jobs were cut over the course of the previous four years combined, technically between 2014 to 2017.  So left-wing media outlets, which we'll get into in a moment, these left-wing media outlets have experienced more layoffs in these last 10 months than they experienced over the course of the last four to five years combined.  Okay, gang.  That's called winning, okay?  So for those of you, our Canadian brothers and sisters who are licking your wounds from the Canadian elections the other day, remember, right?  Elections are only one indicator for how things are going.  They're certainly a very important indicator, no question, but they are an indicator, not the indicator.  There are many more social and cultural indicators to analyze and determine the political trends going on in our world.  And the media comprises one of those major trends.  and ultra left wing media is collapsing as we're speaking.  They've lost more jobs in this year alone than they have in the last four to five years combined.  So let's have a look-see at some of these colossal collapses, shall we?  Let's start with our good old friend CNN.  They've actually had to lay off an entire division this year.  Did you know that?  CNN laid off their healthcare coverage division.  You may know them by virtue of Dr.  Sanjay Gupta.  He's a pretty famous guy.  Well, his job was safe as far as I know.  It's most of the rest of the division.  They're based in Atlanta.  Well, they're gone.  They're out.  And this announcement came just weeks after execs at CNN announced that they were planning to lay off upwards of 300 of their staffers.  Now, CNN came out shortly thereafter and denied that there were any layoffs going on, though they did admit that they let go 100 of their employees.  So regardless, CNN has been going through some significant downsizing throughout the year.  Another example of this downsizing is the ultra leftist Huffington Post, right?  In fact, the Financial Times is reporting that Verizon is looking to actually dump the Huffington Post off to someone else.  Verizon, which is the parent company of the Huffington Post, has announced that it intends to sell the ultra left wing news and cultural site that celebrates all things globalist and liberal.  And the reason is Simply, Huffington Post has become a money pit, simply not garnering the kind of ad revenue that they had hoped for.  Remember, the Huffington Post was originally touted as the future of news media, okay?  These multi-page websites with headlines on the homepage and then links to lifestyle articles along with culture and movie reviews and like, that was hailed as as that which would replace news, you know, cable news, network news, and the like.  Now, it may, but the content of the Huffington Post and BuzzFeed and others ain't making it, okay?  They're not making the kind of coin that they were projected to make.  Now, this news is selling off the Huffington Post, but the latest in a long line of bad news coming out for the Huffington Post from 2019, beginning in January of this year.  HuffPo announced layoffs, upwards of 1,000 jobs laid off as part of the parent company Verizon in its layoff.  Around the same time it was announced the German version of HuffPo, known as the Huffington Post Deutschland, They were going out of business and they eventually closed their news site in March of this year.  And then just a few years back at the beginning, a few years, a few weeks back at the beginning of October, there was a second round of layoffs that included a number of managers at the Huffington Post.  And this is largely because of the failure of their video outlet that nobody was watching.  And so this latest announcement that Verizon wants to dump them is just par for the course.  And good luck on that.  Good luck on finding a buyer.  If the ultra left wing website ThinkProgress is any indicator, the Huffington Post is toast.  Do you remember that?  It's another one here.  ThinkProgress, new site.  It's another one experienced mass layoffs this year.  It was owned by the ultra liberal Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta.  Okay, Podesta was the chairman of for Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign?  Well, this Center for American Progress simply couldn't afford this site ThinkProgress anymore.  It just wasn't making the coin.  they thought it would.  So they put it up for sale.  And guess what?  Nobody wanted it, right?  They said, hey, we got this great progressive left-wing cultural Marxist website that everybody knows about.  It's world famous, Hillary Clinton, all that.  Who wants to buy it and help lead our nation into a globalist progressive future?  And all they heard were crickets.  Nobody even came close to wanting to buy it.  And so they closed it down.  It's gone.  Think progress.  Didn't see much progress.  It didn't exactly progress in 2019.  It's dead.  It closed down in September.  Dead, buried.  Another left-wing lunatic website bites the dust.  Get woke, go broke, right?  So HuffPo is definitely in some dire straits here.  Another example is Vice Media.  The ultra-liberal social media outlet Vice actually began the year by cutting 10% of its staff, while the McClatchy Company, which owns nearly 30 newspapers across the country had to cut nearly 500 jobs from their payroll, which brought the total number of media jobs cut just in the first two months of this year to 2,100.  I think this was by February of 2019.  So the year wasn't even two months old and already it started off with 2,000 left-wing media jobs being cut.  That's how the year started.  The ultra-liberal BuzzFeed ended up cutting 15% of its workforce this year.  Gannett, which is the parent company for USA Today, cut as many as 400 jobs.  I mean, there's just no question that 2019 has been an absolute bloodbath for the corporatist globalist media.  So what's going on here?  Why the bloodbath?  Well, I don't think we have to look very far as to the answer.  While the left-wing globalist media pretends everything is awesome, fine, everything is liberal and globalist, A progressive future is inevitable and unstoppable.  A number of scholars have recognized that the vast majority of the world's populations are thinking and acting quite differently.  Our corporate globalist media outlets continue to represent the world as a massive boutique of globalism.  All the while, the vast majority of worldwide populations have rejected globalism and the modernist philosophical system that undergirds globalization.  We no longer believe in modernity, in the philosophical foundation of this one-size-fits-all political economic system.  and cultural system that's being imposed on everyone, largely through the corporatist globalist media.  And yet that system, that globalist system, it continues to dominate our world, even though we don't believe in it.  And so what's happening is that we're seeing nothing less than a massive blowback, a backlash going on all over the world against modernist globalism, where populations are once again reasserting their nation's customs, cultures, and traditions as mechanisms of resistance against globalization's anti-cultural dynamics and its secular elite aristocracy.  And so the reason why these left-wing progressive neo-Marxist news outlets are beginning to collapse is rather simple.  The liberalism they peddle is inextricably and ideologically linked to a collapsing belief system.  Right.  The ideological norms of leftist liberalism today, particularly its commitment to open borders and human rights and grievance politics, they're becoming increasingly unintelligible among the world's populations.  And so as these sites and outlets are wedded to a collapsing belief system, we shouldn't be surprised to see their ratings and their ad revenues proportionately collapse as well.  And that's precisely what we're seeing.  I think when all is said and done, we're going to look back at 2019 as the year the ultra leftist news outlets began to finally and at long last implode.  Now before you go, make sure to check out my analysis of the Canadian national election yesterday.  I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised by the analysis.  There were a lot of good things that happened in the election, even though soy boy blackface Trudeau squeaked through.  I think you're going to find the analysis rather uplifting.
