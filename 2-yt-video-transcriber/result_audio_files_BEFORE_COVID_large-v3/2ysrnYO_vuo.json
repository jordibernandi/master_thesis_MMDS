            "text": "Yeah.  Thank you.  What's going on?  It's my life to the shot me hoes down in Washington.  Now, the young lady that you're seeing there getting shot, she's 24 year old Brittany Hill.  She was shot in the right side of the abdomen.  That's her one year old child that she's holding.  Now, she was pronounced dead at 925 a.m.  at Western Suburban Medical Center.  The suspects are Michael Washington, 39.  The other suspect is Eric Adams, 23.  Now, what they're saying is that Sylvan Pollard rolled up and shot them.  This happened on the Austin neighborhood on the west side of Chicago.  the police are releasing that they were already, they was just about to set up a narcotic surveillance on one of the suspect, Michael Washington, before this incident happened.  Now, one of her neighbors, Rashad Graves, said he saw Brittany Hill seconds before she died and she stood outside with her boyfriend and played with her daughter.  She was very happy that day.  That morning, she was happy, Graves said.  They say one day you're here and one day you're gone.  So the Chicago police are releasing that they began an investigation immediately and they were able to obtain a license plate number from the pod video.  This is the video that you guys are seeing here.  However, this video was leaked.  to social media somehow.  And they're looking for the person who leaked this video.  So now, this footage was leaked to social media.  And what the police is saying is that we are taking this video release very seriously and working to establish its origin as this family deserves better.  Two men were arrested by CPD last week, and this case is now before criminal court.  We have confirmed with Cook County.  Now, this is what the Chicago Police Office Superintendent Communication News Affairs released.  They're saying the access and handling of retention of evidence in criminal investigations is of the utmost importance to the Chicago Police Department.  The defendants in this case have been arrested and the case of evidence are now before criminal court.  As a result of the unauthorized video release, we have notified the state's attorney's office and also opened an investigation to determine who electronically accessed the video and whether anything was released or compromised on CPD's end.  So now that's very serious.  They're trying to see if somebody accessed that pod video.  hacked into it or was it something on the Chicago police and how that video got leaked.  This is the video that I'm showing you guys.  It is very graphic.  The evidence has to be released in court, you know, for it to be admissible in court or whatever.  And that, you know, nothing was tampered with because the jury, because the jury's in this case, whoever, everybody in the city of Chicago is a potential juror and they can't be influenced by outside opinions.  And they don't want any jurors that's going to sit on that jury and and be influenced by social media or any outside forces.  So this is the biggest thing about this video being released because now all these potential jurors are going to already have a preconceived bias because they've seen the evidence that the CPD has against these two defendants.  So this is very sad.  She did have a one-year-old.  child that's going to grow up without a mother now.  This violence has to stop.  This is the epidemic that's plaguing this city.  So make sure you guys check out My Life with a Shot YouTube channel.  I want you guys to like, comment, let me know what you think about this video.  Peace, peace. ",
