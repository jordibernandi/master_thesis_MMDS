Am I being detained for a crime?  Can I just explain?  You know what?  If you live here, who else lives here?  Yo, what are you doing?  I'm on my property, bro.  I'm not interfering with anything, bro.  Why would you turn your lights on, though?  All right, what's your name, sir?  I'm not speaking to you right now, all right?  You are right now.  I just heard you talk to me.  And this guy's shining his light at me.  Who are you dropping off?  This gentleman here?  Okay.  And what's your name?  I don't answer questions.  You guys know me.  I don't answer questions, sir.  She don't either.  Yeah, why are you telling the ID people now?  I'm on my property.  Obstruction means I have to be in the way of you, in between you and what your duties are.  I know the law.  Oh, I know it all, dude.  I know it way more than you.  No, I really do.  I know so.  Yeah, you guys know who I am?  Right.  Right.  Studying YouTube, yeah.  Sure.  So I don't know if he lives here or not.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Can you prove that you live here?  Do I have to prove that I live here?  It doesn't matter who lives here.  You're in a traffic stop.  Do you have your ID, sir?  No, I don't have your ID.  I never had an ID.  You have your pad and pencil.  You can save the pad and pencil.  You can put it back away.  I'm not going to give you any information.  Well, you're going to have to, sir.  Why?  Why is that?  Am I a driver of a vehicle?  If you want to play the game, we can play the game.  Yo, that's cool.  We'll play this game.  Put your pen away.  I'm not going to give you my name.  Ryan what?  What?  Ryan, what's your last name, sir?  I'm not going to give you any answers.  I explained to you why we're here, right?  Am I being detained for a crime?  Can I just explain?  You know what?  If you live here, who else lives here?  Yo, what are you doing?  Get off my property right now, sir.  Look at this guy.  Look at this tyrant, yo.  Look at this tyrant.  Look at him, look at him.  Look, he's opening my door.  Ain't nobody there.  It's my house.  Get off my property, sir, please.  Get off my property right now.  This is turning into a traffic stop to coming onto my property.  Get out of here.  What's your name?  Sergeant Richards.  Sergeant Richards?  I've never met you before, man.  You're, you're, you're a new tyrant.  Hey.  Johnny, we're okay just trying to... Come up on property right now.  Come on.  Johnny, take... I have a phone without one.  Bye.  This tyrant right here wants to go on my property because he's butthurt.  Yeah, they know who I am.  You don't know who I am.  Shoot.  They know who I am.  I'm the camera guy.  Well, you can't see me?  That's why we're out here.  There's no reason for him to act.  No, no, no.  I just know my rates.  What's your name, sir?  Name and badge number, please.  I'm being kind.  Please, sir.  Name and badge number.  Exactly.  There was never a stop.  You guys just pull up, put your lights on and just want to check on people and ID them.  I am YouTube.  So we were getting dropped off and these cops over here just want to roll up and put their lights on, create a traffic stop out of nothing.  And then they want to run all over my property.  And this guy is shining his light in my camera.  Have a good day, sir.  He is too.  Yeah, man.  Beat it.  I love you, Chris.  Come on, let's go.  I'm going to stay here until the coffee.  Huh?  Yeah, they're going.  Yeah, yeah, you're good.  Yeah, you're good.  I'm going in there.  All right.  Do your thing on the side.  Don't say it too loud.  So this is a sergeant that I had never met before, and this guy wants to play the game.  Look, they're all butthurt.  Look at them both.  They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she's inside.  Look, look, is there a need for that, Boots?  Come on.  Sorry about that.  Thank you. ",
