I'm here today with none other than the climate change crusader herself, Greta Thunberg.  She's in this hotel room right behind me and I just had the pleasure of asking her a few questions.  It wasn't too hard to find her.  She's the only one in Edmonton driving a state-of-the-art Tesla with a New York license plate.  She's here without a doubt to influence the Canadian general election with dark money with foreign interests, with foreign agenda.  Frankly, we have no idea who is paying our bills, who's putting up her up in nice hotels like this, who's charging her Tesla and buying her groceries.  I had the opportunity to ask her a few questions.  Started with a quick selfie, started fun, and then I got down to the details of why she's here instead of in Saudi Arabia or China or even India.  Here's my first question to her. ",

But you're welcome to criticize them from the safety of Canada or from the safety of Sweden.  You could go to India and criticize them for their disgusting pollution of their waterways and for the damage that they're doing to the Pacific and Indian oceans.  You could go there, but you won't.  Why is that, Greta?  How dare you come to Alberta and criticize the most ethically produced oil in the world?  Why not deal with the big problems first, the huge emitters like China, Saudi Arabia, and India?  Well, I think I know the answer.  Whoever's paying your bills, whoever's giving your dad money, it's simply not on their agenda.  Now I didn't come here primarily to ask Greta tough questions.

Now right when I ask a tough question that Greta can't answer, There's no way she would be able to answer that question because really, she's not on the administrative side of this campaign.  She's just there to answer really easy puffball questions in press conferences.  And right when I asked that question, the default response was, we're going to call the cops.  We have them on speed dial.  Well, I'm sorry, honey, this is Canada.  This is Alberta.  And we don't call the cops on journalists here.  Just ask Anne McGrath, a failed NDP candidate from Calgary, who used to be a communist, she tried to call the cops on me for asking tough questions and it didn't pan out well for her.  But really, let's break down what just happened there.  I asked her what their foreign interests are.  I asked them if they were registered as third party advertisers.  their response was to call the cops because that's their sore spot.  they don't want to disclose that because they know that if we knew who was funding them we wouldn't pay them any time.  now i want to point something else out to you.  look at this guy's face.  his name is rob liddell.  he's a bbc activist the state broadcaster in the united kingdom.  he for some reason has come all the way not on a boat mind you on a plane.  he's come all the way to alberta to stage this child actor in this BBC reality show that I heard them talking about.  It's to change the hearts and minds of Canadians and North Americans to get off of fossil fuels and to embrace the agendas of the Green Party and the NDP and every left-wing party on our continent.  Look at his face.  My question to him.  How dare you?  Exploits a mentally vulnerable 16-year-old and come to the most ethically produced oil and gas reserves in the entire world and tell us how to live our lives.  When you're from the United Kingdom, you live in a democracy.  You could be criticizing China.  You could be criticizing India and Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.  But no, you come here to criticize us.
