            "text": "Ricky Gervais exposes left-wing celebrities in Hollywood, woke left-wingers go crazy and we talk about the relationship between politics and celebrities.  Right, we've had the Golden Globes again the other night, and the organisers decided to invite Ricky Gervais to host it again.  Now, every time Ricky Gervais has hosted the Golden Globes, he's been controversial, and somehow they decided to invite him again.  This time, because he said this is the last time he's doing it, and I don't think he's going to get invited again, he went completely all out with his comedy.  Now... The relationship between comedy and the truth has always been interesting.  So Ricky Gervais is not right-wing or left-wing in that sense.  And for some reason, after the other night when he hosted the whole thing, left-wing groups and activists went completely crazy and said, why would we invite a right-winger to host basically a left-wing ceremony?  Well, firstly, Hollywood isn't supposed to be about left and right, but they basically admitted that the left-wing takeover of Hollywood and the entertainment industry has been completed.  And they said, well, everybody should be left-wing, basically.  Everybody should be woke.  Now, Ricky Gervais is not right-wing.  His jokes and his comedy happened to expose a certain truth that happened to be anti-left.  that night.  And, you know, sometimes truth could be against the right.  This time it was against the left.  Now, we're going to go through the opening statement that Benny did.  And he's always expressed his opinion when it comes to these sort of entertainment circus gatherings like the Golden Globes.  And, yeah, he doesn't really care about them much. ",

Some of them happen to come from, some of them, happen to come from working class, normal backgrounds.  Most of them come from middle class, arty backgrounds.  But the moment they become rich and join this bubble of Hollywood, they completely forget about reality and the real life out there.  And for example, when it comes to lecturing the public on climate change or anything else, politics, and living a healthy lifestyle and being a better person.  Yeah, these are the same people who are drug addicts, who basically have no respect for social dynamics or their own marriages.  Yeah, this is what Ricky Gervais decided to expose. ",

Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.  So, if you win, right, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your God and... So... It's already three hours long.

            "text": "Now this whole relationship between politics and the woke.  celebrity culture has been quite interesting for the past few decades.  Probably actually, well, especially since the 80s and Ronald Reagan era when celebrities basically started to get more involved in politics and talking to the public about it.  Obviously, they've always been attracted to the left because the left traditionally used to be anti-establishment, but the left are now the establishment themselves.  They don't even realise this.  When you have in this country, in the UK, during the election, people like Lily Allen crying over the Labour manifesto when it was launched.  She was so happy and excited over it that she literally cried on Instagram or TikTok or something.  You have that.  Actually, I think it was Snapchat.  We have that.  And then at the same time, you have people like Stormzy coming out and lecture people about Boris Johnson and basically decide to brainwash young kids when it comes to politics.  And there is no wonder that not everybody in Hollywood or the whole entertainment sector are left wing.  There are a lot of people who are not political, just don't care.  Kind of like Ricky Gervais.  There are a lot of people who happen to be conservative leaning celebrities.  They exist, but they have to stay quiet because they get into trouble.  These things have happened.  Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn, a couple of years ago, when Meryl Streep was on stage ranting about Trump, the body language was quite obvious.  They didn't like it because they're both conservative leaning celebrities.  specifically Winsbourne because Winsbourne has actually been disadvantaged because of this.  Ever since Hollywood discovered that Winsbourne is conservative leaning they haven't been giving him many jobs.  This has happened to many celebrities.  If you don't follow the consensus you'll be in trouble.  Now people like Mel Gibson decided to take a different route and started to make their own films but in reality you have to go with the crowd.  This is why even in that room Even if someone happened to be right-wing, they have to basically just boo Ricky Gervais and heckle him because otherwise your certain friends will find out you're right-wing.  So this is not a healthy environment for anyone to be in.  But the people who will be damaged mostly is the public out there and democracy because you have these woke left-wing celebrities going around brainwashing people.  And... It doesn't really work anyway.  Most voters out there are smart.  And the more celebrities come out to endorse left-wing politicians, the more ordinary people are going to be, yeah, I don't really trust you.  But it does affect certain young kids.  And I have met a lot of young teenagers who have been affected by the words of Stormzy when it comes to Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson.  And they've told me, they said, well, Stormzy said Boris Johnson is a bad person.  So... That means Jeremy Corbyn is a good person.  This is not healthy.  And we have to expose them for what they are.  Now, we have a lot to talk about on this channel.  Tomorrow we have Jess Phillips as the main topic and the Labour leadership.  And I've also heard that certain Labour leaders leadership candidates are trying to bring out celebrities again to endorse them because that's going to work.  so we're going to have that and to make sure if you enjoy the content subscribe and click on that bell next to it so you get notified when the video comes out.  a video has come out every day at 5 45 p.m and on that note we have only one week to go to our brexit victory rally.  we're organizing a big brexit party and also as a thank you to you guys for supporting this channel, 100,000 subscribers.
