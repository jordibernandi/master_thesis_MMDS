            "text": "Only the optics matter.  Optics.  Noun.  The way a situation looks to the general public.  The way your actions are perceived.  Why am I talking about drama?  Aren't there bigger things to worry about?  Bigger damn fish to fry?  I'm actually going to be attempting a sociological viewpoint of this whole thing and the effects of optics and public statements by online personalities when addressing this kind of situation.  I would argue that if the left can get hyped for in-depth analysis of the Lion King movies, then maybe we could also get hyped about what's happening with the ContraPoints.  non-binary situation.  Disclaimer.  Harassment and doxing are awful.  I don't want to cancel anyone.  I don't hate anyone.  I have supported these creators for years.  I don't think that pressuring content creators to immediately cut all ties with someone is cool.  The necessary disclaimer is over.  Can't we be talking about more important things?  Do you know who really hates non-binary people?  Transphobes.  Do you know who really loves strict binary gender roles?  Fascists.  Do you know what the strict gender binary reinforces?  Sexism.  Homophobia.  Transphobia.  Oppression.  And capitalism really really really likes oppression.  I'm not saying that we need to completely destroy the gender binary.  It is fine to be a man or a woman.  I love binary people.  I love non-binary people.  Let's just all get along and be friends.  My optimism will literally kill me.  Being more inclusive would be beneficial to everyone, even to cisgender straight white guys.  There would be less rigid expectations for them.  Yes, of course, there are more important things happening in the world right now, but that will pretty much always be the case.  We can be and should be invested in talking about more than one thing at a time.  Maybe we should try and address these issues instead of sticking our heads in the sand and waiting for the next time that this inevitably happens again.  Maybe we should have conversations instead of brushing this one off.  Whether you think that their pain is warranted or not, people are hurting over this.  I've seen comments dismiss this pain as performative, which is kind of really bad.  Dismissing the pain of hundreds if not thousands of trans people?  This is just being blown way out of proportion.  Why are non-binary people hurting?  Why is this a big deal?  Transmedicalism is a huge source of tension in the trans community right now.  If you're not part of the trans community, you probably can't imagine the extent of this.  That is fine, but sometimes you can't smell the smoke, so you should probably listen to the people who can.  And when I say this, I don't mean that ContraPoints is the problem in the trans community.  No.  I think that talking about transmedicalism as a concept is actually a lot more productive than just calling ContraPoints a transmedicalist.  Although all of this doesn't change the fact that Buck Angel is definitely a vocal transmedicalist, Blair White would probably be very happy that he was included in a video.  That's not a very good look.  The LGBTQ community has a long history of a struggle with optics because LGBTQ people are desperate to finally be perceived as normal in the eyes of society.  We have a history of throwing entire subgroups of the community under the bus in an attempt at finally being accepted.  the reason that subgroups of the LGBTQ community are pushed away is because that they are bad for optics and it often has something to do with class, gender, gender expression and race.  transgender people specifically have been at the center of an optic struggle in the community for the last few years especially in the US where their rights constantly hang in the balance and they are now a mainstream talking point.  trans people are desperately trying to find their footing in the mainstream and in order to secure a place people like blair white, calvin gara and buck angel push non-binary and non-passing trans identities into the spotlight and say these people are crazy, irrational, they're not normal.  i'm normal.  this is what oppression does to oppressed people.  when trans twitter blows up at contra points this isn't just drama or harassment.  this is a fight for survival in late stage capitalism and it can get very dirty.  trans non-binary twitter is trying to push back against the representation of transmedicalism on youtube.  anyone dismissing this as no big deal should be quite wary, because the current discourse about non-binary people says a lot about the world and how it pits marginalized communities against each other.  the world isn't a safe space.  uh... i know?  I'm transgender.  I live in a world where trans women are killed for existing.  I live in a world where non-passing trans people are terrified to use public restrooms, where non-binary people are harassed on the internet.  I don't live in a safe space.  I live in a fucking danger zone, and I don't even have a very hard time navigating it.  I'm white, I'm pretty much socially invisible, I can't even imagine what it's like to be a non-passing trans woman of colour right now.  Transmedicalism is dangerous, not only for non-binary people, who it excludes from its worldview, but also for binary trans people too.  As a trans person, I have met quite a lot of trans people, I can pretty confidently tell you that there is no one way to be transgender.  Everyone has a different experience with their body, their social role, their gender feelings.  None of us have exactly the same experience with transition or even our needs when it comes to medical care.  Attempting to construct a rigid set of characteristics that we must abide by in order to truly be transgender is harmful to everybody.  very, very few people will fit neatly into that system.  This kind of gatekeeping prevents people from accessing medical care, change their gender markers, and can even lead to more violence for non-passing trans people.  The left is eating itself.  I sometimes feel like I'm part of a movement where any criticism of the largest voices feels like a threat to the movement itself, and I do understand why people feel like that.  I've felt like that before.  Watching this kind of thing go down from the sidelines can be very frustrating, especially when you feel like fascism is winking at you from the other side of the room.  however, i do sometimes think that this idea of left unity is being used to dismiss legitimate concerns from marginalized communities.  this is a bit worrying to me.  groups of people expressing pain repeatedly can be dismissed.  they will get more angry.  it doesn't make their pain less real.  people in pain can get angry.  The thing is, when large groups of marginalized people get hurt, there is no one in charge telling them what to do.  There is no behavior agreement.  Things can get very messy very fast.  While some people still think that the pain isn't justified, I would remind them that that does not make the pain less real.  Even if you don't understand it, it's still there.  Some people definitely won't know how to deal with that pain in a healthy way.  A big group of uncoordinated, disconnected, decentralized, hurt people is always going to end up with some people taking it way too far and participating in toxic behavior.  This is a non-binary hate mob, not criticism.  because it's non-binary trans people on twitter suddenly it's a group of sensitive snowflakes making a fuss over nothing or it's a rabid hate mob.  people think these things because that's what it looks like from the outside.  it's all about the optics.  the twitter format itself is a format that leans towards toxic behavior.  I think most of us will agree on that.  However, if a group of people use it to voice their concerns because it's one of the only places where they have managed to build a solid community and they know they will be heard, can we blame the whole group for the actions of a few?  Has anyone paused to think about why trans non-binary people are such a big Twitter demographic?  Has anyone paused to consider that it might be because other platforms such as YouTube are such scary hellscapes for non-persing or non-binary trans people?  Irrational, crazy, Tumblr, safe space leftists.  Watch a couple of Blair White videos and you'll catch my drift.  I'm not saying that everyone sees us this way, but a lot of people do.  Including a transmedicalist in a video essay was bound to cause a lot of discussion and even outrage.  The online trans community is very aware of Buck Angel's views.  Transmedicalism is often praised by conservatives, or even TERFs and transphobes.  These people wish to gatekeep medical care for trans people as much as they can.  This is why Graham Linehan, of all people, cozies up to Buck Angel on Twitter.  And although you might not think this is a big deal, for a lot of people, it is.  This discourse could have very real consequences on their access to medical care or even their human rights in the very near future.  The discourse surrounding trans people right now is quite ironically in a stage of transition into the mainstream.  people are suddenly a lot more aware that we exist and the tension arising in the community is a result of the transphobic society that we are all trying to navigate.  people like Blair and Buck do what they do because they legitimately think that it's their best shot at being accepted.  they think that non-binary and non-passing trans people are a threat to transgender optics.  therefore they declare these people as not really transgender to not be associated with them.  the public statements.  There has been quite a lot of criticism of the public statements.  Don't get me wrong, their content is great.  Thank you for your content.  However, I think that a lot of the criticism of these statements has got to do with optics.  I'm not talking about the optics surrounding online personalities, I'm talking about the optics that concern a marginalised group of people.  These optics are about how trans people, and more specifically non-binary people, are perceived by the mainstream.  It's about how this whole situation is viewed from the outside.  I've seen people comparing this to Gamergate.  I've seen people comparing this to an alt-right Nazi mob.  The reasons behind these two are not the same.  Unfortunately, making this comparison is not about the intention.  It's about the optics.  It looks like Gamergate from the outside.  It feels like an alt-right harassment campaign when you are the one getting flooded with Twitter mentions, especially if you've already been the target of Nazi harassment.  The way this whole thing has been handled is very worrying to me, and I'm worried about the next time this happens.  The negative narrative about non-binary people will be reinforced in onlookers' minds.  I realize this might not be the intention of these statements, but it's not about the intention.  It's about the optics.  I have no control over what people do on Twitter.  I do not know all trans people.  We are not an organized group.  Obviously, we are not going to react in the same way when this kind of thing happens.  The emotional tension in these statements is important for the people in the crowd observing.  The right-wing reactionary side of the internet very often uses the crazy, SJW, irrational, safe-space, non-binary feminists in order to win people over and get people more on board with their politics.  I am simply urging people to take this into consideration when addressing this kind of situation publicly, especially if your voice is amplified by the number of people listening to you.  No, I don't think that these creators are my friends.  I see them as professionals making content online.  This is their job.  Professional online influencers who can literally influence the discourse surrounding us.  I am personally very, very capable of making the distinction between an online personality and a close friend.  However, even if I wasn't, as YouTubers, we build our channels around a sense of community, a sense of support, especially when we cater to marginalized audiences.  A large part of the YouTuber brand is built around building parasocial relationships with the people watching us.  I am seriously questioning whether we can use this to our advantage when people defend us and turn around and label it as inherently toxic only when part of our audience is hurt.  When your income depends on your community and your community is built around your personality and your personality fuels your content, can we separate the art from the artist?  We live in a digital age.  Twitter is simultaneously a personal venting space and a part of our professional branding.  When these two overlap, can we blame our audience?  Or should we be looking at the system which this kind of dynamic feeds from?  i understand why you want to condemn toxic behavior.  however you've got to be really wary about doing that in a statement which could be read from the outside as a generalization of an entire marginalized community.  this could reinforce the mainstream perception of us which is already overwhelmingly negative introducing your fan base to this complex situation with a statement which could be read as a non-binary mob versus us is really scary.  Observing the discourse surrounding transgender people is not just drama to me, it's a survival tactic.  I have been so careful phrasing my thoughts here because I'm desperately trying to counter the narrative that portrays people like me as an angry, irrational mob.  We have to be careful.  I'm literally tone policing myself.  Natalie Wynn, also known as ContraPoints and I, have an in-joke which goes thus, The truth does not matter, only optics matters.  The basis for this is that your lived inner beliefs may as well not exist, because if you speak your truth, it will often be taken in bad faith.  So there is no truth, only hashtag brand, only construct, and only damage control.  Lindsay Ellis wrote this paragraph about the optics of online personalities.  Weirdly enough, it rings true to me, but for different reasons.  If you speak your truth, it will often be taken in bad faith, so there is only hashtag brand, only construct, and only damage control.  We dehumanize not only content creators, but also the people who criticize them.  I'm just trying to look underneath this discourse and trying to make sense of it in the bigger picture.  Let's look at the people hurting.  Before dismissing them or taking a side, maybe we should be asking ourselves why the sides exist in the first place.  I sound like a fucking centrist.  Harsh words have been exchanged.  But I need young radicals like you in my life.  The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant.  So what's the plan?  A huge thank you to all of my patrons, especially Jessica.  You all give me the hope that one day I will escape the clutches of 9-5 capitalism and do what I love for a living.  If you would like to help me out on this journey, you can support me on Patreon.  I don't only make stuff like this, I also make satirical synth-pop music where I diss Ben Shapiro, so check that out if you want to.  See you soon. ",
