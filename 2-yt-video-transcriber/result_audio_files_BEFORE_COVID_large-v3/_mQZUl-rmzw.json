            "text": "Hi, guys.  This is your sister Karine Gazzanini, Jesus Christ Gazzanini.  Just with this quick update, Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Giddens in Jesus Christ.  Guys, I just want to come very, very quickly.  It won't be too long.  I'm just on the back of a video that I put up yesterday concerning a tsunami that I saw coming into the UK.  But the reason why I'm doing this video is because I didn't realize that I would get so much response concerning part of the... In the video, the Lord just told me just to mention that I don't go to church.  And it's really overwhelming to see the amount of comments coming in.  Brothers and sisters saying they too that God has taken them out of the church.  And I just want to officially do this video concerning the state of... of the church.  now god has given me a numerous amount of vision when i was awakened in 2015 16 going on where god showed me the state of the church my brothers and sisters and it is not good to say the least.  i'll do the visions of these that the lord has shown me concerning the church another time i'll put.  i'll do a video of that but just to say that the visions that god is showing me concerning his church.  it is not in a good place my brothers and sisters and therefore i'm coming to you today to let you know that you must get out of the churches because if you do not do that what's going to happen to you?  it will stop.  uh the the true light that's in you because eventually you begin to operate like the apostate church.  you begin to operate in a different spirit.  we call it the spirit of divination And it's a spirit that's very, very rampant in the church.  It mimics the Holy Spirit.  And a lot of believers believe that most of these pastors are anointed and filled with the power of the Holy Ghost, when in fact they are not.  Now, if you are going to a church and you've got an excellent, excellent shepherd, a true man of God, you must stay under his anointing.  You must stay in that church.  As long as he's bringing the word to you and the word is lining up with scriptures, brothers and sisters, you must stay in that church.  But if you're going to a church where you're not growing spiritually, if two years ago you're exactly the same place where you are, no spiritual growth, You go to church every Sunday or Saturday or Bible studies or wherever.  It is time for you to get out.  You must come out and let the Holy Spirit teach you because that's exactly what has happened to me.  God has taken me out.  I could not fit in.  I mean, I went to different churches.  Trying to fit in.  And even my old church that I used to go to.  I just could not fit in ladies and gentlemen.  Because where God has brought me.  And where he wants to take me.  The church isn't ready.  They are not ready.  They are not ready for repentance.  They are not ready for the end times.  They are not prepared for the second world.  For the return of Jesus Christ.  And this is the state of the church.  Majority.  the churches are about wealth health prosperity houses and car and a very very slick these pastor because they do it through the faith teaching message.  it's all about faith.  you've got to have faith to get that car claim touching claim or you know and all that.  and God is saying You've got to wake up.  You must wake up, brothers and sisters.  You must come out of these churches.  This is a serious, serious warning.  The Bible says, come out from amongst them, my people.  Now, probably some of you will watch this and you'll say, well, what about Hebrews chapter 10, verse 25?  which says something in the line of, you must not forget the assembly of yourselves together.  Well, yes, that is true.  And that scripture stands.  But what is the assemble?  God is not going to send you to assembly with an apostate church.  He's not going to do that.  So that scripture is talking about the true believers coming together.  And I believe that has begun because in 2015, When God woke me up from my slumber state, he specifically said to me, daughter, I have started the gathering and the amount of brothers and sisters from 2015 to 2019. that I have known, I haven't seen them physically, but spiritually, this massive connection, it's absolutely amazing.  And so therefore, the gathering has started, the assembling of ourselves together have started.  There's a massive difference when I say to you, get out of the churches.  I am not talking those people who come out of the church and backslide.  That's not what I'm talking about.  Because if you're going to leave the church and totally backslide, turn away from God, you weren't saved in the first place.  That's not what I'm talking about.  But I'm talking about... true believers who are hungry or thirsty for the word of God but is not getting it in the church.  God wants to teach you himself the Holy Spirit wants to teach you.  and if you leave these churches and you allow the Holy Spirit to teach you you stay at home read the Bible fast pray seek God's face.  let him reteach you everything.  because unfortunately majority of these churches have got a catholic background.  uh that the philosophies and the theology is based on some of these catholics believe ladies and gentlemen and it is nothing to do with the word of god.  and god loves us so much that he's willing to take you away from that situation and reteach you.  And I don't believe that you, you know, God is speaking to your heart saying, you know what?  Leave the church.  Don't go back.  You shouldn't be fearful.  You shouldn't be scared.  You shouldn't be saying, well, you're going to lose your brothers and sisters.  because you don't go to church for a cup of tea and biscuit.  really and truly you go there for spiritual growth.  uh underneath the man of god.  uh that's that's that's that's giving the word that that's what it's all about.  so i don't think you should be very fearful.  if god said to you leave that you're gonna elapse that that's not what it's about because you will sorry You will grow spiritually.  And when I stopped going to church, a lot of people said to me, oh, how are you doing?  How are you growing spiritually?  You're going to backslide.  You're not going to be spiritually covered.  You need a pastor to cover you.  And I'm like, no, I don't need a pastor to cover me because I've got the covering of the Holy Spirit.  He is my covering because you do not go to church to get the glory of your pastor.  If you do that, you are idolizing your pastor.  You are idolizing the man of God.  You do not go to church to get the glory and to feel good.  You know, you've got an anointed pastor, he's preaching.  Brothers and sisters, time is short.  This thing that I'm telling you is very, very serious.  You must, you must get out of these churches.  If not, you will partake of the plague that's coming.  These churches, majority, not all of them, because there's some good shepherds.  There's some good pastors there.  that's preaching and teaching the sheep's.  And leading them into green pastor.  And these brothers and sisters in the Lord is growing in Christ.  You know, they have a repentance heart.  They are solid.  Their foundation is solid in Christ.  Stay in that church.  Do not leave.  You must.  You must stay.  But for the rest of us, and I'm included as well because I don't go to church.  We don't have any pastors.  We don't have a shepherd.  Physically, we know that the Holy Spirit is teaching us, but we're not going to go to church for the sake of going to church.  Don't do it.  Do not do it.  You must come out.  This is a very serious warning, ladies and gentlemen, because like I say, just one second.  Like I say, sorry, I'm sweating.  All right.  like i say judgment.  it is coming and it will begin with the house of god.  that is very very clear in the word of god that judgment will begin at the house of god.  so you have to uh be in good stead with with the lord.  you've got to walk in him in his integrity in his in his law and it's all about holiness all about holiness brothers and sisters.  so i just wanted to come on the back of that uh video that i did yesterday didn't realize i would get so much response of people saying sister i don't go to church i do so much and i just wanted to do this video to make it official to say to you brothers and sister please get out of your churches Get out, get out, get out.  Allow the Holy Spirit to reteach you.  That's what he's done to me.  He's literally retaught me everything, all the lies that I used to have in my heart concerning God.  That's all God.  So I just wanted to come to you and just basically just give that, give this prophetic warning that you must come out of the church.  only stay if you have a good shepherd a man of god that is leading you in good pastors.  god eternally bless you.  i love you all and i will see you someday in glory in jesus precious holy name.  amen and amen amen blessings amen.
