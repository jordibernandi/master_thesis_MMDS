            "text": "good afternoon.  everyone.  chinese scientist warning of global cooling trick up nature's sleeve.  they found a five hundred year chinese weather cycle and they say that climate change is not due to humans.  A glimpse of climate variations over the last 150 years, Chinese grow zones.  They've been following sunspots for over 2,000 years.  This is what I talk about in my book, Climate Revolution, Understand, Prepare, Adapt, and Thrive, because United States and China are the two largest corn producers on our planet, and they're both struggling this year with corn production.  It's all related to the grand solar minimum.  The link's in the description box below.  Starting off here, IceAgeNow.info, Robert Felix's site, not by fire, but by ice, magnetic reversals and evolutionary leaps.  China's preparing for a cooling planet.  So when we see the saber rattling and the devaluation of currencies and all the perceived danger across the planet, perhaps it's coordinated to explain away why there'll be a lack of food.  Why prices will rise.  And right here, Adoni even speaks to this a little bit.  China has weather records going back thousands of years.  And those records show the exact same thing these Chinese scientists just stated.  It's on a cycle.  There's cooling periods.  There's warming periods.  And it has nothing to do with human influence.  China's also been reestablishing the fabled Silk Road supply, both over sea and land.  Where's the sea roots?  Oh, they're going to end up in North Africa.  That's turning into a new grow zone as parts of northern China go offline.  We'll take a look at those charts in just a second.  Last paragraph, they have had a terrible season.  They had spring armyworm, and now they have the fall armyworm.  They've lost at least 35% of all corn crops.  And when they said they're not going to buy agricultural products from the United States, it gives the United States a big, deep breath of relief because they don't have to supply China.  Because if they did, there wouldn't be enough.  And that might raise questions.  Also, the pigs, they're gone.  You know what China's doing?  Giving subsidies and financing to pig farmers to now establish fish farms.  You can still grow protein, but it takes far less resources.  Chinese astronomers have been following these cycles in the sun for thousands of years.  There's legends of Hou Yi with the comets, nine suns in the sky.  We have the legend of the crow, which was a three-footed crow that appeared in the sun.  We also see coin sizes in the sun.  That's a very large sunspot.  But they've been observing the cycles for thousands, plural, of years.  They know what's coming.  They're positioning themselves to be world leaders as the rest of these countries collapse that are not preparing themselves for the grand solar minimum changes.  So when you see China in North Africa, that is a new grow zone emerging.  So as our financial system collapses across the planet in slow motion over this next year and a half, whoever controls food can grow food is going to control the planet.  So look at where the new grow zones are emerging.  Chess pieces are being positioned across our planet.  Now, Chinese scientists warn of global cooling trick up nature's sleeve.  Again, they find this 500-year cycle in at least Chinese weather.  So obviously, they're talking about effects from the sun affecting crop output and temperatures in China on a cyclical pattern.  And underneath the image there, they took this back 4,000 years finding the same cycle interwoven within longer-term cycles itself of 4,000-year cycles.  So in the northern Chinese winters, they found no evidence of man-made influence on that.  It's a natural cycle in its variance of temperature, precipitation.  But they also list famine and chaos as a result of this pattern that returns.  And that's the whole point of the article.  Don't get caught off guard.  Center image from the University of Minnesota tracing back temperature drops and collapse of Chinese dynasties.  And it goes into a little more detail about the summer monsoons, the winter temperatures, all being driven by solar activity.  So what is this telling us now?  Well, there's full on disclosure that we're going into a grand solar minimum, although it's being drip fed.  But if one government on the planet at this level is telling not only its citizens, but the world we're getting ready to cool, That's a game changer.  And off the report here, temporal and spatial variations of climate in China during the last 10,000 years.  Screen grab here of the last 500.  You can see different parts of China and how the rainfall or the temperature shifted when there were no factories or cars driving around.  And at the very bottom there, you're going to see right around 1640, that precipitous dry period, that is the Maunder minimum.  You can see the dip also in southeast China temperatures along with plum rains or the monsoon rain shifting.  We can see the dropout in the northeast and east as well during the modern minimum.  These are food growing zones, and it apparently is going to do the same exact thing once again.  So they're positioning themselves.  I don't know how much we are in the United States.  I don't hear about this on our media, but China's sure talking about it.  circled Jilin there, which the arrow directs down to the temperature variation.  But when we get up to that Haelongjiang that has the border with North Korea, these are major crop growing zones.  So if they were following the cycles, they would know these areas are going to go offline for 150 years or so, set up the maritime string of pearls, Get a new grow zone ready because they know the rainfall would change in northern Africa.  It could be a bread basket.  And then you balance out the amount of available food for your population.  if you can control the emerging grow zone.  Who would have ever known all these cycles?  Oh, unless you studied cycles for thousands of years, then you would see that it's a cycle and we're back in it again.  Welcome to the new Grand Solar Minimum.  How prepared are you for emergencies and long-term food storage?  My Patriot Supply, two-week grab-and-go food crate, or the four-week food supply?
