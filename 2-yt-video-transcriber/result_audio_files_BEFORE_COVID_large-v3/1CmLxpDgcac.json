            "text": "is cyberpunk 2077. pretty cool game you got there would be a shame if something happened to it.  that's what seems to be the overarching narrative that reached peak cringe over the weekend with anita sarkisian.  essentially i don't know what the word would be But I would say it's pretty transparent, issuing some sort of, hey, you should probably hire me in case you don't want something bad to happen to your game.  And on top of that, we all saw the creator of Cyberpunk completely dunking on people who were pretending to be angry about... The new video game of probably this century.  I'm going to break down exactly what Ms.  Sarkeesian had to say and also what Mike Pondsmith had to say as he is the superior Chad of all video games at this point.  It was brought to my attention and to be clear, I... maybe a year ago, six months, eight months ago, I had told myself I would not be covering this person anymore because they are irrelevant.  And the fact that I'd be covering it would just be providing more information or more news.  That's why I didn't cover this yesterday or even the day before when everything started pouring out.  But I thought now that Mike Poundsmith's got in on it, the creator of Cyberpunk, I would build it in to the overall narrative that appears to be going on in the video games world.  Now it all started with a weird rant by Ryan Boyd.  who is an editor and writer, pop culture hobgoblin, and their pronouns are in their bio.  This is like a turducken of facile takes, genre ignorance, and milquetoast body squeamishness, which is maybe not ideal from the makers of a game called Cyberpunk.  And this is talking about The interview that we saw over the weekend where people are angry about NPCs not having clothes or whatever, just general fake faux outrage.  But then we see Anita Snarkisian obviously getting ratioed here with 2,500 comments compared to 1.4 thousand favorites.  Hey, CD Projekt Red, I'm always available for consulting because it sure sounds like you might need it before the whole of the internet drags you for what sounds like some potentially problematic representations, which we all know you've struggled with in the past.  No, they really haven't.  The non-clothes itself is... Not the problem, neither showing or expressing or desire.  It's about how it's represented and what the overall value of the narrative promotes.  Video game designers, let me help you avoid these kinds of mistakes.  I want you to make great games you're envisioning while appealing to a broader audience.  Yes, the 0.03% of the world out there that is perpetually offended and constantly making demands of video game developers, I'm going to tell you it is not worth it.  Of course, links to her consulting.  Now, notice how she has shifted her services from not providing videos that her many soy-infused orbiters had paid for to probably not providing actual consulting services.  I'm not sure how she would be qualified to do consulting, but what I can say is I don't think it did much for BioWare.  When we look at some of the history, of projects Ms.  Sarkeesian has been involved in.  It's pretty interesting.  And also you can see this narrative.  There's a tweet, where is it, that alleges that she had tried to go and do some consulting for Activision.  Now, this is unverified.  Be clear about that.  I don't know who this person is.  They apparently must have some connections.  Ask Activision how their consultation with Anita went.  Ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  She gave a talk to Activision higher-ups and was asked what her data gathering was for several points she was making.  She flipped out.  She threw things.  Ask them.  Anyway, it's part of the reason she doesn't quote debate anyone or defend her points.  All she has is her incel rhetoric to fall back on a nothing based on reality or real data gathering.  Now, of course, that is... speculation.  but we've seen dice work with anita sarkisian.  that didn't work out well for them as well and you know the coverage of this has been pretty hilarious.  she attempts to weasel in a consultancy gig on cyberpunk 2077 and the article itself goes on to say culture critic anita snarkisian is desperately trying to get back into the gaming gig again.  The Queen of Constarian made tweets recently indicating that she wants to dig her claws into one of the most highly anticipated games due out next year.  She out and out requested the CD Projekt Red bring her in as a consultant for Cyberpunk 2077.  That's pretty sad.  To be honest with you, you know, I mean, ironically doing that.  Sure.  But it would appear to me that this woman needs work.  Now, maybe if you had not had a history of lying and not fulfilling your promises, you'd still have loyal supporters.  But we know that didn't happen.  On June 16th, she tweeted out a reply to Ryan Boyd, who had his own thread criticizing CD Projekt Red's explanation of the body statement.  and lack of sanctity for honoring one's temple.  that essentially turns into a profane display of degeneracy, Sarkeesian's nonplus at the existential conversation regarding Puritanism versus transhumanism decided to hijack the topic and request a job.  Sarkeesian then uses the opportunity to plug your own site and promote new consultancy outfit, which is designed to reshape the way people engage with interactive entertainment, or more realistically convince people to disengage from a game that is no longer made to be fun.  Now it's an interesting.  It's interesting because this game was clearly going to be one of the biggest games of, I don't know, the decade.  I mean, it's going to be huge.  It's going to probably sell more copies than Red Dead Redemption.  You know, it's going to be massive.  Gamers called out Sarkeesian for what perceived grift on CD Projekt.  Res was just one of many attempts by Sarkeesian to squeeze into the dress of relevancy during this year's E3.  She was recently indignant that Electronic Arts did not contribute money to her ever-shrinking coffers, making a tweet on June 8th during the weekend of the EA Play event lamenting the company's negligence.  of unimportant nonprofit organizations.  And you remember she tweeted out, sorry, what is only a million dollars in nonprofits working to end bullying and online harassment?  Some facts.  They didn't speak up during GG at all.  Feminacy frequency has been a nonprofit on the front lines of issue.  Now it sounds like somebody salty.  They didn't get more money.  I think companies have figured out that being associated with this person is probably not a good idea at all.  And on top of that, she had an article that came out this week talking about protagonists.  E3 is her one time a year to try and grift money.  But you can tell the team at CD Projekt Red has had enough of being told what's right and what's wrong.  you can see the creator of Cyberpunk Mike Pondsmith to Cyberpunk 2077.  Sorry, Cyberpunk 2020 creator.  to Cyberpunk 2077.  Stop telling me what to be offended by.  And if you see some original threads, which are pretty hilarious, there's one thread listed in here.  Mike Pondsmith creator, stop telling me what to be offended by.  Go tell your uncle.  So we see him here saying, Want to say this just once.  I am really tired of well-meaning people on the internet chat boards paternalistically telling me what I, as a black person, should be offended by.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  You want to be my ally?  Go grit up your loins at this year's Thanksgiving dinner and have the nerve to tell your dumb uncle to SDFU for a change.  Now, I think that's pretty hilarious.  I love that the guy is out here just... dominating uh not taking any any flack from potentially uh faux outraged people.  and this of course i thought was going to be its own video but there isn't enough of a story around it other than mike pondsmith.  you are a hero creator of cyberpunk 2027. this is via niche gamer and consultant on Cyberpunk 2077, has struck out at those claiming content within Cyberpunk 2077 is offensive.  In case you missed it, several individuals have taken an online offense to an in-game advertisement within the game.  It appears to be a trans man with a prominent flagpole being used to advertise a soft drink with the tagline, Mix It Up.  The advertisement also appeared in CD Projekt Red's booth at E3.  The grumbling has been rumbling for the past few days, but Pondsmith finally stepped in to share his thoughts on a thread in the Cyberpunk 2077 subreddit.  Pondsmith replied to others discussing the controversy.  The developers and artists later defended this in an interview with Eurogamer art director Kesa Redisuk.  I probably mispronounced that.  You'll notice many advertisements for anything, a table, a chair, a roof tile, slap a random attractive person on top of it and say, hey, buy this.  This person, this shows the exploitation of these people.  And many of our advertisements feature this.  We want to show how terrible that is.  With our advertisements, we want to say something.  The other users continue to discuss the matter.  What do you think?  Well, it's interesting to me.  I mean, I would say that Mike Pondsmith has had a history of being relatively woke, but everybody has their limits.  You see another comment here coming from Reddit.  So the people in the comment section under RPS had some.  turds one very vocal and repeatedly telling everyone that mike pounce with was involved at some point.  but he definitely is not heavily involved anymore because he'd never sign off on something as uh crazy as the gang called the animals.  cdpr deviated from 2020 canon horribly and inexcusably as well as the whole thing just sets off alarm bells suggesting that the game is profoundly inauthentic and cdpr didn't really get cyberpunk.  now you see Mike Pondsmith actually himself coming in here and squashing things.  One, if it wasn't heavily involved, I would be able to get more done.  As it is, I barely have a life.  Two, as for animals, that's the whole freaking point, is that they think of themselves as powerful, dangerous, wild animals.  You'd have thought the lady named Sasquatch would have given them a clue.  The original Voodoo Boys were a scathing commentary on cultural appropriation.  I love the idea that the real practitioners of Udon moved in and took back their turf.  And you've got to get the Creole right.  Four, who the bleep do you think?  you are telling me whether or not my creation was done right or so?  Boom!  Mike Pondsmith, more like Mike Chad Smith, out here just dominating, dominating.  dominating um full outrage and of course reset era is upset about it.  you know ultimately i'm very excited.  this is of course just another tempest in a teapot for the gaming industry.  this is always going to happen when it comes to a hugely anticipated release videos On the topic, we'll always get many more views, which, by the way, I appreciate all of you doing your part by liking and sharing and commenting on the videos.  It definitely helps the channel out.  But ultimately, Anita Snarkisian is irrelevant.  She can just be gone, Thotimus, and the rest of all this faux outrage will blow over by the end of the week.  And then we'll see it rise up again in April around release time.  But of course, hopefully, YouTube will allow me to still be here so together we can all point and laugh at it.  get out of here fake outrage.  give me my cyberpunk 2020 2077 immediately.  i hope you enjoyed this video.  we'll talk to you again real soon.
