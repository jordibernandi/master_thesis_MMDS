            "text": "We are the children of the one you have.  You are the chosen of the one you have.  And he has given his life to us.  This is the book of Jeremiah, chapter 49, verse 16.  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee.  Thy what?  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee.  Thy what?  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee.  How terrible and how wicked and cruel and destructive you are, that's deceived you.  You think you can go around the four corners of the planet just working hard.  And that puts you on this mindset that, oh, I can just do whatever I want.  What's God going to do about it?  Go ahead.  and the pride of thine heart, and thou dwellest in the clefts of the rock.  Pride.  Yeah, proud people.  What's up?  You got a question?  What's up?  Y'all got a question about what we're saying right now?  No?  Well, I got a question for you.  How do you feel about this sound right here?  Being from Alabama.  This happened in Alabama.  How do you feel about that?  You see the chuckle?  That's bad.  That's bad?  Well, who did this?  I have no idea.  You have no idea?  So during the time of slavery, who do you think was treating slaves bad?  Was it other slaves?  You know, slaves have been treated bad throughout history.  Oh.  By who?  Okay, we're not talking about all people.  We're talking about your people.  So can't do that.  What's your last name?  Your last name is Christian?  So you're telling me there's not black men with the last name Christian?  So why do black men have the last name Christian?  No idea.  Because white men enslaved them and put their last name on them.  So it is your people, the Christians.  And that's not perfect because the Christians enslaved black men.  They came from Ethiopia.  Ethiopia?  Yes, sir.  Who came from Ethiopia?  There's black people in Ethiopia, I think.  What about them?  I'm not a black man from Ethiopia.  Nobody you see up here is from Ethiopia.  The black men, women, and children that your people enslaved in America are not from Ethiopia.  I'm not talking about the Ethiopians.  I'm talking about the black men and women and children you stole from Africa.  No, you can't.  I do want to have a debate.  Let's debate.  Let's reason.  You say, oh, let's reason, government, but you're talking about some Ethiopians.  You have a question.  Our purpose is to wake up so-called blacks and Hispanics, tell them that God's chosen people.  That's what our purpose is.  Hispanics and Native Americans.  Yes.  They're the Israelites, the true Jews.  Christ is a black man.  No, you cannot have them there.  No.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Do you believe that he died for everybody's sins?  No.  You don't believe he died for everybody's sins?  No, I don't.  So whose sins do you believe he died for?  These people on this side, right here.  Only you?  Only Baptist-based Native Americans, yes.  So Jesus died for everybody.  Prove it.  You have to believe the Bible.  I do believe the Bible, so prove he died for everybody.  It says so.  Where are we going?  I'll be... Where?  Where?  Where is that in the Bible?  Show me in the Bible.  You're from Alabama, right?  I'm sure you grew up Christian.  Show me in the Bible right now.  Go to Matthew.  Let's go.  Perfect.  First chapter.  Matthew, first chapter, 21st verse.  Read it out.  This is the book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 21.  And he shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall say, His people.  Who?  His people.  All people.  His people.  Who?  His people.  Christ died for his people.  Who are his people?  Matthew 2 and 6.  For his people.  You say what?  Everybody.  Christ God for everyone.  Oh, listen to what the Bible says.  Matthew chapter 2 verse 6.  And I beg for him in the land of Judah.  Not the least among the priests of Judah.  For out of you shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel.  My people Israel.  Who's God's people?  My people Israel.  Who's Christ's people?  Israel.  So guess what?  Who are you?  Who's an Israelite?  These people on this side.  Surely you're not an Israelite.  Israelites are Abraham's descendants, right?  Yes, yes.  We're all Abraham's descendants up here.  We all descend from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Okay.  So Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  So the Jewish people are all white people?  No, no, the Jewish people are false claimers.  The real Jews are so-called black people, according to the Bible.  Give me Revelation 1 and 14.  Let's see what the greatest Jew, what he looked like.  Revelation 1 and 14.  This is going to break Becky's heart.  Come on, Susan.  Come on, Susan.  Go ahead.  It's the Book of Revelation, chapter 1, verse 14.  His head and his hair were white like wool.  The Bible says that the Son of God, when he called Jesus Christ, his hair was wool, girl.  As white as snow.  And his eyes were as a flame of fire.  And his feet like unto fine brass.  Unto fine brass.  What color is brass, Susie?  Oh, shit, Susie.  What color is brass?  What color is brass, Susan?  Come on.  You can't answer that question.  Is it Becky or Sarah?  Which one is it?  My class?  No.  Elizabeth.  Why do you think I would call that?  I mean, I don't know.  Don't deviate.  What color is brass?  Brass, the color brass, brass.  Is there like a... Okay, but let me get another one.  Let me get another one.  Bright gold.  Those are like bright colors.  If I had just a small little crayon box, what color would I get the closest to?  Brown.  Brown.  Now, brass, is it what?  As if it burned in the furnace.  So if I took brass and I burned it, then what would it look like?  So Jesus Christ, black.  That's right, Daniel.  And that's black.  The Jews are black.  That's what we read in the Bible right now.  I don't even like Jewish people, man.  Come on, man.  I know y'all don't like Jewish people.  Hey, y'all are good old boys, man.  Y'all don't like no Jews.  Am I stereotyping?  I'm a true Christian.  I'm a real Christian.  Let me ask you a question.  Where is my true Christian?  In Jesus Christ.  Of God.  Yes, ma'am.  I think it's born by the Virgin Mary.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Stop there.  What Virgin mean?  Virgin?  mean?  somebody didn't have sex?  You got to study Hebrew culture.  that's joseph's son.  that's joseph's son.  so let me show you something.  let me show you what they call the christians watch this week.  this is the book of acts chapter 13 verse 1. now there were in church that was in antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon watch this.  that was called.  that was called what.  that was called what they was calling the priest the jews the prophets.  ain't that something who else got called?  You think that's a coincidence?  I don't even know in that context what the Hebrew word is.  Well, it's Greek, and the word means black.  That's what the word means.  They go back to the Latin word, which means black.  So why would they call him black?  There you go.  So Jesus Christ is a black man.  The Israelites are black.  And Christ died for black and Hispanic people.  That's right.  You've had your hope.  You've had 500 years of hope.  At tobacco plantations and cotton plantations in good old Sweet Home Alabama.  You guys have had 500 years to just run amok in the earth.  Christ is coming to put you in the cave.  The Indians, what do you mean?  The Native Americans?  Oh, East India?  Oh, they had the Israelites enslaved.  So everyone's getting ready to get it, thus says the Lord.  Give me the book of Maccabees, or the first Maccabees 1010, man.  All right?  We ain't here to play with the Red Devil or the Blue Devil, goddamn it.  I'm going to tell you that now in the spirit of the most hot.  All right?  This hot time, if you shook off blacks and Spaniards and Native Indians, come back into the street, man.  Oh, easy time.  Come on, man.  Well, here's the thing, your concept of heaven, Bible doesn't teach that concept of heaven.  And so the good and the bad go to the same place.  So it's not this heaven and hell.  Heaven and hell are conditions that are played out here on earth.  Did he say heaven or hell though?  Yeah, he did.  Where?  No, no, no.  Hades, that's a Greek concept.  What justifies you to be, so you're saying everybody by their own works?  No, no, no.  The works of your people.  have gotten you what you deserve.  Let's put your people in one place.  Yes, the Bible talks about judgment on your people and my people.  Listen, everybody when they die, they go to one place.  So there's not this heaven and hell concept that you have.  I don't subscribe to the Bible.  So why are you out here?  What are you passionate about?  I'm teaching my people the identity that your people stole from them.  That's what I'm doing.  Hey, if we go to the same place, what's the matter?  But see, that's the problem.  Your people have told a lie about this Bible that it's all about the afterlife.  When it's all about this earth, right?  What does it matter?  It matters what we do on this earth.  It matters what you do on this earth.  Because God gives.  See, here's the problem.  You believe eternity in heaven or hell.  The Bible does not teach that.  The Bible... Here's the thing.  The only thing I'm out here to tell you, the only thing I'm here to tell you is that your people are going to slavery.  I'm not telling you that you're going to go someplace mythical to burn forever.  You're going into slavery, man.  Alright?  What am I mad about?  I'm mad about father.  Give me a database.  This is what I'm mad about.  Give me a database.  This is what I'm mad about.  This is what I'm mad about.  This is what I'm mad about.  This is what I'm mad about.  I want you to see this.  This is what I'm mad about.  I'm mad about this.  I'm mad about this.  Shut your drunk ass up.  You're drunk in public.  You're drunk in public.  Send me to walk in like he's drunk in public.  This is mine.  I answered your question.  I answered your question right here.  This is what matters.  This is what matters.  This is what matters.  I answered your question.  I answered your question.  I answered your question.  I'm going to tell you what matters.  Your people are going to be judged by Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ is coming to put you in slavery.  We're being judged.  We're being judged.  It's your judgment that's coming.  It's your judgment that's coming.  It's your judgment that's coming.  These devils, they think they know the Bible.  Jesus Christ, yes.  If Jesus Christ is coming to put you in slavery, shut your drink down.  You are a fool.  Shut up.  Alright?  Don't touch anybody's property up here, you understand me?  Don't touch anybody's property and calm your drunk ass down.  Chuck, what are you mad at?  Calm your drunk ass down.  We've belligerently drank, grabbed and stepped on it.  All praise to the most high.  All praise to the most high.  What are we mad about?  It's very simple.  I'm mad about 500 years of atrocity.  That's what angers me.  That's what makes me mad.  All right?  Point blank, period.  But we're not even out here to talk to y'all.  Right?  But when y'all are going to come and put your nose up in our business, we're not even going to tell y'all about y'allself.  Point blank, period.  So-called black man, you ought to isolate of the Bible.  That's right.  All right, Jesus Christ died for you.  It's time to repent and be converted and come back to the laws and the faith.  It's that simple.  That's the message, man.  All right?  As soon as you got all these heathens that want to come stick their nose up in the business, guess what?  I'm going to tell you about the sins of your forefathers.  And you're going to pay for the sins of your forefathers.  That's right.  Period.  It's unavoidable.  Thus saith the Most High God.  I don't even care what you believe in.  Whatever you believe in, you've got to believe that what goes around is going to come back around.  It's going to.  That's why y'all shaking in your boots.  That's why you're trying to ban abortion everywhere.  Why?  Which is good.  I'm glad y'all have banned abortion.  But the reason why y'all are doing it is simple.  Because white people are not having enough babies.  You're afraid of getting outnumbered in this country.  You're afraid of losing your grip of power in this country.  And you know it's true.  Because you're a parasite.  And the parasite knows when it's losing control over its age.  You're a parasite manifest in human form.  All right?  So don't come over here messing with us if you don't want to be told about your goddamn soul.  Isaiah 49 and 26.  And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh.  That's what God said.  You oppress us, you will be fed with your own flesh.  And they shall be drunken with their own blood.  With their own blood.  With their own blood.  That's right.  That's what you're going to get.  Drunken with your own blood, right?  And as with sweet wine, and all flesh shall know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior.  Everybody's going to know.  You may not believe it now.  You may not know it now.  You may not understand it now.  But here's what I'm here to tell you, God damn it.  You're going to know that the most hot God, Yahweh is his name in Hebrew, is the Savior of the Israelite, black, Hispanic, and native Indian.  You're going to understand that, man, when this judgment comes.  That's what you're going to understand.  We say that he is our Savior and none else.  We.  And God redeemed him.  God redeemed him.  He's coming to redeem blacks, Hispanic, and Native Indians.  All we've got to do is retain and be converted.  All we've got to do is come back to the laws and the faith, and we will be saved, they'll say, at the most, our God.  And he's going to show everyone.  he's our Savior.  Because he's going to judge all these people that do something to us.  All these people that rob and murder and oppress us is going to be paid directly back to them by saying, God, all we have to do is keep the laws of faith.  All we have to do is do what we've been instructed by our Heavenly Father, man.  It's that simple.  And we're going to get the reward of rulership.  read jeremiah 25 and 28.  29 below i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name.  and should you be utterly unpunished?  that's right.  evil got brought upon us so the white man not gonna be unpunished man.  that's what we gotta understand.  all right we gotta separate from these people.  It says, ye shall not be unpunished.  For our God swore upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.  That's right.  The sword is coming.  And that sword is going to be the sword of destruction of the so-called white men.  All right?  But with that, we're going to give our praise and our glory to Yahweh by assuming our song.  And we're going to say, Death to Alabama!  Death to Alabama! ",
