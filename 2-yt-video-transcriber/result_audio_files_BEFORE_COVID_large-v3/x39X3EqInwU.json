Will all the pews be emptied and all the believers go up?  Yeshua says in the Bible, many will come to me in that day and say, Lord, Lord, did we not cast out demons in your name, heal the sick in your name, and do many wonders in your name?  And he'll say to them, depart from me, you workers of iniquity.  I never knew you.  So what does making a believer, what does it really mean to be a believer?  In your heart, is it just acknowledging that God exists?  James 2.19 says, So it takes more than just believing and acknowledging God's existence.  You have to surrender your life to Him.  every part of your life.  You have to receive him into your heart and he has to be the Lord over everything that you do. ",
