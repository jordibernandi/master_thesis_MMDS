            "text": "All right, let me catch you up to speed on what has happened over the past few days.  A couple college kids with a Twitter channel called Adherent Apologetics started a March Madness tournament where they're actually having a group of apologists that they've selected, like 64 I think it was, and they have us all competing against each other in multiple rounds of competition.  See, at first it wasn't like a big thing, but it's kind of become like a thing.  and I'll tell you how it's gone so far.  Round one, I went up against BioLogos.  I was happy enough to be in the competition at all, and I beat BioLogos, which I was very happy about.  Round two, I went up against David Wood.  I don't know how I beat David Wood.  Act 17 apologetics, like, David Wood doesn't know how I beat David Wood, although I think it might be due to his glowing endorsement, although that was a hastily edited, poorly edited video where I made him say that.  For round three, I went up against my friend Cameron Bertuzzi from Capturing Christianity, who I've recently done a great video series with, 20 Answers to 20 Atheist Arguments Against God, really cool stuff.  And Cameron actually did endorse me.  He like legit went and endorsed me and so there you go.  But right now it's coming down.  It's coming down to it.  We're in round four and there's only four people left in this competition and the person I'm up against is Michael Brown.  Dr.  Michael Brown.  Now, I've been holding onto this information for a while but Today's the day I tell you the truth about Dr.  Michael Brown so that you can vote correctly.  For one thing, this guy is a cultural crusader who unceasingly stands up for what he believes is right and godly no matter the cost, like sexual ethics and things like that.  He's one of these.  reach out to everyone in love, but still tell them the truth about sin kind of guys.  He's written the whole books answering Jewish objections to Jesus and has provided us with some much needed content actually, which I've used in my own videos on Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22.  He's been serving God for many, many years and has done lots of things in ministry and has a PhD and he debates rabbis and he really liked the Apostle Paul debating with the rabbis in the book of Acts when they were showing that Jesus was the Messiah from the scriptures.  By all rights, Dr.  Michael Brown should just utterly destroy me.  But I have four reasons why you should vote for me instead of Dr.  Michael Brown.  And here they are.  Number one, this tournament right here is actually really good for helping other people to become aware of apologists that they have never heard of.  And a lot of people have heard of Dr.  Michael Brown.  And you just heard of him too on my channel.  So really, if you think about it, it's probably better for the kingdom if more people hear about these lesser known apologist guys.  So you should probably vote for the lesser known, less appreciated, perhaps even less valuable apologetics type guys.  That's number one.  Number two, reason why you should vote for me instead of Dr.  Michael Brown, I'll just let David Wood say it for you. ",

            "text": "Michael Brown.  Reason number three why you should vote for me instead of Dr.  Michael Brown.  Dr.  Michael Brown beat William Lane Craig.  Like, William Lane Craig.  He beat William Lane Craig the gall.  Like, what was he thinking?  beating William Lane Craig?  Everybody knows you don't touch the Craig.  What is he thinking?  beating William Lane Craig?  You need to show him that he shouldn't beat William Lane Craig by helping me beat him in honor of William Lane Craig.  Look, if you think... William Lane Craig deserves your vote, then I think I deserve your vote.  Number four, the fourth reason why you should vote for me instead of Dr.  Michael Brown.  You see, I beat JP Moreland.  I beat JP Moreland and that was wrong.  That was very wrong.  JP Moreland should have beat me for sure.  That was wrong.  But... The thing is, if Michael Brown beats me, then it's like he's beating J.P.  Moreland and William Lane Craig.  And that's just insane.  He can't beat both of those guys.  So in honor of J.P.  Moreland, you need to vote for me so that I can beat Dr.  Michael Brown.  So choose wisely, vote correctly, and don't think about it too much.  Just vote Mike.  Link is in the description.  Thank you very much.  But do check out his online content.  I'll put links down there too for that.  It's really good. ",
