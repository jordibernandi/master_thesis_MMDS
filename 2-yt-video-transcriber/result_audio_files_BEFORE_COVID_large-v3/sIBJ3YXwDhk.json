            "text": "When God created the world, he looked at his creation and he said, the trees, they are good.  The mountains, they are good.  The grass, the birds, everything was good.  But there was one thing which God did not call good.  Do you know what it was?  loneliness.  and the Lord God said it is not good for man to be alone.  and I'm making this video today because I'm guessing there's probably some people out there who are feeling a little bit lonely.  and from one man who feels lonely every now and then to another I want to speak to you about loneliness.  as a street preacher often I'm standing on the streets and I'm preaching Christ and the whole world is going by.  the whole world is looking at me and laughing at this street preacher the odd man who's at the front preaching about Christ.  and you know I spend many hours on my own in my office writing sermons writing essays making these videos.  I feel so alone.  But I want you to know this, if you're watching this now and you subscribe to my channel, you've been a real blessing in my life.  You've encouraged me, you've blessed me because at times when I feel lonely, I just log on YouTube and I see all these wonderful friends from America, from India, from the Philippines, all around the world.  there's people out there who are really helping me.  But I do want to now share a true story with you.  And the first time I heard this story, it brought tears to my eyes.  Before the time of aeroplanes there was a poet a man called Rupert Brooke and he was making a very long journey all the way from Liverpool to New York by boat.  and as he's standing on the boat there was other sailors there and their families were on the pier and they were.  they were shouting to the sailors.  they were saying oh make sure you write oh we're gonna miss you.  oh we're gonna miss you so so much.  and they're waving away waving to the sailors.  But Rupert Brooke stood there on the boat, totally alone.  But as he sort of looked out at the crowd, he noticed a young boy, about six or seven years old.  And I don't like to use this word, but he's what we would call a peasant, you know, dressed in rags, Oliver Twist kind of style.  So the poet, he ran off the boat and he scrambled through the crowd and he went and he found that little boy and he went up to the boy and he said, excuse me, young man, what is your name?  Oh, my name's William, sir.  William, if I gave you a sixpence, would you do a favour for me?  What would that be, sir?  William, would you wave to me?  And as the boats left the dock, there was that little boy waving his rag with all of his might.  And so the poet wrote, so I got my six penneth worth.  Loneliness is a terrible thing, isn't it?  And you can feel lonely when you're in a room full of people surrounded by everyone, but you feel totally alone.  Have you felt like that before?  Some of you watching this video have no doubt.  Some of you, you feel lonely because you are the only Christian in your family.  You're the only person who loves Jesus Christ and you feel alone because you can't talk about the most precious thing to you.  Some of you watching this video, I've no doubt, you're a single parent.  And you love your children to pieces, but at the same time, you're struggling to bring them up.  And you feel lonely and you want help, you want companionship.  And some of you, I've no doubt, you are watching this video and for some reason or other, the Lord hasn't opened the door for you to meet someone.  And you're lonely, you spend your nights alone.  But I believe the worst kind of loneliness, and if you're watching this video and this is you, I'm particularly making this video for you.  Some of you, you have once had a spouse but sadly they've gone.  You're bereaved and you spend your nights alone.  You eat your meals in quietness and you might have had a really really good day or a really really bad day.  and the first person you want to talk to, the first person you want to tell about the pain in your heart or the good news, they're not there anymore.  But if you are feeling lonely, may I make a gentle suggestion to you today?  Why not string up a friendship?  With the friend?  in the Bible it says, there is a friend who sticketh closer than a brother.  Who am I talking about?  Jesus.  Call out to him.  Call out to the saviour of the world who left the glories of heaven, who left his own dad, his father, and came into this world.  and was lonely.  call out to the saviour who when every single man went home to his wife to his family jesus christ withdrew and went to the lonely places to pray.  come to the one the lord jesus christ who even though he's surrounded by people when he's there hanging on that cross when he's bleeding there and dying on that cross and everyone's scorned him everyone's pointing at him and saying him if you're the son of god bring yourself down from that cross Deliver yourself.  He was lonely on that cross.  He suffered loneliness on that cross.  Separated for your sin.  All of the sin of the world laid on Jesus Christ.  And he was crushed on that cross for you.  Friends, friends, he is the only one who can deliver you from your loneliness.  He is the only one who can help you.  And thanks be to God that we have a saviour, Jesus Christ, who sympathises with all of our weaknesses. ",
