            "text": "Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey guys.  Well, I'm on Harbor and Lambert.  There's a new center that they just built here.  Right across from the CVS Distribution Center.  And I'm just checking it out.  Looks pretty cool at night, actually.  This architecture looks to me, I can't put a name on it, but it looks like it's very 50s.  And so not the big buildings on the edges.  Those are just behemoth buildings, but like these two in the middle.  And the little awning kind of thing that comes out, but it's all cement.  Pretty cool.  Nice to see not everything's been modernized in its look, but that they still have old-fashioned buildings.  Technically, this would be La Habra.  Oh, there's a guy with a crane.  Doing something to the sign up there, probably.  Sorry for all the noise here with the cars.  People go really fast on this street.  Here's the same little... Willows or whatever you call them that are all over the La Habra and Brea area on every corporate center that there is.  They just love those.  I was at ISO 10,000.  That's pretty funny.  It's a cool, I don't, you know, this is silly, but I don't know if that's a Challenger or a Charger.  I think it's a Challenger.  I'm not up on my American muscle cars as of late.  They do look cool, though.  But it just looks like a big rolling wine spot, if you ask me.  Really bad visibility and stuff.  I don't even know if the handling's any good.  I just have good luck with... Well, you know what?  I always end up talking about cars.  I don't know why.  But I used to love Hondas.  And then I think Honda had its heyday and it passed right around the year 2000.  And since then, I would say that Toyota is a lot better.  But nothing beats those old 90s Hondas.  Those things were so cool.  So iconic.  Especially like the Prelude and the Integra, which I had an Integra once.  Those are all cool cars.  Then Toyota always had its Supra, which was cool.  That's a really cool looking building.  Big vent on top.  Lots of brickwork.  Now, I think that brick's probably a fake gate.  I don't think that's real.  I think it's just plastered on the front there.  Look at that.  It's probably a name for that kind of slope.  It looks like an upside-down roof, the way it comes out like that.  I don't know why it comes up as it goes out.  Maybe it supports the weight or something.  Or maybe it's for visibility for the people inside.  Yeah, it looks pretty cool.  I like it a lot.  This whole center came together in like the last year.  They've been building and building and building.  And then people finally moved in.  You know what's hilarious?  The guy just came out of his office with like a 70 to 200 L lens from a Canon and tried to take my picture.  That's kind of funny actually.  Here comes two guys it looks like.  They look pretty jovial from here to be honest.  But who knows.  He's an idiot.  Who knows?  How's it going?  Good.  Nice to meet you.  Good to meet you.  I don't strike hands with changers, sorry.

Do you do the boxes that go like outside, like between the internet and the switch or is it?  We'll do that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  That's cool.

Good questions or anything like that.  We have a lot of former Beckman employees that really care about this particular thing.  It's cool.  And if you guys care about that flag you're flying, people like that shouldn't hassle people on the sidewalk that are just taking pictures.  well if they walk up to me that's their.  i don't mind.  if you take my picture yeah i'm not stalking anyone or following them around.  yeah that's none of my business although one of your employees was taking pictures of me.  so i guess that's okay.  he had he had a canon 70 to 200 uh the white lens.  It looks like it was a silver Kia SUV.  I got his license plate just because, you know, he kind of engaged me with that.  That would help me more than tell me the type of camera, I'm sorry.  But still.  Yeah, no worries.  These are larger.  I used to own a lot.  That's cool.  No, I mean, no ill will, no harm.  I watched him build this structure for about a year, and I saw the behemoths on the corners, and I just thought, that's bitchin' design.  Yeah, this was nice.  We were lucky.  I know you're probably just keeping me here until the cops come.  They're just going to tell you that there's nothing they can do.  They're going to drive away.  They're not even going to get my ID.  That's not my way of doing things.  Okay, cool, cool.  Well, I've dealt with enough CFOs to kind of distrust.  I'm the CFO.  Oh, sweet.  Okay.  What's your name? ",

But anyway, you're welcome to take pictures of the building.  I don't think I'll be here much longer.  I got a ton of cool pictures.  Okay.  I'm going around.  There's a lot of stuff in this area that has just been redone.  Yeah.  But, I mean, mention these guys.  Come on.  How many Bruce Willis movies do they think is real life?  What are they doing over there?  They shouldn't be afraid of cameras.  So why do they come outside and get in the picture?  That's the stupidest thing in the world.  I mean, I don't think they think I'm stealing their soul or something, but it looks like it.  Look at him.  Okay.  Thanks for being cool, actually.  Yeah.  Take care, man.  Thanks.  Hey, what's your CFO's name?  Michael.  Okay.  Typical asshole name, Michael.  I don't think I've known any mics that weren't assholes, to be honest with you.  Mr.  Arms Cross right there.  I'm going to get your fucking picture taken right now.  That class guy was really cool, actually.  I thought he was neat.  You're going to stand there and stare at me.  I'm just going to take a picture of you.  You're engaging me at that point to some degree.  So if I walk away now, it looks like the guy won.  You know what I mean?  Oh, he told me, so I'm going to go home.  So I got to stick around for a few more minutes at least.  There's the photographer guy and his little Pia that I got all of his plate info on.  That's pretty silly.  I'm going to come out with like a two foot lens.  that I just grabbed out of my car or something.  Oh, geez.  That was an interesting twist.  The CFO is obviously an idiot, but the other guy, class, seemed pretty cool.  What's with these guys with the slick back hair coming out with like a Superman complex, you know?  Is everything okay here?  Get the hell back in your business.  You don't patrol the side.  Any idiot can see we're having a two-way conversation and smiling.  That guy's just trying to be a tough guy.  That guy Klaas, who's, I guess he's the CEO, which makes him above the CFO, although the CFO was kind of trying to tell him what to do.  What a jerk.  I will say this.  He's got some class.  He knows what he's doing.  He must have watched some YouTube videos in the past.  Because all he did was make his company look good.  So, I mean, that's good.  That's pretty fast.  There's a cop walking up the sidewalk now.  He did wave kind of friendly, so you never know what's going on.  How's it going?  You're not Harris by any chance.  What's your... You're not Harris, are you?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You look kind of like him.  But he's night shift.  How's it going?  We got a call about you.  Yeah.  Someone was concerned about what you were doing.  Tough luck.  That's not against the law to take photos, but... Yeah.  What's your plan today?  Is it taking photos of the building, or... I'm just not really motivated to help you in your investigation against myself, so I'm... You're going to have to ask them what's going on.  What do you mean, ask who?  Them.  Who's them?  The people who called you.  I didn't call you.  So yeah, I mean just go talk with him.  I'm not, I'm not, I didn't come out here to talk to you.  I have no obligation to, anything I can say to you can only hurt me, so.  Hurt you in which way?  You're not doing anything wrong.  Well, people get busted for stuff they never did all the time.  I mean, are you going to come to my house and make cookies?  The only thing that can happen out of the situation statistically is bad for me, so I'm just not going to talk.  Okay, that's fine.  So.  Are you just planning on being out here all day or... I don't know if you guys all have listening problems, but I just said I'm not going to talk, and then you followed up with a question.  I'm trying to be nice.  Okay, I'll stop now, if that's what you want.  I couldn't find one.  There's not even people in this building.  This guy graduated from a Cracker Jacks box.  That's funny.  Deliveries.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Donuts are that way.  I'm gonna continue on what I was doing. ",
