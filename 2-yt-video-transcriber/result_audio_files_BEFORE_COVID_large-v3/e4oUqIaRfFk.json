There have been multiple instances of, in particular, pro-life groups being disfavored.  For example, here is a tweet that says, abortion is profoundly anti-women, and it's a quote from Mother Teresa.  And this tweet was blocked.  Now it is fairly remarkable that that Mother Teresa is now deemed hate speech.  Do either of you agree with the proposition that Mother Teresa is issuing hate speech?  Is this hate speech? ",
