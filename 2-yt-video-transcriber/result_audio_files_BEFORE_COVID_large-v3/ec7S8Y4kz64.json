            "text": "So, someone asked me if I was going to make a video on what happened with Vic Mignogna.  And for those of you who do not know, Vic is an American voice actor who has actually been in a lot of stuff.  I didn't realize he was in so many things until I checked the Wikipedia page.  But most recently, one of the things he's been in is Broly and the... English dub of Dragon Ball Super.  Broly, obviously.  So what happened, if you don't know, what happened with Vic recently over the past couple of weeks is there have been a lot of allegations or rumors tossed his way of sexual misconduct, I think is maybe the best way to describe it.  And in today's video, I'm not really going to be recounting Every allegation that has occurred, because there's lots of videos on YouTube that have done that, there's lots of evidence to suggest that there is a lot of foul play going on in the background between other voice actors that just didn't like Faye.  There's a lot of fake news articles that could be seen.  One example at the top of my head was there's one article, I think on the Anime News Network, that showed a picture of a young lady being kissed by Vic Manana only for the young lady herself to actually come out and say no.  She literally set up a fan meetup with Vic and he came and she requested that she take the picture, hug him and kiss him and all of that.  It is total bullcrap.  Totally fake news.  Totally just completely untrue, right?  So, that's just one example off the top of my head.  More details, I will put other videos.  The Yellow Flash has made several videos on this topic.  I'm going to link to him.  I'll link to a couple of other videos that I've seen with this evidence.  But today I'm not really going to go over that because, like I said, other people can do this much better than I can.  Instead, I want to look at, I want to do a little bit of a thought experiment based on the allegations and based on the rumors that we have.  Right?  So I'm going to quickly gloss over.  Some people think that Vic is homophobic because he didn't want to... signed some yaoi fanart.  And there's his own personal explanations on why he didn't want to do it, which you'll see in the other videos if you choose to watch them.  But I just want to throw that offhand.  The whole homophobia thing, that's a whole topic unto itself that I'll get into some other time in the near future.  So we'll just put a pin on that for the future.  Um... And instead I want to focus on what these young ladies, what these people are claiming Vic has done to them.  Because I've noticed that a lot of the allegations thrown at Vic that has caused him to lose his job, and even Rooster Teeth, he was actually the voice of Crow on the show Ruby.  I actually watched Ruby, I didn't even know what Vic was doing.  Crow is actually my favorite character, I'm not even going to lie.  So that kind of hurts me a little bit.  So to be fair, I'm not really a huge fan of this particular voice actor.  I have realized he's been in a lot of characters that I do like.  But I'm not fanboying over this guy or anything like that.  But I do have a personal bias in a sense that I do like his voice.  I do like all the work that he has done.  So you can take what I'm going to say here with a grain of salt.  But if you listen, you might find that maybe you shouldn't.  uh... but what we've seen?  he's been fired from his jobs and the reason why is because he's been accused of of kissing people or kissing girls on the cheek, or hugging girls without their consent, without them wanting to.  That is the extent of the allegations I've seen.  Consistently, he hasn't been accused of rape, he hasn't been accused of groping, he hasn't been accused of stalking anyone, he hasn't been accused of any real sexual misconduct apart from hugging people that didn't want to be hugged.  So as a thought experiment, I'm gonna take all his allegations at face value.  Hugging people, kissing people on the cheek without their consent.  Let's take it at face value.  Let's say he did all of those things.  Is it really enough to destroy his life over all of this?  Wouldn't it be weird to kiss people on the cheek?  Sure.  Wouldn't it be weird to hug people you don't know?  Sure.  But then there's the context that he is a public figure.  He's popular with lots of young ladies due to the voices that he acts.  When we add context to this, we find that not only do we have a repertoire of more young ladies who want him to do this, who do specifically ask him to do this.  But we also have to add in the context, and if this is victim-blaming, then you know what?  Maybe I am victim-blaming, but we have to add into the context that Vic has been like this for years.  This is not news.  These rumors of Vic, you know, kissing people in the cheek or hugging people they don't want to be hugged has existed for years.  Nary a criminal charge, nary any investigation into any wrongdoing.  In fact, this is the extent from what I've seen.  The extent is as simple as, you know, kissing people in the cheek or hugging people when I guess they didn't want to.  But see, this is what is weird to me.  And this is why, again, if we take everything at face value, I still think it's bullshit.  And if this is victim blaming, then okay, I'll take it.  I'm victim blaming, but... There's no way you couldn't go up to Vic and not know that this was his modus operandi.  This is my problem with all this bullshit.  Because at anime conventions, you gotta stand in a line.  Let's play this out, like, logically.  Let's play this out.  You gotta stand in a line.  And you gotta wait for your turn to approach Vic and take his picture or talk to him, right?  Which means you see one young lady take a picture.  He kisses her on the cheek, hugs her, goes on.  It happens again.  That's two.  Happens again.  That's three.  Happens again.  That's four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.  You're eleven.  You get eleven.  You've seen ten times he's done this.  And you mean to tell me that you're taken aback when he hugs and gives you a kiss on the cheek for the picture that you asked to be taken?  See, that doesn't... That doesn't add up to me, man.  Because you have to be a certain level of too stupid or just lying to not understand that.  that's just what he does.  Now, some people might say, in the era of Me Too, maybe he should have known better than to do this.  And Vic has made an apology video.  I'll play a little bit here, actually, where he says, in his apology, where he says he's just kind of gotten used to doing this, right?  So here it goes. ",

            "text": "How can I do better?  And I learned something, and I wanted to share it with you.  As long as I've been doing events, which is a long time, I've always been very demonstrative.  It's just always been who I am.  You could go back and find panels or Q&A or autograph sessions from 10 years ago, 12, 15 years ago, and I'm doing the same thing.  In my mind, it's a way of saying thank you and expressing kindness and appreciation and warmth and support for a lot of people that could use it.  You know what I'm talking about when I say that.  But here's what I've learned.  Just because a thousand people want to hug doesn't mean everybody does.  And I got really lazy.  Over the years, I got really lazy.  And I got used to being the same person all the time.  And I was insensitive to the fact that there could be people out there that don't want that. ",

            "text": "And here's the thing though, like I said, going back again, face value, taking all these allegations at face value.  He's been doing this for years.  I understand from Vic's point of view, he says he got lazy, you know, and I think he's being really hard on himself here, you know, because... And maybe it's kind of fair and maybe it's not.  I can see both sides of this where, yeah, maybe he should have asked for consent 150,000 times.  The thousands of times these young ladies have come up to get their stuff signed.  Maybe he should have.  But with that positive reinforcement of literally years of this going on and on and on, it's easy to see how we could have gotten into the motions or into him just being that.  And he just does kind of seem to just be a genuinely friendly person.  Excuse me.  But I find it hard to believe that the girls who have all these rumors and everything, who are upset at Vic, didn't know that this was going to be a thing that happened.  It's like this.  It's genuinely, at least to me, like this.  It's like looking at a rattlesnake, right?  Walking up to that rattlesnake.  You see the rattlesnake.  It shakes its rattle.  Leave me alone.  And you keep walking up to it.  Leave me alone.  Hey, what if I touch this rattlesnake?  You tap the rattlesnake on the head and it bites you.  And it's like, come on, man.  Like, how did you not know that the rattlesnake was gonna bite you?  You can't, let's not pretend that you didn't know that this was gonna be a thing.  And the thing that happens, see, the example of the rattlesnake is just a clear negative.  Like, you never get bitten by a rattlesnake.  Like, oh, thank God, you know?  But with Vic Mignogna, it's a simple, simple thing.  He hugs you and he gives you a peck on the cheek and, you know, sends you on your merry way.  I'm pretty sure he would sit there and chat with you for a little bit.  But if there's lots of people to get through, then you really just can't, you know, just functionally.  You just can't, unfortunately, you know, being a public figure, being an actor or anything like that.  But it's no way, like my example with the rattlesnake is just clearly negative, obviously, you know, but the point being, the whole point of the analogy is to say there's no way you can't know what you're going to get when you approach Vic, same way when you approach a rattlesnake.  So I feel like this might be victim blaming if you can consider these people to be victims, but this is something that Vic has been doing for years.  And the extent of these allegations mark a precedent.  They mark a really, really sad, weak precedent for young ladies and the interactions men can have with young ladies.  It's really getting to a dangerous point where now hugging and kissing a young lady is a sexual assault.  Where we're hugging a girl or kissing her on the cheek is now enough to get you fired is now sexual misconduct.  And I mean, yeah, some of these anime girls, let's be real, some of these girls in anime, they're probably awkward people.  They're probably strange people.  They're probably not used to social interactions.  Maybe some of them probably were uncomfortable, genuinely uncomfortable.  But this is a situation that should be solved between two people.  This is not a problem that should get you fired from your job and come to destroy your life.  This should not be a thing.  This should not be a media circus.  Harvey Weinstein, yeah.  While I'm sure, I'm positive, a lot of this was quid pro quo.  This was, you know, you suck me off, I'll get you this part, I'll make you this producer.  That's too much.  That's straight up prostitution.  Hey, I'm going to have sex with you.  You're going to give me all this money or this job is going to give me money.  Yeah.  And if these girls regret that later, again, no matter how you slice it, it still was wrong.  Harvey Weinstein still shouldn't have done it.  But we can't pretend, you know, this whole Me Too thing isn't just girls who are regretting the fact that they sold their soul to the devil.  That's what they did, you know.  But with Vic Mignogna, it's not like that.  It's not these girls are being prostituted.  It's not these girls are getting rolls or parts and anything like that.  It is as simple as he has done something he has done for years.  These girls knew he was going to do it.  Some of these girls melt when he does it.  They love the fact that Vic will whisper in their ear one of their favorite quotes.  They love the fact that he'll hug them.  They love the fact that he'll be personal and talk to them.  This positive reinforcement is just ridiculous of just positivity.  There's nothing negative about any of this stuff.  There's nothing nasty or manipulative about any of this stuff that has occurred with Vic over the years.  It's not even like you could twist it.  It's just that the whole lack of consent thing for some of these women or some of these girls going to these conventions has destroyed him now.  So much so that where he's making these different apologies, he's getting banned from these different conventions.  Anyone who even defends Vic is getting banned now at that point.  Nary any evidence, nary any of that.  But again, let's just say that this is all totally 100% true.  That these girls are feeling uncomfortable by him being hugged and kissed by Vic.  What is this saying about the Constitution of... of women the mental constitution of women that this is gonna that this is gonna affect them in such a nasty way?  it shows they're very weak And that's not a good look.  A lot of this whole Me Too thing is not giving women in general a good look.  It's not giving a relationship between men and women a good look.  Because now something this simple, that again, we've seen positively, most of the people who go to Mick, they have enjoyed it.  I've seen very few people who haven't, really, which would be these allegations.  But we're taking something that most women have enjoyed and liked and we're turning it into this nasty media circus when really it's just very simple and kind of innocuous.  They kissed you on the cheek.  And if you're not comfortable with that, that's something that should be solved with, excuse me, sir, could you not do that?  Excuse me, I appreciate your work, but I don't like being hugged like that.  Could have solved this a long time ago.  But there's no constitution, there's no mental constitution with some of these ladies.  And maybe there's no mental constitution because this is all just total bullshit.  But again, I'm playing the thought experiment that if these women were so weak-willed as to where they cannot say, hey, don't hug me or move away from a hug or hey, don't kiss me.  We're dealing with a serious problem of just weak-minded young ladies.  And we're dealing with an even worse problem with the destruction of the relationship between men and women.  Like, this thing goes pretty fucking deep.  This is how I view it.  This is some deep shit.  Very deep.  Because at the very least, even if the rules were getting tighter and tighter and tighter... with sexual misconduct.  Even though we knew that being falsely accused of rape is going to get you destroyed.  At the very least, rape is a bad thing.  We know it's bad.  We understand why that's going to destroy your life.  We get that.  But now it's, he hugged me and he kissed me on the cheek.  That won't destroy you.  That's night and day.  rape, being hugged, night and day, night and day.  But it's the same thing.  It's being treated as if it's the same nasty, creepy, messed up thing.  What's happening to Vic is no different than what's happened to even someone like James Dean, who is actually a porn star, yeah, a porn actor.  When Stoya, I actually made a video on this several years ago, said that he raped her, same exact thing happened to him.  There's no difference.  The companies, they just fire them.  They don't want the negative press around them.  No investigation, no evidence, nothing.  Some ladies just said it.  It's literally being treated as if it is on the same category.  And what does that say about our relation as men and women?  That men cannot even show any degree of affection towards women.  Even when they want it.  Even when it's consistently shown that the women want it.  Even though it's consistently shown that that's how the man is.  That's what he does.  He's just that friendly.  And Vic really does seem to be just that nice of a guy.  Maybe he's acting.  I don't know.  But it does seem like he's just that genuine of a guy.  Literally hugging and kissing someone is this deep of a problem.  So they got to get fired and lose their job.  And now they're a monster.  Now they're getting slandered.  Or insulted by people that were supposed to be his friends.  Even other voice actors are now coming out on Twitter bashing Vic.  And again, remember these allegations are genuinely as simple as... He hugged me without my consent.  He kissed me on the cheek without my consent.  This is the extent that I've seen so far.  My friends... We're living in the darkest timeline, man.  I am... I am thoroughly convinced that this is the darkest timeline.  So, with that being said, man, I assume you guys got something out of today's video.  Please check out the links in the description box.
