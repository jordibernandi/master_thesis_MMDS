            "text": "Hi friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor.  I want to welcome you to our Friday evening Bible Question of the Week, where we're going to talk about, Does Hell Burn Forever?  This is probably one of the most important questions that I'm answering because there are literally millions of people around the world that have turned away from the Christian concept of God.  because the way some people teach Christianity, if you're good, you die, you go to heaven.  If you're bad, you die, you go to hell, where you will burn forever.  and boil and roll and blister in the sulfur and brimstone forever and ever and ever.  And that means that a 14 year old kid that never accepted Jesus, but they've reached the age of accountability is going to go there and burn through all eternity for the sins of 14 years.  This is what's taught by not all, but many evangelical Christians.  Thinking people look at that and they say, there's no justice in that.  Why would a God of love create a creature that's already prone towards sin and disobedience and then torment them eternally because they were not able to get the victory?  And so they say this is such an outrageous thought.  You know, a few years ago, there was a pilot from Jordan who was shot down in the ISIS-held territory And the news reported that they took this man who was captured and they put him in a cage and they doused him with gasoline.  And then they recorded as he burned to death, not being able to escape from the cage.  And people around the world thought that this was the most horrific thing that could ever be done.  But yet this is what some Christians say God is going to do.  And I had that idea about God.  I turned away from God, going to a few Catholic schools where this was taught.  And I was so relieved when I learned what the Bible really teaches.  Let me read to you.  Now, the Bible is really clear.  There is hellfire.  There is punishment for the wicked.  But it doesn't burn forever.  Malachi chapter 4, last book in the Old Testament.  For behold, the day is coming that will burn like an oven.  And all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.  The day that is coming will burn them up, says the Lord of hosts.  It will leave them neither root nor branch.  But to you who fear my name, the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings, and you will go up and grow up like calves of the stall.  You shall tread the wicked under your feet as ashes on the day that I do this, says the Lord.  So here it says the wicked will be tread under the feet.  They're ashes, they're burnt up, they're consumed, they're stubble.  This is just one verse.  There are many verses in the Bible.  Some say, well, yeah, it's pretty clear.  the bodies burn up in hellfire, but the soul burns eternally.  Maybe you've heard that one.  Jesus says in Matthew chapter 10, verse 28, fear not them that kill the body, but they're not able to kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy soul and body in hell.  Those are the words of Jesus.  How can that be more clear?  There's two choices everyone has.  Jesus believe and live and If you do not believe, you perish.  That's John 3, verse 16.  Christ says he's rewarding people when they come, according to their works.  That's Revelation 22, verse 12.  Behold, I come quickly.  My reward is with me to give to everyone according to his work.  One thing we learn from this is that nobody's burning in hell yet because the Lord hasn't come yet.  It tells us in Revelation chapter 20 that it's after the millennium that God rains fire down out of heaven on the wicked, and they are cast into a lake of fire.  That's after the second coming, after the millennium, after the judgment, after the resurrection.  The idea that as soon as a person dies, that they're in hell burning.  The Bible doesn't teach that.  That wouldn't make any sense.  They'll point in a judgment if they're already burning in hell.  And so... The other thing we learn from this verse, he says, my reward is with me to give to every man according to his work.  If everybody burns forever, then everybody really gets the same reward.  But Jesus is pretty clear.  He that knew his master's will and did not do it will be beaten with many stripes.  He that did not know his master's will but disobeyed, he will be beaten with few stripes.  There are varying degrees of reward, both for the wicked and for the good, for the saved and for the lost.  And so the idea that Adolf Hitler is going to burn just as long as that 14-year-old boy I highlighted a minute ago is really outrageous when you think about it.  That would also mean that Hitler and Pol Pot and Stalin, who killed millions of people, have burned thousands of years less than Cain, who killed one person.  There's no justice in that.  So, just looking at some of the... The Bible tells us that the punishment of the wicked is going to be very much like the punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah.  In Jude 1, verse 7, there's only one chapter.  in Jude, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, in a similar manner to these, gave themselves over to sexual immorality, and they went after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.  Now, Are those cities still burning today?  No.  You can go to the southern part of the Dead Sea and see where Sodom and Gomorrah used to be.  They were burnt up.  But the result of the eternal fire was forever.  They're never burning again.  Again, 2.  Peter 2, verse 6, turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who should afterward live ungodly.  Well, here it says eternal fire, but Peter says they were destroyed, turned into ashes, as an example of what's going to happen to the wicked.  As we read in Malachi, the wicked will be burnt up.  They are turned to ashes.  So, what does it mean in Matthew 25, verse 41?  when it says, he'll say to those on the left hand, depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  Calls it everlasting fire.  Well, it is everlasting fire.  You can read in verse 46, same chapter, Matthew 25.  These go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.  The results of the fire are everlasting.  So it's like the fire that burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah.  They were burnt with everlasting fire.  It's never been rebuilt.  The results of that fire are everlasting.  And it says the punishment is everlasting.  They don't get a second chance.  See, all through the Bible, God is so patient and merciful.  You look at the history of Israel.  They backslid.  He forgave them.  They backslid.  He forgave them.  He just was so merciful, so patient.  He is with us all the time.  But when hell finally happens, there's no second chance.  It's called the second death.  And the word death means the absence of all life.  What about the phrase where it calls it unquenchable fire?  Let me read that to you.  Mark 9, verse 47 and 48.  And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out, for it's better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hellfire where the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.  First of all, Christ is obviously using metaphorical or symbolic language here.  Nobody in heaven is going to have one eye.  And it's talking about the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.  He's talking about the word for hell.  there is called Gehenna.  That was the dump outside of Jerusalem, better known as the Valley of Hinnom.  And in that place, they filled it with garbage and baskets and dead animals.  And it was full of maggots and smoldering.  And it was a place of continual abhorrence.  And so he's just saying that it's a place where the wicked are consumed.  But notice it calls it unquenchable fire.  Why is it called fire that is not quenched?  Let the Bible describe itself.  Let the Bible explain and interpret itself.  Jeremiah 17, 27.  He says, if you do not heed me to hallow the Sabbath day, such as not carrying a burden when entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath, then I will kindle a fire in the gates and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and it shall not be quenched.  This was a prophecy that was going to happen to Jerusalem because of their disobedience and the rebellion.  And he said that the gates of the city would be burnt with unquenchable fire.  Well, they did not obey.  You can read in 2 Chronicles 36, 19, that the city and its gates were burnt with unquenchable fire according to the prophecy of Jeremiah.  They're not still burning today.  The word quench means to extinguish.  It's an action of extinguishing or putting something out.  No one is going to put out the fires of hell.  No one will be able to stop the results of those fire.  And different people are going to be rewarded differently.  Some may burn longer.  Bible says the devil burns day and night.  And that brings us to the next phrase or the next concern.  People say, well, what about the verse, It says, forever and ever.  Let me read it to you.  Revelation 20, verse 10.  The devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and they are tormented day and night forever and ever.  That phrase, ever and ever, you can read, for instance, in Young's literal translation, they'll be tormented day and night to the ages of the ages.  It's often an unspecified period of time.  It basically means until they are forever no more.  And the last conscious thought of the devil and all the lost is a burning.  It's like it's frozen eternally in time.  But are we going to look from the gates of the New Jerusalem out on a lake of fire and watch people writhing and blistering forever and ever?  Clearly not.  That would not be paradise for anybody.  The Bible says God has no pleasure in the wicked.  You look at the promises in the Bible.  Let me give you another verse here.  2 Thessalonians 1, 7 through 9.  To you who are troubled with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who know not God, that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will be punished with everlasting destruction.  So what's everlasting?  The destruction.  Jesus said how to destroy soul and body.  The words that are being used to describe the wicked, perish, destroy, consume, devour, smoke, stubble, ashes.  In Ezekiel, it says, never shall thou be anymore.  I mean, what terms can God use that are clear to explain that the wicked will not be?  Eternal life is not promised to the wicked.  God doesn't say, you're immortal and you're going to either live in hell forever or you're going to live in heaven forever.  The Bible says God and God only has immortality.  We've got two choices, life and death.  God told Adam and Eve, disobey, you die.  The devil said, you don't really die.  You'll either live forever in heaven or you'll live forever in hell.  You're immortal.  God does not say that.  God said to Adam, ashes you'll return to.  And that the penalty for sin is death.  And so, I think it's very clear as you read these different verses in the Bible.  You can read in Psalm 37, verse 20, \"...the enemies of the Lord will consume into smoke, they will consume  away.\".  And God's ultimately gonna create a universe where there is no more pain.  Now, how can you have this massive area where millions, billions of people, because broad is the way that leads to destruction, that would mean the majority of humans who ever lived would be in the lake of fire, forever burning.  How can God say there is no more pain?  How can God say, as he says in Revelation 21, all things are made new, no more suffering.  It's just not true.  It's a misrepresentation of the love of God.  God is going to take away all tears.  There'll be no more pain, no more sorrow.  And the penalty for sin is death.  God is asking the wicked to turn.  He says, turn ye, turn ye.  Why will you die?  and he wants to save us.  He wants us to have life, eternal life.  God is going to wipe away all tears from their eyes, and he says, I've gone to prepare a place for you.  I'm hoping, friends, that you'll accept that place.  There's a lot more information on this subject of hell, and I don't have time in our short segments that we do here.
