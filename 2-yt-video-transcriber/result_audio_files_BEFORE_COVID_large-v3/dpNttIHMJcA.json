That doesn't even sound right.  But I hope you're doing well.  I hope you're feeling well.  And in doing so, I hope you've felt yourself today.  Also, feel free to grab yourself an AB hoodie.  Links are in the description.  And if you're a woman, you can get one for yourself or for a man in your life.  you actually respect.  Yeah, you actually respect.  But let's begin.  With the topic, the topic of why more men are ghosting women in 2020.  In a sense, vanishing, disappearing off the dating scene, no longer being available to date or not wanting to date, to marry, to be a boyfriend, to be a husband.  or to even be a man that lives with a woman.  First of all, before I speak on ghosting in a relationship, let me speak on ghosting in a, in the macro sense, why more men in general will start ghosting more women in 2020.  Now, there are various reasons, many, many reasons.  For some men, they have been there and done it and they can't be bothered anymore.  They seriously can't be bothered.  Some have been burnt so much and destroyed so much by their relationships that they never want to go back or be in that situation again.  And yes, there are some men who have not been with much or any women at all.  And for them, ghosting makes sense.  And many, many other reasons.  But you see, a large reason for this is the changing attitude of women.  It's also the lack of respect we as men see we're getting in abundance nowadays.  It's to a point where many men just don't care.  They literally don't care.  They don't care what women think, what women want, what turns women on.  Many men have reached a point where they just don't care anymore.  It's not even the fact that they've set women aside to pursue something better as in their life, their own personal life.  For some men, they just can't be bothered at all anymore.  They won't even try.  And in doing so, they won't approach.  They won't flirt with.  You will never find them in someone's DMs.  The only thing you will find them doing is living their own lives.  And as well as changing attitudes, there are the risk factors.  Many risk factors.  Being a man dating a woman nowadays is not so straightforward.  Even in approaching a woman or even trying to court a woman, in this Me Too era, many men get in trouble for just trying to do what they feel natural.  Trying to flirt with or court a woman.  And yes, I know the word courting doesn't exist in 2020.  I know, I know.  And aside from those things, it's the quality of women men have to choose from nowadays as well.  For some men, in their areas where they live, they have nothing but majority single mothers to choose from.  For many men, that's not good pickings.  That's leftover pickings.  Not many men want to pick that up and run with it.  It's also the expected simping of men.  How women want and expect a large majority of men, of us, to be simps for them.  And it's the fact that women want you to simp and they will let you simp.  Because most of the times, they're the ones that get the most out of you simping.  Even if you get some, they're still the ones getting the most.  You see, for many men, you have to actually sell them.  financially sell them the idea of a relationship.  Because for some men that have been there and done it and don't want to go back, yeah, you'd have to pay them and there may not even be enough money for them to even go back to dating, to relationships, to marriage.  You see, for many men, as men, we have to look at what's on offer.  You see, some men don't care.  They don't question anything.  They just go with the flow.  Now you see, many like these sorts of men, the men that don't question anything, that don't observe anything, that don't focus enough to see that they are the prize, to see their value.  But you see, men that do see their value, men that really understand their value, they see their value is much higher than being this man.  For any woman, for any woman to step on and walk on, You see, this is the thing.  What a lot of people are missing nowadays is the fact that men, a large majority of men, actually value themselves enough to see the crap and want nothing to do with it.  That portion of men you can't ignore because they exist.  So for many men, ghosting women makes perfect sense.  Why put yourself in this position to give someone this much power over you?  To then potentially use everything you do for her against you?  and some would say there's no guarantee a woman would do this and there's no guarantee she will not do it either.  from my experience it's leading more to the fact that she will.  from my experience now in saying that let's get to the micro.  Why a man may ghost a woman.  A woman he may have been, for lack of a better word again, courting, checking, chirpsing, or even dating, in a relationship with, or even married to.  Why would these men ghost their women?  Now for some men, they may feel that, well, she's useless.  She's not doing much.  She doesn't bring much to my life.  She's lazy.  She's actually boring.  But for some men, they just enjoy the smash.  That's it.  That's it.  For as annoying as she is, for as crazy as she is, the liar that she is, the deceiver that she is, sometimes, my God, being lost to a woman you just enjoy smashing is... It is a mind F. In a sense, it's you manipulating yourself through the woman.  You can blame the woman, but... In a sense, it's you manipulating yourself, fooling yourself through the woman because of your desire for her.  So when some men actually lift their heads up or stand up and look at the bigger picture, they may then think, you know what, I can't be bothered.  This is stupid.  I don't even like her like that.  I don't even like her at all.  Then some men just disappear.  One of many reasons.  If he's sleeping with you and then he just disappears, well, it's because you're crap, basically.  At the same time, we as men do make women think they can get away with a lot of things because we let them do it.  because we like smashing them sleeping with them sleeping with them safe for YouTube.  so in a sense it is our fault as men that we would actually lie to women to get what we want from them.  you know monstrous men that we are but it's what we do as women lie to us.  but men that have come to their realization they run they flee they ghost a woman because they have no need for her anymore.  For some men, it doesn't get that far.  It may be in meeting her.  In meeting her a few times.  Then you realize there's something weird about this woman.  She's a little bit crazy.  She seems very clingy.  Or she seems deceptive.  Or she's just not as fine as you thought she was from her pictures.  Then yeah, that's a reason why many men just disappear.  Because many women do love to catfish.  And once again, in a sense, it's our fault as men because sometimes these women catfish.  You see a hot chick in the picture, and then when she turns up, it's a hot mess.  But some men still go ahead and smash anyway.  They smash anyway.  And because of this, it only encourages women to do this more.  Because they know how damn right nasty some men are.  And they don't care.  You see, the fact is, things aren't changing.  Things are staying the same way.  They're not getting better.  Men can see clearly now what's going on.  So for them, their best option is just to move on, is just to get on with their lives, to live their lives as best as they can for themselves.  Yes, of course, some still bust and move, bust and move.  But for many men, that's no longer the focus.  Where they're going, what they're doing, building and improving on, that is the focus.  To constantly move forward, to ghost those who have no benefit to them at all.  when you understand that you are the prize.  In other words, the understanding is to focus, observe, remember.  The world is yours.  Have a nice day. ",
