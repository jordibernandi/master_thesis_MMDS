            "text": "Good morning, beautiful family.  It is super early and I apologize.  It's about 5.30 right now and I, about 30 minutes ago, had just woke up to the most real dream, the most realistic dream I think I've had yet.  I've given myself about half an hour to like process it because like literally whenever I woke up, I was bawling.  Like my husband had to like console me.  Excuse me.  Because it was literally that realistic and my husband and I were sitting at the dinner table last night and I was just talking to him about like the peace plan and stuff like that.  and be careful what you ask for because I asked the Lord again last night to give me something again and he did and it's been quite a while.  I feel like since I have had a dream from him and I just know 110% of this was from him.  so I'm just gonna tell you guys real quick what happened.  so when I woke up I was literally trying to process like was this a rapture dream?  and like no of course it was not because guys I saw.  Okay, I'm just going to tell you guys what happened.  So, in the dream, I was in this city and like, I know I was in a well-known city like with skyscrapers and really tall buildings and like, when I was a kid, I used to call it spaghetti because it was like, those like highways and stuff or like the like the roads that we're all in between like kind of like what you find in Atlanta.  I'm sorry guys like it's super early and I'm so sorry about my appearance but I had to share this with you guys.  So I know I was in like a well-known city and all of a sudden I looked out in front of me and I saw You know, like whenever rockets go off and they let off this like white chemtrail type cloudy stuff.  That was like everywhere, all in front of me in this big, like large city.  And, um, I remember yelling, it's starting.  And, um.  All of a sudden, amongst all of that chemtrail stuff, from what I know, was the aftermath of a bunch of missiles being fired.  I saw angels pop out randomly.  I saw them so far out in the distance that they were small.  but I saw the.  I saw them popping out and they started.  they started blowing these trumpets and was watching a video a few weeks ago and it reminded me of this because I saw a video of this girl actually sent it to a couple of brothers and sisters but I saw this video of this woman that was describing a dream that she had had from the Lord when she was an agnostic and she said that she heard trumpets but they sounded like like um.  she said it was like terrifying like trumpet siren sounds and she couldn't even describe how it sounded.  but she just felt terrified.  and now i know exactly what she's talking about.  so all of a sudden i see these angels pop up and they're blowing these trumpets.  but it's terrifying And the best way I can even try to like, do it is like, and then it would go again.  And as soon as I like saw these angels pop up and blow these trumpets, guys, I saw.  know I was seeing the tribulation in the second coming.  sorry I'm just overwhelmed.  so us I saw out in the distance Jesus or God Dressed in red.  And he was coming on the clouds.  On a horse.  And um.  There were two horses.  Next to him.  Like two people were next to him.  On white horses as well.  And God or Jesus was.  Dressed in red.  And they were coming like far from a distance.  And they were small.  Kind of like small up in the air.  But I can see them right now.  And they like they were coming on the clouds guys.  And they came right up over my head.  And like kept going.  And I mean he was coming with power and glory.  And um.  soon as i saw that um as soon as i saw him of course now i know i was i saw.  i was seeing the tribulation in the second coming um and it's like all.  at the same time i'm seeing like these chemchails from all of these missiles going off um.  i'm seeing these angels blow these trumpets and i saw um literally cannot believe that.  I saw him coming on the clouds in red and two other horses and whoever they were on each side I mean zooming in the clouds fast and we're galloping going right where they went right over me and I watched kind of like you would an airplane.  As soon as that happened.  Um.  In this city.  Um.  I was running around.  I ran and I grabbed my cell phone.  Um.  For some reason I remember having.  I had an Apple watch.  And I was scrolling through.  And I hit mom.  And I was calling.  And I couldn't get a hold of her.  I think I tried her like three times.  And um.  All of a sudden, I remember I was in a building.  I was in some kind of skyscraper.  I don't remember being totally on like the bottom level or being at the top or whatever, but I was in like high enough to where I could see like over the highways and stuff.  And all of a sudden, this tsunami just engulfed whole city in.  it came rolling from the left side and I remember when it got to me in the building.  it was just consuming me.  I remember it was coming right over me like I was about to drown.  it felt so realistic that I was literally trying to wake myself.  I was like, Oh my gosh, is this real?  I was trying to like literally wake myself or I was like waiting, trying to like, cause sometimes in my dreams I can wake myself up and I was trying to shake myself out of the dream.  And as soon as that tsunami and that huge wave engulfed me and, uh, everybody else and everything like in front of it and the highway and the, and the building, Um, I woke up, um, I, I am literally like in shock that he showed me that.  Um, and you're probably like, why are you crying?  It's overwhelming.  Um, now I'm going to make a few points here.  Um, cause I don't want anybody, um, that is watching this to fear.  He just, I know for a fact, he put me, um, in that setting just to like to see what it was going to look like.  Um, I know 110% that we are going to be raptured before the tribulation before the second coming.  Um, so I don't want you guys to take my tears as, um, as okay.  Like now I have to, um, I don't want this to turn into fear for you because anybody who is born again, anyone who believes, he says he will save us from his wrath.  And I know for a fact that we're going to be raptured up out of here any second.  And I know that's why he showed that to me.  And the first thing I could say.  Like literally like.  That I murmured out of my mouth.  When I was bawling.  My husband was like trying to console me.  I said those poor people.  Because.  So many people just don't have a clue.  And.  And.  literally cannot believe that I saw him.  it's been a while I need to brush up on revelation again but I'm pretty sure that trumpets blow when when Christ comes on the clouds and I'm talking.  he was coming.  he was coming fast.  it looked like he meant business.  he was coming with glory and power and He zoomed right over me.  I saw him coming with two other people.  There were three white horses.  He was in red.  And there were two white horses on each side of him.  And I don't know who they were.  But there were people riding them as well.  All I have to say, guys, is get ready.  Because... The rapture of the church.  Is any second.  And.  He has never.  Shown me.  His second coming.  I've never.  Ever.  Seen that.  I've only had.  I've had.  Um.  One.  One destruction.  Uh.  Video.  Or.  I'm sorry.  One destruction.  Dream.  Which I shared with you guys.  When.  Um.  I've already shared that with you guys, but I've never ever had a dream like this.  where I was in a large city and I saw the angels and I heard the trumpets and I saw him coming on the clouds.  Guys, he's coming.  I don't know how much more clear he has to get.  Um, if you have not believed on Christ today, I advise you that you believe, um, because I saw this huge wave that is going to engulf.  I don't know what city I was in, but I saw this huge wave that was.  We already know that the world is going to experience something that we've never seen.  That they've never seen.  That the whole world has never seen before.  I know 110% that was from him.  Like that felt so real.  Like so real.  I was like, oh my gosh, is this real?  Or can I like wake up out of this dream?  I'm going to leave you guys with that.  I need to like wake up and process this more.  I'm going to come back on at lunchtime today at work to talk to you guys more about it.  Um, I just had to give that to you guys.  Um, look up our redemption draws and I, um, with this peace plan and everything like it's seconds and I'm just so overwhelmed and like I'm actually happy.  Believe it or not.  Um, Because I feel.  Like I feel privileged.  That he gave me that.  And that I was able to see that.  But I feel bad for the people.  That have to go through.  Like.  Those trumpet sounds.  Are probably going to be terrifying for people.  Because they're going to have no idea.  Anybody is going to be coming on any cloud.  You know what I mean.  So.  Yeah guys.  I'm going to go ahead and head off of here.  The rapture of the church.  Is any second.  So you guys be waiting to hear the trumpet.  For us to meet him in the clouds.  And be with him forever.  Because this is it.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Okay. ",
