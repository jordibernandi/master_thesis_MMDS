            "text": "hey good morning everybody Patrick back with another video and I wanted to make a quick one today because I was just going over some of the financial headlines and I saw that the Dow futures have dropped 500 points.  and this is all due to the the trade war which is brewing between China and the United States.  and now we have here that the Chinese state has said it is going to put its own retaliatory tariffs in place in order to counteract the new tariffs that President Trump has promised to put on China since he said he was in no hurry to come to a trade agreement.  So I just wanted to give everybody out there a heads up as to what the market could do today.  if we're already down 500 points before the open we could see any number of things we could see like last week where the market opens 200 to 400 points down and then it sort of drifts up and only loses 100 points.  or you could see you know a sharp drop two or three hundred points and then magically magically uh the stock market makes a rebound about midday and comes to break even.  you know i've covered in past videos about the uh the open declaration of federal reserve market manipulation.  it's on their own website.  so i'm going to put a link to that video at the end of this video if you want to click on that and check that out.  just how manipulated and rigged the entire world financial system is, how they suppress the price of gold, how they, when I say they, central banks admit to trading in the open market in order to control monetary policy.  So that's two scenarios that could happen.  But the third scenario, which a lot of people are probably, at this point, not even prepared for, because at this point, even I'm getting normalcy bias from all of the rigging, but what if, or should I say, what happens when we open with a bad start or with futures down so low, and for whatever reason, the Federal Reserve doesn't step in, the central banks don't step in, or they can't for whatever reason, and they can't buy up the market, they can't buy up bonds, They can't get away with what they have been and the Dow takes a 400 or 500 point dive, even a 700 point dive.  It's happened.  It's happened in recent times.  You probably remember the massive drop on Christmas Eve of 2018.  But this all happens with a backdrop of record student loan debt, record corporate debt, record personal debt.  We have now news coming in that RV sales are down something like 25%.  The reason why that's significant is because RV sales have typically been a recession indicator because they show that people have discretionary income.  And when people are tightening their wallets and their bank accounts, they don't have the money.  They're not going to go out and buy an RV so that they can take that all-American road trip.  Also, we have other serious recession indicators triggering like the inversion of the yield curve and the flattening of several yield curves in government bonds around the world, not just the US and Canada also and Germany.  So everybody out there, you still have time to prepare.  You still have time to do something about it.  Maybe the government will step in and buy up the stock market if it has a bad day again, but you don't know that.  You don't know when this party is going to be over.  You don't know when the musical chairs game is going to end, and then you're scrambling to get a chair.  So I just recommend that everybody out there, while you still can, do something to prepare, if nothing else, mentally.  If nothing else, mentally prepare to sideline some of your holdings from stocks into cash in your accounts, or you know if you want to roll over into something safer like precious metals I'll put a link below to a free gold IRA investment rollover kit and it is free for everyone who is qualified.  that means you have 10k or more to invest.  and for people who just wanna buy precious metals outright I'm gonna put a link below to a great trusted precious metals dealer in America.  And this is for people who maybe you just want to buy some silver rounds, some American Eagles, or maybe you just want to buy a gold coin.  There is no price minimum or maximum.  So I'm going to put a link below to that as well.  I personally carry silver with me everywhere I go.  I've been traveling for the last two years.  I haven't even been to America, and I keep silver on me just in case.  So anyways, good luck to everybody out there.  It's going to be interesting to see what happens today, but I just wanted to give you a heads up.  because I really don't think that what's happening right now can go on forever.  Could be wrong.  You know, I could be wrong.  They could keep, you know, sort of melting up the stock market, rigging, manipulating central banks, buying up the stock market.  But, you know, it's like I joke around with people on my channel in the comments and with other comment sections around YouTube.  You know, eventually it's gonna be 10 super rich people in a room telling all of us how great the economy is, you know, and we're gonna be like, covered in dirt and rags going, hey, did you hear about that jobs report?  So yeah, just be ready for anything.  That's all I'm saying.  So thanks for watching this video.  I wish everybody out there a good day, good luck, and good golf, good tennis, or whatever makes you happy.  So take care.  See you on the next one. ",
