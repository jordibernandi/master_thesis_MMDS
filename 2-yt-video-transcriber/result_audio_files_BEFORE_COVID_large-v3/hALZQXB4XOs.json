            "text": "Good morning everyone around the world, Tina Spaulding, Trance Channel here with lesson number 45 of A Course in Miracles.  God is the mind with which I think.  Today's idea holds the key to what your real thoughts are.  They are nothing that you think you think, just as nothing that you think you see is related to vision in any way.  There is no relationship between what is real and what you think is real.  Nothing that you think are your real thoughts.  Nothing that you think are your real thoughts resemble your real thoughts in any way.  Nothing that you think you see bears any resemblance to what vision will show you.  You think with the mind of God, therefore you share your thoughts with him as he shares his with you.  They are the same thoughts because they are thought by the same mind.  To share is to make alike, or to make one.  Nor do the thoughts you think with the mind of God leave your mind, because thoughts do not leave their source. ",
