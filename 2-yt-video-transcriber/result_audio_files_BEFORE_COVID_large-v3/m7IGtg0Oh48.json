            "text": "A spray can was never made for art, but the children of the streets created a worldwide phenomenon.  I was born and raised on these streets.  Naturally, I was taught how to hold a spray can.  If it wasn't for Carmelo Alvarez, the majority of us would have ended up in prison.  Carmelo said, you can develop this into a life.  He saw a community that needed some sort of direction and started an actual cultural break youth center called Radiotron.  I was a little kid rolled up to the Radiotron right after being arrested for graffiti.  He welcomed me.  He was open.  He was loving.  He allowed kids to paint all the walls in the Radiotron.  I couldn't believe it.  I wouldn't have to be chased to paint.  For the last week, we've been working on a mural in honor of my mentor, Carmelo Alvarez.  Today, I am so excited to reconnect.  Carmelo is going to walk into Denny's thinking he's going to be interviewed about a mural that I'm doing, but it's going to flip around.  It's all about him.  And I'll be there waiting to surprise him. ",
