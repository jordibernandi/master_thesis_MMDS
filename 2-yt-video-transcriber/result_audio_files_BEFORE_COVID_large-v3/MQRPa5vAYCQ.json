And one of the statistics that Epstein had in his report, and I hadn't read the whole report, but I was just, I was looking through it the other day and he says that, you know, these suggestions is in regards to elections anyway, can turn a 50-50 split among undecided voters into a 90-10 split without people's awareness.  I mean, that's scary.  One of the things that you've brought up, you know, for me, one of the biggest, obviously the elections is a big one.  But it's the mind control.  It's altering people's perceptions that is directly affecting their decisions, not just with elections, but on a lot of fronts.  I mean, they're pushing some really disturbing agendas.  And one of the things I found really fascinating in, I know you've said this in some of your interviews, but for those who haven't heard it, can you explain the ASH experiment? ",

You come in and there's seven other people and you all sit down in a room.  Well, it turns out that the seven other people aren't also volunteers.  They're actually actors.  And their job is to give the wrong answer.  So there's an instructor.  The instructor goes up to the chalkboard and he writes like four lines on the chalkboard.  And he asks, you know, all the subjects, which line is like the largest, like A, B, C, or D. And each one of the actors will give the wrong answer.  Guess what happens to the regular subject?  What answer do they give? ",

I don't know if you ever saw that video circulating where it was in like a doctor's office and there were a couple of people sitting there and when they had this bell, like this bell go off in the background and when it would go off, one person stood up.  and it's like each time it went off, a person stood up.  So then the other people around them started standing up and And then as more people came in and sat down, they were doing the same thing.  And not one person questioned, what are we doing?  Why are we standing up?  They just follow the path.  It's really quite scary. ",

            "text": "Well, I mean, the thing is, is that to understand what YouTube and Google are doing, it's, It's interesting to know what Facebook is doing.  Facebook told us that our data was synchro-synched, that they didn't sell it, that they wouldn't sell it.  Then Cambridge Analytica happened, and then Investigation came in and audited a bunch of stuff, and it turned out that, oh yeah, they actually sold it to 68 different intelligence organizations.  Okay, so now what similar pattern do we see with Google and YouTube, right?  They say that they protect all of our information.  They say that they're, you know, protecting all of our data.  But, you know, we've got this famous saying in Silicon Valley, if the product is free, you're the product.  So the thing is, is that part of my disclosure is not any proof that Google is selling your data to multiple intelligence agencies, including China around the world.  But, but it's my opinion that that is a very, very likely thing that's happening.  In fact, if I was, if I was playing, you know, the table, I would say that this is better than Vegas odds that they're doing, you know, right.  And I would, I would put everything down that I had that they are actually you know, on the bet that they're doing this exact thing.  And then that comes in, well, you know, like I noticed that there's been some of their big clients like P&E have like slashed their advertising budget in half, you know, some years ago.  And Google didn't take a hit on their revenue.  Like it just kept on going up.  And it's been going up in sort of a really nice year over year, like exponential graph.  So the question that I have is, you know, what percent of that money is actually being fumbled in from intelligence consumers, you know, like the, like the former CIA and, you know, the, the, the country's equivalents of their CIAs, you know, like Mossad.  And I don't know what the Chinese intelligence organization is, but, you know, that would be a buyer of this.  Like how many of those, how much of their ad revenue is actually, you know, the revenue of selling your data? ",
