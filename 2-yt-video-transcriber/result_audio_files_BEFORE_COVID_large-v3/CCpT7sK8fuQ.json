            "text": "What's going on?  This is My Life in the Shop.  I'm your host, Donald Washington.  I'm going to bring you guys a story out of High Springs, Arkansas.  This happened at Simply Unique Beauty Supply Store.  The two young girls that you're going to see on the screen, this is 19-year-old Minaya Myers.  This young girl is 22-year-old Monteria Myers.  They're going to be shot in the back of the head.  Now, the story is going to read that allegedly the mother took these two young girls to confront another young girl at this beauty supply store that worked at the beauty supply store allegedly.  And the young girl that worked at the beauty supply store took out a gun and shot these two young girls in the back of the head.  The story is also going to read that the three of them jumped on this girl that worked at the beauty supply store allegedly.  However, I want to get into, I want to go a little bit deeper.  Now, the news is only, that's all the news is releasing, that they went up there, the girls got into a fight, an altercation.  I want to go to their social media, because I'm learning a lot from what people who know them, what they're saying.  I also want to get into, in 2019, The good and the bad of social media.  Because what's happening is a lot of people are beefing over social media.  And once you're publicly beefing, that intensifies the beef because everybody in the world is watching this.  Also, I also want to talk about a lot of our guilty pleasure on this reality TV.  It wasn't like this 10 years ago, 20 years ago, that a lot of these young girls are jumping on others.  You see a lot of these young girls are beefing, fighting in high schools, social media.  A lot of this fighting, beefing over boys.  It's a tragedy.  I'm going to bring you guys their social media and what people are saying over social media.  This is my life in the shot.  So now, I want to bring you guys to their Facebook page, what they're saying on social media.  Now, all this is hearsay.  Now, this is the young girl, Mania, Facebook page.  This is it here.  This is one of the young girls.  This is her Facebook page.  A lot of people are saying, rest in peace, love.  A lot of people are saying this is the mother, allegedly.  So I'm going through some of these posts and this is where I got this.  A lot of people saying what happened?  So sad.  The girl told them to come to her job to talk to her.  Told them that they could talk so they went up there.  Um, TF to fuck if your sister, brother, cousin, whoever got hit in the face the night before.  But listen to this.  This is just allegedly.  This is what's going on.  This is what people are saying on their Facebook page.  However, I'm going to read this off.  Ashley King.  These are the facts.  My best friend is best friends with Shorty and the Purple.  A lot of kids are best friends with best friends with best friends and told them whatever.  All right, now, they're saying the day before they were shot, the crazy B-I-T-C-H waited outside her ex-man's house from 8 p.m.  to 10 p.m.  in the morning.  Waited for the girl in the purple to come outside, and she hit the girl in the head with a rail.  She still has a scar and knot on her head.  Body from net.  She did all this over a young man.  This is the next day.  she text Shorty and said pull up to her shop so they could squash it with the Shorty's mother there too.  And of course that's not.  that's what she wanted to really do.  An altercation happened.  They all started fighting and shots went off.  them babies tried to run and she shot them both in the back of the heads.  these are facts.  is what this is saying.  now one thing as a parent you know we as adults and we as a people we have to understand that.  you know as an adult you know now that I'm older you know when I was younger and of course young kids don't think they don't understand the consequences behind stuff that they do because of course they're too young.  and once you get older The hardest thing to do is to walk away from an altercation.  Even as adults, even as an adult, I still get into confrontations that I want to solve with my fist.  Somebody tick me off, you know, somebody tick me off, say something, do something bogus.  The hardest thing to do as a man, I will pride, is to just walk away.  But when you get older, you think about the consequences and think about What can happen?  When I think about sitting in jail for the rest of my life over some BS, over something somebody didn't say, over somebody, some BS, something somebody did.  And that's all it takes is just sitting in that jail cell, just to think about sitting in that jail cell and just to walk away.  But as kids, they can't think about that.  As kids, you don't understand.  First thing to do is to squash it with your hands.  And as an adult, this is what adults are facing.  Do you let your child get bullied every day and get talked about and ran over?  Because if you don't confront a bully and let them fight it out, then that bully will continue to bully them.  So a lot of people are jumping on the mother saying she's a piece of this, that, and the other.  Let's continue to read some of these comments and I'm gonna come back to you guys with what the mother should have done or should not have done.  This is some of the stuff.  Somebody saying y'all B.I.T.C.  say she's a lion.  That don't even make sense.  Why in the F.U.C.  cave would she tell all three of them come up there and talk to her and it's just one of her?  She might have said something.  Y'all could come up here with that B.E.S.  if y'all want to, but it wasn't true.  Them B.I.T.C.s thought they were going to jump that girl, which they did.  They just wasn't counting on what would happen next, plain and simple.  Somebody said, so one of the sisters got pistol whipped, then came back with the mom and sister.  that led to both the sisters being killed.  Or was the sisters bullying the girl, pistol whipped the girl and showed up to the girl's job.  And then both the sisters and the girl killed both the sisters with the mom hopped in the car and then left them.  I still think the girls should be charged with manslaughter, first degree.  One, it's a work environment.  You killed them.  Second, if you pistol whipped one of the girls day before, now killed them both, yeah, you need the injection.  This is on their Facebook page.  One of the young girls... This is the other girl, the oldest girl, the 22-year-old girl's Monteria Myers.  This is her Facebook page.  These are some of the pictures.  Somebody said, all over a dude, black women got to do better.  Maybe the mother wanted to address the situation as a parent.  If my child is going through something, I am gonna defend my child and see what the fool is going on.  They arrived at the scene and the shooter did not want to resolve the issue.  So it put the parent and the daughters at risk.  So definitely shouldn't have her daughters, not at all.  And so that's what I want to talk about is, you know, These young girls are 22 and 19.  So they are grown.  The young girls are grown.  So if as a parent, I would say, hey, talk to the other parents.  However, the other young girl is probably grown.  If the oldest girl is 22, that's going through the beef over allegedly some young boy.  And they had a problem where the young girl, 22, got hit in the head with a stick.  You know, the mother probably did want to say, hey, let me go up here and see what's going on.  However, if it was a beef between the 22-year-old and this other young girl, let it go down on a one-on-one.  Because one thing that you know, if a bully is bullying another young girl, that bully is going to continue to bully them.  And so sometimes even if your young girl or whatever gets beat up, you've got to let them, whether it's a young boy or a young girl, you've got to let them squash it and let them know that I'm not going to run from a bully.  We don't know exactly what went on in this situation, but what people are furious about is that the mother took these two young girls to go up there and to confront the other... But once somebody's retreating, why would you grab a gun?  Whoever had the gun is a coward nonetheless.  And once the two young girls are retreating, you still should be charged because anytime when they're concealed to carry, you learn that once somebody is retreating, they are no longer a threat.  And you do not fear for your life and therefore should not fear for your life.  They're not a threat anymore.  You should not have shot these young girls.  This is an unfortunate tragedy all the way around.  all angles.  um the mother forever would have to live with herself and this decision forever she'll never be the same.  these beautiful two young girls would never be the same because they are never.  they're no longer with us.  um this family is grieving the loss of not just one or two babies, but two babies that are no longer with us.  We as a people must understand that you must think about the consequences first.  It is not worth it over some young boy.  There's going to be two beautiful little girls.  There's going to be hundreds, thousands of young boys fighting to be with you.  And today in age, we got this social media to where it's... And this love and hip-hop crap.  This social media.  We got this reality TV that are teaching our young girls.  Fight first.  What do you see on social media?  What do you see on reality TV shows?  Girl, I'm going to beat that.  These are grown women.  Grown women in their 30s, in their 40s that are still fist fighting.  This is why I say take... There was a moral police.  I think it was Nigeria.  It was an African country.  As soon as somebody did something, they don't let that ride on their TV.  It's freedom of speech, yes.  But they said, okay, if you're a celebrity and you get on your social media twerking, showing your behind and fighting... You cut off.  You cut off.  No more shows, no more nothing.  There's a moral police and you are morally correct because what you see is what you become.  We need to, what you can do yourself that's watching this, your part is this.  You can stop watching this, condoning this behavior.  By watching this reality TV, we contribute to this growing problem.  We contribute, and I'm guilty of it too, of watching this reality TV shows of these grown women fighting, not talking their beef out.  for fighting their beef out.  And these young girls from this music, reality TV show, and social media pick up this bad behavior.  They emulate this bad behavior.  They become this bad behavior.  Anyway, I want you guys to like, comment.  This is my motto here.  We must take back our communities with what's right.  Stop watching this reality TV shows.  We have to do it ourselves.  Our children are dying on these streets.  This is my motto here.  How long are you going to cry and blame your oppressor before you get up off your knees?  Yes, we must take back our streets, take back our youth, get rid of this stupid music that's talking about.  kill this person, that person, Israeli TV shows, monitor your children's social media and the message we send on social media.  If we send a message of go shoot them, bang, bang, shoot them up, that's what our children will become and do.  Anyway, like, subscribe, let me know what you think about this video.  Peace, peace.  Thank you. ",
