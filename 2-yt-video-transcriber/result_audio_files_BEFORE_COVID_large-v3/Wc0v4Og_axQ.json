            "text": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Brad.  If you're watching another epic, amazing, awesome episode of the Unboxing Authority.  On this episode of your day, we have a digital clamp meter.  We're going to show you how to use it.  Now, if you go to the link in the description of this video, I believe there is a DC only and AC-DC model of this product.  That's why I opened this before we got started today.  I wanted to see what model I got.  So here we go, this was sent to me.  We get two batteries included, that's important, two AAA batteries.  It looks like here we've got some voltage probes and then also possibly a temperature probe.  I'm not sure what this is here.  We've got this wonderful case that zips up right here.  It also has Cat 3 protection.  It appears that you will need a screwdriver to install the included batteries.  Just remove the screw from the back.  Back panel pops right out.  There we go.  We've got our batteries installed.  We'll replace the back.  Alright, so now we've got our batteries installed to turn this on.  We've got several features here.  So you have to hold down this button and get it into NCV mode.  Then when you put it up to anything that's got AC flowing through it, it's going to say H for hot.  and it's gonna beep at you and let you know that there's electricity present.  And this clamp fits right around a lot of wires.  The temperature probe shows that it's about 57 degrees in here.  In the video studio right now, it actually feels a lot colder than that.  If I grab the end of the temperature probe to warm it up, you'll see that it starts climbing up to about 75, 77, 79, 80, it keeps climbing, and that's in Fahrenheit.  If we hit our function button, it changes over to Celsius, and it's saying that my hand's about 26 degrees Celsius.  Here we go, we're gonna test voltage here, so we're gonna put our battery, our AAA battery between the two contacts here.  It says 1.586 volts, and it says DC on the side.  Now I'm gonna hit function and make sure it's on AC mode.  And we're gonna try it on AC.  And it's reading at 128 volts AC.  And it's turned red to indicate that it is dangerous, that this voltage is dangerous to touch.  Now we're gonna try to measure the amperage of this furnace.  Turn our backlight on by pushing this button.  We got it in 600 amp AC mode.  And we're just gonna put it around one of these.  Okay, that's 21 amps right there.  Let's see if we can get it around two of them.  Not getting zapped here.  You should have some electrical gloves on or something for this.  There we go.  Okay, it shows we're using 23 amps to drive this furnace right now, which isn't bad considering, you know.  I don't know what'll happen if we put it around the negative.  We'll put it around the negative here.  And it shows 23 amps on the negative.  23 amps on the positive, so we know that just as many amps are going out as going in.  Also, in addition to having the backlit screen, if you hold this light button down long enough, you get a handy flashlight as well.  So you can see exactly what you're working on.  Now we're gonna test continuity.  So you can turn it to dial to right here.  And then what you do is you just tell it function until you see the speaker on the screen.  and when we touch these two together we get a noise.  I'm going to touch this screwdriver right here And that shows us that there is voltage that can run through there.  And it's telling us there's no resistance, which is why it's lighting up red.  So as you can see, it has a whole bunch of functions.  It also has this low Z function down here.  Low Z works in AC or DC mode.  And it also checks continuity.  But it also is very careful not to send too much power through sensitive components.  electronics when it's testing them so it doesn't blow anything up.  So for sensitive electronics you want to use your low Z-mode.  You see there it's showing resistance and then when I put a touch of them together it's showing no resistance.  This is once again a tool that no man should be without.  So please click the link in the description of the video and pick one of these up today.  So go get yourself a Kyowitz HT206B multimeter here with the volt clamp, amp clamp, and you will be able to do all kinds of things and troubleshoot all kinds of problems.  And I plan on using this in a future video or maybe not a video, I don't know.  where I am going to be diagnosing a problem with another product that I got to review to see if I can fix it or not.  So make sure you get one of these and link the description of the video.  And please watch all of the advertisements from all of my sponsors.
