            "text": "I think there are cult leaders who most of them are these kind of malignant narcissists.  They have zero empathy.  They seem like they do.  They know how to pretend that they care, but they're amazing and they have this sort of charisma.  And then there are these other cult leaders who are just crazy people who are also charismatic and draw people into their psychosis.  They're kind of strange beliefs.  I called it sort of akin to this folie a deux, this shared psychosis.  that is an actual diagnosis.  And then other ones who started out as just regular leaders or community leaders or spiritual leaders and then morph into someone who is very dangerous, sort of a la the Jim Jones of the world.  And so, yes, I met a man who believed that we were all aliens.  His name is Rael.  He still runs the group, the Raelians.  Raelians, yes. ",

            "text": "He's an odd bird.  But what was fascinating about him was, I mean, my little, very little interaction with him was that he put his hand on my head.  I went to go check him out because I had some clients who had lost their kids to this group, and he was having a meeting at a local hotel.  so i went to go meet him if i could and i did.  i said i wanted to talk to him and that there were families who were suffering because their children had gotten caught up in this.  and could he help?  um He put his hand on my head and then he compared me to the height of Jesus, which was, you know, unexpected.  And so I knew why he was doing that and why he was doing that in front of people.  It was to make people believe that he had met him.  So I said, oh, are you are you letting me know you've met him?  And he said, well, of course.  So that was interesting. ",

            "text": "Right.  And I said, well, I'm sure you've met many people.  And he said, yes, Buddha and Moses and a lot of other heavy hitters.  But even though he had his arms out, he had these flowing robes, and he seemed so kind of gentle and serene, when I asked if he could help these families... And if he could reach out to these people who had been pulled away into this group, he then kind of floated away.  He suddenly turned with his robes falling him and he just, you know, walked away like he just didn't care.  And so I think that was really kind of fascinating that here he was so interested in kind of making an impression on me.  And when he thought he could, he really liked me.  And as soon as I was asking him to do something, really take responsibility, he was gone.  I met, well, I was in the room with a man who used to run a group based on Jewish mysticism.  And he has since passed.  But he also had this sort of fatherly or grandfatherly presence.  And he was coming down the stairs of this house where he was running some of the meetings.  And he missed a step and stumbled a bit.  Everyone went running to catch him.  And I thought that he, according to sort of how spiritual and mystical he is, he would be grateful.  But instead, he kind of looked at everybody, scowled, and then everyone kind of looked down.  And I said to the person who had invited me, what's happening?  And they said, well, we believe in energy.  And if... Because he's perfect, because he missed a step, there's somebody in this room that caused that with their negative energy.  And negative energy could be that they just doubted him for a moment.  So everyone kind of looked inward to see if they had caused it.  That was fascinating.  It was fascinating also to see the group dynamic, the social pressure to take responsibility for things.  kind of endlessly.  that were just not your doing, that were not your fault, but also that the rules only apply to the followers, not to the leader, right?  He doesn't have to take responsibility for what he's doing to anyone else and how many lives I think that he was destroying, but everyone else, the people lower down have to take responsibility for everything, including him.  And then I also met someone who called herself a gypsy mom.  And this was quite disturbing, actually.  There are some people who are in families that are considered to be gypsies.  And I know that that's not, you know, the most politically correct word to use it, but I'm just using it because that's what they called themselves.  And I think originally Romany and part of the gypsy circuit of people. ",

            "text": "Okay, so this particular family was running a couple of different shops, palm readings, tarot cards, all of it.  And the woman who became my client went into one of the stores, got her palm read, and they asked her her name.  Her last name was the same as somebody famous, so they assumed that she was part of this famous family, which she was not.  But they assumed then if they kind of used her, they could extort money from her family, which the family did not have.  So they just hung on to her as an indentured servant and convinced her that she had to kind of work for them in order to be safe.  She had to give up her life.  She was sleeping on the floor.  They sometimes drugged her.  It was really a bad situation for a long time, made her very messed up.  It was in an attempt as they had convinced her to keep her parents alive, who she was very close to.  And this gypsy mom said she could see that something was terribly wrong with the parents.  The parents had called the police.  They said that their daughter now was a missing person because they couldn't find her for a period of time.  And then they wound up this gypsy mom and this daughter wound up in a mall actually in Los Angeles.  And I was called by security to come because I was a name listed if this person showed up.  And the police were called and the police protected the gypsy mom actually from us.  It was so disturbing.  They made a line between us and them.  and the parents showed up as well.  They hadn't seen their daughter in years.  And the police who really don't know how to handle these situations. ",

            "text": "Yes.  It's more than frustrating.  It's devastating.  It was devastating for the family.  It was enough where the clerks in the store were disturbed to see this very tough woman really dragging this other girl around and having the girl be the one to open up new lines of credit, to buy things for her.  that she just wanted to get new clothes and she wanted to get new things for her house and she was using this girl to do it.  And yeah, the police showed up and they said, is this girl over 18?  And the girl said that she was.  She looked very dazed.  She didn't know what was going on.  And the police said, that's all we need to know.  And they formed a line.  The gypsy mom carried her away.  It was years before the parents found her again.  Parents just fell to the ground in the middle of this.  It was in the parking garage by the security office, crying, crying, crying.  It was really horrible.  And in fact, now I have this girl as a client.  And she said.  in that moment, she felt hopeless because even though she still believed something bad would happen to her parents, that had gotten under her skin.  She thought, oh, my goodness, if the police are here, that confirms for me, right, taking in the evidence of your senses, that confirms for me that something that is happening to me is actually wrong.  And maybe I'm right about that.  And then suddenly when the police protected her and the gypsy mom, she said, that's it.  My life is over.  I'm stuck here forever.  So I think police don't realize how much they are devastating the people in those situations and making them feel hopeless.  I love you. ",
