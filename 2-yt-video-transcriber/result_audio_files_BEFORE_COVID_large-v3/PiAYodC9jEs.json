Manafort did receive money from Yankovic, tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of his Ukraine work.  This is from the text of an indictment filed by Robert Mueller.  And Manafort pled guilty that he laundered funds.  These funds evaded taxes on him.  and also served as a lobbyist for this guy without registering.  I mean, these are why he's in prison, uh, right now he's got seven and a half years of, of prison.
