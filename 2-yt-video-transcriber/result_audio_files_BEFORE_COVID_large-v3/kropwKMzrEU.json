            "text": "Oh, I say it, I say it again.  You've been had, you've been took, you've been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amok.  Shalom family.  In the words of Malcolm X, I say, I say again, you've been had, you've been took, you've been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amok, And who has been doing all this?  lying and manipulating?  I'll tell you who.  The prophecy pimps.  Prophecy pimps are individuals who take advantage of people's desire for the kingdom to come.  who take advantage of the people's pain and suffering wanting this present wicked kingdom to come to an end and for the kingdom of the Most High to come to be.  They take advantage of people's hopes by filling them up with false hope.  These are individuals who set false dates that never come to pass.  These are individuals that every time there's a breaking news of rumors of war or anything of that nature, they get people pumped up, hyped up, telling them that something is about to happen next week, next month, setting dates, getting people hyped, And then when these things don't come to pass that they predicted or alluded to, people are left with disappointment.  People are left with false expectations.  People are left with their hopes dashed.  And it's so to the point where some people will begin to doubt the most time because of these prophecy pimps getting them hyped up only to be disappointed.  Let's take, for instance, this whole 2019 thing.  The prophecy pimps got people all hyped up, especially in the Hebrew community.  That in 2019, the chariots of the most high was going to come pick you up.  That all the tribes was going to be regathered.  Babylon was going to fall.  All these false hopes and expectations that they painted for 2019.  Yet here we are halfway through and none of the prophecies materialized.  The same scenarios that have been playing themselves out.  Folks getting shot up by the police.  Debates, arguments, division.  All these things are still going on.  But the prophecy pimps got these people so hyped up that this year they'd be in the wilderness.  The chariots was going to come get them.  All the tribes was going to be regathered.  None of that took place, family.  I say, I say again, you've been had, you've been took, you've been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amok.  And by who?  The prophecy pimps.  The people who take advantage of individuals, lack of knowledge, lack of understanding and being naive.  They take advantage of that.  And it pains me to see our people fall for it over and over and over and over again.  When will we get to the point where we use discernment, where we use wisdom, where we study to show ourselves approved?  When will we get to the point as a people where we heed the words of the Most High that no man knows the day nor the hour?  When will we heed the words of the Messiah when he said that in those days many false prophets would come saying the Messiah is here, the Messiah is there, or it's going to happen at this time, it's going to happen at that time.  When will we heed the words of the Messiah?  When will we learn?  I honestly don't know, family.  That's why I'm just here to say that those of us who are striving to be that remnant, we must endure.  We must simply endure and keep going.  And please stop letting the prophecy pimps get you pumped up and hyped up.  Every time there's some breaking news about wars or rumors of war.  Now they got you thinking that everything's going to go down next week.  That, you know, this month, this is it.  The father coming this month is over this month.  All this sensationalism and hype.  is causing people to fall away from the path.  Because they get disappointed day in, day out, time and time again by these prophecy pimps who come up with all these videos, not showing their face with all the spooky doomsday music playing Telling people that everything's going to pop off next week.  Everything is going to pop off next month.  This is it.  This is it.  This is the major thing we've been waiting for.  It's all about to go down, Israel.  This is it.  The father coming next week.  And people eat it up only to end up getting disappointed.  I say, I say again, you've been had, you've been took, you've been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amok.  When will we learn, family?  When will we learn?  Wait on the Most High, endure to the end, focus on putting in work for the Father, Manifesting fruit so that when the Messiah does return, he says to you, well done, thou good and faithful servant.  You multiplied the talents that I put in your hand.  You did the work.  You visited the orphan and the widow.  You ministered to the least of these.  You baptized.  You cast out demons.  You did my work.  You even gave a drink to one of the least of these my followers.  You did my work.  Enter into the kingdom.  That should be our focus.  Not setting dates, not getting caught up in false doomsday prophecies, not getting caught up in all these horror movies that these spooky false prophets, prophecy pimps are putting out.  Focus on bearing fruit for the Father.  That's all I wanted to say for now, family, because some will learn, some won't.  Just wanted to come, you know, show my face and say shalom to all the people.  All praise to the Most High.  We have arrived in Georgia safely.
