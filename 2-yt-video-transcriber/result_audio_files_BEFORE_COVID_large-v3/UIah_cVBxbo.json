            "text": "Actress Ellen Page, who thankfully I've never heard of but I did recognize from her minor role in Inception, is being celebrated by the liberal media for bravely doubling down on her criticism of celebrities who are Christians and go to church.  In response to Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt openly talking about his spirituality in recent interviews, Ellen Page took to Twitter to say, quote, If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don't be surprised if someone simply wonders why it's not addressed.  Being anti-LGBTQ is wrong.  There aren't two sides.  After the Hollywood Reporter posted about his fasting and spiritual side, she responded saying, Okay, um, but his church is infamously anti-LGBTQ.  so maybe address that too.  Excuse me, Ms.  Page, stop bullying Chris Pratt for going to church.  We have freedom of religion in this country.  Aside from not liking the free speech part of the First Amendment, liberals are also upset that it prevents the government from prohibiting us from exercising our religion.  Here's CNN's John King raising the question about whether or not Vice President Pence's wife should have Secret Service protection paid for by tax dollars since she's volunteering at a Christian school a couple days a week As a teacher.

They're calling the Christian school an anti-LGBT school because, well, they believe in the Bible.  Her volunteering at the Christian school caused the hashtag Expose Christian Schools to become one of the top trends on Twitter from so many liberal lunatics losing their minds.  Lady Gargoyle joined in on the fun calling Mike Pence the worst representation of a Christian and then CNN decided to declare that Christianity's future looks more like Lady Gaga than Mike Pence.  I'm glad that the network that's encouraging people to rethink monogamy is deciding who is and isn't a good representation of a Christian.  Yes, it looks like another wave of Christian phobia is sweeping across the country.  It wasn't that long ago that the Benham brothers got their show canceled from HGTV simply because they are Christians.  And let's not forget that it wasn't that long ago that the founder of Mozilla, the company behind the popular Firefox internet browser, was forced out of his own company into unemployment because he didn't support gay marriage.  This is a scene from the film version of George Orwell's 1984, depicting Winston Smith hiding in the corner, writing in his journal so that Big Brother can't see him, and this is gonna be us reading from our Bibles in the future.  as this madness continues to unfold.  You're overreacting, Mark Dice.  Nobody wants to try to ban the Bible. ",
