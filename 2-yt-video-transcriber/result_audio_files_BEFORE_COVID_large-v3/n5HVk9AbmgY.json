            "text": "The Book of Sirach, Chapter 4.  My child, don't keep poor people from making a living or tease needy people.  Don't make hungry people resentful or infuriate those in poverty.  Don't add to the troubles of people who are desperate or wait to give handouts to beggars.  Don't reject the pleas of those in distress or turn away from poor people.  Don't look away from beggars or give people a reason to curse you.  If someone curses you out of bitterness, his creator will hear his prayer.  Be popular in the assembly.  Show respect to important people.  Listen to poor people and be polite and kind when you answer them.  Rescue a victim from someone who is doing wrong.  Don't hesitate to give a just verdict.  Be like a father to orphans and help their mothers as a husband would.  Then you would be like a child of the Most High YAH, and He will love you more than your mother does.  Wisdom helps her children rise to greatness and helps those who look for her.  Whoever loves her loves life.  Those who look for her early in the morning are filled with joy.  Whoever holds onto her tightly receives honor.  Yah blesses whatever place she enters.  Those who serve her serve the Holy One.  Yah loves those who love her.  Those who obey her will judge nations.  and all who devote themselves to her will live securely.  If they remain faithful, she will belong to them and their descendants will continue to hold onto her.  At first, she will lead them on winding paths.  She will bring them fear and dread and will exhaust them with her discipline.  She will test them according to her standards until she trusts them.  Then she'll come straight back to them and make them happy.  She'll reveal her secrets to them.  If they wander, she will abandon them and hand them over to be destroyed.  Take advantage of opportunities, but guard against evil.  Don't be ashamed to be yourself.  One kind of disgrace leads to sin, but another kind leads to honor and favor.  Don't harm your own reputation by playing favorites.  Don't be intimidated because that can lead to your downfall.  Don't remain silent when one word can make things right.  Don't hide your wisdom.  Wisdom becomes known through speaking and knowledge is spread by word of mouth.  Never contradict the truth.  Instead, be ashamed of your ignorance.  Don't be ashamed to confess your sins.  Don't try to swim against the river's current.  Don't become a fool's doormat.  Don't flatter a ruler.  If you fight to the death for truth, then Yah, your Elohim, will fight for you.  Don't be bold when you speak or lazy and sluggish when you take action.  Don't be like a lion in your own home or suspicious of your servants.  Don't hold out your hands when you want something, yet be tight-fisted when you should give something. ",
