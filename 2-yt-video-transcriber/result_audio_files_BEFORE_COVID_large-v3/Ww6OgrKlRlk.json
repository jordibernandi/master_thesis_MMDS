            "text": "At the end of June 2019, a shark team went to Virginia with drones fitted with eye magnification cameras.  This video is the first in a series exposing covance and its massive dog breeding facility located in Cumberland, Virginia.  The beagles you are looking at are destined to be experimented on.  We will discuss that experimentation in more detail in future videos.  Our drones allowed us an unprecedented view of the miserable conditions to which these beagles were subjected.  In this and future videos, we will show the public the victims of Covance's cruelty and will call for major reforms.  Many cages at Covance were overfilled with dogs who were clearly under incredible stress.  Some dogs exhibit severe aggression to more docile animals.  There were many displays of dominance as the animals desperately tried to sort out pack hierarchy in this unnatural and overcrowded environment.  We recorded dogs exhibiting repetitive behavior, also called stereotypic behavior, such as mindlessly walking in circles over and over.  Stereotypic behavior is an indicator of serious problems with the mental state of an animal or person relative to their environment.  Many cages were riddled with feces and urine.  You can see the urine stains on the concrete.  There was heartbreaking and near endless barking and screeching in the facility.  This is what a day at Covant sounds like.  Covance is owned by LabCorp.  LabCorp is ultimately responsible for the cruelty and inhumane conditions you see.  A LabCorp document titled LabCorp Corporate Responsibility Report states the following.  The provision of good welfare is more than just the avoidance of pain and distress.  It must also provide an appropriate quality of life for the animals in our care.  In addition, the animal environment supports exercise, social housing, and material for nest making or appropriate bedding, and supplies sufficient food, water, chew sticks, and other provisions specifically tailored for the animals in our care.  Those are just words, which obviously do not reflect the reality of this hellhole.  Covance and LabCorp have failed their promised standards.  This environment does not support exercise, but instead crams too many dogs into too small of an area.  Their feet will never touch the lush surrounding.  For dogs in the inner counties, they can't see anything but more miserable prisoners just like themselves.  This is not social housing.  It is warehousing of living beings.  Covance and LabCorp are not avoiding stress to these animals.  They have, in fact, created a facility where stress is endemic and dogs sit in their own fill.  This should be absolutely unacceptable to every decision maker at Covance and LabCorp, but clearly it isn't.  That needs to change.  Shark is sending this video, along with a letter, to LabCorp to request a meeting to discuss this horrendous situation.  please contact LabCorp and respectfully ask that they meet with us very soon.  Covance calls these animals research products, as if they were inanimate objects no different than a syringe or bandage to be used and then thrown away.  The truth is, each and every one of these animals is an individual, living, feeling being, who is no different than the dogs that we call families.  Thank you. ",
