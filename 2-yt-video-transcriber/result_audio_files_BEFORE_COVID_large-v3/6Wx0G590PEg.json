I'll give some like mild examples.  You know, obviously a kid is injured.  That's just heart-wrenching and it is very traumatic for a lot of people to handle.  I'll give you another example of somebody who's 80 years old.  Obviously, they were vaccinated all of their life.  They got all these flu shots throughout their life.  And this particular client got recently another flu shot.  It's called high-dose flu shot.  We give it for people who are 65 and above.  Apparently, I think the dose is much higher than the regular flu shot that you give for adults and kids.  And after he got that in the next two weeks, he became profoundly weak.  He could not get out of the bed.  And this particular client was able to walk and do everything independently before he got the flu shot.  So the family shared with me while I was interviewing the client that this is what happened and they're suspecting maybe it's from the shot.  So we see those examples day in and out every day.  But those never get reported.  And I don't even know what happens if they get reported, if it's actually documented somewhere.  And I'm pretty open to that.  And I notice and then I make a note of that.  But the regular doctors, they are so against that particular belief that they somehow believe that vaccines are all good.  They brush it off, say that, you know, his fatigue is from old age or some other problem.  Although chronologically it clearly shows that the client became profoundly weak right after getting the shot.  Obviously in kids, you know, there are so many examples where the kid gets the shot and three weeks later they become weak or they have seizures or immediately right after the shot they have fever.  And now it has become so common that kids are getting fever right after the shot that they go and tell the nurse to give Tylenol with the shot.  They create a protocol around that.  That's awesome.  And yeah. ",
