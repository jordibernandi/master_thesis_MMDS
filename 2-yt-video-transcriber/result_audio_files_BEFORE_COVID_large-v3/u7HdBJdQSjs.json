            "text": "Sheila Gunn-Reed for Rebel News.  I'm here at the Alberta Legislature, and just behind me, the climate march is wrapping up.  Now, this march was organized by Swedish teenage climate activist and incidental foreign election meddler Greta Thunberg.  She took to the stage about an hour and a half late, somewhere near about 1.30.  But The march ended here.  It didn't begin here.  It began up the road a few blocks away at Beaver Hills Park where thousands of climate marchers organized themselves to march over here to the legislature grounds and I was there with the How Dare You?  truck, the How Dare You?  billboard truck to greet the climate marchers, although they didn't really know I was there.  I was there alone, so I didn't want to invite any additional attention to myself.  But the truck did circle the marchers, and I don't think they appreciated it.  I did wander through the crowd a little bit, and I wanted to take in some of the sights and sounds and incidentally smells.  of the climate marchers.  There was a heavy Marxist presence there.  The Marxists are trying to fight duly elected Premier Jason Kenney by selling books for four dollars.  Yeah, they're fighting Marxism with capitalism.  I also encountered a little bit of racism.  There was one young lady who seemed to be organizing the protest and she wanted all the white people at the back.  Just watch.  Can we get white folks to walk around?  now when we finally made it over here to the legislature um the climate marchers were greeted by the good folks from united we rule who on very short notice organized a truck convoy to the legislature.  um so the climate marchers had to chant over the sounds of horns honking.  And I ran into some of the good folks from United We Roll on the legislature grounds here and I asked them why they would come to greet Greta on such unwelcome territory.  Just watch.  There are a lot of people down that hill who are here because they oppose oil and gas.  But you guys are ready to walk into the belly of the beast.  Why?  Why?  Why would you do this? ",
