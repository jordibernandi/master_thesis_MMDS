But far more important than the dating, again, this creed makes absolutely no mention whatsoever of a tomb, and thereby cannot attest to a tomb, no matter when it was created.  Most Christians don't like to think about the fact that Mark wasn't an eyewitness, and was instead merely writing down traditions that became common in the community.  So... Kudos to Craig here for acknowledging this reality.  But his extremely early characterization of this hypothetical source is based even less on evidence and more on what he wants to be true than that 1 Corinthians creed we just spoke about was.
