So recently on our live show, we did a segment about how some women were mad at Tim Pool for saying that he wouldn't want to date a woman who works 16 hours a day like he does.  And based on what I saw on social media, It was especially career women in their 30s who, I'm guessing, are single who took issue with what Tim said.  If you haven't seen the live show or that segment, I recommend you check it out.  But today we are continuing on that same theme because I've discovered even more articles on the subject and I just have so much more to say about it.  Recently, a piece in the Wall Street Journal came out that was the exact same.  men poor, women suffer most BS as the article that Tim originally responded to.  It's called A Good Man is Getting Even Harder to Find, and it's actually written by a man, Gerard Baker.  who, throughout the entire article, displays what I can only unironically describe as internalized misandry.  You see, it's no secret that women are hypergamous.  They tend to date men of equal or greater social and financial standing as themselves.  Rarely do they date... downward.  And I'm not saying this is what I want to happen or that I think this is what women should do.  This is just objectively how it is.  And the reason why this is now becoming an issue for some women is that, despite what the feminists may tell you, there are plenty of women out there who make way more than your average man does.  Hence all of these articles lamenting how there are no dateable, i.e.  richer guys out there anymore.  But if it's true, and it is true, that dating-aged men are struggling financially, especially when compared to women their same age, then it is somewhat strange to focus on how that problem affects women and their dating preferences, rather than the issue of men falling behind in education and even some workplace environments.  Frankly, it seems pretty narcissistic for a woman to acknowledge that men her own age aren't doing so well, but only care about it insofar as it affects her own desire to date someone who is richer than she is.  In any case though, as the article says, quote, \"...the gender imbalance in education attainment is getting larger every year.  That may spell good news ultimately for income and employment  equality.\".  but it presses increasingly problematic social conditions for generations of men and women.  According to the US Department of Education, more than 57% of the class of 2018 who graduated with bachelor's degrees were female.  The gap for master's degrees was even wider, 59% to 41%.  I'm sorry, but you do not get to call yourself an equality advocate if you're actually cheering for the growing gender imbalance in education.  There are so few men graduating from college nowadays.  It's just, ugh, it's great.  This is exactly why the whole notion that feminism is about equality is horse crap.  People who care about equality don't celebrate when one group is becoming more and more marginalized.  And never mind that, but I don't ever want to hear someone say that women are discriminated against in the education system because we're clearly not.  We are kicking boys' butts academically, and no, it's not because girls are smarter.  Men and women do tend to excel in different academic fields, but overall the average IQ of men and women is the same.  But what's happening is that there is an overall imbalance in academic achievement because our entire education system was designed by females to cater to females because boys and girls do not learn in the same ways.  But I digress, and Baker continues.  Quote, this gender imbalance has existed since 1981, when more women than men graduated for the first time, and it's widened just about every single year since then.  In fact, the department estimates that by 2027, women will account for about 60% of all bachelor's degrees awarded.  Now from the perspective of economic justice and equity, we can surely stipulate that this is progress.  It may be the most tangible piece of evidence of a fundamental change in sexual equality since women were given the vote.  If education really is the key to lifetime earning potential, then slowly, perhaps steadily, we can expect the gap in pay and opportunities to narrow.  That doesn't make any sense.  The gender wage gap is not due to women not being educated enough.  As Baker himself points out, more women than men have graduated from university since 1981.  It's been like 40 years.  It's kind of bold to keep pushing this narrative that women are some oppressed class in our society when you've literally just outlined how much more educated they are than men.  I mean, would you be willing to support the complete takeover of women by universities?  Just no men getting degrees at all?  Not allowed. ",
