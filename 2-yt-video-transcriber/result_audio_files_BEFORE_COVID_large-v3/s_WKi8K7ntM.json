            "text": "hey guys alex here.  so remember how women were told that they could have it all an education a career a loving husband and kids.  well turns out that the reality is far from the truth.  an article which i'm going to address today specifically is titled i'm burnt out.  i'm tired why some young women don't see motherhood as realistic.  So, over the last 6 years, Rachel has thrown everything towards building the career of her dreams.  But becoming an architect is tough and despite having completed her studies, she has a 2 year registration process ahead of her.  Quote, at a minimum, it's seven years to graduate and become registered, but most people do it in around 10, she says.  By the time you've registered, you're in your late 20s, early 30s.  Often, it comes down to the question of, do I get registered or do I start a family?  The 26-year-old says with such a late start, taking a break early in her career to have children may not be realistic.  Quote, I'm burned out.  I'm tired.  And to think now I have a registration process ahead of me that may take two years.  And on top of that, whether my partner and I want to start a family, it definitely plays into the worry of what the next 10 years look like.  And this is not an old girl.  You know, she's still quite young, guys.  This is a lot of women out there who want to build a career.  They just literally burn themselves out.  They are burning themselves from both directions.  And this is the end result.  Quote, if you're going to take a year off work, it inevitably puts something on the back burner and often that's a career progression.  Particularly if you spend a hell of a lot of a long time and a lot of effort to get to the point where you've registered.  Rachel's husband, Daniel, says the supportive role he has played has been the hardest and kindest thing he has ever had to do.  Quote, it's been really hard to watch Rach jump through the hoops over the last six years, Daniel says.  It has stretched her, broken her and shaped her.  I do worry about the after-effects of this long-term sustained stress.  Like Rachel, 62% of the 25-29-year-olds said in the Australia's Talks Natural Survey work-life balance was a problem for them.  Young women have also told the ABC that they feel pressure to raise up the career ladder before they risk being set back by maternity leave and parenting responsibilities.  Taking time out of the workforce means that often workplaces forget about that person.  While they're out of sight, they're also out of mind, says Kate Lee from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.  Ms Lee says this has created a trend of young professional women being overworked and burnt out.  Almost half of women told the Australia Talks National Survey career opportunities were a problem for them compared with 40% of men.  Psychologist and career counselor Tina Papadakos says concerns about motherhood are a common predicament for young women.  Quote, I think there is a lot of fear around what it will be like with this life change.  How will this impact on the career I've really worked hard to build?  It's a whole lot of unknowns.  When people have sustained stress, it can lead to burnout.  It's important to recognize and identify when you're feeling disengaged, when you're working incredibly hard and always chasing your tail and never feeling like it's good enough.  And you've got to try and look at it.  Is this the expectation of the organization or is it self-imposed?  Am I a perfectionist?  Am I expecting too much of myself?  And I have to address something important here, guys.  essentially when women are told they need to build up their career what they do and they're building up is a job a job that essentially pays the bills pays the rent or on other occasions mortgage because let's face it you can't really buy houses days anymore like in sydney australia.  an average crappy house is about 1 million australian dollars which is about 700 000 us.  so not many people can afford to buy that on one salary unless they are a celebrity or a movie star or a sports star who makes you know, $300,000, $400,000 a year.  and that's not the norm.  Most people in Australia sit around, you know, anywhere between $50,000 to $100,000 a year and you can never buy a property on that salary for yourself.  So, what essentially these women are left with is not a career.  When I hear the word career, I think of someone who has such a great paying job, a career, whatever you want to call it, or a business is when they drive a nice luxury Mercedes four-wheel drive or some kind of a sporty Mercedes on during the weekdays and then on weekends they drive their Ferrari or Lamborghini.  They have not one but two or three holiday houses, each worth about a million dollars each.  somewhere far away and they live in a mansion or in some kind of a really fancy apartment in the inner city.  Now that's what I would call a career.  They also fly around in business class every week or at least once a month.  In reality, most of these women who end up with careers and just earning a measly salary that helps to pay the bill and they can never get ahead.  and by the time they realize this is all a joke that they're chasing their own tail and they can never catch up to it is they get too old and they realize that they wasted the best years of their life essentially on a deadbeat job that doesn't even get them anywhere.
