And along with that, as explanations for things are found that don't require God did it... there are less and less things that require his input.  the idea of a god becomes less and less relevant until most things can be explained by natural laws and even the things that we don't know for sure.  we have some pretty good ideas that again don't require god did it but likely just one or two more pieces of the puzzle for us to understand it.
