            "text": "Christian Christian.  today I'm going to discuss the prophetic financial freedom and the prophetic wealth transfer.  there's been a lot of speculation over the years a lot of teachings that have taught about a great wealth transfer during the last day and one of the things that I'm going to bring to you today is the one Christian prophet who has prophesied this on more than several different occasions and has also prophesied events leading up to that as well.  now this video is dedicated to the Prophet Kim Clement.  he's passed away now but some of the things that I'm going to show you some of the things that he said you need to listen.  there is a prophetic wealth transfer coming now.  the Prophet Kim Clement has prophesied many, many different things that have come to pass over and over and over.  Everything from September 11th to President Obama to President Trump, Hurricane Katrina, and many, many other events well before they happened.  Now, there is a wealth transfer coming, and there is just one part to this wealth transfer, but it does come at a cost.  Now, I'm going to explain things a little bit more deeper.  after you listen to what The great prophet Kim Clement has said, many of you have been waiting and waiting and waiting, but there is an opportunity and you have to take the opportunity.  But like I said, it does come at a cost.  Now the one part of this great wealth transfer does deal with the country of Iraq and it does deal with their currency of the dinar.  After I show you seven minutes of Kim Clement's prophecies concerning the wealth transfer, I'll come back and explain a little bit more.  But listen to what the prophet has said.  Prophetic financial freedom and the prophetic wealth transfer.  God does speak to his prophets.  There are prophets of today.  Whether you believe that or not, this is going to happen and this is coming.  If many of the things that he has said have come to pass, then this is one thing that you definitely need to listen to.  Some of you have been praying and waiting for an opportunity to an opportunity to have an investment, but this is just one part of the wealth transfer.  After I show you this seven minutes of Kim Clement's prophecies, I will be back. ",

Well, there's some of it I can't share now, of course, but 2002 is when I saw this huge thing happening because of something that would happen between America and China, funny enough, but that would take place.  And then I saw that eight years ago, and then... as a result of that I saw the surrender of masses of wealth coming from the East to the United States of America and the West.  And I didn't understand it.  And of course today a lot of prophecy teachers will get very mad with you when you say that because, oh, that will never happen.  But we know all the things that are going to happen.  But don't let's rule out God's sovereign ability to intervene and to change things, not the word, to change things so that people's hearts can be reached.  Okay, hasn't been time, hasn't been done, sudden change.  So, for those that are investing, I cannot tell you to do this or purchase them. ",

            "text": "For I have whispered in the ear, of my prophets.  Can these bones live?  I spoke to Ezekiel and I said, can these bones live?  He answered, you know, Lord.  And my spirit came.  And as he spoke, it went to the north, to the south, to the east and to the west.  My question to you is, can these bones live?  Can my spirit bring them back to life?  Those who have died, those who are spiritually dead, can these bones live?  For I have excitement for you, says the spirit.  Though you are surrounded by fear, doom and gloom, I have set apart certain things truths for my people to prosper.  and i say to you it has now begun.  they have spoken of the dinar.  they have spoken of the amazing discoveries the big e secret.  i have spoken of these things that will be manifest.  But yet there has been a cover upon these things.  I say to you, I will release them one at a time because this is the beginning of acceleration, says the Spirit of God.  A promise has come to me.  Very clearly that over the Middle East and specifically over Iraq and those regions, something has opened up.  Now, somebody says, well, what does that something mean?  It means that there are people not praying in America necessarily, but in Iran, in Iraq.  In those regions, God has heard the prayers of the Christians on that territory where there is blood being shed.  As a result of it, and this came to me two days ago, three days ago, that there will be provision there.  for the world because of what's opened up over the Middle East.  Now that sounds crazy, I know, because there's so much wickedness going on with the leaders there.  That doesn't matter.  So God spoke about the fact that there would be blessings that would come as a result of their prayers being answered.  Now, as a result of it, there will be a surrender.  There will also be a financial issue concerning the denar that I clearly heard because of this opening up as well.  So now you are hearing things that are basically been spoken that are actually prophetic promises.  Come on!  Come on!  Spirit of God is speaking now over the region of Iraq, over the region of Iran, over the regions of the Middle East and Southern, Southern Asia.  The earth is shaken and shall shake again.  But God said, I am speaking that I may release resources and there will be a grave surrender that will take place in the months to come.  i want to free you every one of you my people to be able to stretch out their hand to the lonely to the hungry to the poor and feed them and close them.  this is my desire says the lord.  therefore there shall be a break in the financial system in the middle east the denial and many shall say why?  why now?  but god said when things seem at their worst i shall bring it forth and i shall free them up.  there shall be a prosperity in a place where you least expected the prayers of my people in iran and the prayers of my christian people that come forth from iraq and from palestine yes palestine and even those regions.  i will hear their prayers and i will do something marvelous and will affect this nation.  says the lord you put your hand in the hand of iran.

So you just listen to what the great prophet Clement has said.  Part of it has to deal with the U.S.-China deal, but also part of it also has to do with what's going on.  And currently right now there's a trade in currency war going on.  And if you've watched any of the videos that I've posted in the last several months, if you've been following Currency365, you will see that this is all becoming a reality.  Now just to kind of explain for those of you who don't know, who have never heard, what is the Iraqi Dinar?  Well, shortly after the invasion, after Iraq was invaded for the second time, and the country became somewhat stable again, the Central Bank of Iraq released new notes.  Now before the invasion, the exchange rate was $3.20 per Iraqi Dinar.  Speculation has ranged from dropping the zeros to reinstating the old rate of $3.20.  In 2014, the Central Bank of Iraq had planned on releasing the new notes and revaluating their currency.  According to the prophet Kim Clement, the dinar will bring great wealth to the Middle East and to the United States.  But over the last five to six years, over and over and over, this has been delayed.  Now, the Central Bank of Iraq has done everything it can to stabilize the Iraqi dinar.  The government has implemented economic policies that have produced record oil production.  They've bought massive tons of gold, and they've rooted out much of some of the terrorism that has gone on in the country.  Now, if you look at Kuwait, their exchange rate right now is about where the Iraqi dinar was before the war.  Now, I cannot tell you to go and purchase the dinars because I am not a financial advisor.  But I do believe in the words of the great prophet, Clem Komet.  In order to be a part of this, part of this wealth transfer, it does come at a cost.  Now with everything in the current news, such as the US-China trade war, everything going on all around the world, there is a currency war going on and economies are literally falling apart.  There are wars and rumors of wars.  Prophet Clement said, why now?  Why now?  When things seem at their worst, this is when it's going to come.  So for those who are listening, for those who are waiting for an opportunity to get out of debt, for those who are waiting for financial deliverance, prophetic financial freedom, and the prophetic wealth transfer that Kim Clement has prophesied, this slowly been coming to pass Iraq and all the trouble that is going on right now within the Middle East Asia and all around the world these things have been slowly unraveling Kim Clement's prophecies.  now when you do your research you will find there are many mainstream articles that denounce what's going to happen with the dinar.  now of course Kim Clement has prophesied these things and the enemy will do everything they can to stop the prophetic financial freedom and the prophetic wealth transfer.  I believe in the prophet Jim Clement because everything he has said many of the prophecies have come true.  Jim Clement said that there will be a great wealth transfer coming to the West into the United States.  for those who pay attention you've made your investments and you've taken part.  for those of you who have not I will post a link down below to where you can get started.  Are you ready to be a part of the wealth transfer?  Are you ready for financial freedom?  It does come at a cost, and if you believe in what the prophet says, you will take advantage of that.  Like I said, this is only one part of the wealth transfer.  Now, the Central Bank of Iraq has stated, and many, many politicians that are involved in the finances of the government have said repeatedly over and over that they can support a high rate.  Now the enemy has come against this country for many, many years.  And there's going to come a time where they say, why now?  Why now?  And God said, when these things seem at their worst, I shall bring it forth and I shall free them up.  They shall be a prosperity in a place where you least expect it.  And this is where the prosperity comes in a place where you least expect it.  Now, if you want to learn more about the Great Wealth Transfer, you can check out the links down below.  And you can also check out the links of the Kim Clement Ministries.  They will all be down below in the description.  Winds of change have come.  And will you be part of that change? ",
