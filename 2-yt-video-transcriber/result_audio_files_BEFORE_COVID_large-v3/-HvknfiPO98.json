            "text": "Hello, I'm Donna Clayton, and welcome to a very special edition of Faith With Flavor.  It's that time of year again where we see children and adults dress up in costumes to celebrate Halloween.  No matter how you feel about Halloween, the truth of the matter is that spiritual darkness is real.  The Bible says that we don't wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers of darkness.  It's important that we stay informed to help those around us make wise decisions.  So get ready because today we're going to meet a man who came out of the occult.  And we're going to find out about the dangers he faced.  I'm talking about evangelist John Ramirez, who now preaches the word of God and helps people become set free from the powers of darkness.  We're also going to discuss the power of our words.  Thank you so much for tuning in to Faith with Flavor.  I am so honored to introduce to you the man of the hour, none other than evangelist John Ramirez.  Evangelist, thank you so much for being here, John. ",

I was hanging out with people with Celia Cruz, Mark Anthony people, India.  I don't know if I can tell you these names, but I was hanging out with these people.  All those people.  I was hanging out with all those people.  I was hanging out with all that.  I was going to VIP clubs.  I was in the best list.  I had the best girlfriend.  I had the best money.  But God took me to hell.  I had power.  I can transform myself as an animal.  I end up in your house.  I should project your house and end up like an animal.  The power of darkness.  I would do all that, but God took me to hell.  And when it was in a train, they were full of people.  that you couldn't see their faces, but you could feel the terror.  And you could feel the fear in the train.  And the people knew that they weren't coming back, but we were going.  And when the train hit hell, it was the speed of this train, you can't even describe it.  When it hit hell, the gates opened and ended up in hell.  The first thing I said to myself, I don't belong here.  I believe every person that end up in hell does the first words.  I said, they don't live here, they don't belong here.  I walked through the portals of hell, trying to find a door in the window, You know, you ever been, someone ever frightened you, you like, you know, you jump like that?  You see, in hell, fear comes on you like a coat.  And this thing wraps around you like a coat, fear.  And you can't take it off.  And we're walking to the portals, and then I was touching the ground, and the ground breathes in hell.  The ground is alive in hell.  It breathes.  It's like you ever seen when someone lays on the bed, the tummy go up and down?  That's how the ground does.  And then the ground feels like marshmallow.  There's no grip on the ground.  I'm walking to the portal of hell.  The devil comes out.  And the devil say, I loved you.  I owned you.  I gave you power.  You're trying to dispose my religion.  You're trying to dispose the way I operate on the earth from.  And I said, oh, yeah.  I said, I'm not going to leave you.  I'm just confused.  Give me an opportunity.  Give me a chance.  When he went to grab me, the cross of Jesus Christ appeared between him and I. Hallelujah.  Dropped him like a bad habit.  When he dropped him, instead of me holding on to the cross, I took off again.  into another part of hell.  Hell has compartments.  It has tunnels.  I took off to another part of hell.  And when the devil came up again, he said, now I have to destroy you because I know if you live, you will tell the people about me and about my tricks, about my patterns and cycles.  And I said, oh yeah?  And I had a pair of blue shorts and I had a t-shirt.  And I said, I got something going to destroy you.  And we were talking in demonic tongues, by the way. ",

And then when I was in witchcraft, I was drinking like $3,500 a month in liquor.  I was in the same direction, but the curse was broken.  My daughter, Amanda, right?  I got a high school diploma, so don't run away.  I have a high school diploma, but I broke the curse.  My daughter got a bachelor's degree in psychology.  The curse is broken.  You have to identify what's trying to kill you, because if you can identify what's killing you, you can destroy it before it kills you.  Renounce.  Use your words.  The power in your words.  You said it.  Proverbs 17, 20, with the anointing, the power of God giving you.  The devil, enough is enough.  I draw the line here.  No more cancer in my family.  No more opulence in my family.  I renounce it.  In the name of Jesus, I uproot it.  I level.  I put you on notice.  It's renounced.  I break ties with it.  Lord, forgive me for it.  I break ties for it.  Devil, I just give you an eviction notice.  Amen.  Got to go.  Love don't live here anymore. ",
