And one day as he was going to do a concert, he was with a friend, and he said they passed by a meeting house that was just crammed with people. ",

And so John said to his friend, hey, let's go and see what this crazy guy is saying.  And the friend said, I'm not going at all.  And he said, come on, go with me.  And he said, well, I'll go with you if you'll pull out your horn and break up the meeting when you get inside.  So they go in with mischief on their minds.  He said that he got his horn out, was just about to break up the meeting.  And at that point, he said, Whitfield turned and pointed at him and said, prepare to meet thy God.  He said, when he said that, he said, in here, he says, I fell down speechless and senseless.  And he laid there on the floor, and he couldn't move.  He was just paralyzed.  And so at the end of the meeting, he said, people came and attended to him, tried to get him up, and he couldn't move.  He said, at the end of the meeting, he said, they brought Whitfield over to me.  And Whitfield looked down at me and says, well, the Lord Jesus has got thee at last. ",

And so John Morant had this conversion experience.  that happened.  When he went and told his family what happened, they said, out of the house.  We don't want you.  They said, everything about me except something good.  And so he was driven by persecution out of his house.  He goes out in the woods.  He gets in the woods.  And of all things, a Cherokee brave befriends him.  And for the next several weeks, they stay in the woods hunting together.  And John can't go back home because he's been thrown out.  So the Cherokee says, come with me to my village.  And so they head for the village.  When they get in, here's a Cherokee and here's black John Morant.  Walked in, the chief looked at him and said, you're not Cherokee.  I wonder how he knew that.  You're not Cherokee.  And he ordered him to be executed. ",

So they put him in a separate hut with a guard on the outside until he's executed.  He said, all that night I cried out in prayer to the Lord Jesus.  He said, I prayed loud.  I called on Jesus.  I had conversations with Jesus.  Well, the guard standing outside the door went and told the executioner, he said, somebody's in there with him.  Somebody's there.  And he said, the executioner came, threw open the door, came inside and said, who's in here with you?  He said, the Lord Jesus is here with me.  He said, where is he?  I don't see him.  He said, no, the Lord Jesus.  And so he started praying again to the Lord Jesus.  The executioner gets converted.  So the executioner gets converted.  and the executioner says, wow, this is, I'm going to save you from execution.  So he goes to the judge and the judge says, no, he's been sentenced.  He goes to the chief.  And when he got to the chief, the chief's 19 year old daughter came out and John had his Bible with him and said the chief's daughter took that Bible, looked at it, held it up beside her and started kissing the Bible.  And the chief is going, what is this?  The daughter gets converted.  And so as a result, the chief says, if you don't take that spell off my daughter, I'm going to chop you to pieces right here in front of me.  Well, the chief gets converted.  Wow.  And so what happens is the chief says, You know, why don't you just stay here and live with us for the next several weeks?  Because all my people need to hear what you've got.  And so then they took a whole group of about 50 Braves and said, we want to send you to the Creek Nation, the Creek Indians, because they need to hear this.  And from there, he went to the Housar and the Cadishah.  And he spent two years going from tribe to tribe.  At 14 years old, he becomes the first black American successfully to evangelize Native Americans.  And it's all told in this story. ",
