            "text": "State and local governments all around the country have failed to set aside enough money to pay for the pensions they've promised to workers in the public sector.  State and local pension administrators report that they're over a trillion dollars short of what's required to fully fund pensions.  But it's even worse than their reporting because they aren't investing in a way that completely guarantees all the money will be there for retirees in the future.  And since the promises they've made to future retirees must be paid, what they should do instead is plan for investment returns at the risk-free rate to ensure enough money is there in the future.  When you calculate current unfunded pensions using the risk-free rate, they're actually underfunded by more than $4 trillion.  Pension funds hide the debt they create by assuming that they'll achieve relatively high investment returns.  But the higher the rate of return they assume, the less likely they'll achieve that goal over the long run.  State and local governments need to calculate their investments at the risk-free rate to ensure they can deliver on their promises.  Confronting the true cost of future pension payments would force state and local governments to save more now to prevent tax increases in the future. ",
