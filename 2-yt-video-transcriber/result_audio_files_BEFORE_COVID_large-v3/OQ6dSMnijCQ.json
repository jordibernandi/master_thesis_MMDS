            "text": "Alienation is a particularly popular concept used in Marxist discourse.  It is at the heart of a number of arguments and ideas, and often has a very mystical nature to it.  Alienation is also a concept that is frequently misunderstood or misused, which is why it is important to become acquainted with Marxist description of alienation, as well as its significance to Marxist theory.  In today's video, we will go back to Marx in order to understand what he meant by alienation.  We will then consider some of the subsequent implications Marx's concept of alienation presents.  Lastly, we will go over a general critique of alienation.  Alienation is a concept that is mostly present in Marx's earlier works.  In particular, Marx develops the core features of alienation in Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.  Certain critics of alienation assert that Marx later abandons, or at least de-emphasizes alienation.  A common response to this observation is that alienation continued to shape Marx's analyses, even in the text where he does not explicitly talk about it.  So, what is alienation?  At the core of Marx's alienation is the notion of species-being, or the essence of an organism that distinguishes it from other living things.  Work is humanity's species-being.  Whereas animals act to satisfy their immediate material needs, humans work beyond those needs, and that work separates humans from animals.  In bourgeois society, the product of labor is alien to it.  In other words, what workers produce does not belong to them, and presents itself as an object entirely independent of the labor that actually produced it.  What's worse is the object of labor, the commodity, develops a power over the worker.  Social relations become mediated by the exchange of commodities, thus giving commodities power over people.  Alienation in this context is then the condition in which work loses its uniquely human character and becomes purely about subsistence, much like the behavior of animals.  The work is not freely engaging his or her physical mental capacity.  work is forced, a means of survival, not by any account the ultimate manifestation of human potential.  Eric Fromm summarizes this well by stating that, for Marx, the concept of alienation is based on the distinction between existence and essence, on the fact that man's existence is alienated from his essence, that in reality he is not what he potentially is, or to put it differently, that he is not what he ought to be, and that he ought to be that which he could be.  Commodity fetishism plays a part in alienation in bourgeois society.  When the commodity replaces people as the nexus for social relations, it alienates man from man.  The power of the commodity dehumanizes society, which is why so many people identify with the analogy of the cog in the machine.  Marx's point was precisely that, regardless of our position in society, we are cogs in the machine, whether we buy or sell.  At work we produce commodities that we part with, whose fate we have no clear knowledge of once they are shipped off.  In the supermarket we walk around exchanging one commodity, money, for another, goods.  What is even more unfortunate is just how much power these objects have over our lives.  We produce commodities in exchange for the universal commodity, which we then use to consume commodities that we want or need.  Abstention from this seemingly endless cycle is almost never an option, unless you are prepared to live a very minimalistic life or work tirelessly to maintain self-sustainability.  One important thing to keep in mind is the fact that alienation is not a feature exclusive to the capitalist mode of production.  alienation has existed throughout history of class society, but reached its peak under capitalism.  Because capitalism universalized a production process that alienates human labor, and because capitalism put, before all other things, the exchange of commodities as the dominant socioeconomic dynamic, alienation is in its most extreme form today.  An interesting observation that alienation lends itself to is the fact that we ourselves have created the systems that tower over us.  we believe that we have mastered nature and the elements but instead we have produced mechanisms that hold more power over us than we do them.  the market is a force that moves on its own impacting and moulding our lives far more than we could hope to mould it.  As we move to a critique of alienation, you may recall that we started our definition by acknowledging humanity's species being.  To affirm alienation, one must employ the notion that human beings have some kind of innate essence.  Certain anti-humanist thinkers have rejected the assumption that people really have an essence, arguing that much of what we call essential is instead a reflection of specific systems, conditions, experiences, and relationships.  Is there really an ideal state for human beings?  If there is, how could we possibly identify or define it?  Why should we believe that human essence is centered around creative work as opposed to any number of existential paradigms?  Saying that humans ought to be any particular way is bold, and arguably challenging to defend.  On top of that, our notions of human essence are informed by overlapping ideological structures, which have been mentally reproduced with the help of external forces.  Nevertheless, the idea of alienation can survive a critique of the human essence.  Even if there isn't some kind of species being, the fact that commodities rule over our lives and the fact that many of us search for meaning in the everyday cycle of capitalist production remain pretty difficult to contest.  Even if the issue is not so much about a separation from a supposed nature, the structures that dominate our lives and depress our sense of self are very much real and persistent.  With that, we can conclude our discussion of alienation.  Hopefully this video has helped you better understand what alienation means in the context of Marxist theory.
