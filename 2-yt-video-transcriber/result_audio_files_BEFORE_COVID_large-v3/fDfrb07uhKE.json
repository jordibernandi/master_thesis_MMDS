            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  2020 began with Cardinal Mueller speaking at the 2020 Student Leadership Summit put on by FOCUS, the Fellowship of Catholic University Students.  Thousands of young people gathered in Phoenix.  I'm quoting from a Catholic News Agency article dated January 1st.  The title is, Cardinal Mueller, Church crisis comes from abandoning God, adapting to the culture.  I quote Cardinal Mueller, The poison paralyzing the church is the opinion that we should adapt to the zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, and not to the spirit of God.  That we should relativize God's commandments and reinterpret the doctrine of the revealed faith.  Goes on to say, he cautioned that even a number of people in the church are longing for a kind of Catholicism without dogmas, without sacraments, and without an infallible magisterium.  The article goes on, calls for modernization demand that the church reject what it holds to be true for the sake of building a new religion of world unity, Mueller warned.  Then quotes Mueller, in order to be admitted to this meta-religion, is giving up her truth claim.  No big deal, it seems, as the relativism dominant in our world anyway rejects the idea that we could actually know the truth and presents itself as a guarantor of peace between all world views and world religions.  The article goes on, the post-Christian society welcomes the as a convenient civil religion, the Cardinal said.  And finally, God who is eternal cannot be changed by the whims of society, he stressed.  And so it's interesting, you know, you've heard people speak about this push for a one world religion where we just water everything down, become politically correct so that we can all get along.  And Cardinal Mueller warns against this.  And I think it's really important as we begin this new year, as we see the church in such a mess, as we see forces in the church trying to push the church into compromising the gospel, that we heed the words of Cardinal Mueller.  Remember the words of St.  Paul.  St.  Paul says, do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed through the renewal of your mind.  Viva Christore! ",
