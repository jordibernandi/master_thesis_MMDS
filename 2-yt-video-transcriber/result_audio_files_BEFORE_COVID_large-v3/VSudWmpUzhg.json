            "text": "A little warm.  You want to see some beauty?  It's policing through the ages.  Dude, that is a shot of the police chief from 1847.  They go way back here.  And that's the unknown comic.  That's the one right there.  With the hat.  Turn off cell phones.  All persons and properties subject to search.  I'm just filming.  Is that okay?  For news purposes?  Is that okay?  I want to make sure I have your permission.  Uh-oh, it's the police.  Am I in trouble?  It is a public entity.  Am I in trouble?  However, it's suspicious behavior.  It is?  I would say so.  Yeah, that's the smart thing.  You should turn your body cam on.  What's suspicious about my behavior?  Would you like to speak with a supervisor?  That'd be amazing.  What's your name, ma'am?  Yeah, that was a question.  Let's go to the play-by-play.  Oh, there's Mr.  Greybeard approaching Miss Hottie.  Oh, no.  Rejected.  Well, that escalated quickly.  Suspicious behavior.  God.  This job is for the brave.  Wilma from Southern California.  Yeah, I wonder where bee sting face is on this wall here.  I'm gonna zoom in here and get some better footage here.  Oh yeah, she's totally hot.  Hashtag hot tyrant.  Hey, is the supervisor coming?  I've got my kid in a hot car.  Okay, is he playing golf or?  Okay, well, I got my kid in a hot car right now, so I just want to.  I've got my kid in a hot car.  I'd like to expedite this.  Nah, he's okay.  He's got another, like, eight minutes.  He's good.  Oh, here we go.  Hello, can I help you?  No, I was just here filming, so apparently you guys seem to think that there's a problem with it.  What's your name, sir?  My name is Sergeant Johnson.  Okay.  No, you talked to Officer Carter here.  He said you wanted to talk to the supervisor.  Well, yeah, she said that I was acting... Well, here I am.  What do you need?  She said I was acting suspiciously.  Well, it was a little suspicious.  She got two phones recording nothing, really.  Okay.  How many cameras do you guys have around the building here?  I see one.  That's really irrelevant.  I see two.  And I saw probably about a dozen around the building.  So that looks suspicious.  So actually, I got a call.  And I'm here because I was told that there was some suspicious activity here at the police station.  So possible gang activity.  OK.  And so you're going to handle that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you guys aren't.  OK.  All right, well, you're more than welcome to hang out here as long as you like.  Okay, Carter, you still think I'm acting suspicious?  Yes.  You do?  In what way?  Can you articulate?  We're not going to answer any more of that stuff.  We're going to go handle the gang problem.  Okay, well, from within, are you going to call IA?  I'm not at liberty to tell you.  Hey, are you a good cop or a bad cop?  That's a yes or no question.  I don't have to answer you.  Have you ever given sworn testimony against another cop?  Have you ever arrested another cop?  All right.  Be here all day.  Cool.  I'm gonna go get everybody's plate on the way through the parking lot.  So hope you don't mind.  Just in case of any blue retaliation.  Well, I got a call.  I mean, you know, we're here to investigate.  We're going to go follow, walk around here and get some, see if there's any contraband around the building.  I'm just going to shout out some plates.  This is for my own personal safety in case there's a fear of any retaliation later.  So, okay, Nevada, 87 Golf 396.  It's a silver four-door Honda.  We got a green Saturn.  Utah plates, Lima 925 Bravo.  I'm actually here in town, I'm actually trying to, I'm hoping to get recruited into a polygamist LDS sect.  So we'll see, we'll see how that goes.  Hi, can you tell me your name, please?  No, I can't, sorry.  You can't?  Why not?  Because you're a piece of shit tyrant pig, is that why?  Oh, they're moving the car that I looked through.  Come on, didn't they teach you anything in the safety course?  Boy, looks like somebody had a dead hooker in the trunk.  You can't give me a complaint form?  I didn't hear you.  I still can't hear you.  There's noise out here in the lobby.  There's air conditioner running.  Are you not authorized to give me a complaint form?  There's a complaint form on its way.  But you're not authorized to give me one?  Okay.  Have you guys ever given out a complaint form ever in the history of St.  George PD?  You have to make one up from scratch or?  Yeah, I wanted to get a complaint form against for an officer.  I want to get it.  Let me rephrase the question.  I want to the statement.  I want to get a complaint form against an officer.  Do you have one?  Yes or no?  It's a yes or no question.  I'm not going to let you bully me around.  It's a yes or no question, sir.  Do you have a complaint form?  Yes.  Okay, can I have one, please?  Yeah, I'm going to have to go print one off, so just stand by a second.  Is that acceptable?  Go.  Get back to work.  Go do something.  Go do some clerical stuff.  There's some coyote shit in the parking lot too.  you might want to clean up while you're doing all of the menial tasks of the office.  There you go, fill it out completely and bring it back when you're done.  Great.  Anything else?  No, that's it.  Can you tell me the name of the officer that left, the female officer that left in the undercover car?  No, I can't.  I don't know who that was.  There's a couple of them.  Well, there was one that was, how many officers are on staff right now?  How many female cops are here in uniform?  I'm not at liberty to tell you that.  Was that top secret information I'm not allowed to get?  Once again, I'm not at liberty to tell you that.  Do you want to fill out the complaint?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Get back to work, dude.  Cuck.  Mike Jones, who?  I'm in St.  George, Utah, and I showed up here, and within 10 seconds, within 10 seconds, everybody... Do you have any business here?  You're right.  Oh, yeah, I'm filming a story.  Okay, you can leave our lobby.  If you don't have any police business here, you're being trespassed from our lobby.  This is a constitutionally protected act.  If you do not leave right now, if you do not leave now, you will be arrested for trespassing.  For trespassing in a public lobby.  What's your name?  No, because you're here harassing our employees.  What's your name?  My name is Kyle Whitehead.  Okay.  Leave our lobby now.  How many unarmed civilians have you shot and killed?  Leave our lobby now.  Piece of shit.  Leave our lobby now or you will be arrested.  asshole Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm not gonna call you fucking cocks.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself, dude.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself, dude.  Go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.  Yeah.  Uh-oh, they got the canine going.  They're gonna set up a perimeter.  Well, you guys post the phone number if you want to seek redress from your government.  Listen, St.  George, Utah is beautiful, but I don't feel like coming back here to fucking go to court.  I'm going to walk away.  They were Googling the fuck out of this.  What a bunch of fucking tyrants.  What an absolute bunch of piece of shit pirates.  Keep posting the phone number, everybody.  Better yet, call the mayor.  Oh, yep, they're setting up our perimeter.  That guy looked like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, man.  He had some weird creepy fucking, he was like Lurch, Matt.  It was like Lurch on acid from Adam's Family.  Boy, if there was ever more of a punchable face that I've seen in the last couple of months, it was that guy. ",
