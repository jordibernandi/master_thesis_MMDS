            "text": "Crowder has won.  Not just my opinion, a statement straight from Vice News.  And their story, YouTube's bungled crackdown on Steven Crowder only made him stronger.  They say, a week after Steven Crowder's bullying of a Vox journalist pitted conservative media against big tech, it's official.  Crowder has won.  Who could have seen this coming?  Crowder, of all people targeted in this capacity, in this Vox adpocalypse, is the least impacted.  Or I should say, he's actually got a net gain.  This has done great things for Crowder.  He's a massive channel.  He was already mass demonetized. ",
