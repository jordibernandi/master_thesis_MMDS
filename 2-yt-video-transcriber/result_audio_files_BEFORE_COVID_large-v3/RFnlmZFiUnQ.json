            "text": "Jeffrey Epstein was put on suicide watch on July 23rd.  July 23rd, right?  He was awaiting trial for a child sex trafficking ring, rape, child solicitation, conspiracy, many, many things, right?  So he tried to kill himself on July 23rd.  He's put on suicide watch.  Then, apparently, there's a series of events that happen where by July 27th, so that would be just a week later, a psychologist at this jail, and by the way, this jail is under Department of Justice.  This is a jail that is under the supervision of the Department of Justice federally.  So in a week's time, he's taking off suicide watch.  I'm not an expert on psychological evaluations of prisoners and this and that, but I am an expert on very high-profile... I wouldn't say an expert, but common sense would dictate.  if you have such a high-profile prisoner... In one week's time, what would you see from that person that makes you think you could take him off suicide watch?  But even off suicide watch, there was supposed to be intervals where essentially he was checked in on every 15 minutes.  But obviously, even if you're checked in on every 15 minutes, I mean, what does it take to put together whatever you're going to do to hurt yourself and for it to ultimately kill you?  So there was a series of things that happened, and I'm going to read from this New York Times stories, that indicate to me this is very, very convenient that all of these things happened all in a row.  I don't want to say allow, but for Jeffrey Epstein to be, quote, dead by suicide basically three weeks after he unsuccessfully tried to kill himself.  It does not make sense.  So this is the New York Times this morning.  Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who hanged himself in federal jail in Manhattan, was supposed to have been checked by guards every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not being followed.  the night before he was found, a law enforcement official with knowledge of his detention said.  So right there, like, and Ty will join me because he knows a lot more about this than me, but, you know, there's kind of like, I don't want to use the terminology VIP, but there's kind of like big... deal prisoners that, like, your ass is on the line if you let something happen.  Right?  I don't want to say, he's not a VIP.  He was a deplorable man, by all accounts.  High profile.  High profile.  Thank you.  But it's not like, do you think that this guard or these two guards, I mean, I'm thinking Shawshank Redemption here or Prison Break, if you remember the show Prison Break.  You think these guards just like unilaterally decided like, eh, I'm going, you know, Dunkin's open late tonight.  We're going to go.  We're going to go, you know, get an espresso, get a frappuccino, whatever.  You think they just did that on their own?  Jack Moore, $10 in the super chat.  I will double the next donation up to $100 because this needs to grow.  Who wants to join the revolution?  Jack Morris, from your lips to if there's a God's ears.  Because I'll tell you what, Jack.  I don't want to get a pity party, but my back is a little messed up this week.  It takes a lot for me to not do live streams.  Literally on the New York City subway, people are giving up their seats to me like I'm a pregnant woman because I'm limping so badly because of my back.  So part of this is burnout, part of this is because we are reporting in the field.  Ty and I were just in Detroit covering the debate where CNN gave us basically a credential to report to you in the parking lot.  We'll show you that video today.  But anyway, I could go on and on, but the bottom line is, Jack, we do need people like you to not only leave Super Chats, but we need to grow our membership.  Membership is how we grow.  We're at 674 members.  I think we could get another 25 and hit 700 today.  I think we could do it today because I got news for you.  There's not a lot of people out there in the news business reporting what's actually going on at these debates, what's actually going on on the campaign trail, what's actually going on and being done to Bernie Sanders supporters as well as Tulsi Gabbard supporters.  So thank you for the super chat and keep it coming.  Before I read more of the New York Times story, can you join me and tell me, is this how it works, where basically three weeks after this guy tries to kill himself, a guard just unilaterally decides, oh, you know, I don't have to watch him every 15 minutes.  Hold on. ",

A lot of people get on suicide watch a lot of times.  You get a lot of people that are like, You know, they put everybody on meds and things like that.  So, normally, what they do, your suicide watch, your suicide watch, they come and check on you every 10 minutes or every 15 minutes.  They come by your cell, they look in your cell, they make sure you're good.  First off, when you're on a suicide watch, they take away your shoestrings, they take away your sheets, they take away your bread, they take away anything that you could possibly use to hurt yourself.  That's what they do.  They take that away.  And then, but they do give you like a blanket and everything and you can... Like they always have someone checking on you though.  And then for you to get off Suicide Watch, you have to be evaluated.  Like that's the thing, you have to be evaluated.  And a psychologist or psychiatrist, either one of them, have to say, oh, they're good to be off.  And then you're off.  That's what happens when you get on Suicide Watch and to get off Suicide Watch.  Because to even get on Suicide Watch, The guards can't put you on suicide watch.  They have to say, this will happen, then you get put on suicide watch.  It's like a protocol.  It's not a guard that just say, okay, we're going to put this person on suicide watch. ",

It's because the warden, it's all on him.  Anything that happens in this prison, it's on him.  So if you got a high profile person that thinks that they're a gangster or whatever and they don't want to be on it, it won't be their choice.

He is supposed to be watched every 30 minutes.  That procedure is not followed the night before he was found.  So basically hours before his death, the procedure wasn't followed.  He's also transferred.  The jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr.  Epstein to be housed alone in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail's normal procedure.  So we got the highest profile person in that jail and probably in the criminal justice system at the moment, besides the El Paso shooter and, you know, that kind of crime. ",

I'm gonna go back and read all of them.  thank you thank you.  we're getting $100 $50 $200.  please keep it coming.  please keep it coming.  god bless you.  so and I'm gonna.  I'm gonna thank you all individually but I want to keep going on this thought.  so you need to tell me and can you pull up the the daily the Daily Beast piece?  yeah so Friday morning Oh no, today's Sunday?  Yeah.  So Friday morning, a deposition comes out.  You have, again, this is all allegedly, let's be fair, but former presidential candidate Bill Richardson, who I believe is also New Mexico governor.  Big, big elite.  Big, big elite.  Always on CNN.  Always on corporate news.  You got Bill Richardson was implicated in a deposition as, you know... Maxwell and Epstein trafficked.  Giffrey said in several depositions, she's the woman alleging abuse via Epstein and the other people that enabled Epstein.  She alleges that in 2016, she said Maxwell specifically instructed her to serve former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, ran for president in 2008.  I think he was Obama's ambassador to somewhere.  Is this the right one, right?  Yeah, yeah, keep going.  Go down, go down.  Yeah, right there.  Bill Richardson, Britain's Prince Andrew, who, by the way, the Queen, Queen Elizabeth, on the same day this came out, went with Prince Andrew, I think, to church.  That's very interesting that they're going to church on the same day that Prince Andrew is implicated in this.  And we've heard about Prince Andrew possibly implicated in this before.  wealthy financier Glenn Dubin, former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, and scientist Marvin Minsky.  So, by the way, we haven't even gotten to Bill Clinton yet, which, you know, that's coming, baby.  That's coming.  And, you know, I texted Jen.  I texted Jen.  Isn't it interesting that the Daily Beast, who is owned by IAC... the Daily Beast, which is owned by IAC, didn't mention Bill Clinton in this whole article.  You know who's on the board of IAC?  You know who's on the board of IAC?  Chelsea Clinton.  So, they didn't mention Bill Clinton, who was also mentioned in this deposition, because Chelsea Clinton is on the board of the Daily Beast, and you better believe they're not touching Bill Clinton.  Again, alleged.  I don't know for sure.  We don't want to be conspiracy Alex Jones peoples here, but There was news and revelations as pertaining to Bill Clinton less than 24 hours before Jeffrey Epstein was found in his jail cell dead of a supposed suicide.  That's not me conspiratorial.  That is the facts.  So this came out less than 24 hours.  Less than 24 hours.  before Jeffrey Epstein was found, you know, they say he was hung, whatever.  We don't have the videotape to prove it or not prove it.  So, the  U.S.,  Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has issued a mandate unsealing a huge cache of documents related to billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.  Again, this was published before he was found dead.  The selection of documents taken for Virginia Giffrey's defamation lawsuit against alleged Epstein enabler Ghislaine Maxwell, I probably mispronounced it, apologies, provides context to much of Epstein's alleged crimes and widens the scopes of elites that are believed to have run in Epstein's circles.  The documents also allege that Maxwell took a nude photo of Giffrey lying on a hammock and gave the photo to Epstein on his birthday.  In transcripts of Giffrey's deposition released by the court Friday, very interesting that this wasn't mentioned in the Daily Beast article, with Chelsea Clinton on the board of the Daily Beast parent company, very interesting.  Bill Clinton's relationship with Epstein is expounded upon.  Giffrey alleges that Clinton was around when she was with Epstein on his island.  Giffrey claims, and by the way, Giffrey is one of the women alleging Jeffrey Epstein's rape, basically serving her to other men.  Giffrey claims that she flew to the Caribbean with Epstein when she was 17, and that while she was there, Maxwell, who was one of, I think it was Epstein's girlfriend, and one of basically the main ringleader enabling Epstein and helping him prey on these underage women, bragged that she picked Clinton up in a, quote, black helicopter that Jeffrey Epstein bought her.  Giffrey further says that she had spent time with Clinton and that while his Secret Service agents were there, they weren't, quote, where everyone was eating.  I don't know as much as Ty does about... uh... security protocols and in prison but i do know that secret service is not supposed to be away from current or former presidents aside from the bathroom.  obviously you know when you're in your home with the house of cards there's a certain time when they don't want them around.  right right right but there's certain times they don't want them around and those certain times are sometimes very elicit shall we say elicit.  And Jen, text me if I'm getting off the reservation here.  I'm trying to be fair to Bubba Clinton here, but this ain't looking good.  Hope you enjoyed that last video.
