            "text": "Before you think anything, this is likely not clickbait.  Hi, my name is Sydney.  Welcome back to my channel.  So if you didn't already know, I moved to Washington DC.  Yeah, that's where I've been.  And honestly, I've been here about a week and it's been kind of rough.  Though that could be because I'm a total crybaby.  I'm not sure yet.  So we will return to my normal content making probably next week or the following week, but I figured that some of you might be interested in the experiences that I've had so far.  So we can just collectively sit in my pain.  Fabulous.  Before I came to DC, only really one of my friends had told me that it was a liberal cesspool, which didn't really bother me too much because I lived in a liberal cesspool for most of my life.  I was prepared.  I'm always prepared.  And if I'm being totally honest about DC, it's exactly like Melbourne, except an American version that's basically taken liberal crack and then gotten way worse than Melbourne.  It's weird.  I don't even know if these liberals can afford living here.  It's just, it's very confusing to me.  Even before I got here, when people had talked about pride and how intense pride is in America, I didn't really have a concept of that because even though I live in a massively liberal city, we never really celebrated it.  And then I got here.  I mean, before I got here, I was like, Pride, yeah, sure, I mean, that's a thing.  Let me assure you, in America, it is a thing.  There are flags literally everywhere.  Everywhere.  I have never been exposed to this much rainbow in my life.  Then there's all the people who keep telling me that DC is getting gentrified.  Although I would say that it's not getting gentrified, it's just being taken over by hippies and hipsters.  You know how I know that it's actually hipsters who are ruining and running this city?  I'll tell you.  Yesterday, I paid $5 for a pot of tea.  That's like eight Australian dollars.  No, but five dollar pots of tea aside, let me tell you what it's been like trying to find housing and housemates here.  I do already have a couple of friends who live in DC, but when I initially decided to move, I wasn't really sure who wanted to move in, where I wanted to live, what the hell I was doing.  Because moving across the world to a new city that you've not really spent that much time in is exceedingly unfamiliar and then exceedingly difficult.  That being said, I did initially ask around to find out if my friends had any friends who were looking for a cool roommate.  It's me.  I'm the cool roommate.  But nobody did, so I did what any good millennial would do, and I went online.  I posted about it in a group on Facebook that another friend from DC had recommended to me, and basically just wrote a long witty, I think witty, post about me as a housemate and basically what I was looking for.  If you follow me on Instagram, you might remember me posting a comment that I got in response to my original post.  Two comments, actually.  Just FYI, Sydney is an insane right-wing YouTube personality who hates immigrants and feminists and loves Trump and other Nazis like him.  Just Google her and you'll see.  Probably not the kind of person you want to live with and definitely not normal.  So I responded and I was like, hey man, that's kind of uncool.  Also weird that you found my post when there was like 90,000 people in that group and then decided to leave a comment like that.  Most of us just... Keep scrolling.  Anyway, he responded and said, warning people that their potential roommate is a xenophobic piece of isn't ridiculous.  There are enough rich, racist like you in DC already.  Live somewhere else.  He thinks I'm rich.  I love how these are the people that are like, let the immigrants in.  And then as soon as you're an actual immigrant that's moved to their country, they're like, leave.  So that was my first experience trying to find a house and or a housemate in DC.  I'm off to a great start.  And just for you wise guys who are gonna come at me in the comments, I realize now that I'm not exactly in a position where I can do things like a normal millennial, like post about housemates on Facebook, which is what everyone else gets to do, but apparently I'm not allowed.  I mean, and I get why, it's because I'm pretty online and, you know, I'm somewhere on the right wing, so yeah, that just tends to lead to abuse.  Tolerance.  So fast forward, I eventually find a short-term sublet that was basically gonna run from the middle of June to the end of August, which was super good.  That's basically the timeframe that I was looking at anyway.  And if you're not familiar with what a sublet actually is, it is where a person who is on the lease, who has a room, will rent that room out to you while they're not there, and basically you just pay their rent and whatever else they want you to pay for.  and then when they come back, you leave.  It's really cost effective if you're not going to be in an area for a long time and don't want to stay in hotels and hostels and things, and from what I have seen living in a couple different places, it's pretty common everywhere.  I'm also mostly sure it's illegal, so there is that as well.  Because I'd already been abused to begin with for being conservative, I was very upfront with the two girls that I would be sharing the house with because I just didn't want them to run into any surprises later down the line finding out that I support orange men.  So I told them I was conservative and then didn't really elaborate any further and I didn't tell them that I talked to a camera on a regular basis because I just didn't see the need.  And both of them in return said that they were liberal and I was like, Okay, now I get to DC and one of my girlfriends who also works in conservative politics came to help me move my things into the apartment.  And we're doing all of that and that's great.  One of the housemates is there who we will call Jenna.  And basically my friend turns to Jenna and says, ha, you should Google Sydney.  And I'm like, No!  That's a really bad idea.  I mean, probably compounding this just like a little bit was the fact that my friend and I were telling her things that we do and what it's like working in conservative politics and, you know, that probably just didn't really make the situation any better.  And honestly, Googling me is like the worst thing you can say to someone that doesn't agree with me politically, because if you do that, you'll get all these horrible dicey fake news articles that don't make me seem like a very nice person.  There is no world where I want a left-wing housemaid who's potentially teetering on hating me to read that.  and hate me.  Anyway, by this point, the other housemate, who we will call Harriet, had also gotten home and then she and Jenna left.  I turn to my friend at this point and I'm like, they are, they are absolutely going to talk about me.  Any woman watching this knows exactly what I'm talking about.  We do things in packs.  We just, we clump together and then we go and talk about how bad your outfit is.  Or that we potentially let a horrible Trump supporter into our home.  So the next day rolls around and I go out grocery shopping because food is necessary for survival and I get a text message from Jenna basically saying that she wants to touch base and talk to me.  I guess my liberal senses were tingling at this point because I kind of knew that when I got back she was gonna ask me to leave.  I get back to the apartment, I've got all my groceries, which I've just carried for however long in the wonderful DC heat, and Jenna and Harriet are sitting on the couch like we're about to have some kind of intervention.  In case you guys were wondering, no, I don't want to stop being right wing, I'm only here for the free snacks.  Jenna proceeds to tell me that basically, the landlord doesn't want me here.  They said I have until the end of June to move out, which gave me about 13 days to find a place.  This not even considering the fact that I'd signed paperwork, that I'd paid them, so on and so forth.  And I guess that's, uh, that's the story.  The thing for me is that it is entirely possible that the landlord, like most normal landlords, was like, hey, don't sublease that room.  That's uncool.  They're not on the lease and that's not part of your contract and I'm not okay with it.  Despite the fact that I pay money on time, that I'm clean and tidy and Not gonna sacrifice cats on the balcony at like 4am.  I'm like, every landlord's dream.  Please give me a home.  But really, before any of this went down, I basically knew that this was going to happen.  And I actually told a bunch of friends that before it did happen.  Because I knew.  because my liberal senses were tingling.  And quite honestly, in this political climate, this sort of thing happening because of the way that you lean politically really doesn't surprise me.  And in fact, and even in this case, these girls subleased a room to someone else last summer.  A lot of people that I have spoken to since this happened that live in DC have basically said that they are not surprised whatsoever and that the city really is this divided when it comes to who's Republican and who's a Democrat or who supports Trump or who doesn't.  And while universally a lot of people think that this whole situation sucks, the people that I've met here who work in politics have said that it just really wouldn't surprise them if this was really down to the fact that I am a conservative.  And that just seems to be the case for parts of America, at least for now.  Things are incredibly polarized, and that is something that I've absolutely noticed even just from being here for a week.  At this point I sort of feel really uncomfortable expressing my viewpoints or even really being honest with people about what I kind of do because I don't want to run into situations exactly like this.  It sucks.  Without sounding super melodramatic, I think a lot of this does actually go to show how far the intolerance towards conservatives actually goes.  The fact that I even get the impression and definitely get the feeling that this happened, at least in part because I'm conservative, says a lot.  And even if that isn't the case, and it really is just the landlord feeling uncomfortable, which is totally fine and totally understandable, it is genuinely so sad.  that we live in days and times where it's actually entirely plausible that you can be kicked out because of the way that you swing politically.  I mean, and that being said, I also get the impression that one of these girls kind of wants to spit in my face every time she talks to me, so there is that.  Thanks for that, DC.  So that's just one of my experiences being here in DC for a week.  Let me know in the comments what you think because, you know, I'm sure you guys are gonna have a lot to say about this.
