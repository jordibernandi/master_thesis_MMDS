            "text": "Time, according to God, according to the Bible, is cyclical.  That means you have winter, spring, summer, fall.  You have seasons.  You can't change it.  Seasons are coming.  You just have to know what season it is.  But today we are taught that time is linear.  Now listen to me, I'm not trying to get heavy and philosophical, I'm just telling you that there is an incorrect perception of time.  And if you think time is linear, then you believe that things are progressing according to your human will and effort, and things should be getting like this, better and better and better and better and better.  That's why people believe in evolution, because at some point we change our thinking of time, instead of realizing there are seasons and cycles and repetitions, and that's part of the meaning of life and part of the beauty of life, and we're to understand the seasons and celebrate the seasons.  Instead, we think, in our own human effort, we're going to achieve perfection.  Time is cyclical.  Everybody for thousands of years understood that.  If you worked on a farm, you would see the cycle of agriculture.  But now, we flatten the cycle.  Because look, what time is it right now?  7.17, let's say, in the evening, and it's bright.  What have we done?  We flatten out the day.  We extended the light time.  Our biological clocks are not really sure anymore when to go to sleep, when to awaken, because even the first cycle of the day, we just flatten out to try to make it linear.  What happens is, if you keep doing that, your health deteriorates.  suffers you get insomnia probably many of you in this church have insomnia and you take pills or whatever you do or play games into the late night just to try to cope with the fact that you're.  you're living in this linear time and god has made time like this and that's why every year around this time october we come back and celebrate the founding the birth of discover church.  You might say, well, that doesn't mean anything to me.  I'm just a visitor today.  Yeah, but it means something.  If you take the significance, if you participate in the celebration, it creates a natural rhythm of life.  Amen?  So time itself is a measurement of cycles.  If there were no cycles, if the sun did not exist, if the earth did not go around the sun, if the moon did not go around the earth, we wouldn't even be able to say, what is time?  There's no definition of time.  Time is by definition a measurement of that cycle.  God made it that way.  So the more we come back into God's system, God's calendar, the more at peace, the more at health, the more we feel our purpose in life, and the more we stop resisting also.  We resist like we think, oh, it's cold.  I don't like the cold.  Yeah, but winter is coming.  You just need to adjust to winter.  Does that make sense?  And then when it's time to plant seeds, you don't say, yeah, but I don't have enough seed to plant.  I'm not interested in planting seeds.  Yeah, but it's time to plant seeds.  You're not going to get a harvest without the planting.  And then when everybody gets a harvest, you're jealous and complaining.  It's cycles and seasons.  Learn to work with that.  Now, you know what cycle we're in.  Just a few days ago, it was Yom Teruah.  Let me translate.  In God's calendar, it was the Feast of Trumpets.  You may know it now.  It's fairly popular to say Rosh Hashanah.  Can you say Rosh Hashanah?  Okay, it's a very long way to say head, Rosh, head, Shana, the year.  Another way is you say Shana Tovah.  Shana Tovah.  Shana is the year.  Tovah is good.  Have a good year.  Say to each other, Shana Tovah.  Yeah, there you go.  So the start of the year in God's calendar, the only calendar that God approved of, was a few days ago, about four days ago.  And so now we're in what's called the Days of Awe.  This is where the people of God, especially the Jews, are aware that this is the time to really search your heart, search your soul, and repent.  And we're to get ready for a major day of repentance that's in about Tuesday.  Tuesday evening it starts.  It's called Yom Kippur.  It's called the highest holy day according to the Jewish calendar, but it's in the Bible.  So we're not trying to copy the Jews.  We're just saying whatever's in the Bible is from God.  We want to follow that.  So Yom Kippur.  So right now would be a really good time to repent.  Whether you're a Christian or not a Christian, God is your God.  He's the one that made you.  Right?  The sooner you get into a relationship with Him, the sooner you walk in His plan and purpose for your life.  It starts out with repentance, and He gives you ten days to really analyze and think about your life and prepare your heart for Yom Kippur.  In English, it's the Day of Atonement.  Very simple.  The Day of Atonement.  Can you say that?  The Day of Atonement.  Okay, so this is part of the cycles that God has placed into the yearly calendar.  And then after that, there's going to be one more feast.  They go on for a couple of weeks with this.  It's called Sukkot.  Sukkot.  Sukkot means the Feast of Tabernacles.  It's a symbol of God tabernacling with us.  What a hard word, right?  We use all these hard words, but they have simple meaning.  It just means God comes to dwell with us.  Why isn't God here?  Well, God will come.  God will come.  But when he comes, everything changes.  All the wicked people are destroyed.  All the people who didn't repent, gone straight to hell.  So God said, I'm coming.  You want me to come?  I'm coming.  You want to see me?  You'll see me.  But when you see me, it's too late.  The holy cannot live with the unholy.  It's like the police and the criminals, they shouldn't be buddies in the same house.  Is that right?  And God is much, much more than a police authority.  He is pure and perfect and holy.  So we're to prepare our hearts and repent.  I want to read you a couple of scriptures about repentance.  Why should we repent?  By the way, the word repent in Hebrew, I love it.  Say this word, teshuvah.  Teshuvah.  T-S-U-V-A-H.  Teshuvah.  What does this mean?  Teshuvah, you say repent, and it kind of loses its meaning these days.  It sounds so religious.  I'm not sure what it means.  But in the Hebrew, all it means is return.  Return.  Imagine that, God says, I'm calling you to return.  Return to what?  Return to God.  Return to God.  You say, I'm not religious.  Yeah, but you can return to God.  God's not religious.  I don't think He is.  But His family meets together, and some people have made it, called it, you know, an institution, and that's fine.  But God has a family and he's calling you to return to him and his family.  So to do teshuva is to repent or to return to God.  Why should we do that?  Let me give you a few scriptures.  Isaiah 44 verse 22 says, I have blotted out like a thick cloud your transgressions and like a cloud your sins.  Return to me for I have redeemed you.  See, he puts it in the past tense.  Actually, this is 700 years before Jesus would come.  But he says, in my mind, when I've thought of it, I've conceived it, it's done.  I have redeemed you.  I paid the price for all your sins.  But you still need to take an action.  You need to make a decision.  Return.  Say, Lord, I'm choosing to return to you.  That's what you say to God.  You need to say it verbally.  Another good scripture is Zechariah 1 verse 3, therefore say to them, thus says the Lord of hosts, return to me and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts.  Is that nice?  So you should return to Him because He's redeemed you.  He's bought you with the blood of Jesus Christ.  Then there's a benefit if you return to Him.  He says, I will return to you.  You say, where is God?  I don't see God.  He says, first return to me.  Then I will return to you.  You don't just say, I don't see the Prime Minister.  He must come here, otherwise I won't pay my taxes.  Well, we don't have a right to speak that way of authority.  You don't make demands on him.  He says, here's the protocol.  You return to me humbly.  I will return to you.  You'll see me.  You'll know me.  I'll hear your prayers.  I'll begin a relationship with you.  And one more scripture.  Malachi chapter 3.  Very simple.  We often quote the end of this, but we don't hear the beginning.  The beginning is this.  It says, Yet from the days of your fathers you have gone away from my ordinances and have not kept them.  Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of Hosts.  Now, he knows that people have a question mark in their head.  Well, you know, God's invisible.  I don't know how you would do that.  Look at how practical God is.  This is the Hebrew God, the God of the universe.  He says, but you said, in what way shall we return?  So God answers, will a man rob God, yet you have robbed me?  You say, in what way have we robbed you?  And he says, in tithes and offerings.  What an interesting scripture, because a lot of people say, well, I don't have the tithe, I don't have the offer, it's, you know, passe, it's Old Testament.  Well, wait a second, let me ask you, is returning to God passe?  Is repentance finished?  No.  So when he defined repentance, he said there are at least two ways that you can return to someone.  First, you say sorry to them verbally.  But then also, if you've been stealing from them, you don't just say, sorry, let's kiss and make up.  No, you've been stealing or you've been doing whatever.  I need to restore.  So he says there are two ways to return.  Verbally, but also with your money.  He says, if you've not honored me all your life or in your work, and you just use up all my resource, you live on this earth as if you created everything.  He says, it's not true.  You must acknowledge all things belong to him.  He's the landlord.  We're the tenant.  It's a very simple principle, so that's never changed.  He's always been the landlord.  We've always been the tenant.  Returning to Him has always been same yesterday, today, and forever.  So part of it definitely is returning in tithes and offerings.  It couldn't be any more practical, could it?  And it couldn't be more simple.  So simple.  Verbally return, financially return, and God says, watch what I'll do for you.  I will return to you.  If you don't know how to return to me, try those two steps.  Amen?  And I'd say, get your heart right until Yom Kippur, and then by the time we get to next week's service, we will just be on the edge of Sukkot.  And we'll talk maybe a little bit about that.  Cycles and seasons of life on God's calendar.  Try to obey that, try to live in that, and you'll see your spirit, your soul, your body will be at peace and rest. ",
