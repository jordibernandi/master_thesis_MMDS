            "text": "We have areas around Seattle, other parts of Washington, and the Pacific Northwest feeling the full wrath of this winter storm Maya as it's dumping heavy snowfall in the area.  And in turn, we have the governor declaring a state of emergency as they're saying that these conditions continue to worsen.  If you have all the snow on the ground and then you have wind blowing it everywhere, it can make for what they call these ground blizzard type of situations.  And this here shows the conditions as of last night on Highway 101, just west of Morse Creek or Baker's Dip.  You can see here just how bad everything is.  Now, we had a cold stretch that went through the United States here this past week where we saw negative temperatures hit like negative 40, negative 50, negative 60 in certain areas in the middle of the United States.  Now, this is affecting the Pacific Northwest right now.  How is it going to affect the rest of the country as it moves east?  Is it going to continue to wreak havoc on these other areas that are still seeing snow and freezing temperatures right now?  Yet to be seen, but we know one thing's for sure.  A state of emergency declared up here because of situations like the one that you see right here.  Now, to me, the number one thing someone can do out here in this day and age is stay on top of forecasting.  Forecasting is the biggest thing that you can use to your advantage.  Anyone can turn on the weather.  You can get a bead on what's going to happen wherever you're heading.  And it never hurts to stop and check the weather a couple minutes.  Going somewhere that has a lot of snow or has flash flooding, things of that nature, you're going to want to check and prepare.  I know here recently there's been stories of rescues that have gone down.  One guy was stuck in his vehicle for two weeks.  And the only reason he survived is because he carried on him a gallon of fresh water and a small bag of food supplies in his vehicle at all times.  That is what kept him alive till they found him.  Things to think about, folks.  Gonna leave a link?  Follow me on Twitter for more.  It's been Dabu7.  Much love, y'all. ",
