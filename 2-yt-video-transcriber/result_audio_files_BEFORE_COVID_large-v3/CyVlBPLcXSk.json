I recorded this maybe like four months ago.  When I very first started auditing and I wasn't too sure of myself.  I wasn't too sure of my words.  But y'all know I keep it 100 with y'all.  I'm sorry.  And for the people that don't understand what that means, I tell the truth.  I like to be open and honest with y'all.  It's called transparency.  See how I break that down for you?  This is just, it's like a two and a half minute video.  I just posted this here just to give y'all something to watch and And again, and I always take constructive criticism.  I like feedback.  Tell me what you think about it.  It was when I first started again, so you could hear the unsureness in my voice.  I mean, but.  Again, I like to have fun with cops verbally because I don't think cops can out-talk me when it comes to my verbal judo skills.  That's not something I'm bragging about.  That's something I just know for a fact.  I am very good when it comes to my vernacular.  Again, I have fun with this.  It's a short video.  I wasn't going to post it because there's not much to it.  But then again, you know, I love y'all.  I do this for y'all.  So I'm going to post it.  Y'all watch this.  I'm gone.  That didn't work yet.  Okay, I'm gone forever this time.  Bye. ",
