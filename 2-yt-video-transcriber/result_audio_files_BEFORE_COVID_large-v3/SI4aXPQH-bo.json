They did not make any media, certainly not Vogue magazine, the gatekeeper here.  The framers of the Constitution said that in order to run for president, in order to be qualified to be president, you have to have been born here, you had to have lived here for 14 years, and you have to be 35 years or older.  Now, if they had wanted to say you had to have been an elected official, they would have, and they didn't for a reason.  They were leaving it to every generation to determine for itself the skill set that that generation feels is most necessary in order to navigate the times in which we live.  And that kind of bias on the part of media, it's very insidious, it's very subtle.  It's a suggestion that only those who have elected office in their past are qualified.  Now this is not in any way to minimize or to disparage those qualifications, but there are other kinds of qualifications.  And Franklin Roosevelt said, that the primary aspect of the presidency, he said the administrative aspect is secondary, and the primary role, he said, is moral leadership.  So this should not be anybody's decision but the American people. ",

If you look at Marianne2020.com, if you look at my issues section, which has been up there since the beginning, I have very detailed policy plans.  However, I also remarked that when John Kennedy said we are going to the moon, he didn't say, I'm going to talk to all these NASA scientists and see if maybe we can make it happen.  I'm talking about the role of imagination in inspiring people.  I'm talking about what it takes to actually motivate people.  And that is going to be necessary if we are going to defeat Donald Trump.  Donald Trump did not win just because of the people who are passionate about him.  Donald Trump also won because of many people who did not vote and many people who voted third party.  So if he's going to win again, it won't be just because of people who are so excited about him.  If he wins again, it would be because not enough people were inspired.  And my point is that we have to talk about a vision for this country, not just prosecuting against what was, which is necessary, but also inspiring what America can be.  I think people are exhausted of the fight.  And what I'm talking about is a vision for America, addressing the things we need to address in order for the United States to be better than ever in the 21st century.  And without that, we will not win in 2020. ",

But a pillar of my campaign is to address the chronic trauma of millions of American children who go to school every day in classrooms that don't even have the adequate school supplies with which to teach a child to read.  And if a child cannot learn to read by the age of eight, the chances of high school graduation are drastically decreased, and the chances of incarceration are drastically increased.  Many of these children, millions of them, go to school hungry.  Millions of them live in what are called America's domestic war zones, where psychologists tell us that they are experiencing a level of PTSD that is no less severe than the PTSD of a returning veteran from Afghanistan or Iraq.  Now, their despair is simply normalized by the political establishment.  To me, we should be rescuing these children no differently than if they were the victims of a natural disaster.  It is a pillar of my campaign.  That's why I want a Department of Children and Youth.  I want, just like Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, has said she wants New Zealand to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.  I want every school in the United States to be a palace of learning.  That is not nothing.  These children, to me, this is a civil rights issue.  How much the despair of millions and millions of children.  just because they're not old enough to work, so they have no financial leverage, they're not old enough to vote, so they're not a constituency, their needs are routinely dismissed.  That should not happen in the United States of America. ",
