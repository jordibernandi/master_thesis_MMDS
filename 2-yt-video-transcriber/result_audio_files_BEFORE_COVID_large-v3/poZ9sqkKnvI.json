As I was going home, the Lord, real quickly, He said, Jesse, do you like your plane?  Now, you know, I thought that's an odd statement.  I said, well, certainly, Lord.  He said, do you really like it?  And I thought, well, yes, Lord.  He said, then he said this, so that's it?  I didn't know how to handle it for a minute.  I went, what?  He said, you're going to let your fate stagnate?  And when he said that, that shocked me.  I went, whoa, wait.  I literally unbuckled my seatbelt, my plane, and I stood up.  My pilots looked at me and said, do you need something?  I said, no, no, I'm talking to God right now.  They didn't believe.  And he went back to flying.  I said, Lord, I don't think I was letting my faith stagnate.  He said, so this is all I could ever do.  I said, you're trying to tell me something.  He said, go to the book of Amos.

Doesn't that sound exactly like something Jesus would say?  Apparently it's only hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven if that rich man isn't trying to get even richer.  Also, the excuse that he can't get to where he needs to preach on commercial flights doesn't explain why he uses his private jets to go on ski vacations and safaris.  Not only does Copeland think he needs a private jet, he even has his own airport.  It's in his backyard, next to his multi-million dollar house.  And you'd think that Copeland would be better prepared for Inside Edition, since this isn't the first time they've confronted him.  Here's what an earlier encounter looked like.  It's reactions like this that make me think that he knows that he doesn't need all that stuff.  He gets defensive because he knows it's indefensible.  If he did need it, he wouldn't get so flustered by folks who ask him about it.  He'd just give them a straight answer.  It's only after he has time to confabulate a weird excuse about tube demons that he has any kind of response.  Folks like Copeland, Popoff, Tilton, and Baker can get away with what they do because their followers are willing to look the other way in exchange for having their beliefs affirmed.  Jim Baker was convicted and imprisoned for defrauding his followers, and he's back on TV selling these weird buckets full of food.  Popoff told people that God gave him information about his congregation when James Randi proved that he was really receiving the information via a radio earpiece.  Did this end Popoff's career?  Nope.  He later started offering what he called miracle spring water.  that would magically heal you and bring you money somehow.  Now, perhaps the folks who continue to give these people money don't know that they are proven frauds, but I wouldn't be surprised if they simply don't care.  Folks giving money to Copeland, Baker, and Popoff don't just do so because they make absurd promises about miraculous healings and financial rewards.  They do so because they say all the right Christian things.  If you go through the motions of confirming conservative Christian dogma, the most committed followers will overlook everything else.
