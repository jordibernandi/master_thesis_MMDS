            "text": "Well, howdy there, Internet people.  It's Beau again.  So tonight we're going to start off talking about a guy named Dick Marcinko.  Now, this is the guy that built SEAL Team 6.  And when you think of SEALs, you're probably thinking of 6.  The image of a SEAL comes from them.  Okay, now just to go ahead and head this off in the comments section.  Yes, I am aware he was convicted of a crime.  I'm aware of that.  He made a lot of enemies over the course of his career, and it certainly appears to me from looking at it that this was a case of those enemies getting even.  It looks like a case of, here's the man, now show me the crime.  At the end of the day, he got convicted and sent to prison for a $100,000 kickback scheme in a unit that had a black budget.  It doesn't even make sense.  He's a pretty bright guy.  If he wanted to skim a little bit of money, there were a whole lot of ways to do it that didn't leave a paper trail.  And the other comment that always comes up about him is that he's arrogant.  Most of the people who say that have never met him.  I have, twice.  Once I shook his hand and was in his presence for 20-30 minutes.  Once I actually talked to him for a little bit.  And because of that, I can say with 100% certainty, yeah, he is.  He is a pretty arrogant dude.  At the same time, Silver Star, four Bronze Stars, Legion of Merit, and built the most elite fighting unit on the planet.  Yeah, maybe he's a little arrogant.  Maybe he earned it.  And part of it, I think, is his brand, to be honest.  I think he actually... plays up his arrogance, to be honest.  But, whatever.  What I want to talk about is him building SEAL Team 6.  Because there was something, he did something that I found very unique and very, very interesting.  When he was pulling guys to go to this unit, when he was picking the very first guys for this unit.  He didn't pull guys that were at the top of their class at Bud's, Bud's Asil School, for those that don't know.  He did not, that's not where he got them.  He looked for the guys that were, that had to struggle to make it through it because he knew that they had suffered and He knew that they had the psychological fortitude to make it through BUDS and therefore would be what he needed in combat.  It was amazing.  That's an interesting thought.  And it's not one that I would second guess, really.  It makes sense.  And for those that don't know, BUDS is... If it's not the hardest course in the military, it's in the top three.  It's a meat grinder.  I've known quite a few guys that went and didn't make it.  And these are tough guys.  So... That was something that always stuck with me because this guy is widely regarded as the ultimate team builder.  And that's who he looked for.  So for the last, no, not even few, but for quite a while, I've been stalking the incel boards.  Because of that, I know you guys are watching this.  You guys seem to post anything that has to do with you.  And while you're watching it, take it for what it is.  Take it for what it is.  All right, so this is what I have kind of observed.  These guys are intelligent, extremely intelligent.  On a general level, when you're talking about the average person on these boards in this group that self-identifies as an incel, they're smart.  They're extremely self-aware and very critical of themselves.  There's a lot of misogyny, a lot of it.  Some of it can be written off as a defense mechanism.  There's a lot of racism, but not all of it is supremist racism.  Some of it is... It's weird because I've never seen it anywhere else.  I knew a couple of military contractors.  One was from Ireland and one was Colombian, of Colombian descent.  There are derogatory terms for people from these countries that both end in \"-ic\".  And that's what their men called them.  Their men called them that.  God help anyone else who did.  It's camaraderie, almost.  And that's a lot of what I see.  Now, don't get me wrong, there is a lot of real racism there.  Supremist racism.  But, at the same time, there's also that camaraderie, and it kind of blends.  It's weird.  Aside from that, those are general observations.  Aside from that, there's three kinds of incel.  Outside looking in at first, it seems like it's one group.  One group of guys.  It's not.  There's three different groups.  The first group are guys who are ugly.  And I don't mean that in the sense of, well, they're not really attractive.  I mean, they're guys who are so unattractive, it doesn't matter how good their personality is.  Odds are, they're never going to have a meaningful relationship.  It's going to take a really strong woman to get past it.  And when I told somebody I was going to say that, they're like, you can't say that about people.  I'm like, I don't think they're going to take offense to it.  I think there may be a group of them that are actually happy.  somebody finally said it.  So that's the first group.  The second group, they look normal.  You would not look at them and say, you know, well, this guy's an incel.  But they have a psychological issue or some cognitive problem that puts them in the same boat.  Realistically, they're never going to date.  It doesn't matter if you look like the dude from Frontier if you have Tourette's and walk around screaming profanity all the time.  That makes dating really hard.  So those are the first two groups.  And then the third group, there's nothing wrong with.  They don't have those same characteristics.  They have bad disposition or bad personality, things that can be changed.  For the first two groups, not a lot of self-work is going to fix the problem.  You know, there's a point where there's only so much that can be done.  And some of these guys are genuinely past that.  Some of them are low self-esteem and maybe think they're worse off than they are.  But some of them are genuinely past that.  But that third group, they're just not dateable because they're not good people.  But here's the interesting part, and this is the part that blew my mind, because as self-aware as they are, I hadn't seen any of them comment on this.  Guess which group most of the violent rhetoric and talk of suicide comes from?  The third group.  I have to believe that it has something to do with why Marcinko chose the guys at the bottom of the class.  The psychological fortitude that it takes for those first two groups to have made it this far and not already take the easy way out, it says something about them.  Guys, I wish I had some sage advice for you.  I don't.  I don't.  A lot of your assessments, they're accurate.  They're accurate.  I don't know a way where you're going to get what you want.  I don't know anything for some of you that you're right.  You're never going to get the picket fence, man.  And I feel for you.  I really do.  Life has dealt you a pretty raw deal.  But at the same time, Keep in mind that when the man that is widely regarded as one of the greatest small unit warriors of the 20th century was looking for people that were capable of the impossible, he looked for guys like you.  He looked for people that had suffered, that had that psychological fortitude.  Maybe you can put it to some good use.  Maybe you can use that.  Now, I know what you're saying.  Why would you want to help society when society has done nothing for you?  There's going to be people like you after you.  And if you don't change society for the better, it's going to be the same for them.  Killing people, killing yourself, it's not the answer.  It's not going to change society.  The only thing it's going to do is add a level of fear to people like you.  And so it's going to add yet another layer of isolation to them.  You're not going to make it better for the people after you.  You're going to make it worse.  Anyway, it's just a thought.  I'll have a good night. ",
