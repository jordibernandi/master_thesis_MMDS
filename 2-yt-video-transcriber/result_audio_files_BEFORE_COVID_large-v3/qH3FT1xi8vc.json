            "text": "No.  No, they're not identical.  But as you can see, the design of the men's razor is very different than the design of the woman's razor.  Not to mention that the Twilight Soleil features lavender-scented handles.  Is that cent worth the extra money?  Probably not.  And while these razors are clearly different from each other, one could make the argument that they're similar enough that they should cost about the same.  With that said, the Daily Show's claim that there was a $2 price difference wasn't sitting right with me, so I decided to confirm it for myself.  So I went to the D'Agostino supermarket where The Daily Show taped their video.  First off, they don't sell razors in the aisle.  D'Agostino keeps their razors in a locked case in the front of the store.  Furthermore, the store doesn't even sell the Flex 3 or the Twilight Soleil.  Which means they were only using the D'Agostino for a shooting location and not for its products.  And since The Daily Show got the pain relievers from CVS, I thought that maybe they got the razors from there too.  And while CVS.com does sell the Twilight Soleil for $749, they do not sell the Flex 3 online.  So I went to several CVS locations and found that none of them sold the Twilight Soleil or the Flex 3 in store.  But the pink tax is so insidious that if I went to another retailer, the woman's razor would cost more than the men's, right?  I went to a Duane Reade and found that the Twilight Soleil cost $8.49.  And the Flex 3 cost $8.99.  Wait, the men's costs 50 cents more?  The patriarchy must be slipping.  So I went to a Rite Aid.  There, the Twilight Soleil cost $7.79 and the Flex 3 cost $8.79.  This can't be right.  How can the men's cost more than the woman's?  This is going against the secret rules of the pink tax.  Then I went to this discount store where the Twilight Soleil cost $4.99 and the Flex 3 cost $5.99.  but my pink tax. ",

What I found is that a 32-pack of both men's and women's underwear cost exactly the same price.  But as you can see, the packaging is very different from the ones seen in The Daily Show, and there's a reason for that.  Back in July 2016, Congresswoman Speier held a pink tax press conference and featured these two packages of CVS brand adult underwear, showing that the women's cost $2 more than the men's, and that the men's package contained four more items than the women's.  Cut to 2019, and the same exact packs of undergarments shown in the press conference are now magically the same price.  But here's the fun part.  CVS hasn't sold those diapers in over two years.  When I called CVS customer service, A representative told me that the retailer discontinued the ones with the green packaging back in January 2017.  The new SKU comes in a black package and has an odor guard feature that the older ones didn't have.  That means that Representative Spear has a bunch of adult undergarments that haven't been made in years just sitting around her office.  I'd say that the Congresswoman needs a diaper change.
