            "text": "Hello, my name is Kit Cabello, and I'm one of the main hosts of Heartlands Media and also of Chicago Corner.  The purpose of this video is a discussion of Tulsi Gabbard, her campaign, and the conflict between progressive media outlets.  We know both organizations that are basically in a conflict right now, and that's TYT with Anna Kasparian, as well as Mi Casa, Su Casa, Nico House.  To clear the record, we know the Young Turks due to the fact that myself and Daniel and Paul are... former members of TYT Chicago and Wolfpack Illinois.  Our time with those two organizations, we managed to get SJR 42 passed in the Illinois State Senate and House, thus making Illinois the third state to call for and Article 5 Convention to get money out of politics.  Plus, when we were with TYT Chicago, we managed to get Cenk Uygur and Anna Kasparian to come to Chicago to visit the members of TYT Chicago.  Since then, myself and Daniel have appeared twice on TYT, being interviewed by Cenk Uygur, who is the main host of The Young Turks.  Our relationship was Nico House.  He is a progressive independent reporter like us, and he has been collaborating with us on a few projects earlier on before we started doing our livestream show.  Plus, he's been giving us advice on how to really build our network and how we can really reach out to progressives and independents.  This is a very difficult story to talk about because we feel that this conflict between progressives is counterintuitive to the main goal, which is to create a better future and to really have strong progressive candidates on the American political landscape.  What I will be discussing is something that myself and my team have been going over in regards to the timeline that really led up to this conflict between progressive independent media outlets over Tulsi Gabbard.  On March 24th, Anna Kasparian, one of the main hosts and showrunners of The Young Turks, stated that Tulsi Gabbard is not a progressive. ",

Even Cenk Uygur was taken back by that statement.  It should be noted that that video that was played earlier took place on March 24th of 2019.  And it was stated.  also on that same day on Twitter, Anna Kasparian did state that the Gabbard campaign has not accepted the invite to the Young Turks, even though it has been stated by other progressive independent media networks and the campaign that they are coordinating with all of them.  to have Tulsi Gabbard on their shows respectively.  Now, the main tweet from Anna Kasparian that really started this conflict between her and Nico was when she basically stated that Nico House received a lot of compliments from Tulsi Gabbard and that he's basically turning a blind eye to anything in regards to be critical towards Tulsi Gabbard.  Now, in this next tweet, Anna Kasparian mentions that Tulsi Gabbard is hawkish in regards towards terrorism and extremism, but a lot of progressives took issue with this tweet because Tulsi Gabbard's main policy is for the United States to get out of foreign wars and for us to really address the military industrial complex.  And a lot of progressive independent media networks like Nico House have been in full support of these policies.  Now from these tweets, Nico House challenged Anna Kasparian to a debate and posted that video on his YouTube channel. ",

She literally touted on TYT boldly, I'm going to accept a lot of money from corporations.  I want all the money.  All of it.  Packed money, corporate money, industry.  She was all of it in the general election.  Right.  We know Elizabeth Warren is a progressive.  She's a hawk on Venezuela and doesn't have a problem with that, though.  Right.  Of course.  She's a hawk on Syria and doesn't have a problem with that, though.  Of course.  But Anna has disdain for Tulsi Gabbard, but loves Elizabeth Warren.  How much rational sense does that make?  How can you dare say that Tulsi Gabbard, who doesn't take any corporate money, who damn near has an identical domestic platform as Bernie, but is even better in some aspects than Bernie on domestic policies, and is better than everyone bar none on foreign policy?  And so, of course, I challenge Anna because I'm not into the bickering back and forth.  I don't have time to debate on Twitter so you can just try to gas yourself up.  I don't have time for that.

She's young, dynamic, and overall unconventional, which is something voters still seem to desire following the last general election.  A few issues came up that I think are worth exploring.  This is not a takedown or a hit piece on Tulsi.  I still think she's a fascinating candidate.  I still think she has several attributes that place her above many of the other Democrats running.  But it would be misleading and unfair to my audience if I pretended there weren't some concerns for progressives.  Tulsi was also extremely critical of Obama's refusal to use the phrase radical Islamic terrorism, which was a common criticism coming from the right wing.  According to a source who spoke to The Hill, Bannon loves Tulsi Gabbard, loves her, wants to work with her on everything.  She would fit perfectly, too, inside the administration.  There were other foreign policy issues Tulsi agreed with Republicans on.  She wouldn't have approached the Iran nuclear deal from the framework of diplomacy.  A photo from the event shows Gabbard posing with avid Trump supporters Rabbi Shmuley and Miriam Adelson, the wife of Sheldon.  Now, keep in mind, though, Miriam Adelson is the type of person who's been very vicious against Palestinians and even considers them a made-up people.  While these foreign policy concerns are legitimate, I want to end this segment by noting that there are some great progressive policies that Tulsi supports.  She's a fighter for Medicare for all, supports a $15 minimum wage, and understands the severity and urgency of climate change.  Her camp has been in touch with TYT to schedule a possible interview, and I look forward to chatting with her about the issues I raised in this segment. ",

A number of her supporters accused me of smearing Gabbard after I brought up her voting record and past statements in support of the war on terror.  So I want to make a few things clear.  It is not my job to participate in political pageantry.  even if I'm inclined to agree with most of the policy proposals of the politician in question.  It's also not my job to smear candidates.  For me, to smear someone, I would have to make things up about them.  Considering the various examples I presented of Representative Gabbard sharing her views in her own words on cable news shows, it's pretty obvious that I haven't made anything up.  It's normal and also responsible to look into someone's record as they're running for president and share thoughts, opinions, and concerns in response.  I did that with Joe Biden on this show.  I've done the same with Kamala Harris, Kristin Gillibrand, and other candidates on TYT's main show.  Regardless of my critiques, I've never received the type of backlash I did when covering Gabbard.  Not only do I stand by my reporting and analysis, I condemn any attempt to silence me when it comes to any politician.  Although I would have loved to ask Gabbard about the issues raised in my previous episode of No Filter, I was informed by her camp that I would not be part of the interview she had with TYT last Friday.  It was surprising and a very surprising demand, considering no other candidate had done the same, regardless of how critical I've been about their positions in the past. ",

However, if we look at previous interviews such as the Joe Rogan podcast, Jordan Sheridan's interview, Michael Tracy's interview, the Nico House interview, the Kim Iverson interview, the Jimmy Dore interview, as well as interviews from corporate media such as the CNN Town Hall, the MSNBC Roundtable, her interview with Tucker Carlson, none of those situations similar to what happened at TYT that Anna Kasparian is making ever happened to those respective shows.  We also reached out to three people who were a part of this process and they have indicated that nothing like that happened to them when they were interviewing Tulsi Gabbard.  It should be noted that from previous interviews that Cenk Uygur has done in the past, he has never let any one of his guests command or dictate him what they can and cannot be asked when they appear on his show and on his network.  We are not taking any sides in this situation.  However, Anna's statement does not match up to TYT's policy in regards when they interview guests, the three people that we reached out to, as well as the previous interviews from other independent media networks and from corporate media.  However, if Anna Kasparian has hard evidence or people from TYT studios will step up to say that that's what happened when Tulsi Gabbard came to their studio, then this argument becomes something completely different and calls into question how Tulsi Gabbard and her campaign handles interviews.  So, Anna Kasparian, if you have this kind of evidence, please reach out to HeartLens Media so that there's a solid conclusion to this series of events.  We are on good terms with Nico House and the Young Turks, and so we want to call out for a moderated discussion in regards to everything that has happened since then about Tulsi Gabbard, this presidential election cycle, and really get to a final conclusion.  We all want to build a better future, and a lot of people watch independent media because Independent media is where people get the facts and are informed about the issues impacting them.  It's distressing that we are attacking each other now this early on.  And if we really want to build a better future, this senseless infighting has to stop.  Look, this is a call out to all the fans of independent media and progressive media.  Please tweet this out, share this so that we can end this because it's senseless for us to be going at each other when in fact there are bigger issues to talk about.  This is Kit with HeartLens Media.  Peace, everyone.  Please make sure you're subscribed.  Hit that ring bell notification.  Follow us on Twitter, Instagram, on Facebook.  And if you support independent media, we have a Patreon account.  Your support is the main heart and backbone to everything that we do.  Peace to all of you and to everyone who's watching.  Let us all do what we can to build a better future, not only for ourselves, but for the next generation to follow. ",
