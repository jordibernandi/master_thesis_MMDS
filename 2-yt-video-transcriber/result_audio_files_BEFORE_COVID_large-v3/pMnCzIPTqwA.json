And I was going to resist saying this, but seeing as you've said I look like a drug user and that I'm old and that I'm a wannabe gangster or gang member, why should I hold back?  I cannot but notice, Philip, you've got three times more subscribers than me and yet your video views are a fraction of mine.  What does that tell you?  This video in particular, I think it's been on your channel for over a week and it's got 1,500 views.  This video you're watching now, if you get to see it, will have 1,500 views in the first 24 hours.  So, dare I say, there may be an element of jealousy involved.
