Does the rose still bloom in the desert?  Does the olive tree bask in the sun?  Do the children laugh?  Are the soldiers home?  Is the age-old fighting done?  Has Messiah come?  Has the King returned?  Are we saved?  Oh, blessed be He.  When the King comes home to the land He loves, can we live?  Can we pray?  Can we be?  Israel, my love.  Israel, my promised.  Chosen of God.  Chosen for me.  Homeland forever Land of Messiah.  Israel my love.  How God watches Amen. ",
