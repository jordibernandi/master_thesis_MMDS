If it were about science, it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.  So what you're seeing here is a political movement and a religious movement, and it's fulfilling religious and political goals of the left, but it isn't doing very much for science. ",

And Michael Knowles is trying to make a name for himself in the very small, squirrely shadow of Ben Shapiro by being an equally terrible person.

Again, can you imagine being that much of a soulless monster?  No, her diagnosis, Greta Thunberg, has given her the ability to see the big picture and not care about the day-to-day minutiae and BS that so consumes your life, Michael Knowles.  Her diagnosis has given her the extraordinary perspective to understand the depths of what we face with climate change, how dire it actually is.  you craven, cruel man, Jesus, and you know he has to be in the wrong because his statements were too far even for Fox News.  Fox News apologized for the comments on Monday night and said the network had no plans for Knowles to appear as a guest on future shows.  In addition to on-air appearances, Knowles writes opinion articles on foxnews.com.  The comment made by Michael Knowles, who was a guest on the story tonight, was disgraceful.  We apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.  a fox news spokesperson said translation michael knowles will take a breather from writing right-wing propaganda on the fox news website.  um so fox news doesn't have to get bad press for having guests and columnists who attack children and call them mentally ill.  The point is that the right has no facts when it comes to Greta Thunberg because the science is all on her side.  Science otherwise known as facts.  And I hear from your daddy Ben Shapiro that facts don't care about your feelings.  But you seem to have a lot of emotions when it comes to Greta Thunberg.  Hmm.  I don't really care about your feelings.  I don't really care about your insecurities.  The facts are on her side.  The facts are on our side.  The facts are on the side of the science.  And you might want to get used to that because your insecurity is showing a little bit, buddy. ",
