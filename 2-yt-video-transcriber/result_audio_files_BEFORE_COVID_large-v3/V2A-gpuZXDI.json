Hello everyone, my name is Aurelia Rita from Africa Web TV and today we are here in Paris for the Rugby Sevens and I'm curious to know how do people celebrate this game?  What is it about this game that people like so much?  So come with me and then I'll show you how Afropians and Friends of Africa do in terms of rugby.  So, join me.  Come, let's go.  i'm a king.  yes i'm a king.  let's go let's go let's go.  I'm here with Simpson.  Simpson who?  Osiemo.  Where are you from?  Nakuru, a small village, a little further from Nairobi, everybody knows.  And in Europe, where do you stay?  I don't stay in Europe, I stay in Nakuru.  So you came all the way from Nakuru?  Yes.  Just for the game?  Yes.  Amazing.  Tell us what you expect today.  Well, I don't expect us to get relegated.  I love Kenya rugby.  I mean, I've played rugby.  I've been a long supporter of both Kenya 15s and Kenya 7s.  And I believe the sport that we have right now is good enough to stay up for this season.  You're from Kenya, but I'm curious to know what part of Europe are you from or did you come from?  Scandinavia, Denmark.  Denmark.  You came all the way from Denmark just for the game?  Yes, yes, yes.  How did you find the game and how did you find the guys?  Interesting, and guys are working hard.  They still need kidogo support here and there.  But that's why we're here.  My name is Collins, and this is my lovely sister.  And I came all the way from Dubai to support the Kenyan team.  Wow.  And I made the most loudest noise.  I almost lost my voice today, but wherever the Shuda team will go, I will go.  Oh my God, the vibe is so energetic.  We're just oozing so much happiness.  What do you think of the game today?  The game is perfect.  First of all, we drew.  And then, we lost.  So I hope we win.  In life, you have these three stages.  You win, you draw, you lose.  And we only have a win left.  Yeah, so I'm hoping that next year I'll be coming here and still hyper, Kenyan is still there.  Let's go!  Let's go Kenya, let's go!  Let's go Kenya, let's go!  Let's go Kenya, let's go!  Let's go Kenya, let's go!  Let's go Kenya, let's go!  My name is Teddy Omondi, I'm the President of the Minister of Rugby France.  It's a worldwide movement of fanatics of rugby and many Kenyan servants who travel all over the world to watch the games.  Because as I noted today, there was South Africa and there was Kenya, but then the turnout was really amazing.  What do you think is the approach towards that?  Because there are a lot more Kenyans than, you know, like Kenyan fans than... The crowd is a bit different.  South Africans, I know, they are trying to franchise their movement using Braille.  And they're building, this is the second year they're trying to build their network.  As the Minister of Rugby, we have about 30,000 followers on social media and 40,000 who visit our websites.  It's easier to market rugby events and guys follow Kenya Sevens all over the world.  My name is Jerry.  And I'm based in Tennessee, the United States.  So I'm curious to know, did you come all the way from the US or you already had something like that?  No, I came for rugby.  I usually, I have a Europe trip every year.  I try to.  And then it somehow coincides with rugby.  So, yeah.  So for me, first of all, it's Shuja Sevens.  And then it's Rugby Sevens.  So because we love the team and we love the sport in general, you know, there's nothing that is too much for us to do.  It's in the blood.  We can do it.  We organize through viral ways, through Facebook and through other ways.  And somehow we end up all here together.  You are a wonderful people.  Yes.  We make so many noise.  Yes.  And you are just wonderful people who are loving rugby.  You are absolutely incredible.  And you are crazy to come in Paris to see the guys to play rugby.  You are welcome in our country.  We are crazy?  Yes.  But the show is very great.  Yeah.  You are all welcome in our country.  Thank you.  Merci beaucoup.  Every time in the year.  Thank you very much.  Let's go Kenya!  Let's go Kenya!  Let's go Kenya!  Let's go!  We love you!  We love you!  Bonjour.  My name is Olive and I live in France.  It's been three years here in France.

I'm here for my studies but I love Kenya so much.  For me, rugby comes from the heart.  Deep down from the heart because I've always loved rugby.  I've followed it through.  I'm from Hamburg and we came like a group and It's been an experience actually.  Thank you.  day the game was fine and I'm glad because my fear was like we won't be here next year because I have to come here and support them.  but yeah luckily we'll still be here yeah.

Cheers!  Thank you.  Thank you.  There you have it, guys.  Almost losing my voice from all the cheering and stuff.  This was an amazing and a different version of rugby and safaris.
