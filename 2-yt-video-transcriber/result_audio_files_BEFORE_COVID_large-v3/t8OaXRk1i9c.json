            "text": "That session with the children and Senator Feinstein was quite revealing.  They kept trying to point out to her, look, we're the ones who are going to be impacted by the disaster that you're hoping to create.  And the slow reformist steps of the kind you're advocating simply aren't commensurate at all with the scale of the problem.  These kids were making that point very forcefully, and she basically had no answer.  Now, the Sunrise Movement has done pretty remarkable things.  This is mostly young kids.  They're the ones who have a major responsibility for putting the Green New Deal on the public agenda.  That's a pretty remarkable change.  A couple of years ago, this was unheard of.  It was the Sunrise Movement who were joined with a few new women progressive candidates, Ocasio-Cortez in particular, who were able to press to get the Green New Deal idea on the public agenda.  Of course, it's mocked, it's ridiculed, even Nancy Pelosi dismissed it, but it's there and it's getting support, maybe not in the precise, detailed form that was proposed, but something like it.  which is a very significant first step towards trying to address this crisis.  Now, with regard to children, in Europe particularly, there have been a series of large-scale children's strikes.  The children are just walking out of striking, leaving school, protesting against the failure to deal with a major crisis that is going to severely impact their lives and coming generations.  And it's important to recognize just how serious this is.  We're coming pretty close on the, you know, the discussions are mostly about storms and so on.  Okay, that's bad enough.  But we're coming pretty close to the level of warming of 125,000 years ago, when the sea level was about 30 feet higher than it is today.  I simply imagine that.  Now, right now, the huge Antarctic ice sheets are melting more rapidly than had been expected.  There's a huge amount of water there.  That could easily bring us to something like what the world was like 125,000 years ago.  What happens to organized life at that point?  Can you even imagine the consequences of a sea level rise at that time?  Well, it's kind of interesting to see the way across the spectrum how this is being dealt with.  I mean, at the right, say, the Trump administration produced one of the most astonishing documents that has ever existed in human history.  I'm not exaggerating.  A bureaucracy, naturally.  The Transportation Bureau came out with a long, detailed document which basically was arguing, it was leading to the conclusion that we shouldn't have any constraints on emissions in transportation, cars, trucks, and so on.  Just let them emit everything, you know, no matter what.  And they had a very interesting argument.  The argument was, look, at the rate of global warming now taking place, by the end of the century, it'll be maybe, they estimated, you know, seven degrees or something like that, higher.  And by then, we're basically over the cliff anyway.  There's no chance of survival after that.  So what the hell?  Why not just enjoy it while we can?  Of course, the tacit assumption is that everyone in the world is as criminally insane as we are, as they are, you know, and will not try to do anything about it.  Can you find any document like that in human history?  I mean, you know, Nero is supposed to have filled while Rome burned.  These guys are saying, let's enjoy ourselves while the planet burns to make more profit for the next couple of years.  We have to think about the time scales involved.  We're facing urgent problems, too urgent to await a radical transformation of the political and economic system.  So let's take, for example, some concrete cases.  Take the JPMorgan Chase biggest bank.  The CEO, Jamie Dimon, I'm sure knows about everything we're talking about concerning the devastating impact of global warming.  So how does he react?  By investing more funds in fossil fuels, including the most lethal of them, Canadian tar sands.  Now, why is he doing that?  Let's ask about the choices that he has.  In the institutional structures that exist, he basically has two choices.  One, to do exactly what he's doing, to try to maximize profit with a certain knowledge that this is going to have devastating effects in the short term.  The other choice he has is to resign and be replaced by somebody who'll do exactly the same thing.  Those are the choices.  It's, as you mentioned before, it's a deep institutional problem.  Now, the way to confront that in the present situation is pretty much the way the Sunrise Movement is doing and other popular movements are doing and Public Citizen is doing.  Try to develop mass popular action, which will compel people within the existing institutions to act differently.  And of course, at the same time, try to educate the public to understand that there are deep institutional problems that have to be changed.  Now, with regard to Mar-a-Lago and the sea level rise, President Trump has already given the answer to that.  He's a firm believer in global warming.  We know that he recently petitioned the government of Ireland, his business did, for permission to build a wall.  You know, he loves walls.  to build a wall to protect his fancy golf course in Ireland from rising sea levels.  Okay.  So they understand, they know. ",
