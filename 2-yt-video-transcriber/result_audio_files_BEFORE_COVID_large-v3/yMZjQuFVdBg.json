So I was just like poking around on the internet, you know, looking at Flat Earthers YouTube pages because that's what I do.  I respond to people.  You get it, all right?  And I was like, what are these guys subscribed to?  Because sometimes you can see who certain channels are subscribed to.  And I came across... forget who it was.  might have been Mark Sargent but he was like subscribed to somebody and it was just the nuttiest stuff.  it was like completely bonkers crazier than the craziest person I've ever met.  that made me really intrigued as to what everyone else is subscribed to.  I want to look into the minds of the people that are telling us that the world is not shaped like a globe.  A part of me thinks that this is one of the dumbest ideas I've ever had.  Part of me thinks that this is One of the greatest ideas I've ever had.  So, I don't know.  We'll have to see.  You guys know Jarenism.  You may be familiar with the sort of stuff that he puts out.  But this is one of the big guys, one of the go-to guys for Flat Earth content.  What is he subscribed to?  Well, if we go to the channels, well, it doesn't actually show us who he's subscribed to, unfortunately.  And that's what we're going to come across a lot, because you have the option whether or not to show who you're subscribed to.  But he does feature certain channels.  Of course, you have Jarenism Raw, another one of his channels, obviously.  And Globebusters, which I believe he takes part in pretty heavily.  But this last one.  Beyond the Veil.  I don't even know what to say.  This is what made me want to do this.  But his channel trailer.  is Illuminati Insider Reveals the Alien Agenda.  This is the sort of stuff that they watch, presumably.  Maybe they don't, but Jaronism is definitely promoting this channel, so he has to agree with some of this to some extent.  How to Remove Spiritual Implants and Octopus Tentacles Beyond the Veil Quickie.  Once I watched this video, this made me want to make this video and stream that I'm doing now.  You guys have to see this and he post. ",

This has got to be one of the craziest people I've ever seen or heard.  That's all we have for Jarenism.  That's all we know about Jarenism.  That he agrees with this guy to some extent or promotes him or whatever.  So let's go.  Mark Sargent.  You guys probably know Mark Sargent is right.  He's one of the big guys, one of the big players in the Flat Earth community.  And of course, if you go to playlist, you'll see the Flat Earth clues.  And yeah, start here.  This is what he's infamous for.  All right, but let's take a look into the mind of Mark Sargent.  Of course, we're going to have, you know, Flat Earth stuff because Flat Earthers watch Flat Earthers.  It's the circle of conspiracy theories.  And we'll see that he is subscribed to Beyond the Veil.  It doesn't look like he's promoting any channels.  Again, he has Beyond the Veil.  Just looking at this, I'm trying to find something that's not necessarily Flat Earth.  There's, oh, he subscribed to PlanarWalk.  Look at that.  That's interesting.  Is he subscribed to me?  Subscribe to me.  Flat Earth Vegan Witch.  Ooh, we're going to have to come back to that.  The Flat Earth Vegan Witch.  Subscribe to PlanarWalk, but not me.  There we go.  Flat Earth Vegan Witch.

I'm going to move right along.  Phuket World.  This guy, he's one of my favorite guys to respond to because some of the stuff he says is like, really, dude?  Can we see who he's subscribed to?  We can.  This guy, he is Thai.  After all, Phuket is in Thailand.  So, you know, his subscriptions might be a little bit different than American Flat Earthers.  So, okay, so he's subscribed to Conspiracy Music Guru.  Who wouldn't be?  Oh, we got the Flat Earth Vegan Witch and Nana again.  Let's, let's, I, I gotta see, I gotta see.

I want to stock up on, like, Spongebob DVDs, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, that sort of stuff.  I'm going to stock up on those sorts of DVDs so that my kids will have that to watch and only that to watch.  Does he just subscribe to anyone and everyone?  Because, like, how many languages does he know?  Like, this doesn't seem like English, and this doesn't seem like English either.  Um, let's move on.  Yes, this is the last one.  Eric Dubay, Simnet Nutrition, High Carb Hannah.  So he seems to be about diets.
