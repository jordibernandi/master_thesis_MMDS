It's been a while since we've released a new video because I've been really busy preparing big videos to be shown at international men's conferences in Chicago and Toronto this month.  I'll have them up on my channel pretty soon.  But before you watch this, could you please like this video and subscribe to my channel?  YouTube is constantly censoring me and hiding my videos and they'll kill off my whole channel unless you actually help me.  Now, today I'm talking to a woman who went through two years of hell after her 18-year-old son was accused of rape.  I find it so heartbreaking talking to the mothers of young men who've been falsely accused.  I'm disguising personal details of this family because they're still trying to get the son's accuser charged with perjury.  So I'll call this woman, Erin, and she's here on Skype with me today.  Hello, Erin. ",

We were walking down the street and one of the jurors was in a car and she's tooting the horn and waving madly at us as we're walking past with the biggest smile on her face.
