The masters were the minority group, a small amount of individuals who were the wealthy, the powerful, the nobles, as Nietzsche referred to them, the ones leading the top lives and the ones who could do whatever they wanted.  This group followed master morality.  Now master morality saw good and bad as whatever consequence benefited them or hindered them.  What was good was what made them stronger, wealthier and of course more powerful and what was bad was any consequence that reduced this.  So Master Morality was consequential.  The only concern was furthering the desire, reaching higher status and working towards the goals of the Masters.  So for Master Morality, what was truly valued were things like glory, ambition, power, wealth, artistic creativity, strength and courage. ",

They want what the masters have, but they cannot achieve this.  They are weak, they are cowards, they are not noblemen.  However, over time, the herd will eventually have a moral revolt in order to deal with the tough lives they lead and their inability to get what they want.  Instead of valuing what they want but cannot have, they begin to denigrate it, they devalue master morality and they turn what they do have into a virtue.  This is slave morality.  A new form of good and evil is now created.  So, having riches now becomes greed, a vice.  Being poor and having very little is now humility, a virtue.  Wanting glory and fame is now narcissism and self-adoration, a vice.  Being oppressed means being obedient, a virtue.  Not having sex meant purity, another virtue.  And being strong and taking what you want means having wrath and violence, a vice.  But being weak, unable to take revenge meant you were being forgiving, a virtue.  And ultimately, if the slave cannot have power, then no one can.  And so taking away the master's wealth, power and status was now the ultimate virtue of equality. ",

The teachings of Jesus was for the oppressed, the downtrodden, the weak, The Herd.  It was centered around all humans being the same in the eyes of God, turning the other cheek, being friendly to your neighbor and practicing forgiveness.  However, at the same time, horrible stories about hell and eternal suffering scared people into following slave morality and making sure it becomes the dominant moral code.  Okay Nietzsche saw that over time the weak majority do end up taking control of the powerful minority and as Christianity spread across the western world the masters were now subject to slave morality and the desire for strength and power could be suppressed.  Slave morality is there to deny everyone what they truly want The will to power. ",

It is either slave morality or master morality and nothing in between, when even the slightest bit of investigation will show you that it is not that straightforward and that easy.  There are perhaps many rich, strong, powerful men who consider themselves Christian.  There are many people who value wealth, strength and nobility.  yet they each practice forgiveness, they give to the poor, they practice monogamy or even celibacy.  They are in positions of power and they are trying to increase this, so they practice master morality, yet they value duty, humility and forgiveness, all characteristics of slave morality.
