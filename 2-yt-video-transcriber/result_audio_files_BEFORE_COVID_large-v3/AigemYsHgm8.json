            "text": "Do you remember that just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, the Washington Post, a terrible newspaper, that doesn't know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they might have gotten it pretty correct.  They said, the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.  That was the headline.  Little did we know they weren't playing games.  Think of that.  That was 19 minutes after the oath of office.  Months earlier, Peter struck.  Remember, he and his lover, Lisa Page.  What a group.  She's going to win.  10 million to one, she's gonna win, I'm telling you, Peter.  I'm telling you, Peter, she's gonna win.  Peter, oh, I love you so much.  I love you, Peter.  I love you, too, Lisa.  Lisa, I love you.  Lisa.  Lisa.  Oh, God, I love you, Lisa.  And if she doesn't win, Lisa, we've got an insurance policy, Lisa.  We'll get that son of a bitch out.  We got an insurance policy.  And we're living through the insurance policy.  That's what it is.  The phony Russia hoax.  Lisa, I love you.  Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate.  13 months, they gotta move fast because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it despite the phony, despite the phony polls that you see all the time.  They're phony polls.  You know, polls are no different.  Remember I always used to talk about polls?  I know polls very well.  Polls are no different than crooked writers.  They're crooked polls.  They're crooked polls.  No different.  Well, that's a lot of media.  Look back there.  That's a lot of media.  They are so dishonest, and frankly, they are so bad for our country.  They are so bad.
