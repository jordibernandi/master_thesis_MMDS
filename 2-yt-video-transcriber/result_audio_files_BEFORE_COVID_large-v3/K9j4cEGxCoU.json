            "text": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Brighthop, and this is another episode of the Unboxing Authority.  On this episode, I am going to show you how to get rid of the Google search bar on your phone without rooting your phone or anything like that.  It's very simple.  I used FDroid to do it, but you can also use the Play Store.  So what you're going to need to do, it's really simple, okay, is if you want to see how to disable the Google search and all that, and, you know, OK Google and all that on Google Assistant, go check out my other video first.  So you see I have Open Launcher installed.  We've got to install Open Launcher.  Now, it is available in the Play Store.  It's not just available in FDroid.  So I'm going to go ahead and open this up.  and we're gonna look for Open Launcher.  And there are plenty of other launchers you can use.  Okay, so now that we've found it, we just click on it like this.  You go ahead and install it.  Okay, once it's installed, all you have to do is push your home button, and it comes up and says open launcher down here.  We're going to click on open launcher.  Now we're in open launcher.  Now, open launcher by default doesn't have any of these icons here.  It doesn't have DuckDuckGo.  Okay, all you have to do is click this button, and all your apps that you have installed um you can put on your desktop.  okay so what we're going to do is let's add google chrome.  i don't use google chrome but let's go ahead and add it to the desktop.  okay just like that now if i wanted to i could put it down here in one of these areas but i'm going to put it up here or i can drag it over and create a new desktop over here.  put it over there i'm going to put it here.  Okay, now I have my DuckDuckGo search installed.  All you got to do to do that is go back to your Google Play Store.  Okay, or you can use FDroid either way.  And we're going to install DuckDuckGo.  Now I like installing DuckDuckGo and everything else using FDroid just because I trust FDroid.  Let's go ahead and backspace all that other.  If you do use F-Trade, you need to enable all repositories under the settings in order to get it to work because some of them don't work.  Duck, duck, go.  I am using the phone upside down, so... So there it is, and you just install, and once it's installed, all you gotta do, now with this, once you check the open launcher, you can hit use just once or always, and then that way it will become your default.  And I don't see anything wrong with this launcher, so eventually I'm gonna hit always, but for the purposes of the video, I have it to where I can still switch between them easily.  Okay, so now we wanna add the DuckDuckGo search bar, so I'm gonna go ahead and remove this search bar first, whoops, So to remove, you have to hold it down, and then once the remove shows up, you immediately take your finger off.  With another finger, you hit remove before it goes away.  That's how you remove.  But now we wanna add a widget to this desktop.  So we're gonna go down here.  I held down on an empty space.  I hit widget.  And now we're gonna find DuckDuckGo.  Okay, so we're gonna add a DuckDuckGo.  widget.  There it goes.  And now we have that on there instead of the Google search.  Okay.  Now all we got to do is make this the default.  Um, once you've got your apps exactly where you want them.  And so we're going to go ahead and hit our home button again in the middle or pill button or whatever.  And then you would hit always okay for this launcher.  And, um, I am going to be getting another one of these phones and I'm going to be using another one and this one's going to go somewhere else.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know if I want it permanently set up until I have my phone in front of me.  that's going to be my phone and then I'll set it up to be permanent.  But I just wanted to show you guys that it is possible to do this without ruining your phone because I've searched all over the internet and I was unable to find any tutorials that showed how to remove the Google search without rooting your phone.  and this is the way to do it.  and I mean otherwise you can root your phone you can pay for expensive apps you can do all kinds of things but I just want to do it this way.  also just as a bonus tip for this video if you don't want to use the Facebook app on your phone you don't want Facebook to have access to your phone.  you can install sim social And this app gives you the ability to message and everything.  However, there is another app that you need.  And under FDroid, if you have FDroid installed, let's go to our installed apps.  Where do I see our installed apps?  I should just search for Facebook.  So I searched for Facebook.  There's an app I have installed here.  Here we go.  So there's this app.  It's called the Messenger Bypasser.  You want to have this installed if you're using any alternative app for Facebook because what this does is bypasses the need to have the Facebook Messenger and you can still do your messages and everything without Facebook Messenger installed.  So you definitely want this app installed as well.  But that was just a bonus tutorial for this video and I hope you liked the video.  Personally, I don't need the Google Assistant.  If I wanted a personal assistant and I could hire one, I'd get me a beautiful conservative Christian woman and she would be my assistant.  I don't want Google Assistant.  I don't want Alexa.  I don't want Siri.  I don't want any of those things on any of my devices.  And so in the previous video I showed you how to completely remove or disable, I should say, the Google Assistant and Google Search if you want to.  Now you can leave Google Search enabled.  Now the other thing is I don't use Google Chrome on my phone, I use Waterfox.  There are plenty of alternative browsers out there, okay, for you to use, and so you don't need to use Google Chrome.  There may be some rare instances where the only app that's going to let you access the internet the way you want is, oh, now we're back to the original, I gotta go back to here, okay.  The only app that's going to allow you to browse the Internet the way you want on certain web pages is going to be Google Chrome.  But, you know, for the most part, you don't have to use it.  There's plenty of other ones.  And I would encourage you to use FDroid to find... the browsers that you want to use.  Well, anyways, thanks so much for watching the video.
