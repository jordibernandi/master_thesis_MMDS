            "text": "Oh, you could do it.  And again, like Eddie, you know, I look back to me.  That movie to me was a circle back to my dad's movie called Putney Swope, which I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen to see.  about a black guy who takes over an ad agency in the 60s because everyone votes for him when the head of the company dies because they think no one else will.  And it's about what happens when someone who is free-spirited takes over an essentially corrupt endeavor.  And then he realizes and confronts his own corruption.  But I remember I was probably two or three when that was being shot and when it came out and it was so a part of my upbringing and I just remembered some of the folks that were around my dad at that time.  And so when Ben called and said, hey, I'm doing this thing and, you know, I think maybe Sean Penn had passed on it or something like that, possibly wisely.  And I thought, yeah, I'll do that and I'll do that after Iron Man.  And then I started thinking, this is a terrible idea.  Wait a minute.  And then I thought, well, hold on, dude, get real here.  where's your heart?  And my heart is a, I get to, I get to be black for a summer in my mind.  So there's something in it for me.  The other thing is I get to hold up to nature, the insane self-involved hypocrisy of artists and what they think they're allowed to do on occasion.  Just my opinion.  And also Ben, who is a masterful artist and director, probably the closest thing to a Charlie Chaplin that I've experienced in my lifetime.  He writes.  He directs.  He acts.  If you had seen him when he was directing this movie, you would have been like, I'm watching David Lean.  I'm watching Chaplin.  I'm watching Coppola.  He knew exactly what the vision for this was.  He executed it.  It was impossible to not have it be an offensive nightmare of a movie.  And \u2013 90% of my black friends are like, dude, that was great. ",
