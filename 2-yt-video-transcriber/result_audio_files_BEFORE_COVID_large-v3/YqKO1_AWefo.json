            "text": "Israel is the only country in the world that violates women's rights.  Wait, what?  That's according to a UN resolution backed by countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Pakistan.  Israel, the country where over 80% of the female population have college degrees.  The country that elected a female prime minister before the UK or the USA.  The country where women hold positions of power in the army, politics, education, healthcare, high tech, like myself, and in nearly every single field.  So why would the UN single out Israel?  Because the countries pushing this resolution are abusing the language of human rights and social justice in order to mislead us.  They have their own agenda to distract you from their abuses at home, where, for example, In Iran, women are imprisoned for removing hijab and are forbidden from activities like dancing or smoking in public.  In Yemen, child marriage is rampant, with over two-thirds of the female population entering into arranged marriages before age 18, and 30% of the female population has suffered through female genital mutilation.  In Saudi Arabia, women are frequently punished for the sin of being alone with a man.  In Pakistan, honor killings, acid attacks, and forced marriage are commonplace.  And who is standing up for those women?  Apparently, no one.  When the UN cares more about harming Israel than protecting women, it's women who pay the price. ",
