            "text": "we all know that there can be too much of a good thing but what about porn?  thousands of guys are now saying that it ruined their lives and they're being demonized for giving it up.  It's an upside-down world when guys are saying they want to stop watching pornography and women are calling them misogynists for trying to quit.  Now, I spent the last two weeks looking into this new phenomenon and wrote a lengthy article in the Postmillennial, which I'll put a link to below, and I urge you to go read it.  But there's a lot of stuff that I couldn't fit into that piece, so I want to talk about it here.  But a quick note up front, please be careful in the comments.  If you want to disclose anything, be sure first, and if you're a porn lover, please don't shame anyone.  They're not trying to take away your porn.  First of all, these are not religious groups, and they're not trying to ban porn.  In fact, the most popular resources like nofap.com and a site called Your Brain on Porn were started by individuals who don't identify with any religion and are simply trying to help people manage what is self-described as an addiction.  In a video with over 10 million views called The Great Porn Experiment, Gary Wilson explains how free porn on the internet completely changed the usage levels and created severe problems, especially with people who started as children, who from the age of about 11 often gain access to an endless stream of hardcore images.  We often hear, don't fix something if it ain't broke, but in this case, thousands of people are saying that they're broken.  So, Why would anyone try to stop people from organizing support groups?  That would be kind of crazy.  But not only are these guys being demonized, being called white nationalist hate groups, like we've never seen men trying to help other men called alt-right before, well, there are two lawsuits underway to defend themselves against prolific, relentless false accusations.  In fact, 10 different people ranging from neurosurgeons to licensed therapists to researchers to the young man who founded nofap.com simply trying to help others like himself, all of them have sworn affidavits saying the same individual, a scientist named Dr.  Nicole Prowse, has launched campaigns against them to silence their speech and destroy their careers.  But why?  Why would that happen?  In my research, The whole thing seems to have started in 2013, when a paper featuring Prowse's upcoming study was criticized and then deconstructed by other professionals.  The battle is over whether or not someone can technically be addicted to porn.  Now from a lay perspective, I don't much care what you call it.  If there are thousands of people saying they have a destructive habit that's harming their lives, they shouldn't be mocked or threatened for trying to do something about it.  Now for those porn lovers in my audience, hey, go ahead and fap to your delight.  What we're talking about is people who said that they stopped being able to sexually function unless they were using porn.  And the guys who are speaking out, they have a lot of courage.  It's not the kind of thing that people like to brag about online.  But for them, the problem was so serious that they became dysfunctional.  And when they dared to talk about it, they found out that a lot of other people were having the same problem.  Sure, maybe some scientists are clucking and rolling their eyes at how little people understand their own bodies, but if you feel ill and have symptoms of illness, and a doctor tells you that there's nothing wrong with you, it's infuriating.  Now, while the science isn't yet resolved, Every time a new study comes out supporting sexual addiction as a legitimate condition, those academics end up getting personally attacked, accused of fraud, ethics challenges filed with their licensing board, or being called twisted cyberstalkers when they try to defend their research.  The phenomenon is being compared to the tobacco company scandals when the public was being told that research showed tobacco isn't harmful to your health.  One of the arguments I came across was that porn is healthy to watch.  The problem is that people consistently masturbate while watching it.  So pro-porn scientist says, it's not the porn that's the problem, it's the masturbation.  That's kind of like telling an alcoholic that they aren't addicted because alcohol has positive social benefits.  The real problem is that they drink it.  So why would sexual science academics start going on defamatory relentless six-year campaigns against people who are simply trying to help others.  Certainly it's possible that trying to carve out a niche in psychology is a battlefield, and some folks are incredibly ambitious, but links have started popping up that indicate the porn industry may actually be fueling the animosity.  But unless I see a big fat check written, I'm not convinced that it's more than just a convenient friendship.  In the meantime, there is that massive group of mostly young guys out there looking for peer support and research that can help them to make decisions.  And the attack on them resembles nothing less than disgusting bullying.  And I don't like bullies. ",
