            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we're talking about a pretty SJW celebrity going after our boy, the legend, my personal hero, Chris Pratt.  Famous for playing Star-Lord in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and helming a number of other major blockbusters in recent years, including the Jurassic World series, well... Chris Pratt's star has really been shining bright since about 2014, the last five years.  And too, ever since then, the rabid leftists and social justice warriors have been trying to find ways to either co-opt the guy and bring him in on their liberal causes or, more recently, the liberals have been attacking Chris Pratt for not only committing wrong think and not conforming to their liberal Hollywood norms, but also, Chris Pratt is a pretty big Christian.  And couple that with him also being straight and a white male and, woo, Chris Pratt's got all the things the left really hates these days.  And that brings us to our latest controversy.  Recently, actress Ellen Page attacked Chris Pratt for bringing up his church, claiming it's anti-gay people or something. ",
