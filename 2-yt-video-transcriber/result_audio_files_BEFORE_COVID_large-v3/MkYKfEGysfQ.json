            "text": "There is a level of moral relativity that is just pure observable reality.  Attitudes and morality shifts throughout time.  And unfortunately, in this current era, attitudes in Islam, like most Islam-oriented countries, towards offering civil liberties to homosexuals is, or even women in some respects, not great.  Okay?  This doesn't mean that this is something inherent to Islam.  This doesn't mean that this is a Muslim problem.  This is not rooted within race.  This is not rooted within culture.  These are attitudes that shift throughout time that readjust to the... I mean, not to go back to the same fucking Marxist dead horse, but readjust to material conditions and manifest themselves through leaders who are... utilizing things like ideology, or at least religion in this instance, to gain mass popularity, oftentimes backed by the United States itself.  If you look at Islamic culture, which is not even a monolith, But if you look at Muslim nations in the 50s and 60s, and this is Turkey as well as Iran and Egypt, they are much more modern, much more Western-focused, and much more liberal.  Unfortunately, through destabilization and destruction and puppet leaderships installed, backed by the United States, in the case of Iran, and even in some instances in the case of Egypt now, that attitude has changed completely.  But you know what?  On the other hand, Iran tried to nationalize its oil fields and no longer have a shit deal with the British government.  So, you know, destroying a very progressive, a very liberal Muslim nation by just completely wiping out their administrative faculties and reinstalling a religious puppet.  But you tried to fucking nationalize your extraction industries.  And guess what?  We're not going to allow that in the United States, okay?  We're not going to fucking stand for that.  So sucks to suck.  Fuck you, Iran, right?  But you're never going to hear this kind of analysis from someone like Sam Harris because it doesn't correspond to his internalized, like his internal bigotries towards Islam.  His only perspective here is to vilify Islam as best as possible.  And if you want to effectively vilify Islam, you can't actually analyze the roots to try to figure out why.  This exploited, barbaric interpretation of Islam is so prevalent in Muslim countries and Muslim cultures now when it wasn't the case half a century ago.  when it certainly wasn't the case when Islam, going through its golden age, was the leader in the world with the preservation of culture and texts, the advances that Islamic nations made in the field of medicine, in the field of art, even in the field of arithmetic.  Like, these are in the field of math, yeah.  So, again, These are very complicated.  These are very complicated things.  And in order to simplify them, either you're going to just turn around and vilify an entire fucking region or an entire culture or an entire race of people.  Or... You're just going to have to actually fucking analyze the deep-rooted problems within foreign intervention and Western imperialism and also conservatism, really.  Because what's really frustrating to me is that whenever we talk about ISIS or whenever we talk about the stereotypical big-bearded Muslim man, that is a conservative Muslim.  But because we don't have a better understanding of Islam and we don't have a better understanding of Muslims in general or Muslim culture, you assume that Islam is monolithic.  No, you don't hate Islam.  You hate conservatives.  You hate conservative Muslims.  I am a progressive Muslim.  Do I strike you as someone more?  Do you think that you have more in common with someone like myself than you do with an evangelical Christian fundamentalist?  I don't think so, right?  Again, when Muslims hurt other Muslims or when Muslims throw gay people off roofs in Baghdad or whatever, those other gay people are also Muslim.  It's so weird that progressive Muslims get fucked both in their own countries for the battles that they're fighting against conservatism.  that is cancerous, just like it's cancerous here in America.  But then they also have to fight another additional battle where they have to side with the conservative Muslims against foreign intervention, against Western cultural supremacy, against Western attitudes that just vilify them all as a monolith.  This is why I have no problem with people calling me Muslim or whatever.  I say this to my Turkish friends.  I'm a proud agnostic in Turkey and I'm a proud Muslim in America.  Anyway. ",
