            "text": "Hello there, YouTube.  So, I was recently at a science conference, and during that science conference, there was a sort of public forum-y type thing on global warming that was sort of open to the public, but it was actually at the science conference.  And, you know, on the panel, they had a sort of hippie plus, I guess you would describe him.  You know, I do everything green, yadda yadda yadda.  a little too pious, virtue signalling and all that sort of thing.  There was a woman who, she knew some stuff, which was okay.  There was the chair, who was a scientist, but clearly didn't know much about... the environment and that sort of thing, or the atmosphere, and some sort of Greta Thunberg-type young woman who was still at school.  And I've got to admit, I don't know much about Greta Thunberg other than she drives people up the wall.  Which, again, is kind of bizarre if you think about it.  I'm not so sure she understands a lot of it either.  Anyway, the thing that I found most depressing about this is this is supposedly a science conference.  These were supposedly the informed people that they had on to discuss this so that we could actually have an informed discussion about how to move forwards.  Um... And the thing that I always find very depressing about it is it's always discussed in very emotive language.  You know, I just don't think like that.  The first thing that you've got to do is work out the sort of orders of magnitude of the problem.  And so eventually I sort of put my hand up and I just give them the orders of magnitude.  And it was clear from the second I started coming out with all these numbers that, first of all, no one had even the slightest clue whether these numbers were right or wrong.  But the chairman, certainly, I was actually speaker at the conference, so he probably knew that I wasn't just making it up.  But anyway, so the rough numbers that I gave them, and it stuns me that they didn't just have a ballpark feel for the numbers.  It's basically 1,000 watts per square meter.  That's what the Earth gets from the sun.  global warming is expressed as an extra one watt per square meter.  So you can look at this, okay, global warming is barely detectable.  Just so you know, if you were to look at satellite images of the Earth before and after global warming, there is zero chance that you would be able to spot the difference.  Well, until you give it a long time and ice patches start melting, that sort of thing.  So it's barely detectable, global warming.  You only really get a feel for it after a few decades.  And also, this thing that, again, is rather depressing that none really understood is... It's all about the atmosphere.  Global warming isn't really about the whole planet getting hotter or cooler.  It's just about the atmosphere and a few meters of the Earth and some of the sea.  The sea is what makes a lot of these models so unpredictable.  If you think about it, you liquefy the atmosphere.  It's about 10 meters worth.  I'll give you these numbers as well.  So if you liquefy the atmosphere, so it's about the same density as the Earth, it's got a similar heat capacity, the atmosphere is worth about 10 meters of water.  That's roughly what the atmosphere is worth.  Then, of course, the land mass heats up and cools down.  But, you know, typically you're only interested in the top few meters of the Earth's soil.  After you get a few meters down, it more or less becomes an equal temperature.  So, okay, let's be generous and say we're interested in five meters of Earth as well.  then the one that really screws it up is the oceans because the oceans circulate and the oceans are a thousand meters deep.  right so you can.  you can dump a huge amount of energy into the oceans because the oceans circulate.  the earth doesn't you know the the ground beneath our feet?  you're you're just limited to conduction.  these are actually this convex stuff around.  So things like this make the modeling of all this a complete nightmare.  But never mind subtle things like that.  So the other numbers that I gave these guys was... I didn't actually give them the total numbers because not even I carry these.  Once you get up to billions and trillions, the numbers stop really sort of making sense.  But anyway, Earth is about 6,000 kilometers is the radius.  So that's 6 million meters.  And so the cross-section of the Earth, if you take a look at how many meters squared does the Earth get continuously, it's basically the cross-section.  So it's the area of a circle.  So it's pi times.  r squared which is that one power 10 right that's pi r squared.  there we go.  so that's the cross section of the earth in meters squared and obviously each one of those meters gets a thousand watts.  so that's the total watts.  total watts that the earth gets.  And the global warming is that divided by 1,000.  So that's total watts for global warming.  And then the only one that's really relevant here is the entire power production of mankind.  All of mankind's energy is basically that divided by 10.  You know, ballpark figures.  All power of mankind.  So those are the numbers that I gave them as well, that basically, ",
