            "text": "Hey all.  So, the Hong Kong protests.  They're a big deal right now.  Let's talk about them.  So first, a quick recap.  Since June, there's been large-scale protests against a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China.  Well, at least that's how they started.  They've since evolved, and they've developed a further list of demands, which I'll get to in a second.  So the protests are continuing, even though it's already been stated that the extradition bill is going to be withdrawn at the end of October.  These protests have involved a lot of violence in the streets, with people defending themselves against police, violence against property, stuff like that.  Though as far as from what I could find, they've yet to directly result in any deaths.  So just to clarify before I move on, because I don't want to obfuscate my position here, I definitely support the cause of the protesters, because the Chinese government is terrible, and I approve of any attempt to avoid as much of its rule as possible anywhere.  And when you look at their five demands, they're actually really basic and reasonable.  Almost too much so, even.  One is the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, which seems to already be happening, so that's good.  Two is an inquiry into police brutality against protesters.  Three is retracting the classification of protesters as rioters.  Four is amnesty for arrested protesters.  And five is electoral reform.  a change to a system based on universal suffrage.  Which in my opinion is actually way more important than all the stuff about the expedition bill.  Since Hong Kong has an incredibly weird political system where literally three quarters of its representatives are not voted for by individual people, but by representatives for businesses.  So I am definitely strongly behind the man number five.  But number two, three and four are just related to the protests themselves, and number one just restores the status quo.  Outside of point five, they're not really asking for any progress.  Quite frankly, for a movement that's being presented as some sort of existential struggle for the future of Hong Kong, their demands are pretty damn lame.  And that kind of makes me wonder what this is really about.  Why are people out in the street employing such advanced group protest tactics, fighting cops, destroying property, etc?  And just to clarify, I approve of those last two things.  Always.  So what they're after is just a return to the status quo from before the extradition bill was proposed, and for the people of Hong Kong to be properly enfranchised.  Know that the businesses represented are mostly Hong Kong businesses themselves, so that last demand is not even an explicitly anti-China one.  And you know, it all really seems a bit... performative?  almost fashionable.  The way that we're being bombarded with this, not just in the traditional media but also on social media, you'd think that the protests were an existential struggle.  The streets are permanent war zone.  But what's actually happening is that young people are suiting up in the morning only on weekends, and going out to fight some cops together and smash the windows of some Starbucks.  We have no intention whatsoever to actually capture territory, to force government officials out, or to claim physical objectives with any sort of permanence.  It's just temporary unrest on the weekends and then from Monday to Friday they're back at work as if nothing ever happened.  It's almost like that protesting is a pastime.  And really, when you see American and British colonial flags being waved, and people with signs begging for Trump to step in, whatever that means, and others apparently leisurely cosplaying as Harry Potter with funny signs for social media, please, God, read another book.  It really does seem like it's just become something fashionable, that even rich kids for whom this protest is nothing serious for whom Hong Kong is going to work fine regardless of whether it's ruled by the British or the Chinese or no one, are strongly represented in these protests.  It doesn't give off the vibe of being a working class movement at all.  Hong Kong is a place where millions of people are forced to live in tiny little one-room shoebox apartments with rapidly rising poverty rates and with the highest cost of living in the world.  These people have really urgent concerns with their material needs, yet there's nothing about material needs in the five demands.  If the protesters were majority working class, there would surely be demands related to such immediate material needs.  At the very least, the protest leaders don't seem very concerned with the needs of everyday people.  And there seems to be no intention to really shake up fundamental societal power structures.  Probably because a lot of those involved benefit from the way that things are right now.  So yeah, I mean, get out there and protest, even if just for the sake of protest.  Be gay, do crimes.  The Chinese government sucks, and you should do everything possible to impede its attempts to gain more power over you.  But these protests aren't really doing that.  The weekend only, no real direction, get your Harry Potter costume on sort of thing can work to put on pressure and to get specific policies repealed, as it already has.  But without being more forceful, more continuous and having a better list of demands, they're not going to accomplish much more than that.  That these protests are being presented as some sort of incredible, inspiring, revolutionary sort of thing is honestly just ludicrous.  You need some actual physical objectives for that beyond just getting together with your mates for the weekly cup bashing.  Just look at how much more the Ecuador protest has achieved in a mere week in comparison, because they actually went and took territory and held it for extended periods of time.  They could have easily kept going and overthrown the government, which they should have done, or because they kept at it rather than heading back to work on Monday.  You can't only do a revolution on your days off.  So what especially interests me about this is how everyone is so easily being sucked into the revolution of our times narrative.  That right there is a quote from Blitzchung, a professional gamer from Hong Kong who was banned from competition by Blizzard Entertainment for supporting the protests in an interview.  There was also some censorship in the NBA, with similar sorts of protests resulting in pushback from Chinese affiliates and investors.  This was front page news on every single major media outlet's website, and also resulted in an absolutely massive outcry on social media.  Free Hong Kong!  It's the revolution of our time!  If this weak-ass part-time movement with such compromising demands is the revolution of our time, then let me tell ya, we're all fucked.  Anyway, even spaces normally completely unrelated to politics went off-theme to go completely crazy about this.  Now, this fascinates me because this pretty much never happens.  I mean, sure, the traditional media is all over this, because it plays into their general narrative of superior Western capitalism, represented by Hong Kong, against evil foreign communism.  represented by, well, China.  But that's expected.  It's normal.  The interesting part is the social media bit.  Now, social media is not one big amorphous blob or anything, but generally, people are a whole lot more divided on political issues, and especially political protests.  There's a definite consensus that it's wrong that this dude was punished for a political protest, and everyone is jumping over backwards talking about it.  While similar protests back home that resulted in the same sort of punishment elicit a whole lot less of a consensus.  In fact, I bet that many of the people expressing their approval here are the same sorts of people who were burning their shoes because Nike put Colin Kaepernick in an ad. ",

            "text": "Have a good day.  If this protest had instead been someone saying Black Lives Matter, would there have been such an uproar?  Or would the response have been a rather muted, hey man, keep your politics out of my video games?  There's also the widespread celebration of the fact that these protests are disruptive and violent, and especially surprisingly, of the fact that they're violent against police.  Social media spaces are, generally speaking, extremely hostile to disruptive and violent protests.  Just look at all the people complaining about Extinction Rebellion, or going berserk when there's a fistfight or a trashcan demolition involving Antifa, let alone when they fight cops.  Cops are sacred to most centrists and conservative Westerners.  For them, someone even laying a hand on a cop is the ultimate affront to authority, something that must immediately be punished for its insolence.  Yet now these same people are suddenly celebrating the willingness of protesters to fight back against police.  Now, I do too, don't get me wrong, but these are some strange bedfellows that I am not used to having.  Now, I think it's fair to say that these people would never, ever, ever approve of similar protests in their own countries or in other so-called Western nations.  In fact, they'd be more likely to be cheering on the cops as they beat up protesters.  Or worse.  And why is that?  Is it really so simple as Hong Kong good, China bad?  Well yeah, but also no.  Now yeah, China is actually a terrible authoritarian hellscape.  But the random Americans and Europeans who normally despise protests suddenly spamming, Free Hong Kong!  Free Hong Kong!  don't really care about that one bit.  They're doing so because of deeply, deeply ingrained cultural biases, and the media shoving the issue into their face as often as possible ensures that they're going to get very invested.  This is the colonial mentality manifesting in the present, plain and simple.  because the only way that these people will look past their usual disdain for protests and the disrespect of police authority is if they consider the other side less than human.  To the people of majority white former British colonies like the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, China and specifically Chinese people have been the designated boogeyman since the 19th century.  They came to their countries, they took their jobs, they stole their women, they never assimilated, they never learned English.  And not only is a lot of this still there, but it's being merged with other colonial mentalities, like the idea of Western colonialism as a civilizing force.  China is representative of the untamed other, indigenous savage or barbarian, who is in dire need of being civilized by the superior western colonizers.  And this was how colonialism was commonly justified in the past.  But unlike in all those other places, such a thing never came to pass in China, except in Hong Kong.  You see, the people of Hong Kong were directly colonized, They've been taught English.  Western cultural practices and norms have been instilled in them.  They've accepted unfettered global capitalism rather than trying to forge their own weird, non-Western form of it.  So, in the Western mind, Hong Kongers have overcome their nature as savages and been civilized in the only way that they believe possible.  They're essentially honorary whites, and now they represent us against the perennial other, the eternal Fu Manchu of mainland China.  And that is why everyone is going crazy about the in-reality, pretty damn lame, sorry guys, Hong Kong protests.  It's very little to do with politics or genuine concern, and everything to do with colonial mentalities.  The frenzy caused by the perceived struggle of their superior civilization against the barbarians.  And we have to be careful not to fall into this sort of narrative ourselves.  We can be against China's attempts to erode the autonomy of Hong Kong, and we can support the cause of the Hong Kong protestors for that reason.  Or not, I guess, if you're part of the tanky contingent of my audience.  Do what you want.  I mean, I can't argue with a tank, even if we're still quite critical of the protesters as I have been throughout this video.  And also because it's really, really cool to fight cops.  There are ways to think about this that go beyond the two most common ideas, which are Hong Kong are the good Chinese in an existential struggle against the invading bad Chinese barbarian hordes.  This is an inspiring revolution, demanding minor change on Saturdays and Sundays only.  And all Hong Kong protesters are CIA plants against the glorious socialist People's Republic of China in its fight against evil Western imperialism.  As an enlightened centrist, I know that the truth really lies in the middle.  So there you go.  I think that the protesters could achieve a lot more than just what they're asking for.  But I also think that a lot of them are rich kids who are pretty happy with the way that things are right now.  Not genuinely interested in substantial change, and so not really willing to go the extra mile.  Because they're more concerned with cosplaying a revolution.  Literally. ",
