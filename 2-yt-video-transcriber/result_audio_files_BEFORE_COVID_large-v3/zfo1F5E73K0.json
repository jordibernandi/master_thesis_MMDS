            "text": "It is landed on the electric scooters that are everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, twist.  They're fucking great.  Wait a minute.  I saw people who said boo now clapping.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you want to see a sheep ride a scooter?  The, uh... Those scooters are great, and I owned an electric scooter when I lived in the District of Columbia because at first I had a bike, but when you bike in DC in a suit, you end up disgusting.  Then I got an electric bicycle that had a little motor on it, but then I locked it at 17th and L, but thought I locked it at 16th and M, and then I thought it was stolen.  And then four months later, I happened to be at 16th and L. I was like, oh, it's my fucking bike.  It wasn't stolen.  It was right here the whole time.  But by then it had snowed and rained.  It snowed and time had passed.  It was just a rusted old hunk.  So... In the interim, I bought an electric scooter.  And it was great.  And I like to believe that a Jewish gay liberal in a Darwin t-shirt riding through the gates of the White House on an electric scooter he bought on Amazon to write speeches about Don't Ask, Don't Tell and universal healthcare.  was the rebuke to somebody.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a man running to become America's first gay president with a straight haircut.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a presidential candidate running on the platform of reminding the teacher she forgot to collect homework.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a man who thinks he could be president despite the fact that the word butt is in his name.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 13-year-old boy who's currently in a Zoltar wish machine situation.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a precocious boy wonder who's getting college credit for his presidential campaign.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the presidential candidate who shamelessly panders to the white working class by speaking seven languages and being an accomplished concert pianist.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the presidential candidate with the neatest handwriting.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is like Robocop, except the scientists were trying to build a Jeopardy contestant.  And finally, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the only gay person Mike Pence is sad is going to hell.  I don't even know what we're booing.  All right.  We love Mayor Pete.  Megan has, with a very heavy hand, landed it on falling asleep on the couch.  Gotta stop falling asleep on the couch.  And I think there's a lot of people out there in this hectic world of ours, quite secretly... falling asleep at night on the couch for reasons that are kind of confusing.  Like, you know that it's time, there's one.  You know it's time to get ready for bed.  You know this.  You know.  You know also that you've not been following the last 10 minutes of Homecoming or the last 10 minutes of The Baking Show.  You know that you're losing it.  Your eyes are closing.  You are falling asleep.  And yet you do this thing where you're like, it's good.  You're like, it's fine.  Like, I know it's bad.  I know that I ate the last bit of chocolate covered cashews and it is gross, but it's also fine.  I'm going to fall asleep here.  And it is the worst fucking sleep.  And we do it again and again.  I'm looking at a lot of people who do it.  It's one of the darkest secrets in America right now.  because we're so like, There's too many people to respond to.  There's too many texts you missed.  There's too many things you had to get done today.  And every single day you fail.  And that last step of going to bed is the admission.  It is the admission of guilt that once again, you did not forward the mail from the old person who lived at your house.  And they're never going to get that Etsy package.  And what is in there?  What's in there?  You were supposed to send that today.  That is too specific.  Oh, yeah.  That's the part where it got specific.  Speaking of Obama-Trump voters, apology not accepted.  Face what you did.  You have given us Paul Ryan.  You have given us Scott Walker.  And, and you have given us Donald Trump.  Two of your main exports are dairy and assholes.  Let's just be honest.  We're caught a bit flat-footed by what happened here in 2016.  I feel like everyone here was pretty surprised when they woke up.  Let's admit it, would've knocked on a couple more fucking doors.  All right, we wake up on that Wednesday, November of 2020, and Wisconsin shits the bed again.  Buckle up, you'll never see me again.  And Tommy and John may wanna come, but I won't let us.  The people we have needed to figure out what the fuck is going on are the worst fucking people in the world.  We got Omarosa on Big Brother talking about nuclear proliferation.  Got Michael Cohen who got his law degree in the mezzanine level of Shea fucking Stadium.  You might find this hard to believe, but when I first met Mr.  Trump, I was blinded by his charisma and handsomeness.  I fell, I was, I fell under his spell.  And now I stand before you a new and different man who recently found out about this thing called the criminal code.  Listen, I bet it all on taxi medallions like five seconds before Uber.  I'm so fucked.  Unbelievable.  There are two kinds of people in this world.  People who think lox and cream cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel is gross, and people who have tried it.  Because let me tell you something, I was born on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.  Don't say stop to me, it's true.  I was raised surrounded by bagels.  My first memory is of bagels.  Every day, the morning begins with bagels.  You open the freezer, there are bags of frozen bagels because sometimes you buy too many bagels and you freeze them because you go to the deli and you say, give me a dozen, a mix.  Yum Kapoor is coming.  You know what there's gonna be for dinner?  There's gonna be bagels.  So no one tells me how to eat a fucking bagel.  Love bagels.  And cinnamon raisin bagels with fish on them is delicious.  Yes.  Cinnamon raisin with tuna is good.  Cinnamon raisin with white fish salad is good.  Cinnamon raisin with lox and cream cheese and a slice of tomato is delicious.  And if you tell me that fish and cheese... and cinnamon and raisins don't go together.  If that's wrong, I don't want to be right.  Fish and raisins are good.  Spit it again.  It has landed on millennials killing Hooters.  Fake news.  And I want to end it on this one.  I debated this, and it's a true coincidence that this happens to be on the board.  My parents are here tonight.  Good job.  Robert Lovett.  Do you remember when I was maybe 13 or 14?  And you took me to Hooters.  Guess what?  It didn't work.  Oh, what a Hail Mary that was.  And I sat at that table.  And remember, it's a high top table.  And given my size as a 13-year-old, which is proportional to my size as a 36-year-old, I remember where my eyeline was, and it was Hooters Heights.  I remember sitting there in silence, and I remember turning to you and saying, I want to leave. ",
