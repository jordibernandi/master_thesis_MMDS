            "text": "Here we are, at long last, on the eve of the release of Star Trek Picard.  To mark the occasion, some of us Star Trek YouTubers got together to create a project where we each share what Jean-Luc Picard has meant to us.  All of our videos have been collected into a playlist which is linked in the description of this video, so be sure to check out what everyone else has to say about Captain Picard.  Now then, for my contribution to Captain Picard Day, as we're calling this project, I've chosen a scene that we don't often talk about when we talk about Picard, and that's probably because the scene isn't really about Picard, and it takes place in an episode that isn't about Picard either, but trust me, because I'm going somewhere with this.  The scene I'm going to talk about is part of an episode from Star Trek The Next Generation's sixth season, titled Relics.  So, this is the episode where Scotty, chief engineer of the Enterprise in classic Trek, arrives in the 24th century after spending 75 years in suspended animation inside the transporter of a crashed ship.  At first, Scotty is amazed and excited by his new surroundings, but he soon begins to feel overwhelmed and out of place on the Enterprise D. After getting drunk in Ten Forward, Scotty staggers over to the holodeck and recreates the bridge of the classic Trek Enterprise.  That'd be the NCC-1701, no bloody A, B, C, or D. And that's where Captain Picard comes in.  Literally, he comes in to the holodeck at this point.  There's a fun bit where Scotty offers Picard a drink of his green mystery booze, which is so strong it even knocks lifelong alcoholic Scotty back on his ass the first time he drinks it, but Picard just drains the glass in a single throw and goes in for another one like, keep pourin', granddad.  Then they get to talking.  Picard notices their surroundings, which he recognizes as an old Constitution-class ship.  Scotty explains that of all the ships he's served on throughout his career, this one, the original Enterprise, is the only one he really misses.  Picard, it turns out, can relate.  He tells Scotty about the Stargazer, the first ship he ever commanded.  He describes the Stargazer as kind of a heap, always on the verge of flying apart at the seams.  And yet, even though the Enterprise is far superior in every measurable sense, there are times, Picard says, when he could give almost anything to command the Stargazer again.  Some of this isn't new information \u2013 we know about the Stargazer already \u2013 but this is the first time we've gotten to see the depth of feeling Picard still carries for his old ship.  It makes sense, though it's never been explicitly stated on screen.  According to the TNG show bible, Picard commanded the Stargazer for over twenty years, so you would expect him to still feel some attachment to the old bucket.  It's more than that lingering sentiment toward his previous command that inspired me to choose this scene of all the scenes I could have chosen to celebrate Picard.  Something I always appreciate as an audience member and a know-it-all self-appointed media critic is when a show suggests a life for its characters beyond the frame.  The first time TNG offers us a brief glimpse into Picard's life before the opening fade-in of Encounter at Farpoint comes in the first season episode, The Battle, which is where we learn about the Stargazer, and the fact that Picard was forced to abandon it several years before taking command of the Enterprise.  Later in season one, there's an episode titled We'll Always Have Paris, where we meet Janice, an old flame Picard left behind over twenty years before.  In season two's Samaritan's Snare, we learn Picard has an artificial heart and that he lost his real one during a fight with some Nausicaans as a young man, a fight we'll get to actually see a bit later in season six as part of one of my favorite TNG episodes, Tapestry.  In season four, after being rescued from the Borg, we follow Picard on a visit to his family estate, where we meet his brother Robert, sister-in-law Marie, and nephew Ren\u00e9.  in another all-time great TNG episode, Family.  And there are more than those.  These personal details are important not just because they tell us of events that happened in Picard's past, but because they help us to fill in the picture of who Picard is.  From the story of his fight with the Nausicaans and his artificial heart, we learn that he was a reckless young man who took on more responsibility and discipline after a brush with death.  From his history with Janice, we learn that he chose career over love, but wasn't completely at peace with that choice.  From his reunion with his brother, we learn that he was always an overachiever, that his career in Starfleet and general embracing of modernity are at odds with the typical ways of his family, and we also learn that while he's never had children of his own, family is important to him, something that will come up again in the film Star Trek Generations.  And from this scene with Scotty in Relics, we learn that the Enterprise is not the center of his universe, which is kind of a stunning revelation regarding the captain of a Star Trek show.  If man-on-starship relationships were legal in the Federation, I'm pretty sure Kirk would have wanted to marry his Enterprise, though he'd probably have to fight Scotty for her, the poor sap.  But Picard?  He loves the Enterprise, Dee.  He thinks of it as his home.  He's grown pretty close to his crew by this point in the series.  But when he's talking to Scotty in the holodeck, it seems pretty clear that his heart or a great big piece of it, anyway, still belongs to the stargazer.  The past looms large for Picard, both in terms of large-scale history, as exemplified by his interest in archaeology, and personal history.  From what I can tell, the past will cast a long shadow over his life when we pick things back up with him in the new series.  Knowing that Picard has a past, and more importantly, seeing that it means something to him, makes it feel more real.  Because, as it is for Picard, so it is for us.  Like characters and stories, we, too, are creatures of narrative.  Our memories of our pasts are among the most important reference points we rely on to tell ourselves who we are.  This scene on the holodeck in Relics tells us a little bit about who Picard is.  It tells us the Stargazer was a cherished location in his life, a location that is lost to him now, a location he wishes against all reason he could return to.  Who can't relate to that?  Don't we all have places, people, relationships, experiences that are gone now, that exist only in the past, inaccessible, that we yearn to go back to even though we know it's impossible?  When I listen to Captain Picard tell Scotty about the Stargazer, it makes me think of those pieces of my past that I wish I could revisit.  That's one of the magical things about how we relate to art, especially narrative.  We find the universal in the specific.  Picard talking about an experience that is particular and unique to him causes us to think about experiences of our own that make us feel the same way as Picard feels about the Stargazer.  It connects us more deeply to ourselves, and it creates a sense of connection and commonality with Picard, who is a fictional character.  We feel a bond with a person who doesn't even exist outside our imaginations.  Isn't that extraordinary?  I'll never get over how cool that is.  Of course, this isn't the only scene.  I could have chosen to illustrate how TNG develops Picard by showing him relating to his past.  It's probably not even the best example.  Picard telling Scotty about the Stargazer resonates very strongly with me, but I could have centered the video on We'll Always Have Paris, or Tapestry, or one of the other episodes I mentioned earlier and made the same points.  There's another, far nerdier reason why I made this selection.  I did, and that is, Shit, it's just cool to see Captain Picard on the bridge of the classic Enterprise, ain't it?  It's made even cooler by how underwhelming other crossovers between TNG and TOS have been.  Dr.  McCoy's cameo in Encounter at Farpoint is neat, but blink and you'll miss it.  And the unification two-parter with Spock is pretty good, but all the Spock stuff takes place on Romulus.  And don't even get me started on Generations.  Would it have been so goddamn hard to write one scene where Captain Kirk visits the bridge of the Enterprise-D?  Or Kirk and Picard return to Kirk's Enterprise?  I mean, they were in the Nexus!  They could have gone anywhere!  Didn't happen, but Picard on the bridge of the classic Enterprise did happen for a couple of minutes in Relics, and I'll take it, since it's as close to a TNG and TOS characters visit each other's ships crossover as I'm ever going to get.  Unless the producers of Star Trek Picard wanted to write a time travel episode where Jean-Luc drops in on Captain Pike's Enterprise, as previously seen on Discovery.  There's no reason why they couldn't do it.  Just putting it out there.  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this video about Captain Picard, and I hope you enjoy Star Trek Picard when it debuts tomorrow.
