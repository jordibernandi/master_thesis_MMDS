            "text": "Thank you.  The mic on the GoPro session is just horrible.  But I'm here, so I'm not going to leave.  Nothing else.  You'll get the video will be good.  If someone gets close enough, you can hear them probably.  This is Broadcom.  Biggest supplier of silicon and ICs and chips.  Mostly radio, like RF.  RF and wireless.  I think they were bought by a larger company a year or two ago.  But here they are in Irvine.  They could have a bunch of space.  Look at that bridge over there.  I'm hoping this wind doesn't take my hat right off my head.  Get a healthy basketball game going here.  There's like a tunnel.  A weird gate.  I love those gates.  That's cool.  I didn't need to go that route yet.  I'll wait and see.  All right, let's go further into this dark tunnel.  Let's see what's going on.  Yeah, this is like its own little city.  Pretty crazy place.  Oh, I didn't get my on the wall in their meetings.  I didn't look it up.  I think I've looked at it.  in the past, but these guys, well, along with the parent company that bought them, these guys do so many billions of dollars a year, probably 15 or 20, 16 right around there.  Sorry for all that wind.  Look at this.  Looks like a bomb shelter.  Then you've got all this lighting stuff.  This must look really cool at night.  It's like it's constantly changing colors.  Yeah, you can.  You're stupid.  Quote me the law on that.  Is there a special reason I wouldn't give a shit what you think or what you're telling me?  No, he's telling me you can't take pictures of people.  There's no law about that.  I'm not talking to you.  You are just making shit up out of your ass.  Yeah, too bad the world's not about your comfort level.  You can go inside if you don't want your picture taken.  Who are you to say what's nice or not nice?  Can you have a sentence there?  Great communicator.  All right, man.  Call the police.  Wow.  So I guess I don't know.  Here we go.  Here's the magic door.  Public sidewalk.  Still some snowflakes here, but... Hey Joe.  Alright guys, so... That's Broadcom in Irvine.  There's two buildings and a bridge.  Pretty cool building.  Most of the people here kind of mind their own business, but... There's a few idiots.  And of course... don't seem to uh all know the law but looks like one of them did.  so i saw him point to the sidewalk and tell the guy to leave me alone.  so i guess there's some some education going on.
