Of course, Ocasio-Cortez is also a sworn enemy of carbon, but that didn't stop her from taking hundreds of Uber rides when the subway was just a few feet away.  She may feel the same way about money for you, but not for her.  A new FEC complaint accuses Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff of diverting a million dollars in donations into private accounts, apparently to obscure how that money was used.  If true, the complaint could result in prison time.  Ocasio-Cortez was confronted about this allegation today, and here's what she said. ",

            "text": "Hey, Tucker, so here's what this really boils down to in my mind.  So it should be noted that the group that brought the complaint to the FEC is a right-leaning organization.  We want to say that up front.  But if you boil it down, basically what she and her chief of staff are accused of doing is moving almost a million dollars from a PAC fund that they controlled over to an LLC, a limited liability corporation that they controlled.  So were I her, I would ask this gentleman in the photo here who is a multimillionaire, you know, tech and finance smart guy who's running her campaign.  I would say, hey, why am I moving this money, these donations that were made to me from this pack over to this other account that I control?  I control them both.  Why move it?  What difference does it make?  Well, one difference could be, look at the rules that govern both.  And the rules that govern a PAC are very clear and much more strict about how much you can spend, where it came from, what you have to disclose, how you list things.  When it's an LLC, a limited liability corporation, the rules are very different, much lighter.  And she marked a lot of stuff, strategic consulting.  And you can do that rather than itemizing things.  Now, is this illegal?  I don't know.  Both sides are going to have their arguments in court about this, no doubt.  And by the way, the rules that govern campaign finance are written by the very people in power who are trying to hold onto it.  So talk about the fox guarding the hen house.  So the people who wrote these rules that she's saying, we're going to rewrite the rules, more people who have come to power and are trying to hang onto it.  So is this legal under the rules?  I don't know.  We have people saying it's not.  Both sides will argue and we'll see.  But what's interesting is you just have to ask yourself, Why did you need to move it from one thing you control totally to another thing you control totally in order to make the expenditures?  It sounds like that dark money that she's talking about, but we will see when they investigate. ",

There is not a bright light shining on it.  But, Tucker, I mean, you made the point before.  Think about what socialism is.  Like, the very definition is a government takeover of the means of production.  It's a power grab.  That's what she's been all about is a power grab.  I'm in charge.  I'm the boss.  We go to Washington.  We decide.  We get the means of production.  We get control.  And we tell you all what you get.  It all has the same theme if you boil it down to its most basic sense.  So she doesn't want other people using planes.  But she'll use a plane going back and forth between D.C.  and New York because she's important.  It means she's the ruling class.  She's powerful.  She's important.  So she gets to do these things.  But for you and me, we're just, you know, the serfs along the way.  So we shouldn't, you know, have a carbon footprint.  We shouldn't do all these other things. ",
