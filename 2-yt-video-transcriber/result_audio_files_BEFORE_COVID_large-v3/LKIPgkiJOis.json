            "text": "Are you suffering from a lack of self-confidence right now?  Are you sat at home or out and about watching your phone, headphones on or just those little earbuds if you've got them, thinking, yeah, I don't have any self-confidence.  People always think that I'm confident because I'm a professional show-off, but I'm actually quite shy in what you might call normal social situations because I'm a professional performer and I've been performing since I was 15 and doing stand-up comedy since my early 20s and so it's more than half my life constantly showing off.  I've developed a series of persona that are quite good but I would say confidence is the sense that you have enough are enough on your own and don't require things that you won't be able to get externally.  i.e like say you think well I know I do need the support of other people but I'm happy that I'll get them.  I know I do need a job.  I'm happy I'll get a job or whatever.  you don't feel like that.  you're constantly at a loss, in a position of dis-ease, I can see why people would suffer from a lack of confidence, because I think we live in this highly comparative and combustible culture, where, like, you know, say I look at David Beckham, like, recently playing for Man United, I think, oh, God, he looks good, doesn't he?  Maybe I should try and play for Man United.  I mean, like, you're constantly comparing yourself to these difficult-to-achieve external... emblems.  but really what I've been told again and again is that true confidence and this does seem to be verifiably true is when someone embraces and accepts who they are.  you know like some I know people who seem confident who have the things that I consider being my own faults or flaws.  let's say you're worried about your own weight.  well there are people that are bigger than what is advertised as the standard size, that seem to be really, really confident, don't they?  Or if you don't think you're good looking enough, or that you don't look good enough naked, or you're not clever enough.  There are all manner of people that are what we could regard as deficient or subpar or substandard.  And I'm simply using these words to convey to you the idea that there's an imagined standard.  We think we fall short of that imagined standard.  We judge ourselves.  We feel inferior.  I suppose lack of confidence is a sort of a... It must be comparative.  It must be comparative.  When I think of an obvious example of where I might experience lack of confidence, it's that old nightmare of having to socialise with a group of, say, 12 people that don't know well around a dinner table.  I don't know how that has even caught on as an idea of something to do with time.  I can't stand it.  Mind you, I don't, you know, drink or take drugs or nothing.  If I have to do that, I think, oh no, I've got to sit at that table, what am I going to talk about?  So what I reckon goes on in my mind is, one, I hold myself up to a too high standard of like, oh, you've got to be some dazzling Peter Ustinov, Peter Cook, one of the Peters, style wit that's setting the table on a roar with some wonderful anecdote.  And I sort of know that that won't happen and then feel inferior.  Or I want to be in control of the situation.  You can't really be in control of many situations.  That's what I'm beginning to learn, that there is little control to be had.  You could master a discipline.  You could become very good at jiu-jitsu, so then you would feel confident in that area.  Always going to be someone... better than you unless you're extremely bloody good at it.  i say that the answers to the feeling of a lack of self-confidence one don't compare yourself to other people.  two find what it is you enjoy doing.  devote and dedicate yourself to it.  three look at what it is you feel is not good enough about you.  is there anything that can be done to improve it?  what results do you expect to achieve by improving it?  say for example let's take that I heard off of the wonderful Bren\u00e9 Brown that men beat themselves up most about not being strong enough, about being weak, and according to Bren\u00e9 Brown, women beat themselves up most about their body image, right?  So say it's body image, you don't think your body's right, and I don't feel my body's right a lot of the time.  Like, whatever I feel, right, I'll exercise more, I'll eat healthier, I'll try and get fitter.  I should examine whether what it is I'm anticipating getting from that.  Because sometimes these things slide into your mind as somehow as a solution when they're really not going to provide a solution at all.  I sometimes feel if I looked better, I'd feel better.  I don't think that's the answer.  I think that we diagnose our problem incorrectly.  Nothing wrong with trying to be healthy, nothing wrong with trying to be fit, nothing wrong with eating well, but assuming that this will somehow provide a solution can be erroneous.  Then take the second thing, rather than body image, feeling weak.  Well, that can only be comparative, isn't it?  I'm weak compared to, I'm not weak compared to people with atrophied upper bodies or people that are immobilized for whatever reason.  When I think I'm weak, I'm comparing myself to a type of man and then thinking, oh, I'm not that type of man.  I didn't reach the you know the kind of when I was at school and thinking oh these are the hard lads or when you start going out and lads that have fights and kick people's heads in and that you know no I'm not one of them.  I could get my head kicked in at any minute.  you know those kind of ideas that sort of thread that seam runs through me still now.  what I think is Just try and be who you are.  Just don't live your life constantly imagining your body should look better or how you might get on in an imaginary fight.  There's not going to be much peace there.  Try to stay grounded.  But I do address these things.  I do eat well.  I do do jiu-jitsu.  I do do exercise.  What I'm saying is perhaps there's a message, perhaps there's something that you could be listening to and responding to But don't use it to create a state of paralysis and self condemnation.  And that's what a lack of confidence is.  It's nice to deal with confident people.  It puts you at your ease when you deal with people that are genuinely, truthfully confident.  They're not overbearing.  Like some of the most confident people I know, they're very easy to be around.  And they're people that have done work on themselves in one way or another.  If you want to feel confident, stop judging yourself, but do go to work on yourself.  Hello, I'm doing these new videos more frequently now.
