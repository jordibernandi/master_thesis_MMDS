            "text": "We are at Salt Bae Steakhouse in New York City, where I worked for a period of a few weeks.  This story starts back in the spring of 2017, when I had heard that the popular internet celebrity, Salt Bae, was opening up a steakhouse in New York.  He is known for his successful steakhouses, Nusret in Turkey and Dubai.  At the time, I was actually working in hospitality as a bartender.  So I was trying to keep an eye out for hiring notices.  I figured there would be a lot of hype behind the restaurant, behind the position, and it would be very lucrative.  Towards the end of that year, around October, I saw an advertisement and was invited to the open call interviews.  The interview was at the Plaza Hotel in New York, which seemed a bit odd, and it was because they were conducting interviews in the middle of a public lobby with other hotel guests.  I don't understand how they had enough money to put all of the staff in the Plaza Hotel, but not rent an office space or room to conduct interviews.  I showed up early and was the first person to be interviewed by a young Turkish woman who had me wait after the interview to speak to... Can I help you?  This is a public place.  All right.  This guy's nice.  All right, we'll five feet up this way.  I guess Humpty Dumpty wanted me to move 20 feet this way, so we'll roll with it.  So I show up to this open call interview for the steakhouse restaurant, and I'm interviewed by this Turkish woman.  It was like a screening kind of thing, and then they had me wait.  Usually, you speak to the hiring manager after they screen you with someone else.  So this hiring manager was actually sold by himself.  As I was waiting, I was chatting with another guy who was interviewing there.  The reason I'm bringing this up is because I actually came across this guy just earlier this year when I was going on an interview somewhere else.  So I'm definitely not alone on my struggle.  hospitality and dealing with you know people like this.  so I get pulled over for the interview and I'm sitting across from an older man.  diagonally to me is Salt Bae.  after a few seconds I realized Salt Bae doesn't speak much English and he was his translator but Salt Bae definitely understood English.  So I wanted to set myself apart from anyone else.  And I have an Instagram with a lot of pictures of meat, so I figured it would be perfect to show him that.  Salt-based thing is doing ridiculous stuff on Instagram related to steak, related to burgers, whether it's slicing a steak or putting something on a fire.  And, you know, I take out my phone and I hand him the phone and he starts looking at the pictures of me.  You know, he's going through them and he swipes over to my shirtless pictures and he started smiling.  I could barely contain myself from laughing hysterically.  And I was kind of like, is this a comedy?  What's going on?  You seriously, you take someone's phone, you look at a picture of them shirtless, and you start fucking smiling in front of their face.  It was comical shit, guys.  And I don't remember the rest of the interview after that, but I ended up getting invited into meeting them the next day because they wanted to discuss the future of the restaurant and what their game plan was.  This meeting was actually in the same lobby of the Plaza Hotel that we interviewed in, and about 30 people showed up.  So we all sit down, and before the meeting even starts, the Plaza Hotel management staff comes over and says we can't be there because it was reserved that day.  They tried to conduct the meeting anyway, quickly asking if, oh, can you go to Miami?  Can you go to Miami?  Because they wanted to open the Miami Steakhouse before New York as a test run.  It's completely ridiculous.  They hired these people on the spot.  And then the next day, they asked people to come with them to Miami in a couple of weeks to work for them.  But I guess that's what you do when your restaurant is owned by a real estate company that's affiliated with one of the richest billionaires in the world.  The guy that owns it is actually the richest man from Turkey.  It trickles down through a few companies and through a few steps, but there's so much money behind this guy that... it's weird.  just a few minutes into the meeting the police came and kicked us out so we had to go downstairs into this bodega market thing where we were signing up to go to miami with the same turkish woman that interviewed me the other day and she's using a garbage bin as a desk.  i was like hell.  no i'm not going to miami with you.  this is already a mess.  So the New York Steakhouse was supposed to open in October or November.  But that was when Miami ended up opening.  In hindsight, I should have probably gone down there because that would have landed me a better position in the restaurant in New York.  But I didn't know that at the time.  And the New York restaurant opening ended up getting delayed several months.  So it's now February.  It was cold as shit outside.  And we started training at the steakhouse.  There were a lot of other bartenders that were hired.  And as with most of the staff, they were pretty much Turkish.  The bar was set up completely wrong, like a kitchen.  We had refrigerated drawers to put rabbits in or something.  But that's a whole different story.  So these people put a lot of money into this restaurant, probably dozens of millions of dollars, with little to no supervision or restaurateur expertise.  I mean, if I had as much money as these guys, I guess I wouldn't care if I was burning it in a driveway.  So we ended up training for a few weeks.  I don't remember how long exactly.  I think it might have been two weeks.  And when we opened, they were giving me day shifts, the lunch shifts.  And the traffic during rush hour for lunch shift was nuts.  So I literally went up to the manager and asked him, hey, what the hell are you doing?  I had more experience than the other people.  I was committed to the job for longer.  In the back of my mind, I knew it was because most of the other workers were Turkish.  The majority of the people working at night, especially the bartenders, all spoke the language.  They were very familiar with Turkish.  Turkish culture.  And I didn't say this earlier, but Salt Bae is Turkish.  He's from Turkey.  His first restaurant was in Istanbul.  That's very successful.  And his next most successful restaurant, I think, is in Dubai.  But the point is, I wasn't going to grow a mustache or learn Turkish overnight.  And I also had an offer to go on MasterChef Season 9 at the time.  So I decided, screw these guys.  I'm going to fly out to California, to LA, and go on the show in about two weeks.  Hindsight is 20-20, guys.  I didn't end up getting more than five seconds of screen time on MasterChef.  And I would have done a lot of things differently.  I still would have gone on MasterChef, but I would have taken my family out there and taken a different approach to the whole show.  But the people in this restaurant were making like $2,500, $3,000 a week waiting tables and bartending, which is incredible. ",
