            "text": "Hi beautiful people.  This week we're talking about Paul and Morgan's ill-timed birth control video.  I say it was ill-timed because they released a video calling God their birth control.  Gave it up to God to be our birth controller.  And then had the audacity to follow up with a misinformed, irresponsible, non-research live stream on the subject of abortion.  This video was going to be kinder, but when I saw this live stream, I lost it.  It is chock full.  full of ignorant, blatantly untrue statements, I'm going to call out both of these videos.  Not to attack or demean Paul and Morgan, but because I believe as a Christian, as someone that genuinely wants to see abortion rates plummet, that we need to stop falling for lies and propaganda.  We need to stop telling each other those lies and propaganda.  We need to open up our ears and listen and figure out what genuinely prevents abortion.  So this will be a two-part video.  Next week I'll be responding to the abortion livestream.  that's happening as we speak.  And this, part one, will be my rebuttal to the birth control video they put out last week.  This video, no matter how angry I get, is not about attacking Paul and Morgan as people.  I respect them, I believe that they are wholeheartedly in pursuit of God.  However, I feel it very necessary to offer a different Christian perspective.  to give you guys options to say you don't need to feel guilty or shamed about using birth control, about family planning, or even about voting pro-choice.  So let's break down this Paula Morgan video point by point. ",

As a science believing Christian, I completely disagree.  Women get pregnant when during ovulation a sperm fertilizes an egg.  The Bible makes it very clear that we are not God's puppets.  God's free will says we are permitted to make mistakes.  He lets us fall.  He's not a helicopter parent.  He doesn't control what we do.  do.  Therefore, our lives are a series of choices and the effect those choices have on our lives.  I have a period and ovulation app on my phone and it tells me when I'm high risk or low risk for pregnancy.  This chart is not infallible, but it gives me an idea of my cycle.  If I, in my own God-given free will, choose to have sex when I'm at high risk of pregnancy, biology can get me pregnant. ",

Telling your audience God will protect them from their own irresponsibility is like telling people not to wear seat belts, because God will protect you if you're in an accident.

Are you implying that you make an exception to bowing to God's will, to His divine design for your fertility, only when it comes to wanting to have a baby?  Is birth control a distrust in God, but fertility intervention more holy?  How is that fair?  If a baby is the desire of their heart, they should pursue that dream.  But I have to point out how Christians can be so imbalanced when we favor reproduction over family planning.  Also, the way Morgan speaks about conviction from God is something I deeply relate to. ",

You guys can make choices on your own.  When you say, God said using birth control is not surrendered, is not trusting him, you can cause a lot of spiritual anxiety in other people.  Not to mention any of us, no matter how aligned we are with God, is susceptible to confirmation bias.  Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.  If she's attending a church that calls birth control into question, she may experience confirmation bias in her prayer life.  When churches teach shame messages surrounding sex, we can easily confuse the voice of our pastor with the voice of God.  And I am not saying Morgan didn't hear from God, but I am saying that you are allowed to question absolutely everything that I claim, that Paul and Morgan claim, that Girl Defined claims, that your pastor claims is a message from God.  Also, birth control is not addressed in the Bible.  Yes, Adam and Eve were called to be fruitful and multiply, but they were also supposed to be the very first and only people on earth.  So that does not make it a call for everyone.  As for why people use birth control, Paul and Morgan say, If ",

They experience energy and housing insecurity, and children who are poor are less likely to achieve important adult milestones such as graduating from high school, enrolling in, and completing college.
