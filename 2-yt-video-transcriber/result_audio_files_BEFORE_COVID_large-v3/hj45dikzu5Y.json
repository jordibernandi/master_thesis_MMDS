            "text": "What's happening fam?  LAR movement still moving.  Book is entitled Lessons from a Non-Custodial Father at Amazon, Kindle, and CreateSpace.  Link will be in the description box below as usual.  Go get it.  PayPal link there also to ask me to put it up, so I'll put it up.  Thanks everybody for supporting.  This video though is entitled black female bisexuality is on the rise.  Uh, article will be in the description box below too.  Um, news one put out an article about, uh, one in 16 black women are now considered, considered themselves as bisexual.  And in general, when 10 years ago was like one in 65 and now between the ages of like 18 and 34 is one in eight.  So For the black men who we know that I think for us It's like it's more like two and five.  two out of five women are bisexual and a lot of times people are tripping about The sexuality part but it spills into the relationship dynamic Part of this stuff and this is what I'm going to be focusing on in this video.  You see When you have, like a lot of these women are opportunists.  So a lot of times when you think these men and women aren't getting along, you have women who don't like gender roles.  So when they're with a man, they want to be a man.  When they're with a woman, they want to be a woman.  So it doesn't really work.  Or they want the man to be a woman or they want the woman to be a man.  And, you know, this dynamic causes always friction in conversation and also in relationship because now it becomes a competition.  And, you know, why should I have to do this?  But you are expected to do something.  And part of that double-mindedness, you know, when you're double-minded, you become foolish because a lot of times you're dealing with women who want you to be a man while they want to be a man too.  And then they want to be a woman.  But they want you to play along with both of them.  And that's not going to work.  You know what I'm saying?  So a lot of times you see some of these people not getting along.  It's because of that.  And people are like, well, how would you know these people?  How wouldn't you know?  Some girls you can tell that they have been lesbians before or bisexual or with women before.  Some girls you can't.  Some girls you find this out in conversation.  And then the remnants of that starts to spill into your interaction with them.  It's like, okay.  you know the the the idea that somebody I don't understand it some of these why these relationships crumble so quickly sometimes because the women wanna be just change their mind.  she likes women she could get upset at a guy and well I'm just tired.  guys see personally I know women who are married who are mothers who were who are in relationships with men who are single who go both ways and that you know some part of this.  you know some of the cultural guys used to want my girl got a girlfriend type culture and they didn't.  and they wind up getting in a committed relationship with this.  and it's it's.  being bisexual is a non-committal type thing.  if you're committed to one thing she's committed to both.  So she hops in and hops out even when you're there and she expects you to be back when she gets back.  Not really going to work.  And women understand this because a woman wouldn't necessarily date a bisexual man because the uncomfortable part of that.  But in number-wise, you're not going to see one in eight black men between 18 and 35 say they're bisexual.  Now, this spills into parenting also.  See, a lot of this stuff talks about people being effeminate And it's because of this part of the culture where, you know, because of your sexuality and your friendliness with your sexuality, you try to push this on your children or you make a situation where you soften up your boy or harden up your daughter because you want to have the best of both worlds.  So you're trying to make your child the best of both worlds.  It's not working.  Now, Same thing that's involved that, you know, I talked about Jay-Z and that 444 album around that when he talked about his mother coming out.  And as a lesbian, he was proud of her.  But in previous years, he talked about how he was mad of kind of being fatherless this whole time.  And how he was kind of cold towards his dad, but I don't know him personally, but people like him, it doesn't register to them that mom didn't really like men all the time.  So part of the issues about your mom and dad not getting along is because she wanted a woman back then because she just didn't pop up being an elderly woman just liking women.  That was in play back then also.  And part of that 18 to 34 thing, like, If you notice, it happens less, but as you get up in age, you know, 36 and up, you see these women coming out of the closet without thinking that they've always had this and snuck around and done this and that.  And part of these no-fault divorces, sometimes it's the sisterhood, you know?  And some of us forget that.  Like, sometimes these girls are getting along a little too well And part of the reason is because they're there for each other in more ways than just emotionally.  You know?  So... These dynamics are come in play.  Like when recently we're talking about women who do a third of women take men out or go out on dates just to use men for free meals and how wrong it is.  Nobody ever considered the fact that some of those women might not necessarily like men or that's the role they feel with men, but they wouldn't do this with women.  Like when I talk about, when I'm talking about bisexuality and even lesbianism, Part of what I'm talking about is also financial.  See, and ethics.  Like, people don't take into consideration that some of these women, they'll spend money on a woman, but they won't spend money on a man.  They'll keep their word with a woman, but they won't keep their word with a man.  Because they're leaning... vacillating to that side.  they'll look at men as a as a as a means to get a resource out of but they won't look at.  but and that's that's on play and that's cool.  but if they do the same thing with a woman it's it's considered like losing using a person.  then it becomes unethical.  you know and this is part of a lot of the confusion going on Because ultimately people think they can come and go as they please in and out of men and women's lives and come back as if it's not a problem when it is.  When you're raising children, I think they can come and go.  in and out of, you know, rules and regulations and roles as they feel in society as you're supposed to be there to accept them with open arms.  And you can't do that because that's noncommittal.  That's a situation where you're dealing with people who are not, you're looking for a person to hold this standard and expectation while you get to vacillate between two different expectations and responsibilities.  But you want the both.  You want to be able to say you got both.  And the problem with that opportunism is also this.  What I've noticed over the years where it's really, the ladies want the, she wants the pros of being a woman.  without the cons, and she wants the pros of being a man without the cons.  So when, when she's doing this and cause she's a woman, she gets these benefits is cool.  But if she has to sacrifice this up, I'm bisexual.  I want to be with men now.  And this is the benefits of, Oh, I take the man role.  So here's the benefits of a man's role.  Ooh, I take the benefits.  Oh, these are responsibilities.  I'm opting out of that again.  So, People don't realize when you're dealing with people, they don't like that.  Even I've come across people who are in same-sex relationships.  It seems like they don't like that either.  You don't get to hop in and hop out of a gender role and leave somebody stuck into it because now you're dealing with the same gender and they're not feeling it.  They're not feeling today, you're feeling this way.  Tomorrow, you're feeling that way.  But they got to change every time you got to change.  they gotta feel how you feel when you feel it's like.  no so you know to me it.  the ramifications are just are beyond quote-unquote just the act of sex they enter.  you know culture finance parenting And even the history behind how these things fell apart or came together.  So this is my thoughts on this one.  Y'all read the article.  It's going to be in the description box or whatever.  And the link is going to be to it.  So like, share, subscribe.  Catch y'all on the next one.  Peace. ",
