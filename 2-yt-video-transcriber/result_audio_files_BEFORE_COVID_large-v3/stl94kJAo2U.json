            "text": "Hi, Wackadoodle family.  It's Pastor Tim.  I want to remind everyone, before I get into this email that I received, that the ABCs of Salvation is in the description box, that I have a video link, Faith Plus.  Nothing Equals Salvation and Eternal Security.  And if you have not admitted you're a sinner in need of a Savior and believed, on the redemptive work of Christ on the cross at Calvary.  I implore you, look at the ABCs of Salvation.  Watch that video.  It's critical in this season.  We're not guaranteed our next breath.  Earlier today, I reported on the magma chambers that Many seismologists and scientists are watching under California that they say is bigger than Yellowstone.  And their concern is with the volcanoes stretched down the West Coast from Canada through California.  With another significant earthquake with a fault line that that could erupt and come to the surface.  And millions of lives are lost.  Well, I'm not a fear mongler, but I do want to bring this to you.  I will not identify this sister for her protection because people identify get attacked.  But anyway, it came through.  So let me just read it to you.  Good morning, Pastor Tim.  I pray that this message finds its way to you because it's urgent.  I have a very dear friend and sister in Christ who has been monitoring the seismic and volcanic events all over the world for years now.  The information she shared is accurate and trustworthy.  She posted about what you were talking about in your video about the magma in California, along with the findings of Steve Quayle.  And it's worse.  This is in capital capital letters.  It's worse than we think.  I'm going to copy paste.  What she said here in this message.  Now, I'm not a follower.  I'm not that acquainted with Steve Quayle, but I know who he is.  So feel free to go check that out.  Steve Quayle made a call, and I'm not sure to whom Paul is, to Paul at eight in the morning the other day.  and mentioned the video, that might be her husband, I'm not sure, and mentioned the video about the 5.4 off the coast of Oregon.  Steve Quayle said, I was just in a helicopter above Mount Hood.  The magma is moving like you won't believe.  like nothing we've ever seen before.  He said, He also stated, That's what caused all the earthquakes all the way down to Ridgecrest, California.  There's this magma flowing.  This is what he's saying, that it caused all these earthquakes.  And you know, now, and some of you, the channel family, are saying there's been over 20,000 when you include the aftershocks.  But you have pre-shocks, the main shocks, right, and aftershocks.  So... Over 20,000.  And they're saying that it's this magma flow.  So it's a ticking bomb because magma is moving like you won't believe.  There's 18 different places where volcanic eruptions could occur along there.  Wow.  But that magma is moving like you won't believe.  Of course, we know that all the volcanoes are likely linked.  And we've been, not me, but they've been talking about the same thing.  This is just further confirmation.  Mount Hood, a potentially active stratovolcano in Oregon and in the Cascadia Volcanic Arc.  He's been flying all over, I believe this is Steve Quayle, the Cascadia subduction zone and over around the volcanoes.  He's doing a film on Mount Hood, Mount Rainier, Mount St.  Helens and the whole Cascadia subduction zone and was surprised to see what he saw.  He has also been meeting with seismologists and meteorologists.  Now, I'm not sure who Mike is, but Mike from around the world was asked for confirmation on the above.  This is what he said.  I support him in the fact that magma is moving all over the place, and I do mean all over the place.  This is in quotes.  These are what these people said.  that's being reported by this sister, and I believe she's telling us the truth here.  He said the heat plumes are incredible.  The physical effects of magma are certainly going to be felt.  The magma is really on the move.  Someone else notes.  He says in the last six weeks... Him and his flight film crew has been photographing every volcano in the Cascadia Fault Range, talking with scientists and watching the events take place, not only in California, but also up in the region around Seattle and Mount St.  Helens.  He has a video file that he couldn't get to send because it was having trouble sending.  He also said to watch... The axial seamount.  He says he lives in Bozeman, Montana.  And Yellowstone is the least of our worries.  But that in the last couple days, a lot of Gulf Streams came in.  He says, I was in the air in a helicopter and they started coming in.  Probably close to four dozen Gulf Streams.  Very expensive aircraft and the world's most powerful people flying in them.  Very powerful people that have places up at the Yellowstone Club all flying in.  He even says that presidents from foreign countries were here in the last couple days.  They were prominent on needing law enforcement.  He says the reason he is even mentioning this is that they are the elite of the elite and the world's most powerful and all have access to real-time intel.  They have no concerns with Yellowstone, though.  I think they are more concerned with the Cascadia zones.  Forget Yellowstone, Cascadia is where the action is.  He also claims that Mount Baker started smoking about six weeks ago.  Steve also sent one of his guys up over Mount St.  Helens and says he had been up two weeks prior to that at his request and sent him back because he wanted better lighting.  the geothermal venting on the bulge and the steaming had become more active.  A note here, by the way, Gulfstream aircraft are like $50 to $65 million for a single aircraft.  So multiply that by 42 and you see how much money worth of aircraft was flying in over the last couple of days.  Now here's what our sister says.  And I'm going to keep this because I have proof.  I'm not going to share who the sister is, but I'm reporting on this because I want you to know.  That's the message she shared last night.  I have no doubt in my mind that what she's sharing is the truth.  And I wanted to get this info to you in hopes that you will do another video on it to warn everyone of what's really going on.  Please, there's exclamation marks.  Lives will be lost and those unsaved are running out of time.  Exclamation marks.  I pray that you take this to the Lord for confirmation and that you're able to reach many more with this warning.  God bless you and your family, brother.  Sending you all love and prayers.  Am I? ",
