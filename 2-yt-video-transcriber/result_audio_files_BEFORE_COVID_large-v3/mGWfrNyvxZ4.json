Or are you willing to ask for, and more importantly, take the advice of an actual expert?  And more importantly, do you then use that newly acquired knowledge to become more of an expert yourself?  Or do you simply take that newly acquired information and still shout and scream and say that they are wrong and you were right?  If so, You may be suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect. ",

            "text": "yeah flat earthers i'm talking to you.  hello everyone welcome to another episode of playing a blinder with me the creaky blinder.  now the problem with my opening statement about me being the foremost expert around youtube.  the problem with that statement is that it just isn't true.  there are lots of people that know lots lots more about being a youtuber than i do but if I was a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect I would genuinely believe that statement I just made regardless of how ridiculous it may be.  Now Socrates said the only true wisdom is knowing when you know nothing.  Now when I first started this YouTube channel I knew almost nothing about how to upload content and how to make sure that people see it.  It's been a learning process.  And in order for me to learn the process and make my channel grow, I've had to search out advice from people who are much better qualified and much more experienced than me.  But if I did suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect, my previous statement in my own mind would be absolutely true.  Because... to my mindset there would be no way that i was wrong and no possible way anybody could teach me anything but i would just be kidding myself.  now i've got a saying that i use why i don't know but i say that nobody knows everything about everything and by that i mean that there's always room to learn whether it's a new skill or to increase your knowledge around a particular subject.  Now, in psychological terms, the Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias whereby people with limited knowledge or competence in a given intellectual or social domain greatly overestimate their own knowledge or competence in that domain relative to the objective criteria or to the performance of their peers.  And to simplify that, I think the Dunning-Kruger effect, there's a big difference between being competent or confident and being cocky.  and i think that the dunning-kruger effect is a perfect example of somebody being cocky.  now if you look at people like some of the greatest minds of our time like dr stephen hawking he was never not learning something new and he was one of the greatest scientific minds of our time.  so what makes flat earthers think that they know everything and the greatest minds know nothing?  it's because they suffer from the dunning-kruger effect.  they're overconfident in their own abilities and knowledge and they're overconfident to the point where they cannot even see when they're clearly wrong because they know so little about the subject that they can't see the errors.  you have to have knowledge of a particular subject to be able to see when you're doing something wrong.  now i've been asked many many times in my comment sections why i don't make the traditional debunking videos And I've said many times that I do not consider myself to be a debunker because I'm not.  I don't debunk anything.  I'm more of a point and laugh channel.  I just like to point out how stupid the whole concept of Flat Earth is.  Now the reason I don't try and make debunking videos is because I don't know enough about physics to be able to do that.  So there would be a very, very high chance that anything I tried to say would be incorrect.  And I would just be making myself look stupid.  Well, more stupid than I do anyway.  But you get the idea.  It would just be completely pointless.  So why flat earthers?  None really spring to mind.  why flat earthers insist on pretending that they've got some super knowledge that the best physicists in the world don't have completely baffles me now.  i just flashed up a picture of anthony reilly on the screen.  we all know who he is.  now whenever i think of dunning kruger he's the first person that springs to mind.  because my god he is the most confident.  And the reason I know he's always wrong, because as I just said, I don't know anything about physics, but the reason I always know he's wrong is because there are so many other debunking videos showing clearly why he's wrong.  Then there's no doubt about it.  But yet he remains supremely, supremely confident.  Now, if you cast your mind back a few months, you'll remember that Fight the Flat Earth did an interview with George Moussa to try and once and for all prove that Anthony Riley has no clue what he's talking about.  But even after the interview was released and Craig and George Moussa discussed everything that Anthony Riley talks about and George Moussa demonstrated why he was wrong, all Anthony Riley did was just double down and carry on with what he's been doing anyway and just say that George Moussa's wrong.  So you can still use Newton's laws to calculate gravity as a force.  So if you've watched this interview previously, and I will remember to include a link to this, you'll know that Anthony Riley claimed that George Moosa was saying when he stated that Einstein snapped Newton's wand, what Anthony Riley thought he meant by that was that Newton's laws no longer applied.  So let's see what George Moosa actually said in reply to that question. ",

In other words, that Earth... reaches out as though by magic to hold on to the moon and grip it. ",

            "text": "Nice American accent, Mr.  Reilly.  But there we go.  Exactly as you would expect from somebody who is completely deluded and ignorant and suffers from Dunning-Kruger.  Even though it's been explained to him perfectly clearly, he's watched the video, he's still... is doubling down and saying that he's right and george musa is wrong.  and people like anthony reilly are exactly the reason why i do not try to use physics in my videos to debunk flat earthers because i really wouldn't want to risk making myself appear to be a gigantic.  Now I know this video is a bit shorter than my usual content, but I wanted today's video to be a little bit of an experiment.  I wanted to see if I could make a video just talking to you and getting something off my chest.  The Dunning-Kruger effect, in my opinion, is probably the biggest contributing factor to people believing in flat earth.  So I hope you enjoyed it.  If you didn't, I'm sure you will let me know down in the comment section.  If it's your first time here, don't forget to give the video a like, hit the subscribe button and turn on bell notifications.  I'm the Creaky Blinder, I had to think about that then, and I will see you all next time.  Take care everyone, bye bye. ",
