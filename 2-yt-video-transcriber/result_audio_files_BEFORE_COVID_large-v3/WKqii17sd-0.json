But what I want to say here, when you look at the behaviour, it's a shocking, disgusting behaviour of the banking, central banks, and like the IMF and the World Bank, and if those who I'm speaking to have read Confessions of an Economic Hitman, then you understand that actually these countries have been pushed into the gutter.  And so the results have caused people to be almost forced to lose all moral code.  So it's not surprising that people like El Chapo has resulted, many other drug barons, as a way they could get money going.  But who is it that started the drug trade?  The British Empire, growing opium in Kew Gardens.  And with that, they started the opium wars to destroy the Chinese public, because China was a very closed country.  They wouldn't let people in.  Anyway, so here is El Chapo, and he has actually been arrested. ",

So that's frankly one of the things I'm most excited about in our trade deal.  I want to know the truth.  I think maybe there's no more important point.  We're going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.  It's going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.  Their market's down close to 40 percent.  Our market's way up.  We've picked up since my election trillions of dollars of worth, trillions, many trillions.  And China's lost trillions of dollars.  But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.  So we'll see what happens.  China's coming here next week, by the way.  They're coming home, the traders.  And then China's coming here next week.  And then I'll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe for some remaining deals we'll make them directly one-on-one ourselves. ",

            "text": "Now, I want to just carry on reading this.  Meanwhile, UK may be facing martial law after Brexit was once again downvoted by the government.  Well, I haven't seen any evidence of that today, which is the following day.  The Gabal are afraid of Brexit as it will cause a cascade of events for the UK once passed.  Northern Ireland will be forced to leave the UK and unify with the rest of Ireland.  Scotland will vote to leave the UK and join the EU as a sovereign nation.  These events are all under GSARA-compliant terms given to the UK via Brexit.  Now, GSARA stands for the Global Economic Security and Reformation Act, and you can find a link on the Restored Republic website.  of judy byrington.  reminder gesara is not a law.  it is a complex secretive treaty or even agenda that is being enforced upon all nations by brics who are working with the earth alliance.  There will be no GASARA announcement, but rather, that's new to me, but rather nations will have to reform and create GASARA compliant laws.  The declaration of a national emergency in the US, that's just what we've been watching President Trump announce, and martial law in the UK might both occur simultaneously.  This would wipe out the cabal-stroke deep state military industrial complex and their financial capital, City of London.  This would cause the rest of the global structure to completely collapse.  Any other cabal remnants that refuse to surrender will be tracked down and apprehended.  The Earth Alliance is willing to do whatever it takes to begin the transition with or without the Cabal surrender.  The RV can be expected to begin at any moment as it will kick-start the transition.  Now, I've just clicked into the Restored Republic via the GCR.  as of February the 15th.  Here, you can see this.  The other one I was talking about was one up here.  Well, the intelligence alert afraid.  So now I'm back into Restored Republic, and I'm just going to run down here.  This is talking about the end of the Gabal financial system.  That's the fraudulent system we've been under for, well, I would say probably around about 100 years.  Brexit vote ended on the cabal financial rule of the cabal city of London and Vatican.  On February 15, Trump was expected to close the cabal's privately owned U.S.  Inc.,  Federal Reserve and IRS.  The New York stock market has been on the brink of collapse since October 1, 2018, when it lost all gains for the year.  By early March, the financial giant was expected to crash, putting a final nail in the cabal's financial system coffin.  Now, stock market revival.  A crash of global markets would hide the huge influx of monies from the global currency reset, while Zim redemption would not only back the GCR, but revive the stock market.  So here we've got the next bit, RV for the general public.  If public chaos occurred and to calm the masses, there would be a public announcement of the new quantum financial system that reset value of world currencies based on the individual countries' gold asset-backed resources.  which should allow the RV to begin for the general public.  And it is a matter of timing.  That's the quantum financial system.  Now, other news that I learned down here, which is, I'm just skipping through, but I'll give you the link.  OK, see, February the 14th, Intel report from Super Shadow.  Now, I don't know who Super Shadow is.  It's ex-political intel report.  Once I go onto his site, I don't see any more.  But Tony Blair has been arrested, according to a reliable Alliance source.  Blair had been holed up in a cabal hideout on the Isle of Lewis, at the very top of Scott.  Lovely place.  I've been there.  and had been aware for over five days that the alliance was going to issue an arrest warrant and was on the run.  the alliance had enough information from informants at gitmo as well as documents found at a cabal deep underground military base called dumb located near beaufort county kerry ireland.  last year in twenty twelve the cabal was experimenting with low frequency large amplitude radio waves on the local population of beaufort.  the alliance had evidence that blair signed off on these dangerous experiments.  Low frequency is very, very dangerous.  And there is the information about the locals.  The Alliance subsequently stormed the base last year and it has since been neutralised.  Blair was believed to be on a chartered flight to Montserrat for further interrogation prior to being sent to Gitmo, according to the Alliance sources.  And then there's a Benjamin Fulford snippet coming from him where he's actually even... talking.  so let's hold it there.  okay this is benjamin fulford.  so we're on the precipice of another government shutdown.

Again, remember, the Pentagon has its budget.  This is only affecting the regime in Washington, D.C.  They still control the Saudi oil, right?  That's basically what they've got, keeping them going, and the drug money.  The drug money is being reduced by legalization of marijuana.  That's hurt them a lot because that was... in terms of volume and money, and the Saudi Arabia oil was not enough to keep their show going, so they tried to steal Venezuelan stuff, but it didn't work.  This could be the time.  And the other thing, I was sent by the U.S.  military a bunch of documents, you know, which I've seen before, but nonetheless, it was a good reminder that the only reason they were able to survive after the Lehman shock was this incident.  Johannes Riadi fraud.  Let me remind you that this was brought up in the British House of Lords, and I've also published related documents.  But basically, the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, went to this Asian royal by the name of Johannes Riadi and bought the rights to 700 tons of gold from him.  They used that 700 tons of gold to to create 750,000 tons worth of gold-backed bonds, which generated the $23 trillion when Fred Osorin forged the Quintalism Signature and stuff.  And it's kept the whole Zionist fraud thing going.  And they gave the Chinese a big chunk of this, too.  And the Chinese went along because they promised that everything would be different under Barack Obama.  They said, we'll have a black man in charge now, and it'll all be different.  And they believed it, but Obama was just a house slave with no real power.  And it was the same people, you know, just using him as a nice face to cover the reality.  So this time... They're not going to be able to do that.  They're not going to be able to put out another fraudulent document and keep their shoulder on.  Henry Kissinger is trying hard, but I don't think it's going to happen this time.  We'll see.  But I'm certainly pushing.  Let's finish these bastards off.  They're mass murderers.  They're international criminals.  They invade countries, massacre millions, and steal resources.  And they need to be removed from world power once and for all. ",
