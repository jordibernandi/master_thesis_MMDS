What's your thoughts about that? ",

            "text": "Well, Antarctica, you can't really live down there.  It's just really uninhabitable.  It's too cold.  It's literally too cold to live.  That's why there's no government in Antarctica.  There's nothing.  It's the only continent that doesn't have any form of government.  Nothing.  Because it's too cold to even go down there for long periods of time to maintain any type of civilization because it's like year round.  It's snow.  So you won't have any kind of resources to get.  You can't really survive in that type of climate.  At all.  So it's just an unnatural place for you to survive.  Even Europe, when it went through an ice age, it was damn near uninhabitable, but they had caves and places like that where people could get refuge from the elements.  And that's why the Europeans had to leave there and go out and explore the world.  Because of the lack of resources.  So if there were a lack of resources in Northern Europe, just imagine the lack of resources in Antarctica.  In places like Alaska, it's cold for most of the time, but then you have certain times of the year when it's not so cold.  So you had nomadic tribes called Eskimos who would move around.  to cold areas and warmer areas in that area of Alaska and Canada, but Antarctica... ",

Well, thanks about that because I was real confused about that because the main reason why they've been on my mind a lot because I've been doing research on it, and there's animals that stay in Antarctica, but it's like a little strip park that sort of connects from South America to there, and, you know, it's a lot of animals that stay on that park, Like, I'm trying to get a good description of it, but it's a certain part where a lot of animals stay, and it's in Antarctica.  Right, right.  I was sort of confused.  how come there wasn't no indigenous people that stay there. ",
