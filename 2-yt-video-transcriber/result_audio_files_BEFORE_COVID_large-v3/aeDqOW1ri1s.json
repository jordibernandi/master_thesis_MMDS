Now pay close attention, pay close attention to this tyrant trying to escalate this situation, trying his best to escalate so he can arrest.  Escalate to arrest.  That is this cop's agenda, his main agenda.  But fortunately, this gentleman kept it cool.  He kept it calm.  which I tell you guys, it pissed off the cop.  He was so pissed off because this gentleman here kept it cool because the cop was trying to escalate to arrest for whatever reason.  They're out there, guys.  They're out there.  in our free world.  These cops like this is the reason why everybody does this.  This is why you have the First Amendment audit, cop blocking, cop watching, mirror channels, reaction channels.  This is why we exist.  Because if there was not cops like this, there would be no need for our channels.  No need whatsoever.  So guys, roll the clip. ",
