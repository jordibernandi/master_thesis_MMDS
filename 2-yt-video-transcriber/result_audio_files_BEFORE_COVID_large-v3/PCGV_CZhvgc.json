            "text": "Hey folks, Matthew coming at you here on 19 July.  Make sure I got my dates right since I can't keep names right.  I'm sitting here trying to get some stuff here at the homestead done.  Been pretty busy, can't seem to get anything done because of having to stay on the phone.  But at any event, moving onward, sitting here 14.30 almost-ish.  I've been watching all the comments roll in, and folks, listen, I'm not perfect.  I've never claimed that I was the end-all, be-all of information.  There's plenty of other channels out there that, you know, claims that I am, however, not.  It was indeed Maxwell, not Roberts, the last name designation, you would be correct.  Robert Maxwell, the father of the Epstein madam.  And, you know, pretty much you see that once you watch the video that I highlighted in last night's video.  And look, that's another thing I want to before I move into the news.  Listen again, folks, I'm not trying to get into the dirt or the minutiae and drag our president through the dirt.  That's not what I'm trying to do.  I'm just trying to look at all the Information that is circulating and vetting it.  And as I said before, folks, you know, I've got to be honest, my TNFL patrons, you know, all the information that's out there is vast.  It's deep.  And there's plenty of it.  And as a good friend and source emailed me this morning, He's given me some advice as always, but also too, admitting, listen, it's a fact, folks, that our president rubbed elbows with the deep state and the cabal players out there.  Again, does that make him complicit?  No.  But there is some information out there, example regarding the yacht that was sold to the Saudi Arabian attorney that once belonged to the Khashoggi family.  Folks, there's information out there on that.  Don't take my word for this particular example or anything that I put on these videos or on the airways over at Mixler or more.  have you anywhere.  Folks, I guess that's the message of the day.  You don't have to believe anything I say, but I can tell you I try my best to bring out the truth, not fiction.  And some of the information that I uncover, some folks aren't going to like, mainly the left, but some of the information, let me just keep it in layman's terms, that I may uncover, some folks on the right aren't going to like it.  The issue at hand, folks, is that there's a lot of information coming out and I'm sifting through all of it.  For example, China Lake.  I'm getting information and chatter that that facility was targeted by the White Hat community.  They're seeing a lot less chemtrails, if you will, on the West Coast.  Again, don't take my word for it.  That's what I'm hearing, which is a good thing.  We're still seeing a dramatic rollout of 5G across this country and across the world.  Folks, That's a problem for me.  5G is a dangerous, and some are saying can be utilized as a mass population weapon.  We're still seeing, gonna go over some of it here, more breaking news on Iran.  We're still seeing more warmonger talk.  The last thing we need is another major conflict.  You've heard me say this many times.  I'm sure you'll hear me say it many more.  Another major conflict over in the Middle East region.  Now here's something else I'll leave you with.  before moving over to the headlines.  Folks, you need to look at the markets.  Food shelves are starting to get thin with certain items.  I've been talking about this along with others about the vast crop loss throughout the Midwest.  There are now signs in every grocery store in America that they're running out of certain food items.  You need to start looking at if you can't afford gold like I myself.  I have a little bit of gold, not much.  I have about 300 or so ounces of silver, not enough.  looking at buying some more, I would highly recommend that you diversify yourself and not depend on the electronic banking system.  That's the best advice I can give you as our markets continually become unstable.  Probably going to upset some more people, but folks, listen, I'm not here to entertain you.  I'm not here to follow a certain narrative.  In fact, I have considered in the last two weeks of just sticking to mainly geopolitical and prepping news narratives, if you will, or points.  and getting less and less involved in the mudslinging of the political landscape.  But here's what I'm going to end with.  I believe Donald J. Trump will win in 2020.  I want to leave you with this before going into some of the news.  Why is it in no forecasted sight that interest rates remain at zero?  Somebody go research this.  School me, if you will.  But folks, if they raise the interest rates at all above zero, this economy would go into a deep recession.  That's what all the indicators are showing.  Well, I'll tell you why.  Because the petrodollar's out there.  and gold is back in.  Let's get to the news. ",

            "text": "On my phone today, on the move, Iraq explosives dropped on base belonging to Iran-backed forces.  Two injured after unnamed drone drops explosive on base belonging to an Iran-backed force in northern Iraq, folks.  Kind of crazy headline.  Got more MSM headlines here.  Here we go.  We've been hearing about this.  British oil tanker seized by Iranian forces and being guided into the Strait of Hormuz.  MSNBC, go figure, right?  And the last headline here, Iran releases footage.  It says, this proves drone was down by U.S Play the video here.  Kind of, bear with me.  Kind of crazy looking video of a drone overhead a military vessel.  I guess they're trying to prove that the United States Never shot down this drone that supposedly belonged to Iran.  But it's an interesting headline to say the least.  Wanted to show this particular video.  Well folks, again, check out Aftershock Preparedness in EMP Shield.  Also, they have food buckets that are capable of withstanding long-term storage.
