            "text": "We got a problem.  Right, welcome to.  We Got a Problem, guys.  So last night, the Brexit Party MEP Alex Phillips appeared on the BBC Question Time show.  On the show with her was the Tory MP Rory Stewart, the Labour MP Barry Gardner, and the Lib Dem deputy leader Joe Swinson.  During the show there were some great questions from the audience and a great sparring match between Alex Phillips and the Lib Dem deputy leader Joe Swinson.  The first question we will look at is about the Tory leadership contest.  The Lib Dem deputy leader proceeds to make a sensational claim about the damage a no-deal Brexit will do while confirming her Lib Dem leadership bid, prompting a great response from the Brexit MEP Alex Phillips.  Take a look.  Is electing a new Conservative leader like changing the captain of the Titanic after it struck an iceberg? ",

            "text": "Jo, elect a new Conservative leader like changing the captain of the Titanic after it struck the iceberg?  Well, I think both Labour and the Conservatives hit icebergs last week, if we're honest.  But, I mean, I think the analogy is in some ways a good one for this reason.  We're looking at this through the prism of the Tory leadership contest, and actually we should be looking at it through the lens of what is in the national interest.  And, you know, the iceberg, the disaster that we're heading towards, is about what happens to our country.  Now, Rory aside, most of these Tory leadership contenders have been merrily talking about going for a no-deal Brexit, as if that is something.  that should be considered or contemplated by any responsible politician.  And we see this through a who's up, who's down, it's like some kind of episode of 15 to 1, you know.  This is not a game show.  It's not a scenario.  where all is at stake is whether you win the prize or get a pat on the back by Noel Edmonds and go home empty handed.  We are talking about A scenario where our economy loses \u00a3140 billion, where we have threats to our security, and where our NHS is undermined in a no-deal Brexit.  A doctor came to see me and told me about the plans that were in place And his concern, working in nuclear medicine, that despite all of the fridges that Matt Hancock has boasted that we're now the world's biggest bar of fridges because of how many medicines we have to stockpile, despite that, for those nuclear medical products that have a short half-life, the queues at the Channel Tunnel at Dover are going to mean that fewer procedures for cancer diagnosis and treatment are going to be able to be undergone.  This is what we're talking about.  And I think it is entirely irresponsible the way most Conservative leadership contenders are going about it.  Alex, the question was about the Conservative leadership, but obviously you've heard what Jo had to say about No Deal.  Yeah, I mean, look, actually no deal is the de facto position we're in now, come the 31st of October, and that is the net result of prevarication and politicking in Westminster.  In fact, what Brexit has done is shine a spotlight on our domestic politics, on the nature of our democracy, and what we have seen, really, is the two establishment parties spend more time focusing their agenda against the other.  trying to figure out how they can create longevity for their particular political brand and not longevity of democracy in this country.  Now, going back to No Deal, you know, the sort of apocalyptic situation that Jo paints \u2013 she better be careful, someone might take her to court \u2013 That's a bit of a joke.  But the point is this.  The referendum was about leaving the EU and all of its institutions.  It was very simple.  That's what we should have done.  And it should be in the PM's gift, the next PM's gift, to stick to that.  A lot of contingency planning has taken place.  The European Commission and Whitehall have already done a lot to make sure that if that scenario comes to pass, then we will be prepared.  And as a G5 nation, I'm sorry, with only 5% of our businesses in the UK trading directly with the EU, We should be able to do this.  We absolutely should be able to do this.  It will take political will on both sides, but I'll tell you this as well.  Europe is about to face a banking crisis.  Our economy is with 19 member states.  It's not in their interests to create some sort of punitive Brexit.  Yes, they need to sort of try and scare Britain into not doing, you know, not leaving the customs union and having completely free and fair trade with the world, which would undermine their own protective system.  They have their own agenda, of course.  But Alex, let me just ask you this.  When you look at the results of the EU election last week, and I've seen lots of people from various parties saying it tells them that the thing that they're doing is right and they need to do more of it, the Brexit party included.  But when you look at the results, and there's been a lot of analysis of it, it shows it's more or less a draw.  So what makes you think the Brexit party is the party with the answer, when you've got at least... half of those who voted anyway, thinking it isn't the answer.  But the answer's already been given.  That's the thing, the answer's been given, because the question was asked to the public.  Well, the question on the referendum was not no deal, or a deal, or all the poems they saw, it was just in or out of the EU.  Yeah, and actually, in and out of the EU, out means out of the institutions and out from under its jurisdiction.  The hard and soft Brexit dichotomy is a false construction.  Alex, is Norway in the EU? ",

            "text": "Now Alex is right about no deal being the de facto situation.  It should always be the de facto in any negotiation, since to actually negotiate you need to be able to walk away if the terms are not acceptable.  With no choice to walk away, it's not a negotiation, it's signing the terms of your surrender, much like most of Europe did during World War II.  These politicians are trying to convince us to sign our own surrender document, saying we can't do a no deal WTO Brexit.  They're a bunch of cowards.  Now, you also heard in there Alex tell Jo to be careful about the claims she makes as she might end up in court.  That's a joke at the fact Boris is up in court on 350 million pound NHS claims before the referendum, which this also drew a few chuckles from the audience, which was quite funny.  Now, a man in the audience also addresses the Labour Party's wish for another general election and how they are deluded if they think they will win, drawing applause from the audience.  Listen. ",

That there is something the left don't like, reality.  As the reality is right now, Labour would likely lose the general election by a significant amount since they don't know their arsehole from their earhole.  Now another great question from the audience comes from a lady named Sally who asks should the new PM invite Nigel Farage to be part of his Brexit negotiation team?  The Tory MP Rory Stewart responds first and is fairly open to the idea, claiming to have reached out to Farage already.  But the best part comes when Joe then tries to use the fact that more people signed a petition to revoke Article 50 than voted for the Brexit party in the recent EU elections, prompting a great response from Alex Phillips to shut her up.  Here is the questions and the responses from Rory Stewart, Joe Swinson and Alex Phillips. ",

            "text": "Take a question from Sally Blackett.  Sally, where are you?  Should a new Prime Minister invite Nigel Farage to join his or her Brexit negotiating team?  Well, Roy, let me come to you then.  In terms of a negotiation, pre or post a Citizens' Assembly.  We have to unify the country.  That means that I am very happy.  I've reached out to Nigel Farage.  I've reached out to Len McCluskey.  I'm happy to talk to anybody.  And obviously I'm happy to talk to the people around this table.  Alex, clearly the answer would be yes.  Well, you know, the man's not radioactive.  I've spent the best part of a decade with him and I'm fine.  And actually, he is the sole voice, really, that represents the 17.4 million who voted to leave.  He has now become the person who is proud to stand and say, we've got to deliver this result.  Isn't complicating it.  How do you stand that claim up, Alex?  That's quite a claim.  Well, when you look at the success of my party in the recent elections, and when you look at the collapse of the Labour and the Conservative vote, and people going either to Joe's party, the Lib Dems, or to us, people now identify primarily with being leaders or remainers.  More people voted on a petition to revoke Article 50 than voted for the Brexit party last week.  and yet we still beat you in the elections, so, you know, what can I say?  You know, Nigel's actually got two decades' worth of experience inside that parliament.  I think Rory is actually being fairly sensible in saying, you know, why keep demonising somebody who, in many respects, is completely in tune with a big chunk of the electorate?  You know, I... We are in this mess because David Cameron, who started off his leadership by saying the Conservatives weren't going to keep banging on about Europe, capitulated to Nigel Farage and the UKIP tendency of his own party in calling the referendum in the first place.  And this is a man who stood in front of that breaking point poster which stoked hate and division in our country and he knew exactly what he was doing with that.  And the morning after the referendum he came on the television and he said we won it without a single bullet being fired.  A week earlier an MP had been murdered.  I have to say that man is beyond pale.  He should not be in our politics.  We should not be inviting him into the negotiating team.  I think the key thing here is the policy, not the personality.  And I think where I would focus is what are people doing when they're voting for somebody talking about a no-deal Brexit?  Sally, you're the one that asked this question.  Do you think Nigel Farage should be invited to the Brexit?  I do think he should, yes.  As Alex has said, he has 20 years of inside knowledge of the workings of the EU.  He now has a large new mandate.  and he's got a total no-nonsense attitude.  And I don't think he's entirely all for no deal.  What he says, I understand him to say, is that no deal should stay on the table.  Not be... She's absolutely right. ",

He's not narrow-minded in that sense even if he is a bit narrow-minded in other senses.  But the Lib Dem deputy leader is only interested in attacking the person not the policy showing her true fascist nature.  Even though earlier she called Farage a fascist it seems to me she is the fascist.  showing a complete intolerance for any idea that differs to her own.  How do these people not see that they're talking about themselves?  It baffles me how stupid supposedly educated people can actually be.  You can see that she attempts to link Nigel Farage to the person who murdered Joe Cox in the public's mind, which is disgraceful.  She knows he never sent anyone to hurt an MP and he would never condone such actions, the same as 99.9% of the population wouldn't condone it.  But she has to try and paint him with the same brush as fringe lunatics since she can't win the argument against him.  The questions then move on to if Corbyn would allow Nigel Farage to assist with the Brexit negotiations.  Let's listen to what the Labour MP has to say.  And listen to him call out the Lib Dems for their continued betrayal of the 2016 referendum results by wishing to remain in the EU. ",

It is governments who negotiate international treaties.  And international treaties are perhaps the longest lasting contracts that we enter into.  Governments have to do that.  Nigel Farage will have a say in what goes on because he's just been elected or re-elected to the European Parliament.  He will have a say when it comes, if there is a deal that is eventually coming, a new deal coming through to the European Parliament, he will have a say in that.  And he'll have a say as a representative in the European Parliament.  But you say governments should negotiate.  It's such a good fitment so far.  Sorry, I didn't say should.  I said they do.  Only governments can negotiate international treaties.  The EU's not a government, so how does that work with your theory?  Well, because the EU has, on the Council, the 28 governments come together, the 27 who are negotiating against us. ",

Now the show finishes off with a question from another lady called Sally about the anger among British people right now, which is then followed up by a young man and one woman calling out the media and politicians for creating the anger by smearing people in the press.  which we all know is exactly what both have been doing to the UKIP MEP candidate Carl Benjamin and others during the recent EU election campaigns.

And don't you think that media actually portrays portrays a large significant factor in regards to that.  So why everybody is angry and everybody hates each other as opposed to, right, we're going to go have some time, go sit with that person, let's see how they are, let's see what their views are, as opposed to looking at what the TV actually shows us every single day.  Right, so it's either the politician's fault or the media's fault.  But actually, you know, Sally's got a very good point, because one thing that I have found, despite always trying to keep upbeat, and I'm always really nice to everybody I meet, I mean, I am, is, genuinely, I'm an optimistic little person, but I have faced some absolutely horrifying negative language, some of the most potent words, fascist, far-right, and the fact now that mainstream politicians are among people ",

I think there is a little bit more hope than perhaps you think, because given what many people in society today think is a big democratic deficit going on in this country since the referendum, you don't really see many people out wearing gilets jaunes and organising mass protests.
