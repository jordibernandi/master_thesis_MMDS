            "text": "Indication that there's a problem of free speech on campus is given by polls of students, which show that considerable majority, sometimes close to three quarters, believe that hateful ideas have no place on campus.  Racist, sexist, xenophobic, and so on.  I think that is a problem.  It's a problem because the motives are understandable, admirable in many ways, and can be accommodated appropriately, I think.  Nevertheless, the principle is mistaken.  I'm sure we'll have ample discussion of that.  And it's also a tactical error for quite a number of reasons.  One of them you've just seen.  If you look at the history of such concepts, which is rich and ugly, such principles have almost invariably been directed against vulnerable groups, groups that deviate from what George Orwell once called the pervasive orthodoxy.  and have been efforts to sustain power, authority, and domination.  That goes right till the present, in fact.  And we can anticipate that if such principles are established in a firm fashion, that'll continue to be the way they're used.  And there's another reason why it's tactically mistaken.  If you have a festering sore, the cure is not to irritate it, but to find out what its roots, where it comes from, and to deal with those.  Racist and other such speech is a festering sore.  By silencing it, you simply amplify its appeal.  and even lend it a veneer of respectability, as in fact we've seen very clearly in the last couple of years.  And what has to be done plainly is to confront it and to ask where it comes from, and to try to deal with the roots of such ideas.  That's the way to extirpate the ugliness and evil that lies behind such phenomena.  And as we think about this, I'd suggest reflecting a little on something that's really not the topic tonight, but nevertheless is worth keeping in the back of your mind.  But when we ask about the state of free speech on campus today, we should be asking ourselves, in comparison to what?  Well, the natural comparison is to the period when student activism in the modern period really began to take off some of the pictures that you saw, the 1960s.  So what was the situation like on campus at that time?  Well, one of the major recent books on free speech on campus, actually the book that had the lead review in the New York Times book review last Sunday, is called The Coddling of the American Mind.  And it discusses the danger of... safe spaces, other devices, which are leading, it claims, with some justification, to citizenry, which is unwilling to face alternative ideas and stays within its own cocoon.  that's destructive of the people, of course, destructive of democracy.  I think there's a fair amount of validity to that.  And we can ask what it was like in the 1960s.  Well, when the student movements began to develop, what they were opposing was safe spaces, namely the university system and the intellectual culture, which was a safe space for the prevailing orthodoxy with remarkable effectiveness, as Orwell wrote, speaking of England.  That's what the university and the culture was like.  And minds were indeed coddled.  They were protected from what were regarded as dangerous ideas.  Actually, you saw an example of that in the comments about Russell.  It happened to be a little bit earlier, but that was very much the case in the academic environment and, in fact, the intellectual culture generally in the 1950s and early 60s.  That's why when you look at what the student movement was doing, it was not only engaged in important tasks of trying to gain the right of free speech on campus, but in discipline after discipline, students were creating alternatives.  The major issue in the 60s, one of the major issues was the Vietnam War.  The Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars initiated by students, it's flourished since, still alive, was a critique of the prevailing orthodoxy in political science and Asian studies department, which was extremely rigid.  Same happened in economics and political science and history and so on.  The Union of Concerned Sciences scientists was critiquing the unwillingness of the scientific community to confront seriously the effects of the use of the technology and scientific ideas that they were developing.  This was prevalent throughout.  And if you look back at the orthodoxy of the 60s, you can understand why.  We may have forgotten, but it's worth remembering.  So, for example, in the 1960s, the leading study of American diplomatic history by a distinguished liberal scholar, blandly described the task of the colonists once they had attained independence.  Their task, he said, was to turn to the job of felling trees and Indians and expanding to the national borders.  That's pervasive orthodoxy, felling trees and Indians and expanding to the national borders.  Not a hint of protest.  Actually, if you look up the phrase on Google, you'll find the nature of the protest.  A couple of dozen quotes from things of mine and nothing else because no one saw anything wrong with it.  Today, I think it would be inconceivable that you could have a statement like that almost anywhere, but certainly not in the leading most prestigious history of American diplomacy.  And it continues.  The leading anthropologists in the country were telling us that the Indian population was a group of scattered savages dedicated to vicious warfare.  or no culture or nothing.  In the Cold War, which was of course raging at the time, the soul idea that could be expressed was what's called the orthodox position.  The United States is absolute sublimity.  Our enemy is ultimate evil.  Nothing further to discuss.  If you think about this, it not only coddled the minds of students, but coddled the general population.  So you look at attitudes at the time.  about 5% of the population thought that interracial marriages were tolerable.  50 years later, it's about 90%.  And a large reason for that is the impact of student activism.  You have to recall that in the 1960s, the United States still had anti-miscegenation laws, the laws so severe that when the Nazis in the 1930s were looking for models.  These were the only ones they could find, but they were too harsh.  So the Nazis wouldn't accept them because US had the one drop of blood principle.  That was too much for the Nazis.  Same on issue after issue.  It's something that one should definitely bear in mind.  So yes, the academic culture, the intellectual culture were safe spaces.  They were coddling the American mind.  And the student activism has played an enormous role in the vanguard of demolishing much of this.  There's plenty to be done still.  We can say not this extreme, but similar things today.  And that should be recognized.  In fact, it's happened right here in Tucson, as many of you know better than I do.  There was an effort by the legislature to kill a very effective Mexican-American studies program in the schools.  It was confronted by students, high school students, who demonstrated, protested effectively, They didn't manage to ban the law, but they did help create a mentality which led the federal judge to impose an injunction so that it can't be applied.  These are very important things to keep in mind, I think, in the background when we talk about the problems of free speech on campus today, which are very significant ones. ",
