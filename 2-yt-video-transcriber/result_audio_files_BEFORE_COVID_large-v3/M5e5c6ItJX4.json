            "text": "Good morning everyone.  Blessings.  It's Amanda.  I hope you're having a wonderful start to your day.  Glory to God.  I have some brief words to release, some insight that the Lord has given me in all his glory.  Oh glory be to God.  I'm going to pray and then we are going to get into this, okay?  So Father God, in the name of Jesus Christ, we come before you, Lord.  We praise you that you are God and there is none like you.  We acknowledge you sent your one and only son, Jesus Lord, as we approach your throne to die on the cross, to take our place father god when we did not deserve.  father god for you to send your one and only son for us.  holy spirit in the name of jesus.  you are welcome in this place.  consume this room consume this broadcast.  let your fire fall.  you are anointing.  fall, Lord, upon those who are watching.  Have your way, Father God, for we love you, we glorify you, we honor you, Father God, this day for who you are, that you are the giver of life, that you are our loving Father, our fierce protector, our soon-coming King.  We give you all the glory this day.  Have your way, Lord, in Jesus' name.  Amen and amen.  so this was given to me today by the power of the blood of Jesus Christ.  me only the truth come forth.  strategy comes in times of war.  it's where the greatest strategies are released.  the Lord is set to pour out the greatest keys and strategies on to his children.  his chosen is anointed.  the greatest revelations will be released powerful prophecies like fire.  This is why so many feel the pressure and the fight is so strong because the Lord is now going to use the enemy's own weapons to backfire, to boomerang back on him, to do a reverse, to birth forth the greatest outpouring of the revelation and the keys from the kingdom and the anointing of God we have ever seen.  So all glory be to God.  If it is getting heavy right now, this is why.  Push through it, soldier.  Push through it right now because you're almost there.  Push through it because breakthrough is right in front of you.  Glory be to God.  you don't play ball with the demonic forces.  you take a spiritual bat and swing at them until they are no more.  you don't play with them.  they don't want to be your friend.  okay they are out to destroy you do not play with them.  okay Curse the root of their power in the name of Jesus Christ so it cannot touch you.  You know, loosen, cast them to a dry place and bind and banish them there in Jesus name.  The Lord has given you the power to trample upon serpents and scorpions and against all the power of the enemy.  So nothing shall by any means harm you.  The Lord has given us the weapons of our warfare that are not carnal, that are mighty through God to the pulling down the destruction of strongholds.  Use the weapon of our warfare, which are spiritual weapons.  Use them right now in this hour.  The Lord gave me this too about churches and the abortion bill that was passed.  Many a church are not rising up against this abortion bill because they are in bed with the high democratic leaders.  They are being financed by them.  They are being controlled behind the scenes by big donors and political players.  And I, the Lord, am going to vomit capital letters them out.  Many have signed their death warrants.  They have given themselves over to the enemy, and if they want and desire to serve their father, the devil, so there they shall go, says the Lord of hosts this day.  I shall make a spectacle of these churches who have become temples for false gods and idolatry, and every stench of hidden sin they think they have covered.  I, the Lord, am going to air it out for all to see.  as there was an angel of death released over egypt so shall i the lord release against those wicked wicked sons and daughters of baal and baphomet who have chosen to take innocent newborn children and spill their blood for their cause.  for the blood they spill it shall be stained upon their entire household says the lord.  my children the weapons of your war are not capital letters carnal but mighty.  through god to the pulling down and destruction of strongholds.  come into agreement and capital letters pull them down.  Thus sayeth the Lord of hosts in Jesus' name.  Glory be to God.  Father God, we pray you protect this broadcast, Lord, that your hedge of fire falls.  Father God, in the name of Jesus Christ, we take authority, Father God, over every power in the air, which is warlocks.  marine spirits, Father God, unclean spirits.  We command in the name of Jesus Christ that power to die and we curse the root of it in the name of Jesus Christ.  Command it is loosed in the name of Jesus, cast to a dry place and bound and banished in the name of Jesus Christ that it cannot touch this broadcast or those who want to watch and draw closer to the Lord in Jesus' name.  Amen and amen.  God bless you guys.  I love you all.  Keep the faith. ",
