But it was more like I wanted to hear what you had to say.  And I agree with one thing I can name, which is like increasing parent like paternity leave or whatever.  So, or maternity or whatever it is.  And so one thing I do want to say to the audience is if I came here with no knowledge on abortion, you would have convinced me because of all your fear tactics and all of your, you're like, let's bring out the gore.  Let's talk about like killing babies.  Oh, it was gory though.  So what I wanted to say though, was I encourage everyone in this audience to actually realize like what it means to be to have bodily autonomy, to be pro-choice, which is not pro-abortion.  It's pro-choose.  No, yeah, I'm getting that.  It's pro-choosing the right to have an abortion if you feel that's necessary.  So I want to ask the question, what makes you qualified to tell everyone here that abortion is so bad and it should be illegal when in reality, are you a scientist?  Are you an OBGYN?  Do you have any kind of degree?  that makes it so like we should be listening to you because you're, oh my gosh, you're this figure that is, So correct on all these issues like I I want to hear what you have to say about like your background.  that makes this.
