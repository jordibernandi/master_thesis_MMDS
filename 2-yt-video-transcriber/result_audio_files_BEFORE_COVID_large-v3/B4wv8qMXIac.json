That would be like me swearing an oath to keep the Big Mac recipe for their sauce for the Big Mac a secret, but yet not know anything about it.  Is that a good analogy?  No, I don't think it is.  Well, it could be.  But anyway, guys, be sure to go to Alabama Freedom Watch Subscribe to the channel.  He's going to get over 1,000 before the 9 is over.  Because that is how good the video is.  So like I said, go to his channel.  There's a link below in the description box.  Because I prefer you watch his video to see the First Amendment audit encounter with the dumbest cop ever.  This is the Radical Reactor.  I'm out. ",
