            "text": "I am getting ready to start seeing clients for the day, but there was something I had on my mind that I wanted to ask you about.  So I posted a video and I was talking about my, you know, hormones and things like that.  And I referred to myself as a non-binary elder.  And this is a phrase I've been using for, I think, a couple of years now.  And, you know, these things just kind of pop in your head and It seems like it maybe is a good idea and it fits right and it conveys a message and maybe also conveys like a feeling of sorts.  And so, so far it seems like most folks have been, they connect with it.  Like other people who are non-binary are able to, it helps designate that I am older than people who are non-binary and realizing this at younger ages.  and a lot of people like hearing from people who are older.  So here's the question I have for you is that I shared that, video on Instagram and somebody had mentioned that they didn't think I should use that.  Now, here's the thing I think is confusing.  They said you shouldn't use the word elderly to describe yourself because I think of that more as people who are older than you are, Dara.  And so the thing is that I definitely was not using the word elderly.  I agreed that that would not be accurate.  And so sorry about that.  Um, what I am wondering, even though that wasn't the word that I was using, I did kind of take a step back and think about the word elder.  And I wanted to see if I want to see what you think of that.  I guess I think of it in a way where somebody who is elder sometimes is just older than somebody else.  Maybe it's not like in terms of indicating that somebody is much, much older or a certain age group or second decade of age.  I have a friend who calls themselves an elder and they're only 35 years old and I'm 45 years old, but they are still older in terms of growing up as a teenager, not knowing that being non-binary was an option.  So, but I want to be sensitive.  So I wanted to ask you, I'm going to ask also my Instagram audience and also my Twitter audience and also my Facebook audience, because I think there's going to be maybe different perspectives from each group.  So this is my, my posing the question to my YouTube audience.  I look forward to hearing what your thoughts are.  And yeah, I'll talk to you again soon. ",
