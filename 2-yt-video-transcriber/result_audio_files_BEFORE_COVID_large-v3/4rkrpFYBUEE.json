            "text": "Julius K. Nyerere, the 74-year-old former president of Tanzania and one of Africa's most respected elder statesmen, led his country to independence in 1961 and presided over it until 1985.  Searching for a development path for his dirt poor country, he introduced a governing concept that was meant to meld socialism with traditional tribal government.  He called it Ujamaa, Swahili for familyhood.  Through benign one-party rule and emphasizing racial and tribal harmony and moralistic self-sacrifice, Nyerere unified Tanzania from a far-flung collection of tribes into a nation.  But the country faltered.  After Nyerere stepped down from power in 1985, the country was in shambles and the socialist experiment was viewed as a failure.  Nyerere resigned voluntarily after serving four terms.  He handed over power to a constitutionally chosen successor, one of the few peaceful transitions in a region dominated by military governments and coup d'etat.  Neighboring Burundi and Rwanda have not been so lucky.  Since their independence in 1962, both have been torn by fighting between factions from the majority Hutu tribe and the minority Tutsis.  Millions on both sides have been killed.  most recently from the Hutu genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994.  That produced waves of refugees, also in the millions, that spilled into Tanzania, Zaire, Uganda, and other border states.  The minority Tutsis have now regained control of Rwanda and have called for reconciliation as thousands of Hutus have begun returning to the ravaged country.  In Burundi, A military coup by Tutsi leader Pierre Bouyoya is still in effect, despite a call by leaders from the region to return to democratic rule.  Julius Nyerere has come out of retirement and at recent summits in Arusha, Tanzania and elsewhere has been involved in mediating the conflicts in the Great Lakes region.  Called Imwalimu, the Swahili word for teacher, Nyerere has devoted much of his time to African solutions to Africa's problems. ",

            "text": "When we have African problems, We ourselves have a duty to solve our problems.  I think we must accept that.  When you have African problems, we should try on our own to solve those problems.  We would prefer the outside world to keep out.  If we want help, we can seek for help.  But you realize sometimes we ask for help and it doesn't come.  On the 5th of last month, our leaders met in Nairobi.  and said we need an external, we need a force to go into Zaire to help the refugees to come back.  It's not happening.  And we appealed to the United Nations to establish that force and we said we would also be participating in that force.  Well, quite frankly, this is not happening.  What is happening is a kind of self-help within within Eastern Zaire itself and the refugees are going back.  I hope I think the lesson which Africa should draw from that is that they should they they should rely upon themselves to the maximum when it comes to dealing with African problems.  well thank you.
