We can't just be passing out empathy like donuts covered in Skittles.  Question of the day.  Let me start this off.  On a scale from one to 10, how much empathy do you have for the modern day fat pride movement?  And is thin privilege a thing?  Let me know below because the new social justice crusade is to expand this idea of privilege to every possible area.  And there was this video not too long ago and they've been expanding upon this actually doing more videos.  But this is the one that I think is the most egregious about thin privilege.  Let's just, well, let's go through this piece by piece and you'll see why I'm so disturbed. ",

This is so obnoxious.  And by the way, perceived as thin?  What is perceived as thin?  This is one thing that people always talk.  They act as though we don't know how to make these judgments.  Line up 10 people, okay?  Make nine of them within the bounds of health.  They don't have to be all thin.  They can be somewhat chubby.  They can be overweight.  They can be on the thin side.  They can be right dead center.  Make one of them really obese.  Then take 10 people, these other same 10 people can be obese, they can be thin.  I guarantee you every single time they can go, well, that's the fat one.  It's not perception.

No.  But if you refuse to do it and then demand that people praise you, it's like a kid who no one can stand because they don't want to reward any behavior because we're supposed to reward all behavior.  And by the way, this goes both ways.  My wife is naturally very thin.  She gets a lot of flack for it.  We've talked about this.  She had a complex growing up because people would imply that she had some kind of eating disorder.  You've seen her parents.  They're all tall and thin.  Six foot and thin.  She's naturally that way.  I can't tell you how many women I've had around her.  She's like, we only carry sizes for real women or you need to eat a sandwich.  Yeah.  This happens all the time.  Listen, you don't think that the only difference is she's within the realm.  She is thinner.  She was when she was younger right now.  She wouldn't know it when you look at her.  When she was younger and she grew up really quickly, she was thinner, but she was well within the bounds of health.  And that's something else.  By the way, men do not expect women to be perfect just as you don't expect men to be perfect.  Hopefully, women out there don't expect all men to have a six-pack that comes with weeks of dieting down and diuretics and getting into a hot tub with winter greens so you can have veins in your lower abdomen.  We hope you don't expect that, just like we don't expect all of you to look like a cover model.  We do, however, find ourselves biologically more attracted to women who fit within, the good news is, a very wide spectrum of weights, shapes, and sizes, as long as they are healthy.  Just like Jussie Smollett with fake crimes and poop swastika in Covington, what happens here is when you go out there and you demand that everybody praise you and you claim a new marginalized status, you hurt people who are actually marginalized.  And here's the thing, there's an empathy bank for everybody.  A lot of people don't like to admit this, but we have a certain bandwidth of empathy.  We can't just be passive.  and out empathy like donuts covered in Skittles.  So we reserve the right to not give it to you because we want to give it to the veteran who had an arm blown off in Vietnam.  Or we reserve it for somebody who might have some kind of degenerative brain disease.  that can't help it.  You ate too many Skittles covered donuts.  Hey there, if you liked this video, subscribe or click one of these videos playing in a box.  You know what?  Hit the notification bell because subscriptions don't really mean anything anymore, especially if you're not 18 or older, at the very least logged into YouTube as 18 or older, because sometimes people are 25, but they don't know how to use the YouTube system properly.  And then you never just hit the notification bell or you hate yourself. ",
