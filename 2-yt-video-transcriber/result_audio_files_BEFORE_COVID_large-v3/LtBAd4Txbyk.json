            "text": "As the sheriff said, today we're here to update everyone on the new developments in a very old cold case homicide.  The actual incident date was April 18th in 1980, where a Caucasian female was found near the banks of the North Canadian River in eastern Oklahoma County.  It was determined she was 18 to 25 years of age at her time of death.  It was later determined she had been killed by gunshot.  And it was apparent that efforts had been made to accelerate her decomposition because her body was covered in lime.  All the traditional methods of identification, they proved to be unsuccessful.  And over the years, she became known as the lime lady.  So I think I picked this case up about 2008.  And at that time, I enlisted, this is Sergeant Kathy Foote.  She's a technical investigator, and I enlisted her to help me with the forensic portions and other research.  And I'll tell you, through the years, we did our due diligence.  We tried everything conventional to try to get this young woman identified.  And it just came to a point where, you know, I thought, well, Let's try something unconventional.  So in the latter part of 2018, I contacted the DNA Doe Project, just made a phone call, and I talked to Dr.  Colleen Fitzpatrick, who is one of the directors of that organization, and I just was asking Well, what about my case?  Is there anything you think you can help me with?  And what that is, is they are an initiative that uses genetic genealogy through DNA to try to identify John and Jane does, and they've had a remarkable success in some of the older cold cases.  And she was very receptive and, uh, had actually heard of this case.  And after several phone conversations, she said, I'll tell you what, if you can find quality and quantity DNA, we could make a lab referral and we'll see if we can't come up with a profile.  And so we selected bloodstain and oral swab.  And we forwarded that to the lab referral from the DNA Doe Project.  And months went by, about nine months, I think, total.  And I finally got a call, October 30th of 2019.  And they said, well, we've got a profile for you.  And I thought, okay, you know.  And we're going to send it to our genealogy research team to go from here.  and so I'd like to introduce Karen Binder with the DNA Doe Project and she is over the research team that that took care of that for us.  and so two days on November 2nd I got a call from a Karen, and she said, well, we've got your girl.  And I thought, what girl?  But it turned out it was a candidate for the identification of our victim.  And I thought that was just amazing of how fast that occurred.  Now, she made it clear that this is a candidate.  It's not a 100% sure, but it's a really good candidate.  And now it came back to me.  I have to find a relative for a DNA comparison or some type of medical records to confirm the identity.  And it became difficult because her immediate family was all deceased.  And so through the course of my investigation, I ended up learning that our victim had served in the military.  She was in the United States Army.  So then I reached out to another colleague, Angela Berg, here with the medical examiner's office, and I said, well, can you help me maybe get some military records and we might have some luck there.  And in a couple of weeks, Angela called me back and she said, well, we've got the records and we're going to send them to Dr.  Montgomery, the orthodontist, because they had dental x-rays, and see what we can come up with.  And she called me on December 24th and said, well, Bob, your Christmas present this year is a positive confirmation on your victim.  And that confirmation is for Tamara Lee Tagard. ",

            "text": "Tamara Lee Tigard was born April 18, 1959, in California.  At the time of her disappearance, she was living in Las Vegas, Nevada, and she was reported missing from there in March of 1980.  She was a veteran who had served in the U.S.  Army, as Captain Green said, and she had parents and a sibling all living on the West Coast who are now deceased.  This is a brief timeline of the case.  Tamara's remains were discovered on April 18th, 1980.  Traditional investigative methods failed to identify her and efforts had been made by her killer to hasten her decomposition and cover up her identity.  In September 2018, Captain Bob Green contacted DNA Doe Project to see if we could assist with the case.  The process of obtaining a usable DNA profile was a long one.  In early 2019, Othram Incorporated was able to get some DNA extract from a sample of Tamara's blood, but they were unable to create a usable sequence profile for her.  So later in July of the same year, the sample was sent to Hudson Alpha for a second sequencing attempt, and they were able to sequence her DNA.  On October 11th, the sequence data was sent to our bioinformatics team where Dr.  Gregory Magoon created a GEDmatch uploadable kit for her.  And on October 30th, her kit was uploaded to GEDmatch.  So we were able to see her matches on the 31st.  We're really proud that it only took us about a day and a half to come up with an ID for Tamara as a potential candidate, and I was able to report that to Captain Green on November 2nd.  Captain Green then followed up with the US Army to obtain dental records, which confirmed her identity on December 24th, 2019.  A really great Christmas present for us.  I want to point out that GEDmatch has a policy in which users have to opt in for law enforcement matching, so we can only see DNA matches that have been opted in.  In Tamara's case, that was only about 17% of her matches, and yet we were still able to identify her in a day and a half, so we're really proud of that accomplishment.  On this slide you can see a family tree which we built for Tamara and her DNA matches.  Her closest match was a second cousin once removed so that's quite a good match for us to start with and that's why we were able to identify her so quickly.  There were also a couple of fourth cousins on both her mother and father's side.  On the following slide there's another family tree which shows a few more matches which reassured us that Tamara was a good candidate. ",

            "text": "Of course, you're not going to reveal who they are.  Are you working suspects?  A lot of times these cases, the police will off the record say they think they know who they are, but there's no case.  Are you working suspects?  I actually have a few people to talk to.  I can't really comment on the homicide investigation.  It's not over.  How much have you been working with Nevada law enforcement now that you know where Tamara was from?  Well, through the course of my investigations, I discovered that she had some history in Las Vegas.  And so I just reached out to a homicide detective in Las Vegas, and he did some research on her name.  And there was a missing persons report back in the day.  It was around for a few years.  Another twist in the case is that there was a law enforcement contact with a woman in Ohio, actually, that she was using our victim's identifiers, and that's how she was cleared from that missing persons case.  You know, I have a photo of her, but I don't know who she is.  Just another place to try to go. ",
