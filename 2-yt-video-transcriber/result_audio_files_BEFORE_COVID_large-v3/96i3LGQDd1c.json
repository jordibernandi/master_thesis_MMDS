James read my book on a vacation in the Cayman Islands, got so upset about what he found out about the boy crisis, he volunteered to start the first government entity in the United States looking at boys and men's issues, which is the Staten Island Council on Boys and Men's Issues.  And he said he wanted to talk with you about making this a significant issue in the campaign.  This is a guy that when he reads a book, He gets deep into it.  He really does.  And he doesn't just read skin.  He really gets into it.  He saw the father's issues, the issues of about 92% of our mass shooters have not had dad involvement.  Oh, wow.  Which you probably instinctively know.  Yeah.  and that prisoners, while there's a 93% male prison population, that 90 some odd percent of them do not have fathers and are ISIS recruits, the same statistic, 90 plus percent.  So the trillion, approximately trillion dollars that I calculated would be saved by getting the, like a White House Council on Boys and Men, And then getting fathers, I'm sorry, having that White House Council on Boys and Men begin to work on getting father warriors trained to be warriors, trained to do communication, that type of thing.

Right now we lock up more people, including more dads than any other country on the face of the planet.  2.3 million behind bars right now as we're enjoying our freedom on this beautiful day.  disproportionately comprised of people of color.  Not only are we locking up that person's potential, not only are we locking them up very often for possession of marijuana, a substance that's illegal in most states in the country, but we're locking up their opportunity to raise their family and provide a role model for their sons and daughters.  So ending the schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline, ending the war on drugs that has become a war on people, Ending the prohibition on marijuana and expunging the arrest records for those caught for possession of something that is legal in most of the country is a great step to take in the right direction.  And then investing in families, paid family leave, universal guaranteed high quality health care, access to higher education.  That's going to produce a return that we can measure in terms of economic growth.  and tax receipts, but it's also gonna produce a return in terms of the integrity of the American family and the ability for more fathers to have a chance to raise their daughters and importantly to your question, their sons.
