I actually looked into this in, in other Amazons, not amazon.com or UK, but, um, and like India, they are selling a product that you can take.  Women can take these pills, uh, and it makes it look like they're bleeding after sex.  So, um, people just can't understand why anyone would want to do that.  Uh, and it basically boils down to how sad, you know, certain societies are where women are absolutely expected to be virgins on their wedding night.  Um, and if they're not, they can fake it now.  So, um, Shubham, what do you think about this? ",

And, It's like, okay, so like I was saying earlier, like sex, the topic, the concept of sex is a taboo in India, which is an irony because considering the huge population, sex is the thing that most people engage in.  And the only thing that most people engage in is a freaking taboo in the society.  That's That's an irony of the next level.  And I mean, even if you ask people in India, they'll say like, Oh no, boys can't.  Okay.  Even, even boys having sex is kind of looked down upon, but it's not as bad as girls having sex.  Right.  Okay.  So if it's like, okay, boys can have sex maybe before marriage and stuff, even if someone accepts that, many, most people will be like, oh, no, no, no, girls can't have sex.  I mean, just the other day, I was talking to a girl and she was like, oh, no, we girls cannot have sex.  We need to stay virgins.  I'm like, okay, how are you supposed to achieve that unless boys are having gay sex with each other?  How are girls supposed to remain virgins? ",

            "text": "So the difference I think is, and you guys could let me know if I'm looking at this correctly, but I think the mentality is when boys are having sex before marriage, they're just doing something wrong and that's bad, right?  But when girls are having sex before marriage, It's beyond doing something back.  They now use property, right?  So women are, when you marry a woman in most societies, it's still kind of like a purchase between the father and the son, the father and the husband, right?  So it's kind of like the husband, the new husband is taking a property away from the father and it's now his property.  And if the girl had sex before marriage, it's kind of like buying underwear that was used before you purchased it.  You know what I mean?  That's how it's looked at, right?  So it's kind of like women are treated like property and this is a used product.  It's broken.  Like, why are you giving me something where... So when men had sex before marriage, it's not... it's not like some.  the fact that woman had sex some other woman had sex with her doesn't really change his body right.  there's nothing.  her body was changed.  i don't have her stink on me anymore at all right.  i did something to her.  she didn't do something to me.  i did something to her right.  i put something on her.  but when when a woman has sex before marriage There's something in those societies, in the minds of men and women as well, there's something fundamentally changed about her.  There's something, you know, virginity, the virginity of men, that being broken, that doesn't really change something about his body.  But when they think that the virginity of women, when that is broken, there's something significantly changed about her, right?  And that's why they see her as something used.  That's why women are often compared to chewed gum or a candy that was, its wrapping was over and there's bugs sitting all over it.  And now would you want to lick that now?  If you had a candy, you know, a candy that its wrapping was open and was left with all these bugs lying all over it.  But men are never compared to that.  Men that had sex before marriage, they are never compared to chewed gum, right?  Why is that?  Because they think like men that have sex before marriage, nothing significantly has changed about them, right?  So this notion of purity is reserved for women.  And the fact that I think the whole idea of the hymen being broken and all that, that just supports that idea that look, when men have sex, There's no way physically to detect the difference between a man that had sex before marriage and a man that hasn't had sex before marriage.  But for a woman, in their mind, again, this is not accurate because there's other ways for you with extreme sports and whatnot.  But for a woman, there's something physically that you could identify a woman that has sex before marriage and a woman that hasn't had sex before marriage.  And that physical difference for them, they translate that to a more spiritual difference, a more significant spiritual difference as well, right?  Even though the physical difference is so insignificant for them, that just proof of the spiritual difference as well, which is a lot more significant.  What do you guys think about what I just said?  Do you think that's right?  Yeah. ",

And they are really backwards, barbaric, ancient ways of life that need to die.  So yeah, Hinduism is a way of life.  And it's a way of life that needs to end.  And it's a way of life that needs to be ridiculed.  It's a way of life that needs to be mocked.  It's a way of life that needs to be called out.  And it's a way of life that needs to end.  Okay?

If they were Muslims, their voices would be heard.  But they are atheists, and not many seem to be listening.  Let's make it difficult for them to ignore us.  We have built a global community, and now we are tearing down geographic, cultural, and language barriers so we can find each other and support each other.  In the last decade, we have built the largest atheist community in the world.  Now we're doing the same in other languages.  With your help, we have started Atheist Republic in Persian and Arabic.  As we grow, we can dedicate more time, staff, and resources to start doing the same in Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Bengali, Urdu, Hindi, and other languages.  We are providing community, support, informative content, and amplifying the voices of those who need protection, especially in countries where people feel isolated simply for their lack of belief.  We want to be there for them, and we are only getting started.  Help us get there.  Check in the description for ways you can support our projects. ",
