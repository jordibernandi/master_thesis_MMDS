            "text": "of human rights violations.  Thank you very much.  And thank you, everybody.  It's a good issue and a very important issue.  We're going to strengthen up our southern border.  That should have been done 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago.  It's a disgrace.  It's a disgrace.  And now you have problems even with, I understand yesterday, even people from Venezuela want to come through.  Everybody wants to come through.  Part of it is the success of our country, but we're going to keep our country successful.  And we want people to come in.  It's so important to say we need people.  We have a lot of companies moving in.  A lot of companies are moving back into the United States that never thought they'd be moving back, and we need people.  You see that with the jobs numbers.  We really need people.  But it has to be through a legal process and a process really of merit.  But we do want people coming into our country.  They have to come in legally.  I just want to thank everybody for being here.  What you go through is incredible, and the job you do is incredible.  Few people could do what you do.  And we want to try and make it easier for you, or another way you could this way handle more of the incredible work, because no matter what we do, it's not going to stop, but we can reduce it incredibly by tremendous numbers.  So I just want to thank everybody for being here, and we're very proud of you, very proud of the job you do.  Thank you very much.  And, Madam Secretary, thank you very much.  Really great.  The Press Mr.  President?  The President.  Yeah, please.  The Press Mr.  President, why not just go ahead and do the controversy now if the COVID-19 is not?  \u2014 The President.  Well, we're building the wall then.  Yeah, we're building the wall.  People don't understand that.  They're starting to learn.  a lot of money that we have on hand.  It's like in a business, but we have money on hand.  And we're building, I would say, we will have 115 miles of wall, maybe a little bit more than that very shortly.  It's being built.  Some of it's already been completed.  And in San Diego, if you look, it's been completed.  It's really beautiful, brand new.  We have other wall that's under construction, and we're giving out a lot of contracts.  So we're building the wall.  It's getting built one way or the other.  Is there another option besides the medical emergency?  We are doing things right now.  I mean, we're building it with funds that are on hand.  We're negotiating very tough prices.  We've designed a much better-looking wall.  that is also actually a better wall, which is an interesting combination.  It's far more beautiful, and it's better.  It's much more protective.  But it looks better because the walls that they used to build were not very attractive.  I actually think that's possibly part of the problem.  But the real problem is we need something.  We have to have a very strong barrier.  But we're building a lot of wall right now as we speak.  And we're renovating a lot of wall.  And we're getting ready to give out some very big contracts with money that we have on hand and money that comes in.  But we will be looking at a national emergency because I don't think anything's going to happen.  I think the Democrats don't want border security.  And when I hear them talking about the fact that walls are immoral and walls don't work, they know they work.  I watched somebody being interviewed the other day by a very good anchor.  And the anchor actually was getting angrier and angrier as they tried to explain how a wall doesn't really have that much of an impact.  And yet thousands of people are on one side of the wall and nobody's on the other side of the wall.  It was actually laughable.  and really horrible in the same breath.  So that's the way it is.  You know, if you look at El Paso, if you look at certain places, but El Paso was one of the most dangerous cities in the whole country.  Once the wall was completed, it became one of the safest.  Immediately.  It wasn't like it took five years.  Some of you know this.  Immediately, it became one of the safest cities in the whole country.  So we're building the wall.  A lot of it is, I mean, the chant now should be finish the wall as opposed to build the wall, because we're building a lot of wall.  And I started this six months ago.  We really started going to town because I could see we're getting nowhere with the Democrats.  We're not going to get anywhere with them.  It's going to be a part of their campaign, but I don't think it's good politically.  And I think Nancy Pelosi should be ashamed of herself because she's hurting a lot of people.  I think the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves.  Now, in all fairness to the Democrats, many of them want the wall.  And I see it.  They're just dying to say what they want to say.  But they can't say it as well as they would be able to if they were allowed to do it.  Yes.  The Press Mr.  President, so are you saying now you believe that on February the 15th the only option you will have left is either close down the government or declare an emergency?  Because you don't have any faith that this committee will come up with an answer.  And if you do declare an emergency, are you concerned that you will almost be immediately being joined by some court in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals District?  The President.  Well, we have very, very strong standing.  It would be very hard to do that.  But they tend to go to the Ninth Circuit.  And when they go to the Ninth Circuit, things happen.  For instance, the ban, it missed and then missed and then was approved in the United States Supreme Court, where we have had a very good record.  They go to the Ninth Circuit in many cases.  And, in fact, in most cases, it has nothing to do with the Ninth Circuit.  It's a shame what they do.  So, let's see what happens.  I can only tell you this, John.  We have very, very strong legal standing to win.  We are doing it regardless.  I mean, we don't have \u2014 we haven't declared the national emergency yet, and yet we're building a lot of wall.  We're continuing to build a lot of wall with, as we would say in business, cash on hand.  And we're negotiating tough prices.  We have a great system, a great wall system. ",
