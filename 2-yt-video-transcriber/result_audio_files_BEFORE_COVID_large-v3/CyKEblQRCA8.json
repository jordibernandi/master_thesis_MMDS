            "text": "Let's talk about an insane case of discrimination in high school athletics.  This is about a Diamond High School swimmer who was denied a victory last Friday after she was disqualified for a, quote, uniform violation.  Well, that sounds serious.  What was wrong with her uniform?  Well, Annette Rode, who was working as an official at the dual meet back on Friday, said she froze in disbelief when she saw the disqualification decision by the meet referee, who has not been officially identified.  Rode said, I told her, I need to know how you're defining this because this is going to blow up.  She said the official replied that the bottom of the girl's suit was so far up I could see butt cheek touching butt cheek.  And South High coach Cliff Murray said at the beginning of the season that high school coaches were told that as far as the buttocks region goes, you should not be showing any part of the intergluteal cleft.  I don't think I've ever heard that term before.  And so this athlete was disqualified as a result of this.  Now, there are several things you need to understand about this case.  First, she was wearing the official school approved handed out swimwear.  It's what they told her to wear.  You should also understand that she's black. ",

After winning, the judge isn't concerned with the time or any of the specifics of the technical part of the swimming to make sure that they didn't break any other rules.  I'm not sure what else the judge is looking for, but she's looking at her butt.  Closely enough to see butt cheek touch butt cheek.  Now, if a father of some other athlete in the stand says, I'm seeing that six-tall and all the girl is.  I'm gonna throw 16 since it's a high school age.  A 16-year-old girl's butt cheek touching other butt cheek.  I would run him out of the school and be like, I need you to stop looking at these girls so closely.  What's wrong with you?  This is the problem.  How about we let the race finish?  And let the kid win.  What is she supposed to wear?  What's the alternative?  If a kid shows up and does something against the rules, there's usually an alternate thing they're supposed to do instead.  What else was she supposed to do?  Yeah.  That's the question should be asked of this judge, by the way, which is not identified yet.  You can throw down a ruling like this, take away this victory and then not be identified.  Stop being a coward, come forward and stand up for what you did. ",
