            "text": "What a week.  We live in the world.  But we are not of the world.  But are we affected by those worldly people?  But to give us full context of what I want to talk about today, we'd have to go all the way back to the beginning so that we could declare the very, very end.  And in Genesis, Genesis chapter 2, excuse me, Genesis chapter 12.  Did I say 2?  Genesis chapter 12, verse 2.  Yahuwah said to Abraham, Abram back then, I want to make you a goy gadol, a goy gadol, a great nation.  From you will come a goy gadol, a great nation.  The Hebrew word there for nation is goy.  The Greek word that is used to translate that Hebrew word in the Septuagint is anthropos, anthropos, where, of course, we get the word anthropology, the study of man.  And that's what we're going to be looking at today.  Genesis chapter 12, verse 2, the promise given to Abraham, out of you shall come a goy, A goy, a nation, gadol, great, a great nation.  Now, as we delve in, we're going to find again the Greek word anthropos for nation.  anthropology the study of man.  and this is my lead in.  this is my intro because you and I in Revelation chapter 2 specifically we need to study declare and find out who is the strongman the anthropos the strongman.  we need to name the strongman Anthropos, anthropology, the study of man, because the strong man, my friends, is the gatekeeper.  The strong man is the gatekeeper.  In Acts chapter 19 verse 15, there were some vagabond Jews, they were exorcists.  Hellacious, wicked as hell, exorcists.  seven sons of Sceva and you'll remember the narrative in Acts chapter 19 verse 15. hey what's your name?  what is your name?  what is your character?  where do you get your authority?  what is your authority?  what is your legal right?  identify the strongman anthropos a nation exorcists wicked evil demonic.  this is what we're delving into because you'll remember the seven sons of Sceva said well yahushua I know in fact Paul I know but who are you?  The strong man, the gatekeeper is the synagogue of Satan.  And it's going to be identified because we need to bind the strongman which has just been loosed through, of course, the signing of the executive order which was just done in this prior week.  We witness the final descent this week of bootleg.  Israel signed into an executive order And you know, some things just don't change, do they?  Because it's written in 1 Samuel 8, verse 19.  Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of the prophet Samuel.  And they said, nay, but we will have a king over us that we also may be just like the nations.  We want to be recognized as a nation, a nationality.  We want to be just like the nations and that our king will adjudicate for us.  He'll be the one that will adjudicate for us.  He'll be the one that will go before us.  And guess what?  If we can get him to do that, he'll fight all of our battles.  That just took place this week.  This is the final descent of bootleg Israel as we now enter into apocalyptic proportions at a level never seen in this Goy.  And the synagogue of Esetan, they turn the prophecies given to Abraham upside on its head and actually use goy as a derogatory term against the followers of Yahushua.  They say, oh, you're goyim, you're goy.  But it's actually biblically a blessing to be the Goy Gadol, the great nation.  You see, what is up is down.  What's black is white.  It is Luciferic and occult.  And today, the Goy, the Anthropos, the strongman will be named.  The gatekeeper is the synagogue of Esetan, and it has to be bound.  It has to be bound.  This is so important that the end-time saints, that are the true believers, that hold the testimony of Yahushua and keep his commandments, they have a common identity, those true believers.  They identify the strong man.  They wrestle with the strong man, the synagogue of Esetan.  We see that in chapter 2, and we will see it again in chapter 3.  There's three things, three things.  Number one, the synagogue of essay tam wants to be like the nations and nationality.  number two they want to have that king adjudicate for them.  and number three they want that king who adjudicates for them to go before them and fight their battles as they lay behind the scenes.  This is... what we're up against today.  Get ready for severe hate speech laws.  The synagogue of Esetan has employed their king, Clan Trump Kushner, to make Judaism a nationality.  It's been signed into an executive order.  And Ashkenaz wants the same three things.  Number one, to be like the nations and nationality.  Number two, to have Washington,  D.C.,  which is their kingdom, go and adjudicate for them.  And number three, have D.C.  go before them and fight their end-time occult battle to set up their temple.  This is now had rocket fuel added to it.  And you will see what had little traction has now got thrust force to be able to go forward in an exponential rate.  So we really just took a huge leap.  Massive nosedive of apocalyptic proportions with Klan Trump Kushner signing in an executive order that was spelled up by the synagogue of Es-Satan, which punishes anyone in speaking against the Ashkenazi.  Not only does it mean that, but it also means that you cannot speak against the state of Israel, which was created in 1948.  Now, many of you may have watched it on the television, but it's very interesting to know.  at that ceremony of signing in that executive order, you will have to have noticed that The vice president, Mike Pence, was not standing on stage as the right-hand man of the president, was he?  No, he was down with the common folk, or as the synagogue of Es-Satan would say, the Goyim.  But to his right were two Chabadniks, Ivanka and Jared standing at the right hand of the president.  What did that communicate?  What does that communicate?  At the right hand of power, we have got a major problem.  And it is addressed in this chapter specifically to the assembly of Smyrna.  This is what we're dealing with.  And it is huge.  And those that want to put their head in the sand, oh, well, you know, that's fine.  But this is very important that we layer this now with the scripture so that we can navigate ourselves through a minefield of what has happened.  It's really weird that he even signed in this executive order specifying that because, you know, I mean... You know, I like historical truth, and last time I remember reading, this kind of action was done by a man called Adolf Hitler when he kicked off the 1940s with the Nuremberg Laws that declared German Jews weren't of German nationality.  They were of a different nationality.  So this week, with the signing in of the executive order declaring Judaism as its own nationality, this then has to be, based upon historical truth, a double-edged guillotine, does it not?  It's going to cut both ways.  It's going to cut both ways.  And the ones that are going to get cut are who?  Chapter 2 tells us the believers in Yahushua will get cut.  Let me continue on.  Because this has now added rocket fuel to the sluggish Noahide laws that were finding very little traction.  Oh, now we've got traction.  We've got rocket fuel traction now to the Noahide laws that were already signed into law.  And this is now a meteoric shift toward a tribulation scenario.  Meteoric.  And I hear believers, and myself included, I get all up in arms about Islam, the Muhammadans, Sharia law.  How many are we finding of believers getting up in arms about the Noahide laws?  Because whether it's Sharia law or the Noahide laws, it's both, again, a double-edged guillotine where the ones who get cut... are the followers of Yahushua who will not compromise.  That's a specific group.  It's a group that holds the testimony of Yahushua, that keeps his commandments.  They are a kingdom of priests and a what?  A goy.  A nation.  priests Exodus chapter 19 verse 6 clarified and distinguished a very separate group of people And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Yahushua and for the word of Yahuwah, which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or their hands, and they lived and reigned with Yahushua in the millennium.  Baruch Hashem, Yahuwah.  Look at chapter 2 and verse 8.  That's my introduction for you.  I'm done.  No, wouldn't... I mean, I could go home at this point because right now I am trembling in my boots.  I have goosebumps.  I have been... The anticipation and the... Pray for me and my family.  The spiritual warfare.  Yes.  know that this was what I had to teach.  my wife has no idea what I'm teaching my kids don't.  nobody does because for me it's between me and yahuwah and prayer supplication and confirmation through the word and then I cannot speak it until I speak it first right here now and then afterwards you can come talk to me but it has to.  I have to birth it but I know what's what that means And I know the cost.  And this is... So, you know, please, download our videos that are on YouTube.  Download them to your hard drive.  Share them with your friends.  I hope we're backing everything up here.  And we want to be fully backed up because I don't know after this teaching, I hope, but we have to realize that the world has changed.  The reason we were late last week was because YouTube made us sign out and re-sign in so that we had to accept all these new terms of service.  That's why we were late last week in broadcasting.  Because of the new restrictions on speech and how they now have defined hate speech.  Chapter 2, verse 8.  If you read this... In metropolitan London, you will get in trouble with the metropolitan police.  Because they're already not protected by speech laws.  Just reading this.  So I'm glad I'm not in London, even though it feels like foggy, wet, drizzly London out here.  And to the teaching overseer of the assembly in Smyrna, write these things, says the first and the last who was dead.  And he is alive.  I know your mitzvah, your good works, your tribulation and poverty, but you are rich.  And I know the blasphemy, it's absolute blasphemy, of them who say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Esetan.  Fear none of those things that you suffer.  See, Satan shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and that you shall have tribulation for 10 days.  Now, is it possible now with these new hate speech laws and what's been signed in that you'll find that these prison sentences or these jail sentences will be for 10 years?  I mean, excuse me, for 10 days?  and then you're out on release, restriction, and your whole world has changed, just like China's got the new social scores, you'll find that this is now where we're going.  Because it's rocket fuel to what has already been laid forth with the Noahide laws, now with this executive order.  You could easily see how there could be 10 days of tribulation for speaking out such things as we are now reading today.  this very Shabbat be faithful regardless of what happens.  you have to be faithful even unto death and I will give you the crown of life.  He that has an ear, let him hear what the Ruach says to the Israelite congregation.  So if you're still watching, then I pray you give us some thumbs up that you have an ear to hear because there's already those that have bounced because they haven't an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying.  And that's okay.  But we go where we're supposed to go and we pray that those that do have the ear will receive it and spread the good word.  And I know that this is serious because the beast, Revelation tells us, chapter 13, verse 2, the beast gets his power, which means his seat, which means his authority from the dragon.  And that is Anthropos we're going to find.  This is a nationality.  The beast gets its name.  The strong man, the gatekeeper, it's about authority.  It's about its power.  It's about specifically its seat of authority is at the right hand of the power.  But the power is the beast.  And now I'm even more concerned, not necessarily just about November 2020, but maybe specifically 2024. ",
