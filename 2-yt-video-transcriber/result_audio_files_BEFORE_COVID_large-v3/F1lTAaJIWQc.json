When you're operating out of legalism, you're trying to control because you're afraid.  if you don't, sin will run rampant.  Fear, however, is the opposite of love, and so we've got a problem there.  But luckily, in Romans 2, 4, it explains how we can actually fix this problem by saying it's the goodness, the kindness of God that leads men to repentance.  You don't have to take a restrictive vice grip on Christians and tell them, be this way, and that's how you get righteous, because it's the goodness of God that's going to compel them to. ",

It could be from jealousy.  It could be from pride.  But control functions in three ways, through intimidation, through manipulation, and through domination.  Well, manipulation, let's see, someone who views himself as weaker to control another person, they try to manipulate them like Jacob in the Bible.  intimidation, someone who views himself as stronger.  They can impose their will on someone through intimidation, make them do what they want to.  But the end result of both of these actions is domination, to control and dominate another person's life.  And we know that's not a God, because He gave us a free will.  God doesn't want to control us.  But Satan seeks to control us and wants us to try to dominate and control other people's lives as well.  And it's really the result of showing that you don't trust God. ",

She set up against the Lord's prophets and tried to murder them.  She actually did murder tons of the Lord's prophets.  She functioned in that idolatry.  She functioned in that rebellion.  She manipulated her husband Ahab to try to control an entire nation.  And we even see in Revelation, the church of Thyatira, one of the seven churches, the Lord said, that spirit of Jezebel is alive today in your church.

And the deal is witchcraft has this really fanciful, ethereal name that when you say it, you start picturing all the different things.  all the silly stuff.  But the thing is that the Bible is saying witchcraft is a very applicable thing that is against the nature of God.  So where does this fit in with the life of a believer?  It's very simple.  Who would you have your life mirror?  How would you have your demeanor, your choices mirror?  Would you have it mirror the countenance and the representation of God?  Would you have it his personality?  Or would you have it mirror the personality of the enemy?  Because when you look at witchcraft, you start talking about things like rebellion, stubbornness, control.  All those things are personality traits of the enemy.  But we are the sons and daughters of God, and we're called to mirror the personality traits of the Father.  So make it very simple, guys.  Cut anything out of your life that mirrors the enemy.  Let your life be a reflection of the Father and do so because he has given you his love and your life and put you here for that purpose. ",
