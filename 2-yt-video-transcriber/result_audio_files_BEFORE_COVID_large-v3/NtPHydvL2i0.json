            "text": "Tonight, is dating advice useless if all anyone cares about is the way that you look?  I'm Roaming Millennial and you're watching Uncensored.  Hey guys, welcome back to the show.  Today we're going to be talking about dating.  Specifically, how our looks affect the way we date in this superficial culture that we live in.  So the inspiration for this video came the other day when I was scrolling through my YouTube homepage looking for something to watch when I saw a video that caught my eye.  It was titled, Being Ugly, My Experience.  Now, if you're anything like me, the word ugly is just one of those words that kind of draws your eye in and gets your attention.  And especially, we don't see a lot of people calling themselves ugly in this day and age.  I mean, we often talk about things like being marginalized in society or lacking representation in the media.  But if there's one group that that actually literally applies to, and I think it's objective, it's... ugly people.  So it was interesting to see this guy, this young guy, kind of openly call himself ugly and be willing to talk about his experiences being ugly.  And of course I watched the video and this guy seemed kind, sincere, and well-spoken.  And there are two things that are very clear in that video.  Number one, this guy really hates the way he looks.  And number two, he very much thinks that the way he looks has been responsible for his, I guess, shortcomings, for lack of a better word, when it comes to dating.  Here's some clips of that. ",

            "text": "I'm feeling really down.  Like, extremely down.  And I will tell you why.  It's cause my entire life I've been treated quite bad.  I feel really alone and I felt like I was gonna search YouTube for people with the same issue as me and that is being really unattractive.  And I've been having lots of issues with that because every video I come across is with a really attractive or normal person and they have no idea how it really is.  So first of all, right now I'm putting up quite of a show.  So if you think that I look pretty good right now, It's because I'm doing my absolute best to show you that I look good. ",

            "text": "Yeah, and so in posting this video, I mean, this guy is pretty clear.  He's not really asking for anyone's advice or anything like that or guidance or tips.  It seems like he's just posting this to share his story and so that people who maybe are going through similar things can know that they're not the only ones in that scenario.  But with that being said, I thought that the concept of how looks affect our dating prospects was a really interesting one and we've talked about dating on this show before and I've made it very clear that when it comes to dating I really think we should all be pushing ourselves to be the best that we can be not only for ourselves but for our future partner, our wife or husband.  If you really love someone, that means wanting them to have the best partner possible, wanting to be the best husband or wife for them that you can be.  And that's not even to mention that both men and especially women are attracted to confidence in partners.  And the best way to be confident isn't to fake it if you don't have it, but to be the type of person that you can be proud of.  So basically when it comes to dating, I'm very much in favor of the be the best that you can be so other people will be attracted to you sort of approach.  But anytime I've mentioned that, there have always been people in the comments and on social media saying, okay, wait, I get what you're saying.  Self-improvement, that's all great.  Work on your character, your career prospects, education, yada, yada, yada.  But what about your looks.  Because sure, looks are something that you can affect to a certain extent.  I mean, you can go to the gym and be healthy and work out.  You can take your personal grooming seriously.  You can dress well, wear things that are flattering.  But I mean, that only gets you so far at the end of the day when it comes to physical appearance.  There's a lot that is somewhat of a genetic lottery.  Unfortunately, that just is how it is, and we've discussed the concept of privilege on the show before, white privilege, straight privilege,  etc.,  etc.  I dismiss a lot of those concepts, but I think one of the real privileges that we can't deny does exist is the privilege of being gay.  good looking.  And as much as I like to focus on the character and personality and self-improvement aspects of dating, it would be naive and wrong of me to say that looks just don't matter.  I mean, I've had people messaging me saying, look, I've got a great job, good education, strong family values.  I'm ready to date and find that special someone.  But in the era of Tinder, where literally people are pretty much just going on your face to decide whether they want to be with you or not.  It's really hard to advocate for your other qualities if people are just judging you based on your appearance and looking at you and saying if you don't meet a certain standard they don't even want to find out more about you.  I mean in the past I think it was way more common for people to date people who they either worked with or went to school with or they knew through family and friends or.  but nowadays because we are so into online dating, which I don't think is a bad thing, this isn't to hate on online dating, it works for a lot of people, but when our dating methods have become so calculated and systematic that we're essentially reducing people to profiles on a computer screen or phone screen, then I think looks kind of start to play into it more than they have in the past.  And then on top of that, you throw in things like our social media obsession and the fact that when you tell your friends you're seeing someone new, the first thing they ask you is probably gonna be if you have a picture and like, We've come to a place societally where we are just obsessed with looks and what's been interesting for me looking at both feminist as well as MGTOW and incel blogs is that there are a lot of people out there who think that their own gender has it worse than the other that the whole looks obsession is worse for females than males or vice versa it's worse for males than females.  There are women out there who believe that the world judges women's worth especially when it comes to dating solely on their looks.  so If you're unattractive or you're too fat or your boobs are too small, you're kind of at a loss.  And I think that mentality mixed with insecurities about their own looks is why some women support things like the body positivity movement.  Some women see society's obsession with being beautiful and are so frustrated with the fact that they don't fit into it that they want to try and change, even if it's by authoritarian measures, the definition of what we find beautiful.  These are the kind of women that get triggered by seeing the tall, blonde, skinny Victoria's Secret models on the runway instead of the maybe fat, trans, disabled models that would better represent them.  And then on the other hand, you also have women who say, no, screw beauty.  Beauty is just another way that men try to control women and that women try to seek the approval of men.  These tend to be the more hardcore feminists and they're the ones who, for example, maybe cut off all of their hair.  do weird things with their eyebrows, get piercings.  If you ask me the stereotypical feminist look, you know, when you're kind of overweight, maybe hairy, and just in general issuing beauty norms, that's them trying to tell the world that, hey man, I don't care if you don't want me because I'm I don't want you either.  So that's the female side of things.  Lot, lot of fun.  But from the male perspective, you then have MGTOWs, but mainly incels, who believe that women are just superficial leeches and that if you don't look like Brad Pitt or some Chad, then you have no chance trying to get a girlfriend.  So seeing all those people complaining that the other gender is just way too superficial kind of got me wondering, do looks matter more for men or for women?  If you had to choose to be someone who is not visually that attractive, would it be better to be a man or a woman looking for a partner?  So I ended up doing some reading, and as it turns out, according to science, we're all just these superficial monsters.  All of us.  Apparently when we're talking about what men look for in women, at least for initial attraction, you would be correct in saying it's all about her looks, or at least mostly about her looks.  As the Daily Mail reports, and guys don't freak out, this is from a legit study, it's just that the Daily Mail has a nice summary of it.  Quote, it's official, a woman's beauty really is the most important thing to a man, but for women it's all about social status.  As the article reports, published in this month's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a new study is the first to demonstrate experimentally that the sexes differ in the way they choose mates in real-life contexts.  The research contradicts recent speed dating studies that have found preferences in men and women do not match up with how they actually evaluate and choose speed dating partners.  The article explains that unlike past studies, these experiments were set up to include men and women with low social status and low physical attractiveness.  After chatting with the opposite sex with both low and moderate levels of these traits, men, more than women, rejected and reported less attraction toward potential mates with low physical attractiveness.  Women, however, indicated similar aversion toward those with low social status.  How people valued these traits when asked about their preferences on paper predicted their attraction toward actual chat partners encountered live.  According to Professor Li, the study's lead author, the research is novel because the scientists are clarifying how exactly men and women differ.  That is, they prioritize different qualities when screening each other in online chats and speed dates.  Women want men who are at least average in social status, while men want women who are at least moderately physically attractive, Professor Lee said.  So basically, if you are a woman who is considered attractive, you will have more luck with men than a woman who is not considered attractive.  Thank you, science.  And likewise, with this study, the idea that women, rather than being focused solely on looks, are also attracted to men with higher social status is not a new thing that we are all just hearing about for the first time.  Generally speaking, men do care more about looks and women do care more about something like wealth.  And taken to an extreme, This kind of preference is something we see manifest in things like sugar daddies.  It is what it is.  But before any women start getting up on their high horses saying, see men, you're the superficial ones who only care what their partner looks like, that's not true either.  Sure, women do tend to focus more on status than looks, but as a recent study found, Quote, men's looks matter more than women admit.  As Carrie Nirenberg writes for Life Science, even if a guy has a great personality, a woman looking for a date still hopes he's at least a little cute, a new study suggests.  The findings indicate that women see at least a minimum level of attractiveness and that, quote, results show that as long as a man was considered attractive or moderately attractive, both mothers and daughters would pick the guy who had the most desirable personality traits.  but when an unattractive male was paired with the most highly desirable personality profile, neither daughters nor mothers rated him as favorably as a potential romantic partner compared with better-looking men with less desirable personalities.  So ultimately, the study suggests that if a man is considered at least moderately attractive, then his personality matters to women.  But if a man is viewed as less than moderately attractive, it doesn't seem to matter as much to women what his personality is like.  Basically, it would be wrong to say that looks don't matter to women... at all because they clearly do.  But what's interesting about that study is that it focused on looks and personality traits, but not actually something like wealth or social status.  Specifically, in the study, quote, the profile of the highly desirable traits contained three qualities, respectful, trustworthy, and honest.  The traits for desirable were friendly, dependable, and mature, while the moderately desirable traits described the man as having a pleasing disposition and being ambitious and intelligent.  So right there, we can see that there is some subjective qualifying going on here.  that I think really throws a wrench into the whole experiment.  I mean, can we really say that being mature and dependable is better than being ambitious and intelligent?  I mean, they're all great qualities, but I don't know what I would do if I had to pick some over the other.  Anyway, though, the point is looks do matter to women.  It would be wrong to say that they don't.  But the thing is, if you are a guy who is on the unattractive side or less attractive, the fact is you can still make up for those shortcomings physically by enhancing things like your wealth or social status.  But for a woman who's considered unattractive, you just have fewer options because men are more visually oriented.  I guess the point of this video was to address the fact that yes, looks still do matter when you're dating and if anything, they matter more now than they ever have.  And although that applies to both men and women, men do tend to be more physically superficial than women are.  And as crappy a deal that is for people who weren't born looking like Adriana Lima, I think it's still important to remember that even though looks matter and they matter more to some people than others, they're still not the entirety of what people are looking for when they're looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend.  There are things you can do to improve yourself that don't involve getting a face do-over like Kylie Jenner.  But anyway, I would love to know how you guys feel about this.  Are looks important in our dating culture?  Is it more important for a man or a woman to be good looking?  Have looks held you back or helped you, do you think, in your own dating life?
