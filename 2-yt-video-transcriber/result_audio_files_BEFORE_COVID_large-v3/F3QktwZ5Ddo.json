            "text": "The Center for Disease Control is purposely hiding something from you, the American public, something that I believe you should know about and something that should not be ignored.  There is now a drug-resistant fungus sweeping across the country called Candida auris, and this particular fungus kills about 40 to 50% of the people it infects.  Now, I'm not one for a typical New York Times article.  However, I believe the writers of this particular article are seriously concerned about the fungus.  Take a look at this New York Times report published April 6, 2019, titled, A Mysterious Infection Spanning the Globe in a Climate of Secrecy.  The Rise of Candida Ares Embodies a Serious and Growing Public Health Threat to Drug-Resistant Germs.  The article states, the germ, a fungus called Candida auris, preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe.  Over the last five years, it has hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela, swept through a hospital in Spain, forced a prestigious British medical center to shut down its intensive care unit, and taken root in India, Pakistan, and South Africa.  Recently, CRS has reached New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, leading the federal CDC and prevention to add it to a list of germs deemed an urgent threat.  It goes on, nearly half of the patients who contact CRS die within 90 days, according to the CDC, yet the world's experts have not nailed down where it came from in the first place.  Now on the screen, you're going to see a chart.  This chart actually shows the patterns of the fungus over the past couple of years.  The areas in yellow have multiple cases, and in some cases, it's in the hundreds.  As you can tell, the fungus is spreading all across the globe.  But the truth of the matter is the New York Times article only lists three states here in America that have confirmed cases.  That was New York, New Jersey, and Illinois.  However, the CDC today is reporting over 12 states that have had confirmed cases.  of this particular fungus.  But before I get into that, I wanna show you that the CDC and the hospitals are attempting to silence and hush it in order to prevent panic.  Going back to that New York Times article, take a look because it continues and it states this, with bacteria and fungus alike, hospitals and local governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks for fear of being seen as an infection hub.  Even the CDC, under its agreement with the states, is not allowed to make public the location or name of the hospitals involved in the outbreak.  State governments have in many cases declined to publicly share information beyond acknowledging that they have had cases.  It goes on, this hushed panic is playing out in hospitals all around the world.  Individual institutions and national, state, and local governments have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks of resistant infections, arguing there is no point in scaring patients or prospective ones.  In other words, the hospitals and the Center for Disease Control is purposefully keeping this information from the public.  Why?  Well, according to them, to stop panic.  Personally, I believe this is something the public should know about in order to prevent an outbreak.  You see, if people take more precautions when going out, then the fungus or bacteria or whatever it is, is less likely to spread.  But yet... They're keeping it wraps and they're keeping it under the radar.  So what does the CDC have to say now that the cat has been let out of the bag, so to speak?  Well, take a look at their website where they detail exactly what Candida auris is.  They say it is an emerging fungus that prevents a serious global health threat and that they are concerned about CRS for three reasons.  Number one, it's often multi-drug resistant, meaning that is resistant to multiple antifungal drugs commonly used to treat those kinds of infections.  Number two, it is difficult to identify with standard laboratory methods and it can be misidentified in labs without specific technology.  And third, it has caused outbreaks in healthcare settings.  For this reason, it's important to quickly identify CRS in a hospitalized patient so that the healthcare facilities can take special precautions to stop it.  Obviously, you can see why the CDC is seriously concerned about this particular fungus.  The problem with it is when a person goes into a hospital with this particular issue, the CRS, they go into a room and literally infect everything from the railing to the walls, to the bed, to the mattress, to even the counters and the cupboards, everything in the room has the virus on it.  Imagine that amount of virus being spread all across the country.  Everywhere someone with a disease goes, they spread it on everything they touch.  This could cause some serious issues in the very near future, especially if it's easily misidentified, which according to the CDC, that could be possible.  Now, here is a map from the CDC showing all the states currently infected.  You can see it includes everything from New York to New Jersey to California to Texas and to 12 states total that have cases of this particular fungus.  Bottom line, I guess, is this a real reason to panic?  Well, no, I wouldn't say now is the time to panic.  I think now is the time to be aware of what's going on so you can take your own precautions at home.  Anyhow, I'd love to get your thoughts, comments, and concerns.
