            "text": "you.  hey guys now watch POV here just did a little little walk probably um hear me out of breath for a second.  but hey I'll tell you guys I lost 30 pounds well I guess over gosh two or three months.  and Remember I told you guys in March that I was in the hospital and they almost didn't make it?  It didn't fix the problem.  So I had to go back in September 11th.  And then I was in there for about a week.  And since then, I've been able to, once I recovered, I've been able to go crazy and do all the stuff I wanted to do for the last few years.  So it's really helped.  Great, I've been lifting, I've been doing cardio, swimming.  Man, if you, I mean, stuff happens.  And it's tough.  But if you have the ability to get out there and exercise, don't take it for granted.  Because there are people that can't exercise very much just due to things that happen to them.  And it sucks, really sucks.  So don't take it for granted, you know?  And also, be a little understanding when you see people that you think maybe are just lazy or don't want to work out or whatever.  Maybe they can't.  Maybe they've got something wrong, you know?  All right, enough of that.  So I've been curious.  One of my buddies told me there was a big night crew here.  Maybe I came too late.  But I was told they worked through the night.  And this is, of course, Fountain Valley.  So this is Kingston Technology here.  One of the largest memory chip manufacturers who actually do have their own known memory.  I think they still use Samsung wafers instead of the other.  Not sure, though.  But anyway, they don't just relay to other people.  They make their own, which is pretty cool.  They can also cut corners in the market because they just buy up big chunks of memory at a time.  They can kind of control the market a little bit.  But not always.  So... I wanted to check out just what it looked like here at Christmas time.  Kind of interesting.  I don't know that it's really that interesting, but I got a few things here in the area to take a look at, so it's not a waste adventure by any means at all.  Pretty quiet street and everything.  Pretty cool.  I know this company used to be really well known for standing behind its products.  I think it still does.  But it's also, from what I hear, it's turned into sort of a sweatshop for the people that actually work there.  It's not like it used to be.  I think that's just due to the nature of operating a business that wants to run on like a 3% or 2% profit margin.  Maybe overall they managed to eke out, you know, 4% or 5%, but manufacturing memory modules is, you know, you can't garner too much more.  People are paying more for Kingston, but they're not going to pay double.  So it's not like it was maybe in like the 2000s where people would pay a lot more for something.  So that's got to be tough because they've got a lot of infrastructure to pay for and a lot of personnel and benefits.  So I hear a lot of that's not nearly what it used to be.  Flags are gone.  Unless they just take them all down every day.  That's kind of cool.  interesting i believe this is what they call building m which is their.  yeah it is actually so.  m must stand for manufacturing.  and on this side of the street there is uh that's where they manufacture.  i think what they do is like final assembly or the overclocking for the the hyper x memory.  i think it goes there and they overclock it This over here, apparently they have three buildings.  This building's just fun and games, I think.  That's where like yoga meets and stupid crap like that, I was told.  And then this one here is where everything goes down.  It's where sales and marketing live.  I think we have contacts here.  I think the bird has landed.  Is that what they call it?  There's some bit.  You're in the middle of the road with no lights on.  What kind of idiot are you?  Did she say this is private property?  It's even... Yeah, I got it.  You should probably drive away now.  You're in the middle of the street parked sideways without your lights on.  You're going to get hit.  Get the fuck out of the road, idiot.  What a fucking idiot.  Sorry guys, I had to do that for her safety.  She's about to get nailed.  Do these people even understand how to drive or park?  Without blocking the road?  Like, do they think they're cops or something?  Jeez.  Hey guys, I'm shooting JPEG mode tonight, so the pictures, Might be a little weird, a little grainy.  I'm going to switch over right now to raw mode so the rest of the pictures come out nice.  I had it set that way to save space on my card.  I don't understand what the deal is.  That's really weird.  I don't understand the... I don't understand the, uh... the whole... Well, she scurried into the darkness over there.  Now another one's coming out that looks a little bigger than her.  We'll see what's going on here.  Go for it.  Pepper spraying on your eyes.  Big one.  Got a large one here.  In fact, this might be two women.  I think one ate the other one.  Oh, she's hiding behind the cart.  I think Edie works for her right here.  Oh, she's over in the darkness there.  Hi.  Morning.  Can we help you with something?  No, they want to be nice.  It's weird.  Nothing at all?  Sir?  Can we help you?  She's trying to stall me.  She's just trying to stall me.  That's exactly what she's doing.  Oh, that's a big freaking woman.  I can tell by her tone of voice.  They tell her to walk away.  Yep, there she goes.  Wait for the cops.  Well, I'm not going to sit here for 30 minutes.  I found that the cops are pretty chill.  Not going to do anything, so I might as well walk around the next spot I was going to hit. ",
