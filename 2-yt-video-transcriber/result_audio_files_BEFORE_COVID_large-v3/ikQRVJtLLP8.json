Dropped at the first sign of trouble.  They're only as good as the world allows them to be.  I'll show you.  When the chips are down, these, uh, these civilized people, they'll eat each other.  See, I'm not a monster.  I'm just ahead of the curve.  Introduction to the black pill.  Now everyone knows the philosophy and I'm going to call it philosophy of the pill came from the movie Matrix.  In the Matrix itself, the initial story was an esoteric story about reality in... social construct and the symbolism of the matrix were the two pills or the philosophies or even the worldview and the initial ones were the blue and the red one for the accepting social norm and the the other red for the worldview of the reality behind the construction of the social norm.  And the, what we call the manosphere adopted the symbolism of the matrix and adapted the symbolism to its own philosophy, which is basically the same thing.  I mean, the matrix is the matrix is the, socialized story versus the truth.  And in the pickup community, they wanted the blue and red pill to symbolize the social construction versus the truth.  And as the manosphere matured, we added the third, which is the black pill.  So in essence, we have three pills.  One is blue, which is social construction.  One is the realization of the truth, which is the red pill.  And the black pill, which is the last, is accepting the truth of the world without the moral constrictions of the socialized norm.  So we're briefly going to go through the pills.  Now the blue pill is absolutely necessary for the vast majority of people.  For a herd animal like human beings to get along, There has to be an agreement, an agreement about how large groups of people are actually going to operate and live together.  and cooperate.  because to have a civilization as large as this one a global civilization as large as this one with 8 billion people there has to be a social contract and every citizen or every human being brought up in it has to be socialized or taught or brainwashed into accepting the social contract for this thing to work.  and the social contract is called the blue pill in the manosphere.  This is what you're taught.  This is what you swallow when you're born into what we call the matrix or civilization.  Thou shall not kill.  Thou shall not covet your wife, commit adultery, whatever your social norm is in your area, because it will slightly differ from locale to locale, but it is fairly consistent.  And the vast majority of people have to have absolute belief, belief that this social construct, this social agreement is organic and it's natural.  Otherwise, things like family, jobs, commerce, government wouldn't work.  They absolutely would not work.  Everybody would go into their own little caves and with their little weapons and they would either grow food or try to take somebody else's food.  There would be the law of the jungle, which is absolutely against.  human nature.  Human nature, we are group animals.  We are group beings.  We cannot exist out in nature by ourselves.  So the blue pill is absolutely necessary to have, even if you take the other two, you still have to have the vast majority of your psyche within the blue pill to be able to operate within the matrix, even as Neo and Morpheus and the rest of the crew did.  They have to have blue pill orientation operate with inside the matrix, with inside civilization.  Now, the next pill is the red pill.  Now with the red pill, it's not necessarily acceptance of the truth, it's knowledge of.  Knowledge of the real world, knowledge of the core of human beings, and to quote what Morpheus said, no one can tell you what the matrix is.  Nobody can tell you.  what the red pill is, you have to be shown.  So step by step, you have to unplug yourself from the blue pill world, as they say, unplug, and let your worldview wander over what the real truth is, whether it's reading books, seeing videos, until slowly but surely your worldview changes so you can actually see the matrix, see the construct for what it is.  And you have to have some kind of guide to do that.  Some people don't.  Some people just can unplug naturally.  Or they just never fit.  Even in the Matrix, the beings that didn't fit got spit out.  And sometimes civilization will spit those Oddballs out to where they don't fit and then forced to see what the truth of the matrix really is.  But most people have to be shown.  most people have to be given the red pill and shown What the matrix really is and shown what reality really is what you know in the beginning of what?  Women were like were really like Through reading anthropology, biology, other articles, sociology, understanding what women were really like and not their blue pill conditioning and not your blue pill conditioning and how you were taught to see women.  But eventually that lens turned itself on the man itself, which is seeing what men were really like and seeing how men were really taught and seeing how men really view the world and also their women.  So accepting the red pill means you have to turn on the knowledge.  You have to see what reality really is.  Whether you accept it or not, you have to see it.  And once you see it, what do you do with it?  And for some people, they stay there, just seeing it, but not accepting it.  So they've built strategies how to operate within the knowledge, believe that it is true.  but still operate within a blue pill world.  So in other words, you're actually still enacting the blue pill framework, but with the red pill knowledge.  In other words, you know how sausage is made.  You know how blue pill is constructed.  So you can reconstruct your blue pill with red pill knowledge.  That's what most people do.  The last one, which is what we're gonna talk about, is the black pill.  And the black pill, if you look at the pills as layers, blue pill is the top layer, as Morpheus says.  The red pill sends you down the rabbit hole, and the black pill shows you how deep the rabbit hole actually is, what is at the bottom of that rabbit hole.  And the black pill is reaching the bottom of that rabbit hole.  It is the third level in.  It is the dream within the dream within the dream.  Where literally the blue pill is actually constructed.  As when Neo went into through the door of light and talked to the architect.  And then realized exactly how the matrix is actually constructed.  That is the black pill.  The black pill is the acceptance.  The true digestions and acceptance of the world as it is good, bad and different, and this is.  the place where good and evil go to die.  What do I mean by that?  This is the place where amorality lives.  And most people think that amorality and immorality are the same thing.  Immorality means against, the opposite of what the accepted morality actually is.  Amorality is the acceptance of the non-existence of morality.  and deals with the action and reaction.  what is the base nature of creatures and how do they respond to the environment and how it affects their decisions?  you go deep down into not the what but the why.  the black pill is literally the abyss.  standing on the edge of the abyss, standing on the edge of darkness and looking out and seeing the darkness.  Some people cannot take it.  They get consumed by it.  Some people cannot take it and they withdraw from it.  They go, they sometimes go back to the red and a lot of times go right back up to the blue and pretend like they never saw it.  They get plugged back into the matrix because their psyche simply cannot handle The raw truth.  There are some people that go crazy and say to hell with it.  Morality doesn't exist.  And I'm going to do whatever I want to my pleasure.  I'm going to give into my base nature and let it run wild.  But what the black pill is really meant for, for the few that can really handle it is to gather The nothing gather the darkness and construct something out of it.  So when you turn back onto the red into the blue, you can see reality for what it is.  And start to reconstruct it into your own image.  But that is a very difficult task for anyone.  Darn near impossible to ingest the black pill and not be consumed by it.  Can you accept the true nature of people without being jaded?  Can you accept the true nature of women without hating them?  Can you accept the true nature of society without becoming despondent or suicidal, even homicidal?  The black pill is the raw truth, devoid of morality.  The red pill still has morality attached to it.  The red pill still has blue pill morality attached to it.  The black pill does not.  Now for people that jump off the edge of the abyss and get consumed by the darkness, they become a moralist.  They become a moral nihilist and they can and do, do things to hurt themselves and hurt other people.  For the people that can ingest the black pill and not be consumed by it, they get almost a second sight, a deep understanding into the human psyche, a deep understanding into human culture.  They become the one, they become one with the universe.  The universe is blackness.  can you become one with the darkness?  can you become one with the universe?  can you become one with all that is without being destroyed by it?  the kabbalists say no.  the kabbalists say that your vessel cannot accept what he calls the light or the knowledge without it destroying the vessel, which is your psyche, which is your body.  Can you become the one and not the opposition, not the negative opposition?  That is the black pill.  And that is the challenge of the black pill.  That is why the black pill is the ultimate.  It is the most powerful, but it's also the most dangerous.  The blue pill means safety.  Blue, green, those colors mean safety.  That's why the UN wears blue helmets.  That is safety, that is protection.  Red is always means danger.  In other words, you're crossing over into another realm.  You're taking on knowledge that is dangerous.  And red pill knowledge has been used for damage.  It has done damage in the wrong hands.  Because once you get into the knowledge and you go down the rabbit hole, the gravity can pull you toward the black.  So if blue pill is safety, red pill means danger.  What is the black pill?  Ultimately, especially in this culture, the black pill is death, but not a physical death.  It's a death to the beliefs, as Neo experienced when he talked to the architect.  Red pill knowledge doesn't kill off blue pill.  Black pill kills off blue pill.  If you decide to accept it, if you decide to walk through the door of light, if you decided to completely ingest the black pill and die to your former beliefs and die to the image of the world that you've been given.  Like I said, some people are forced.  Some people are born that way.  Only a few choose the black pill and only few are still even embraced the black pill and still even less embrace the black pill and not be consumed.  But this is just the beginning of the discussion.  And this is the introduction.  I have, I do believe two more segments for Black Pill.  I will try to get them out and finish this project.  But for now, this will serve as the introduction to the philosophy of the Black Pill.  With that, I'm going to jump off of here.  This is BGS out, and I will see you cretins on the next one.  Peace.
