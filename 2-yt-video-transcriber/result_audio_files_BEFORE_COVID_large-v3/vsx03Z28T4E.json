            "text": "Welcome back to another video from the Thailand Village Academy Adventure.  This time we're starting off at Sukhothai, my amazing and wonderful life-changing village.  The mission of this trip was to learn more about the people of Sukhothai, the villagers, how they live their everyday life, what they do for a living, and how they make their money.  Also, we learned a lot about the culture and traditions of the Thai people, which was such a beautiful and inspiring experience.  For the following week, we had a jam-packed itinerary full of things to do from early morning to late at night.  My trip had a lot of ups and downs, but if there's one thing that I have to share is the incredible people that made this trip and the villagers of Sakotai that have changed my life forever.  I'd love to introduce some of them to you right now.  is Mr.  Pangla and Uncle Bub, who were the local heroes and actually run the tourism for the city.  They have lived here their entire life.  They have over 700 years of ancestry history in this village.  They were honestly some of the most amazing and astounding souls I have ever met in my entire life, full of light and love.  I love these two men.  This is my amazing house mom who felt like a second mother to me.  She actually runs a homestay accommodation for any tourists or visitors that are looking to stay and get a local experience.  She was incredible, you guys.  We like fell in love.  She's my second mom in Thailand.  I love her.  You'll be seeing a lot of their faces, so I thought it would be time to introduce them.  We just landed.  Day one of the competition is starting now.  Can't wait.  I arrived from the airport to Sokotai.  It took about an hour to an hour and a half.  And while on the way there, I was learning so much things about the villages and the history of this beautiful city.  When we finally arrived to Sokotai, the local tourism set up such a beautiful, warming welcome, and I was so embarrassed because I didn't put on any makeup, and I had to run to the car and put on my makeup because there was so much media there, and I had no idea I was going to get filmed and how many people were about to greet me.  So I was a bit embarrassed, to say the least.  But it was a very beautiful presentation, and I love that about Asia culture.  She's Frank Tipani, right?  Oh, I love this flower.  Yeah, Frank Tipani.  I was just greeted with it.  What do you call it?  Frank Tipani.  Frank Tipani.  In Thai we call Lila Wadi.  Lila Wadi.  Right after our beautiful greeting, we were headed towards this gorgeous temple that's located in the Tourism Visitor Center.  This place was gorgeous.  I was so amazed at the beautiful artwork and the way it's been preserved for so many years.  There are artworks on the wall that tell the entire story of the village and how they became Sukhothai.  Sukhothai's history and Thailand's history is full of stories of kings, queens, princesses, and princes.  Then we were headed to Mot View, our homestay, for an amazingly delicious local lunch and get our room set up.  Hi, you guys.  So we just arrived into our homestay.  This is my room.  I took the double beds and gave the older people like the king and queen size bed because I felt bad.  but um this is a homestay.  um it's like a family owns this property and then they have different rooms.  so I have my own room with a private AC a bathroom and a funky shower.  and um this is where I'm gonna be staying.  this is so cute and pretty.  it's like a hotel and they gave us welcome drinks.  um And then, one second.  This is our living room.  There's a big TV here.  so this is my room.  this is my translator room and then this is the other um local blogger's room.  he's from thailand.  there's a hangout spot here um and then that's the queen and then the family is out here.  Hi, you guys.  Good morning.  It is 6 in the morning.  Actually, that's a lie.  It's 5.30.  And we are waking up early to go give offerings to monks, which is basically, you know, giving them, like, food for breakfast.  And we're going to ride bikes to do that.  And then they're going to bless us because monks don't work, so they live off of people's offering.  So, um, I was told yesterday that because you would sacrifice waking up super early, even though it's not convenient, um, you get like a high blessing.  So we're going to go do that right now.  It's okay.  I went to sleep at like nine 30 or 10 cause I was exhausted as fudge.  So, um, So the sweet lady, my house mom, she ironed and let me borrow these clothes, these are pants, to go to the monks this morning, so I'm excited.  Our amazing house mom dined us, like always, making us an amazingly delicious breakfast.  Okay, what are we going to do?  We're going to give alms to monks.  This morning.  It means offering food to monks.  Yes, it's a beautiful act.  Yay!  Before we leave, this is our bicycle with offering set already.  It's beautiful.  My favorite way of exploring a city is always on the bike.  Fun facts, you guys.  The monks' temple that we were going to is about 15 minutes from our homestay.  Most people in this village get around by bikes.  Early morning bike ride, early morning bike ride.  It's very hard to focus on recording with one hand.  Where did my team go?  Well, I know there's people in front of me, in back of me.  I know there's supposed to be people in back of me.  People are arriving.  And we made it to the temple just in time.  Woman not supposed to get too close to monk, not supposed to touch, but man is fine.  So the only thing he's more privileged.  Monks actually only eat two meals a day.  One is at 6 a.m.  and the other one is before 12 p.m.  If they did not eat at 12  p.m.,  they have to wait till the next day to actually eat.  So it's very important to get here on time.  And the rest of the day they spend praying and learning.  This is the main existing temple of Sakotai and where the city center is.  So make sure to visit.  Then we were off to the beautiful historical park and ruins.  Next adventure.  Hi, you guys.  Good morning.  We are visiting one of the most historical sightings.  Let me get you some more information.  Wait, Tipi.  Hold on.  Okay, what is this?  Hi, what is this place called?  This place called Sukhothai Historical Park.  And it's one of the most famous temples.  Mahathat Temple.  Yeah, you said if you don't see this temple, you didn't come here.  Right.  Yeah, so we are riding bikes right now.  I'm wearing a dress and I currently I wear pants, but I tucked it in and we are going to go with a bunch of other people.  to see the temple right in front in a couple of minutes.  This city is all about the bike life, and if you like biking as much as me, you will be in bike heaven because this national park, you will definitely need to ride a bike because the distances between the temples are pretty far apart.  This is so fun.  I love riding bikes.  I love it.  Dress, scarf, pants.  Let's do it.  Sukhothai's National Park is just beyond words.  It is gorgeous.  I highly, highly recommend it.  It is so peaceful and gorgeous here.  Sukhothai is special for many reasons.  One, it is the first capital of Thailand.  before Bangkok was the capital.  Bangkok is the third capital of Thailand.  It was also in this beautiful city that the Thai language was actually created by one of their many famous kings.  So since I'm traveling here with the tourism board, apparently I'm filming a short movie slash commercial for this city.  I did not know that.  So we've been doing a lot of drone shots and different things.  There's such a big camera crew, people everywhere.  There's cameras filming us, and it's been fun, and I've been a bit shy about it, but it's one thing for me to film myself, but when others film me, I'm like, ah, I don't know what's happening.  It's, like, really overwhelming.  But we are at the temples right now.  It's gorgeous here.  Thank you.  I always feel like in Asia.  I start my day glamorous and then I turn into a humidity mess and I just don't give a crap.  So my hair is a mess right now.  I'm super humid, but we are going right now.  I clipped it while I was on the bike.  Right now we are having lunch at the tourism board office that they prepped for us.  It's been nuts.  It's been a crazy day.  It's been very overwhelming, but let's see what they have in store for us.  As a vegetarian in Thailand, it is pretty difficult to find food, but somehow, someway, the villagers always found something to feed me.  I mainly ate eggs and rice, though.  And in the afternoon, we spent our time meeting the local villagers, hanging out with them, making some fun drinks with them, and dessert.  It was lovely.  And that's it for my first two days in Sokotai.  Make sure to come back to see the rest of the adventure unfold.  Also, don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and leave a comment below.  I love you guys.  Have an amazing day. ",
