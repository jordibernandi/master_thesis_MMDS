            "text": "Hey, howdy bash.  It is the 16th of April, 2019, and my schedule yesterday just didn't allow me to get to this, but this is quite fascinating, this Notre Dame Cathedral burning down.  That's an understatement, but there are several things very quickly this morning that just were put out in front of me that are like, whoa, this is absolutely something significant going on here.  I'm just going to show you what I saw, and I'm sure I'm not the first one at this point to have seen... what I'm going to show you the I pet goat.  pretty much everybody in the world has probably seen this but I made videos I don't know year or two ago showing this particular scene and being this as the collapse of the quote Christian Church.  as the world knows it There are true Christians, there are pseudo-Christians, there are all sorts of Christians, and not many of them even know what a Christian really is, never mind actually live like a Christian.  But I digress.  when this steeple here this spire falls it's interesting to watch a very specific part of it and i'm going to try and give you the comparison to these two first the best i can.  so we'll get this one started and we'll bring this one up and get this going and you can see that's pretty crazy right.  But if you continue watching this one, the Ipec Goat, this is amazing because right as the spire's falling, you see this cross?  This is the main cross on this cathedral.  And watch as the spire takes out the cross right there.  Okay?  at exactly 6 11 on the time stamp and this is the original video.  so right at 6 11 it takes out the cross and oddly enough if you look at this uh cathedral right going through this article and like i say i haven't had a whole lot of time to go on this let me get rid of this here.  um but you'll see down here somewhere they put a lot of pictures on there.  i have the wiki here too.  let me get the wiki for you.  oh yeah it was the boston marathon yesterday too.  right here the cathedral was begun in 1160 and largely completed by 1260.  1160 and if you look at the time stamp on the ipet goat 11 6 which also you know flip those around you have 9 11 9 11. right but that's not all the completed by 1260. now this is just crazy.  but okay the boston marathon the 123rd i i was kind of focusing on that yesterday a little bit because you know i'm from boston blah blah blah the boston bombing all those things that happened.  And so the 1, 2, 3.  But the other day, someone had mentioned to me about the black hole.  They referred to it in a comment and it caught my attention as perhaps representing the red dragon.  The red dragon in Revelation.  12, 3.  The 123rd Boston Marathon, which just, these are the way these things click with me.  12, 3.  So a appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon.  now i'm just kind of running off of what what's given me here.  but this is very interesting.  very interesting because the 1260 days or years 1260 rather when it was completed if you keep continue reading revelation 12 you get down to revelation 12 6 as in 1260 And the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared to God that she should feed her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.  Twelve sixty and twelve sixty on the cathedral.  So I just keep seeing these things.  And at the same time, there's so many things that take into consideration here.  At the same time, you know, yesterday they were actually in Israel.  And again, you got to bear with me finding these things because I'm just not set up right now.  You know what I mean?  In Israel, though, they slaughtered a goat.  I mean, by the whole temple rules and all this stuff.  Here we go.  This is no lie.  Passover sacrifice and they do it like four days before Passover.  I just find that to be very strange.  I don't know.  What do I know, right?  The goat was prepared and roasted, burnt.  So they burnt, sacrificed and burnt a goat at the same time that this cathedral was being burnt, right?  This is just crazy stuff, you guys.  I don't know how exactly to put this all together, but hopefully I'll get to it again later.  and put some more time into this because, you know, my spirit's like kind of going off the charts with all these things going on here.  But it's all right there.  And it's funny, I pet goat and they slaughter a goat, right?  And when you continue watching this, I mean, basically it depicts their new world.  This is the destruction of, quote, Christianity as the world knows it.  And in comes the new Jesus and the morning star.  That's just how I see it, basically.  Look in Isaiah again.  We were just in Isaiah the other day on Isaiah 14.  Yeah, Isaiah 14.  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning?  Right?  And that's basically what they're depicting right here.  along with the scorpions, the pyramids.  The pyramids get destroyed.  It's their phoenix, if you will.  I haven't looked at Ipec Oat in a long time, but that's what we're looking at.  That's what my spirit's telling me.  That's what we're seeing right there.  This is symbolizing the death of Christianity and the rise of the New World religion, which these guys... this is just crazy to me.  these uh these israelites these jews that are doing this sacrifice of the goat.  why are you doing the passover goat four days before passover?  that's just insane.  and like i say i hope to get to more of this later i really do.  but that's all i can give you right now and it's real.  And just be in Christ.  I mean, I'm telling you, it's really manifesting fast.  And you've got to be on that rock.  Be in Christ.  Praying always.  Singing in your spirit.  Knowing that He has the victory.  Amen.  So, there you go.  Peace and grace to you all.  And fish. ",
