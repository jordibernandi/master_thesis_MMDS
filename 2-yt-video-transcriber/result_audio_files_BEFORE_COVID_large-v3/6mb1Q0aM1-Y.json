I'm starting to think they're kind of dumb, not least because they seem to be the main vehicle through which the most annoying people on the planet get on TV.  I've been a critic of Obama, I'm a critic of the Democratic Party because I'm literally a communist.  Fair point.  For those of you with very healthy emotional lives who don't spend most of their day scrolling on Twitter.  Sorry, one minute.  Recently, two darlings of the culture wars conservative right went on flagship BBC programs and got dealt a bit of a mauling.  If it's so obvious that Andrew Marr utterly destroyed Nigel Farage, why is it that the Brexit Party's tweet of the exchange got shared over 2,000 times and has been viewed by over a million people?  Something doesn't quite add up here.  By any metric, you would say that Andrew Marr was the one who came off best in that exchange with Nigel Farage.  He seemed clear, he seemed calm, he didn't raise his voice.  However, I don't think that Nigel Farage was there to win a debate against Andrew Marr.  He wasn't interested in making the best points, all he wanted to do was declare war on the BBC. ",

And what's more, absolves Christianity and whiteness more generally of responsibility for the most deadly instances of anti-Semitism in human history.  So even though he made a complete tit of himself, Ben Shapiro was actually quite successful because he was able to take a fringe idea which has a violent following and place it slap bang in the middle of mainstream political discourse.  He didn't have to win a head-to-head with Andrew Neil.  His victory was getting invited onto the BBC in the first place.  I think that no platform is a tool rather than a moral imperative.  There's not much of a point in saying no platform when someone's already got millions of followers.  What it's actually about is responsible coverage, and that means thinking about interview formats which challenge the strategic political objectives of your guests rather than simply fulfilling them.  In my view, that means long-form content, deep dives, documentaries.  Two-minute clip with over a million views is never a car crash.  It's virality of the kind that money can't buy, because here's the thing.  Even when it looks like they've lost, culture warriors have actually played the game better than those who set the rules of engagement in the first place. ",
