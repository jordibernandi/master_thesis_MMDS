            "text": "Good evening, brethren.  This is Big Judah, coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, I'm going to give all praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehawashai.  I pray that the Most High blesses this lesson this evening and gives us even more understanding and clarity of the events of the past.  In order to get a better understanding, of the events that are happening on the earth.  And to be able to actually get more understanding of the things that are soon to come on the earth as well.  Brethren, we have, we passed this marker of the whole 400 years of captivity.  And I don't know if you feel it, but I'm seeing a change in our nation.  I'm seeing many people emailing me and talking to me about how they're being blessed, how the Most High is blessing their situation, how the Most High seems to be working for our people once again, how he's turning his face back to his people.  Most High has been downloading a lot of information to me And I had a lot of, I had a video I was trying to get up earlier, but due to some technical difficulties, I wasn't able to upload anything.  So I'll be coming with a lot more information, most high willing in the next couple of days, but at least wanted to get out this one bit of information that, you know, as we have now are starting to transition.  to the turning away, the Most High turning his face away from the Gentiles and turning his face back to us.  The whole thing about him giving us our land back begins with us understanding where our land is.  Then looking back in history and understanding what happened to us and how the Most High used the Gentiles to chastise us.  And how he's about to move these curses away from us onto the other nations.  But one thing that I wanted to show this evening was how, you know, we get much more understanding of many things that have been put in our faces because of the times that we're in.  This Book of Mormon has opened up so much more understanding so that when you see things that have been shown to us before, things start to be made much clearer, make much more sense.  We have a lot more clarity.  So like I said, this is going to be a short video to kind of set the tone for some of the other things that are coming.  You know, I ordered the Christopher Columbus Book of Prophecies right before I put the video out, knowing that usually, as I said, the subscribers we have on this channel are very well-read.  And if something comes out as a book maybe they don't have, then many people will go and purchase it.  So I purchased the book for $90 right before I released the video.  And within five, six hours, the price of the book had gone up to about $335, $340.  Well, yesterday, I received the book.  Well, at least I thought I was about to receive the book.  And they gave me one that was totally different.  It wasn't the book that I ordered.  It was some book that you can actually buy off of Amazon for $15, $16.  It's called Christopher Columbus, His Life and Discovery in the Light of His Prophecies.  So needless to say, I was pretty pissed yesterday when the guy did this.  So I just said, you know what, that's why I know that you're doing this On purpose.  So let me take a look at this book.  And the information that when you start to compare it to the other Christopher Columbus's book of prophecies is mind blowing.  And it's just a confirmation of the Psalms 83 and the tumult and how they've worked against us.  So I'll be bringing that out in the next day or two.  You know, most I willing.  But something that I saw today that I wanted to share.  was this.  I'm sure many people might have seen this before, but I wanted to show you something here about what it says there in the mirror in the middle, that this would be the American or Indian race found only in America is of a deep copper color, straight black hair, high cheekbones, eyes black and sunken, large faces and robust bodies.  Now, the key to this definition is this American or Indian race is found only in America.  Now, when you understand that the Most High has separated his people, that was part of the covenant that he made.  Then we start looking at these people here, then you realize why it is.  they're only found in America.  It doesn't say that about any other group of people, but it says this about the Americans or the copper-colored people, that they would only be found in America.  Because, of course, this confirms what we read in the Book of Mormon.  about the covenant, about the separation, about how the multi made it more difficult for the other nations to come to our islands over here.  So even in that little bit of information that it actually exposed, which is found only in America, that there is confirmation of what we are now getting from the Book of Mormon.  You know, there's only one group of people that is separated and you're only going to find these people in this area.  You know, and the other nations have been trying to make it seem like, well, you know, all of the natives have been killed off.  All of the natives, you know, that were here originally, you know, were killed and, you know, and all of you guys all come from Africa.  Yeah.  And of course, if you look at the bottom of the African or Negro race, so they put the Africans and Negroes as the same.  But we know that the Hamites and the Shemites are two totally different races of people.  So they, of course, you know, they're always, you know, mix in their lies with the truth.  But the natives right there, I love that part where it says the American or Indian race found only in America.  Because for, you know, thousands of years, these were the people were only, you know, these were the only inhabitants of these lands.  So they knew that we were separated.  They knew they had not been over here.  They had met it right here.  So anything pre-Columbus.  has nothing to do with the other nations.  And that's why I said anything that was pre-Columbus, they discounted, they burned.  They did not accept it because they knew that none of that had anything to do with the Europeans, the other nations.  So they didn't want to recognize anything that had been built or accomplished before Columbus got here.  Now, what I do want to read is a little bit of this right here.  This is from the book of Nephi.  I want to say 2 Nephi chapter 1.  Read a little bit of 6 through 9. which will pretty much confirm what you just saw in that definition.  Wherefore I, Lehi, prophesy, according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there shall none come into this land, save they shall be brought by the hand of the Most High.  Wherefore this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring, and if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, It shall be a land of liberty unto them, wherefore they shall never be brought down into captivity.  If so, it shall be because of iniquity.  For if iniquity shall abound, cursed shall be the land for their sakes.  But unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.  And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of the other nations.  For behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.  Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise that inasmuch as those whom the Most High Power shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem, shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land, and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves.  And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments, they shall be blessed upon the face of this land.  So the people that were here were the Israelites.  That is one of the main conspiracies, lies that has been kept secret from the world.  That the people that was here when the Europeans got here, when Columbus was led over here, were the most highest chosen people.  Columbus knew it, and that's what we're going to be getting into.  The other people knew it, but they've hid it from the vast majority of the population until now.  And just like it says, people are going to... lose their minds once they find out the truth, that when they got here, and the people that they've been keeping at the bottom, destroying, raping, robbing, murdering, pillaging, taking all their things from them, all their possessions, everything, land, making laws that keeps them at the bottom, you've been doing this to the most highest chosen people for the last few hundred years, and now the most high.  is about to bring that same judgment that he brought on us onto the rest of the world.  And we're at the precipice of that right now.  So just like I said, there are nine, wherefore I, Lehi, have obtained a promise that in as much as those whom the most high power shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land and they shall be kept from all other nations.  kept from all other nations.  So then when you go back over here and it says the American or Indian race found only in America, those are the people that were kept from all other nations.  People that look like that right there.  So when you got brought over here, those are the people that you're persecuting.  The ones that had made a covenant with the most high.  One has made a covenant that he gave this land to.  So this is just a real quick lesson that I wanted to share with the family.  And I have a whole lot more information coming real soon.  Most High Willing.  All praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehawashai.  Shalom. ",
