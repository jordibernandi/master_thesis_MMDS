            "text": "What's up, guys?  Cyrus here, and it looks like we're going to go back to daily videos.  I'm producing all of these over the weekend, so I will not have any sleep, but this way I'll be able to get back to working on our house.  I did a livestream talking about some of the stuff we've ran into with the new house we just picked up.  Links to that will be in the description below.  That said, if you notice, there is a new avatar here right now.  This is not a permanent thing, but this avatar was provided by Turning Tide Studios.  They're a really good friend of mine, their commissions are open, and they also have a wonderful webtoon that they've been working on for the better part of a year.  I will have links to their webtoon and their Twitter down below so that you can get in contact with them.  And I know this video is getting really front-loaded, but as per usual, we do need to get into the fan art.  First, we've got one from Bill Sy, who's the resident troll on Genetically Modified Skeptics Discord.  We have this one from SpookyRayboy, which is honestly the most surreal way I've ever seen my character depicted.  And then finally, we have this one from Gaelic Knox, because apparently, I will never be able to escape the fact that I had to sing that song for Oz.  So if you're a Steven Universe fan, this is the crossover that nobody asked for.  All right, that all out of the way, let's go ahead and get political for an episode.  Alright, so normally I don't talk about politics on this channel because it is an incredibly divisive subject.  But I do like to tackle social issues, and unfortunately the two things seem to intertwine from time to time.  So if you live in America, we have a Republican who goes by the name of Eric Porterfield.  I personally don't care about him being a Republican.  Whatever political alignment you find yourself on, I honestly couldn't give a crap about.  I just care about what you're advocating for.  And it looks like he is advocating for some pretty heinous shit.  So, let's take a watch. ",

When asked what you would do if either one of your children turned out to be gay, your first thing would be to try to make them do the things that are considered the gender norms.  So hunting and fishing for a guy and getting a pedicure for a girl.  So I can firstly say that you obviously don't understand what it means to be gay.  then because it has nothing to do with your gender expression.  You can have the most manly, masculine, buff, macho, hunting, hiking dude in the world, and they can still be gay.  You can have the most feminine woman in the entire world that all the guys want to see.  that looks like a Barbie and plays with them too, and she can still be gay.  So now that that's out of the way, let's get to the actual egregious thing that was said, because even though the other one is bad, don't get me wrong, that's different than saying that you would drown your kids.  The interviewer caught on to the implications of that, that's why they asked for clarification, and you caught on to the implications of that, and that's why you had that shit-eating grin and then tried to cover it up by saying that you just wanted to do activities.  Sorry, Eric, but everybody sees through it.  In fact, there's actually several people who have been asking for your resignation, and honestly, I kind of stand beside them.  I don't want people that say that they would willingly drown their kids leading the nation that I live in in any direction.  Now that we've got that little, uh, nugget out of the way, let's continue.

There are religious people in this country who actually fall under every single problem that you listed out.  That when they don't get their way about wanting things like creationism taught in school, or having abstinence-only education taught in our schools, that they start making things incredibly hard on everybody in the nation.  But I have a feeling that you're talking about a particular incident with a cake.  I actually have a video on my channel about that as well, and my stance on it basically boils down to this.  If you are a business that would refuse a black person based on the merits of them being black, something they cannot control, then you do not need to be in business.  So if you are a business who would deny somebody something on the merits of them being gay, something they cannot control, then you don't need to be in business.  If you want the full clarification of my stance on that, again, I have a video for it and I will link it below.  If I forget, let me know in the comment section. ",

Regardless of what side of the conversation you might fall on when we're talking about the cake situation, I can still understand what it's like to be part of a minority group trying to have their voice heard in America.  While on one hand I am a hetero cis male, I'm also a polyamorous atheist.

This group of people, so loosely connected and underpowered, are the threat that you're speaking of.  While there are organizations that happen to be made up of multiple LGBTQ or ally members, that is not the LGBTQ community.  That is one organization that happens to fall under that umbrella.  Just like, say, the atheist community of Austin happens to fall under the umbrella of atheism.  Or, say, the Ku Klux Klan falls under Christianity.  I don't use the Ku Klux Klan as the broad brush that I paint all of Christianity with, because I recognize that there's a distinction between the two, but Eric here seems to not have that ability.  There must be an LGBTQ conspiracy or a gay agenda trying to, I don't know, give everybody better decorating advice?  And he hates this fictitious organization so much that if he found out that his children were gay, and thus would be part of that organization by default, fictitious as it is, he would then willingly drown his children after making them conform to normative gender roles.

Secondly, when talking about how other people should live, the LGBTQ community, for the most part, again, I recognize there are some people on the extreme side of everything, do not do anything to try to tell people how they are supposed to live.  If anything, they usually argue that you should let them live how they want to live instead of doing things like, I don't know, outlawing sodomy.  That's a lovely blue book law that's in like 10 states.  Instead, you point out that a preacher needs to be given the benefit of the doubt. ",
