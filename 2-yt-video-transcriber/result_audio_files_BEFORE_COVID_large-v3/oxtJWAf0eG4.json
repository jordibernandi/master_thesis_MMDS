            "text": "The video that you're about to see and watch later on in this video is something that I had never even seen until a few weeks ago.  Shiloh appeared on Chris Hansen's show to have a seat with Chris Hansen and during that show she revealed some information about several videos that were filmed with Greg at that time.  Now I don't know how this got leaked but it did get leaked and it is a video after they filmed a skit in which Onision says some pretty horrific things, which really, I think, exposes himself even more than he already has, which is saying something, because every time I make a video like this, I always ask the question, how far can this person keep exposing himself?  And well, because he's pretty stupid, it just keeps escalating and he keeps exposing himself.  Like, I've never seen any sort of ripple effect with any person unlike this man here.  But before we begin any further, special thanks to our sponsor today, Raycon.  They've been sponsoring my channel a lot recently, and this latest model, the E25, is their best one yet.

No one will ever know how much I abuse you.  Yeah, you heard that right.  He said, you know that this video is never going to be online, right?  People are never going to know how much I hurt you.  Those are his exact words and you can see the expression on her face.  to the reaction of what he said.  Now, in the Chris Hansen Shiloh interview, she talks about this specific segment and how this was never originally even supposed to get leaked, and I don't know how it did.  This is one of those types of clips, these types of videos that get leaked and really expose a terrible person behind the scenes.  You get a few seconds, a glimpse of what actually goes behind outside of a camera, and that's really, really scary type of behavior that he just exhibited there and the things that he said.  You know how the phrase goes, karma is a bee?  Yeah, well, this is karma coming back at you.  It's ridiculous that you think you'll be successful.  How many times do I have to tell you?  Everything that you want to put online goes through me first.  It's ridiculous that you think you're going to be successful.  Is that not demeaning language?  Is that not a type of language that puts somebody down so much that they feel like they're so worthless they can't get away from that type of person's grip?  This type of language being used towards Shiloh is some of the most destructive language that you can have in a relationship.  And it really affects one's self-esteem and self-worth to the point of they don't know who they are anymore.  They don't know who their identity is anymore because of the constant berating of those types of words.  How many times do I have to tell you everything that you want to put online goes through me first?  Want some candy corn?  How many times do I have to tell you that everything you put online has to go through me first?  That's not normal.  Your significant other should be able to have a voice and have their own opinions outside of what your significant other thinks of your opinions or perspectives or ideologies.  The fact that she can't voice anything, the fact that she can't talk about anything unless it goes through him, that's a control freak.  And one of the biggest red flags that you, even though you as an audience member, a viewer, should look into other people outside of just, you know, obviously Greg, this level of control is not okay.  I asked Vincent if I could interview Chris.  I have a lot of questions about the numerous accusations against him.  Would be a relief to know he is innocent.  Please get back to me so you can clarify.  Clear your name, friend.  Now, for those of you who don't know, Vincent is one of the main media guy that works with Chris Hansen.  Vincent is basically just Chris Hansen's media man.  They've been having a lot of exchanges recently via email.  Now, this tweet that Onision is saying is in regards to Chris Hansen's past because apparently Chris Hansen wrote a few bad bounced checks.  This was obviously years ago, but regardless of that, Chris Hansen turned himself in, the charges were dropped, nothing came of it.  But you know, Greg, he has to scrape the bottom of the barrel even if something isn't criminal, even if something has been dropped with charges, even if the person turned himself in for something that they did wrong.  If anything, Greg, I think you should take example after Chris Hansen and turn yourself in just like he did when he made mistakes because that's what a person should do.  They try to break the law.  See, now you're just getting semantical at this point.  Because you and I, everybody here has done some illegal thing at some point in our lives.  Have you ever driven through a stop sign?  That's illegal.  Have you ever went through a red light?  That's illegal.  Have you ever passed on double lines?  That's illegal.  It's not relevant to bring up something that was dropped years ago as a means to crucify somebody who is now helping the people that you've hurt all of these years.  Onision, we find it ironic that you would raise the subject of legal action when you've created and distributed deceptive video cons that falsely suggest that you were interviewed by Chris Hansen and contains malicious and slanderous claims made by you.  If you continue to have concerns, we'll be happy to connect you to our legal team.  In the meantime, we renew your offer to sit on an interview with Have A Seat with Chris Hansen.  Hey Vince, at this point your whole channel is harassment and slander of me.  It violates YouTube's harassment policies and pushing me to the point of needing to sue.  Just giving you official notice.  Ah, yes, the elephant in the room.  The lawsuit threats.  I mean, how many years have you been doing this now?  Are you pretending not to understand what a parody is?  Have you ever seen SNL?  You are comparing two parody videos with an entire channel dedicated to falsely criminalize someone for doing nothing wrong.  So yes, not only do you violate YouTube's harassment policies, but you should read up on, but you are also very, very deep in slander, which is an offense worthy of suing.  Connect me to your legal team.  It's amazing what people come up with when they are in your shoes.  You know what parodies are, you know they are legally protected, and you know that this is harassment slash slander.  It's amazing what people do for money, but thankfully I can simply sue and make an example of Chris Hansen.  A few legal topics, and Onision sends stupid dictionary laws.  You, your team, are in for an open-closed lawsuit.  You have falsely reported us to the FBI for things that never happened.  You dedicated your entire channel to harassing myself and my spouse.  The real only option for you now is to issue a public apology, remove your videos, but if you decide not to, that is your choice.  I just got off the phone with a law office.  Please give me your legal team's info.  And just a little math for you, whatever money you have made off your slanderous videos, it does not compare to even your attorney fees.  This is why you don't dedicate your entire channel to ruining innocent people's lives.  Greg, you said the same things to me that you were going to sue me, that you told me to remove all my videos about you.  Let me tell you a little bit about slander in the legal sense.  Slander is really, really, really difficult to prove in actual court.  Because in order for slander to be slander, the person who is quote unquote slandering you has to know with a matter of fact that what they're saying is not true.  Which means that in court you have to provide evidence that this person is knowingly Lying like they know that they're presenting false information with a malicious intent to hurt you or to lie about you.  some ginormous legal cases with celebrities trying to Sue somebody suing a news article for quote-unquote slandering them And nearly all of those things never go through because those sites, no matter how false something is, they are reporting on what they believe to be true.  And proving it with intent that these people are saying things with an intention to lie or be malicious is just very difficult to prove in court.  And considering that the FBI, as we learned last week, has actually had Onision on file for a very long time and now are even taking... the things even more seriously.  The FBI has actually been watching Onision, according to Chris Hansen, and now the case is much larger due to the certain circumstances that have occurred.  Now this next part is cripplingly sad.  Uh, if you can even end that word with an L-Y.  But, apparently, Onision is on 4chan and he made an anonymous post.  Now, obviously, I don't know if this is him, but there is a little bit of evidence that suggests that this is him.  But let's just go through this and you'll see what I mean.  Quote, Rational human beings.  Different of opinions equals interesting discussions.  Little to no bias.  Stands up for people who need it.  And he says, I'd like to suggest offering your support to Onision.  If you don't know him, now is a great time to check him out.  I personally am a fan of his and have been for years.  Onision has been falsely accused of groom grooms and does groom... And he does groom his facial hair.  For the record, these were lies created by vindictive women he dumped.  Women who are not credible as they openly admit to doing substances and are unemployed and have many other problems.  Most of these same people have contacted him in the past asking for him to reconsider their relationship and he denied them.  Because of Onision's fame, many people try to use both him and his husband Kai.  Chris Hansen, a man who has committed illegal acts and lost his career is also using Onision's name and popularity to benefit himself.  Patreon, a website he was doing really great on and that allowed him to connect with his fans, now only wants to host liberal extremists and SJWs.  If you don't fit their views, they will kick you off even when your claims are proven false.  We know that's not why Patreon kicked you off, Greg, but whatever.  Let's give Onision our support.  Liars shouldn't win.  Another great example of media bias is how they are always trying to claim Onision fans are underage edgelords.  False.  Both Google and YouTube analytics show, and this is where the mistake comes in, show half my audience is 18+.  So, obviously, grammatically, he uses the word my, which implies that, This could be a grammatical mistake, but he refers to himself, which is why people are thinking that this actually is Greg writing this on 4chan about himself, is because he uses the word, my audience is 18+.  How would you know what your audience is unless you're that person who's writing it?  You know, it's like common sense.  They call him the most honest YouTuber for a reason.  He also likes the website, this website I heard, and even more reason to support him.  I've shown Twitter DMs from, I believe, to be sock accounts that are Greg.  Obviously, I can't 100% confirm it to be true, but they talk the same way that he does.  They are recently created.  They say and have the same verbiage and phrasing that the way that he speaks in his emails, but who knows at this point whether this is him or not.  I believe it is.  But if it is him, do you know how sad this makes you, Greg?  You are a sad, sad, sad little man.  In the words of Toy Story.  And your time of destruction is coming to an end, my dude.  So yeah, there you have it.  Thanks for watching this video.  All of my socials are linked down below.  I will see you guys in a few days for the review of Rise of Skywalker.  It's gonna be bad. ",
