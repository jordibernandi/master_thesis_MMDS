I recently visited the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.  to get an up-close look at ancient artifacts from Nebuchadnezzar and get a window into the mind of this infamous ruler who actually played a very crucial role in Israel's history.

In about the year 605 BC, there's a big battle.  Egypt is kind of pushed aside.  He comes to the throne and reigns for a very long period, about 43 years.  And it's during this time that the kingdom of Judah, the southern kingdom, is really struggling.  They're aligning with Egypt.  That doesn't work out.  They don't have a lot of power.  And Nebuchadnezzar is the one who finally comes in and destroys Jerusalem in 586, destroys the temple, takes all the wealth away, takes all the powerful people away.  And it's really the end of the kingdom of Judah. ",

He comes in and that's really where most of the treasures are taken away.  He takes away the royal family.  He takes away all the artisans and skilled workers and takes them off to Babylon in 597. and installs kind of a puppet king, Zedekiah.  Zedekiah, 10 years later, thinks it's a smart idea to rebel, which it really wasn't.  Nebuchadnezzar comes back and just completely lays waste to the rest of the thing.  So he's kind of the character, the individual that Daniel has to interact with and deal with all the rules.  Let's start with the two cylinders.  It's a pretty interesting concept.  So typically when somebody dedicates a building, they're going to want to put their name on it, right?  And so everybody knows who it is.  Well, these cylinders would have these inscriptions written in Akkadian is the language. ",

They were actually buried inside the walls.  So in the corners and kind of spaced along the walls, these cylinders would be buried, not so that the common person would see how great Nebuchadnezzar was, but so that the gods would see how great he was.

We don't know exactly where it would have been in the building, but again, it has an inscription that talks about Nebuchadnezzar's power and wealth and might.  And there are examples, similar bricks known from other sites, but typically a brick would have kind of a pre-made pattern and they would just like a mold and they would press it into the brick and you'd have multiple copies.  Well, this particular brick is unique because it's handmade.  It's a common inscription, but it's a handmade inscription, so it's pretty rare.  And if you can get a good shot of it, it's very complete.  So a lot of bricks are broken. ",
