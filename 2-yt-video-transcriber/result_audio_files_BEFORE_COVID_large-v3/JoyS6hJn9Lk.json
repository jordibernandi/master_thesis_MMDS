            "text": "Now, when people are talking of tibur harvesting, this is what they mean.  Look, these are our tibur going to China.  I'm at the site now.  These are tiburs going to China.  Do we really need to blame the Chinese on this?  They got these payments from our Minister of Agriculture, Forestry.  We've got these things.  Our traditional authorities involved.  It's our government.  Nobody else.  Chinese were given these things and they are taking advantage of our forest.  Do we need to blame the Chinese?  No, no, no, no.  Our country is going to the dogs.  Look at this tree.  Diameter of more than one meter.  Diameter of more than one meter.  Our country is gone to the core.  This is mostly what is called Zabezi Tikokiata.  Okay?  It's gone.  Gone, gone to the dogs.  You can circulate the video.  These trees take years to replace.  And they were cut.  Now they have been trimmed to be packed into containers.  And it goes to... Valves, and then China.  Each month, Sophie Roux prepares herself a cup of Erjiao, a powder well known in China for its purported health benefits.  Drinks, cakes, pills, there are many ways to consume this substance, made out of gelatin from donkeys.  Let me open it to show you.  This is pure lejiao.  It doesn't taste nice.  It's complicated to get because you have to go to a pharmacy and ask them to make it into a powder, or you have to melt a piece.  It's very complicated to prepare.  Sophie doesn't like the taste.  But since it's a high-end product, it's good to be seen drinking it.  It's a sign of wealth.  My father was the one to offer it to me.  He gives it to me every year.  He and his friends offer it as a gift.  A jiao is a lovely present, a health product, so people give it to each other frequently.  It's said to act as a blood thinner, reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and even enhance the libido.  China's economy has been growing steadily for more than 40 years.  The country's development has fostered a burgeoning middle class of some 130 million people.  And it's mostly the middle class that buys products like this.  In Shanghai, specialized shops are flourishing.  Some products are extremely expensive, like er jiao, that can cost up to 600 euros per kilogram.  Inside these offices, nutritionists give counseling over the Internet.  It's a lucrative business.  E-commerce is rapidly growing in China, and when you look on the Internet, you can sell all sorts of Erjiao products.  It sells well.  The most popular product is sold more than 36,000 times each month.  Sales exploded in 2010 thanks to an advertising campaign on TV and the internet.  It provoked new interest in a remedy that had all but disappeared from the shelves.  Ajao is considered a traditional medicine because it can be found in the reference book on traditional Chinese medicines from more than 2,000 years ago.  It comes from communities raising donkeys in the countryside, like in Shandong province or in the southwest.  This is only partly true.  Because of the demand, the Chinese donkey population has been halved, falling by over 5 million in the last 25 years.  So the industry has sought another source.  They found it more than 9,000 kilometers from the office of the nutritionist in Africa.  The continent has become a major supplier.  In Kenya, with its 1.8 million donkeys, we track down a Jiao to this slaughterhouse.  John and his family specialize in selling animal hides.  But before the Chinese approached them, donkey skins weren't a product they sold.  Since 2016, three specialized slaughterhouses have opened in Kenya.  They're all Chinese-owned.  The one John manages kills up to 200 donkeys a day.  The meat is then cut up and packed.  But it's another part of the animal that interests the exporters.  Here we do the removing of the skin.  It goes in a process.  They remove the skin here until it reaches here, where they are now going to remove the red ovals and the green ovals.  We have to remove the skin up to the hooves, and we have to remove the skin even the head.  You see, the whole head.  We are going to remove even the mouth.  They can't lose a centimeter of skin.  With an average price of 8,000 Kenyan shillings, about 65 euros per hide, it's the most valuable part of the animal.  It's the piece needed to make the gelatin for a jowl.  We wanted to film how that's done, but the factories involved are overwhelmingly linked to the Communist Party and refuse to allow cameras.  The only exception, Chinese public television, which was able to film these images.  To make a fresh donkey skin, it takes 99 large tools and 300 small tools.  The whole process takes 80 days.  After the experience of making donkey skin, the requirements are very strict.  The Chinese appetite for er jiao continues to grow.  To meet the demand, manufacturers would need to purchase 10 million skins per year.  But there are only 44 million donkeys on the planet.  In the slaughterhouse storage area, several thousand pieces are ready for export en route to Asia.  Here we use salt, industrial salt, to preserve the skin and it drains the water, it drains the blood.  That is part of cure, curing the skin.  And this now material, it can even take one year without being spoiled.  But John doesn't have to wait nearly so long.  In just one month, he can fill and sell a container of 2,500 skins.  The production rate is so fast, Kenyan donkeys are no longer enough for the industry.  Not far from the slaughterhouses, these men have spotted a business opportunity.  They found illegal ways to supply the animals.  We get them from the Maasai in Tanzania.  We have to go on foot to get them across the border and secretly leave the country.  Once in Kenya, we have to pay a tax.  But it's becoming more and more complicated.  The Tanzanian president wants to curb the export of animals.  To save the species, Tanzania has joined Mali, Senegal and 11 other African countries in banning the slaughter of donkeys.  Kenya hasn't followed suit, but reports of abuse are beginning to add up.  In the countryside outside Nairobi, the trade has become a problem for farmers, who need donkeys for agricultural work.  Thefts are multiplying.  Gerald has had to rent his neighbor's donkey.  I'm just starting to use this donkey, and since I'm not its owner, it doesn't obey me very well.  That's why we have to help it and push it, because it doesn't belong to us.  Our donkeys have all been stolen.  The robbers always use the same tactics.  They come at night, around one or two in the morning, and then come into the stable.  They steal the donkeys and we never see them again.  Today, Gerald has a visit from the NGO Donkey Sanctuary.  Hello, how are you?  I'm here with the veterinarian.  Hello doctor, how are you?  Last week, some men tried to steal his newest animal.  Come inside, I'll show you what they did.  It's from that side that the robbers entered.  They broke this piece of wood, but thanks to this piece of sheet metal, they weren't able to take the donkey with them.  The only proof of their entry?  The knives they had with them to dismember the animal.  Gerald wants to show them to the two men.  This time I heard the robbers and I went outside.  It scared them and they ran away.  They left these knives behind and fled.  We are advising him to reinforce the shelter to keep it more secure.  And that's why now he's thinking of going to an option of putting the stones.  The farmer has already lost three donkeys.  Only one foal is left.  But it's impossible to look after it since its mother has disappeared.  So the donkey sanctuary is taking care of it.  Since Kenya is a staunch defender of wild animals, the NGO veterinarian can't understand why the authorities are doing nothing.  One of the major challenges we have realized is that when you want to exploit an animal for food, you never usually utilize too many of them.  But when you are exploiting an animal for only one part of their body, you realize that you can actually overutilize them.  That is a problem we have seen in whales, we have seen in elephants, rhinos.  The organization has tried to raise awareness among government officials, but so far without success.  We had a lot of petitions.  Over 1,000 people signed signatures, petitioning the government to stop the trade in donkey skin.  So this is the report that came with us to show us what has been happening, and the report covers the year between 2014 and 2016.  During that time, more than 100,000 donkey skins were shipped to China.  The government, which declined to comment on the situation, has taken no measures to protect the animals.  Even to the contrary, according to our information, a fourth slaughterhouse is about to be authorized.  If nothing else is done, the donkey sanctuary estimates that Kenya's donkey population could all but disappear in just about six years. ",
