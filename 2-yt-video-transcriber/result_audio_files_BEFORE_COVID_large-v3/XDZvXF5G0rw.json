It's not just for what they did to my campaign, but it's because of what we're seeing growing at an alarming trend where these big tech monopolies are directly infringing on our public discourse and really on our fair elections.  Because if they can shut down my Google ad account, During that first debate, when I was the most Googled candidate of the night, if they can do that to a sitting member of Congress running for the highest office of the land, they can do that to anyone running for any office anywhere or any person who is speaking with a voice that they may disagree with.  I've been really intrigued by some of the responses we've gotten from this lawsuit, from the chattering class.  From some quote-unquote progressive voices, they say, oh, well, she's just trying to grab headlines.  And from some conservative voices saying, finally, someone's standing up for freedom of speech.  Why the disparity here?  We as a country cannot afford to only stand up and fight for our freedoms when we are the targets.  But when someone else is the target, we turn our backs and walk away.  This is a danger to all of us.  This is a danger to all of us.  Can you imagine if Google's CEO was a conservative Republican who was shutting down Democrat voices that they disagreed with?  Can you imagine how up in arms progressives would be if it were their voices being shut down?  We can disagree with each other, but I will tell you as a soldier that I'm willing to lay my life down to protect the rights and freedoms of every person in this country to speak their voice and make sure that voice is heard.
