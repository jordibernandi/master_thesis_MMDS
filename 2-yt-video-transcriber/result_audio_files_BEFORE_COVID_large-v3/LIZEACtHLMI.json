            "text": "what's up my brothers from another mother title.  this video today is women do not care about your struggles.  they hang out at the finish line and they pick the winners.  you ever see that movie the rock I think was about 15 20 years ago with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage I believe and they're an Alcatraz doing something.  they're trying to overthrow somebody that's got control of the rock at the time.  but anyway the sound bite that really stood out in that movie.  you can find this on YouTube I believe Nicolas Cage says something to Sean Connery along the lines like, I'll give it my best.  And he turns around and looks at me and he goes, your best?  Your best?  You're going to have to do better than your best.  Winners will go out and get the job done and they'll go home and bang the prom queen.  People that say that they tried their best will complain about why they didn't get anything out of it.  Again, I'm butchering it.  Somebody linked that video somewhere down in the comments.  I'll make sure I approve it.  But the point of this video, gentlemen, is women do not care about your struggles.  They will hang out at the finish line and they'll pick the winners.  Now, there's some caveats to that, of course, because somewhere some woman's going to come along and go, Rich, you don't know what you're talking about.  I married my high school sweetheart.  We had 2.1 kids.  He stayed home and looked after the children.  I went to work, and I make $160,000 a year, and we're just fine.  Well, again, there's some exceptions to the rule.  And on a balance of probabilities, you guys all know that I'm right.  And in scenarios where women are going to work and a dude's staying home and she's saying that, you know, I'm doing my best, but he's kind of like, you know, struggling along, trying to do something to contribute, they're not truly happy.  They're going to lie about it, but they're not truly happy.  Either that or their SMV's too low and they're just making excuses.  But back to the point of this video, guys.  On a balance of probabilities, they just don't care about your struggles.  I'm gonna share my own personal story because this one was a very, very hard lesson for me to learn personally.  You guys know, if you've been following my channel for a while, quick subscription break.  If you're new, hit subscribe and the notification bell.  I always share my own stupid experiences in life.  It's really clouding over now, and it's starting to rain.  Hope you guys can hear me okay.  Anyway, a few years ago, around 2014, 2015, my business was transitioning.  There was some legislative changes that really imposed some pretty harsh financial restrictions on it.  And I was struggling.  Like, I'll be honest, I was really hurting at that time.  And I had to make some very tough choices that needed to impose some financial constraints on the business.  Only because of the business that I'm in, payroll is the biggest expense.  I couldn't really put it on my staff.  So I took the brunt of it all.  And there was a period of time for at least a few months where I was the lowest paid employee in the company, which was a brutal shift in that dynamic for me anyway.  Anyway, at that time, I was in a relationship with a single mommy.  Things weren't going the greatest with that anyway.  But I announced thinking I should be vulnerable to her and say that I was the lowest paid employee in the business.  And gentlemen, vulnerability is not a strength.  It is not going to do you any favors in a relationship.  Quite the contrary, it's actually quite harmful.  What ends up happening is women's DNA is hardwired to dismiss weak men.  And the minute that you announce or imply that you're weak, their DNA, their hypergamous nature is going to kick in.  Like, hypergamy can't afford to allow a woman to be around a weak man.  You can't blame them for wanting to monkey branch away from you by tuning into their own female nature.  I mean, this is what we talk about on this channel quite often, is trying to understand the true dynamics of the world.  Quite often this ties into women for a lot of guys because too many of you guys are chasing tail.  If I'm being honest with you, you need to spend more time chasing excellence.  Card up on the top right.  All right.  That being said, back to the point.  They will not care about your struggles.  Do not emote.  Do not behave in a vulnerable fashion.  You know, there's places that you can do that.  You should have a tribe of men that you can do that.  In fact, I'll talk about that towards the end of the video.  But do not emote to your woman.  Solve your problem.  It's expected upon you.  Men have the burden of performance in this world.  Women don't.  You know, they just have to show up and look good.  Guys have to actually perform.  If you demonstrate an inability to perform, you know, to be successful, to deliver, you're going to be dismissed at some point.  You know, that point, that line in the sand may be one place or another.  It may be further on down the road.  If she's got more investments in you, if you guys are married, if it's harder to untie the knot, I don't know.  But... It's not binary.  It's not cut and dry at one point or the other.  Again, like I said, there's always somebody that comes in and challenges me and says, no, no, I'd stick with my guy between thick and thin.  Rich, you don't know what you're talking about.  Between thick and thin, I stuck through him.  Well, in many cases, if you're sticking through him through thin, a lot of thin, your SMV isn't high enough to monkey branch away from him.  So let's be honest, right?  Let's call things as they are, Feldes, and ladies too, right?  Anyway, back to this point.  I'm going to wrap it up on that note.  I wanted to keep this short.  In fact, I think this is going to be the first video in a series that I'm going to do.  I did a quick survey on social media not too long ago, and I asked people publicly, what are the red pill tenants that have really moved the bar, that have been big aha moments for you?  So if you missed that, leave a comment below.  But I've got about six pages of them, 950 words.  It's going to end up being a chapter in my book.  So subscribe to the channel, look for a playlist on this topic, and Last but not least, I mentioned the community thing.  A lot of you guys look for places to kind of run tough ideas up the flagpole.  Card up on the top right, there's a men's community that I've created.  It's a membership base, and there's also access to premium content on there.  that doesn't end up on my channel.  So consider signing up for that.  It's a great opportunity to network with other like-minded men and get access to that group of guys where you're not going to be judged and criticized by your woman.  and potentially leave yourself in a vulnerable state where she might optimize her hypergamy.  Anyway, we'll leave it at that.  Good talking to you guys.  Have an amazing one.  Peace. ",
