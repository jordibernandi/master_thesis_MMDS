            "text": "just about everything we've been told our entire lives is incorrect from diet to sun water and exercise.  the modern culture we've grown up in has reduced our quality of life and for some less fortunate destroyed it.  fat is bad for you.  it'll clog your arteries.  eat your fruits and veggies.  they're good for you.  have you ever stopped to think the opposite?  What if fat was actually good for you and fruits and vegetables were bad?  The fact is, fruits and vegetables actually lack nutrients that are specific to only animal foods.  Animal foods contain vitamins, minerals, elements, and fatty acids that are not found in plants.  The plant forms of these nutrients are not available to the human body as the animal versions are.  Not only that, plant foods contain negative substances such as anti-nutrients that can actually harm the body.  Make sure to put on sunscreen or you're going to get skin cancer.  What if we need the sun?  We obtained our foods out in nature.  There was no hiding behind sunscreen and shades.  Vitamin D from the sun is crucial to both plant and animal life.  Don't salt your food too much, it'll raise your blood pressure.  If salt was so bad, why do animals go out of their way to find salt licks?  Drink 8 glasses of water per day, but then go for a run and sweat out all the salt and water?  How could we possibly drink 8 glasses of water per day without modern plumbing?  Is running really the best form of exercise if hunter-gatherers used to spend most of their day running around?  Don't we have to work a bit harder to make up for sedentary activity?  Have you stopped to think this is all wrong?  Won't you join me as I question modern cultural wisdom in favor of our past, exploring the truth through science, native habits, and logic, how we can perfect our health through everything physically possible.  To look like a Roman statue casted out of bronze.  Hehe. ",
