            "text": "Hallelujah.  this study will focus on investigating why israelites are instructed to wear a particular color on the borders of their garments.  speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue and it shall be unto you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of yah and do them.  when reading these verses there are two questions that come to mind.  why is blue selected as the color to be worn and why should looking at these fringes cause them to remember the commandments of yah?  this color tekelit which varies between a blue indigo and tyrian purple rose to significance several centuries before the israelite tribes inhabited the land of canaan along with the city of tyre.  sidon was the most powerful city-state of ancient canaan and first manufactured the purple dye which made tyre famous.  this dye was so rare and expensive that the purple color became synonymous with royalty.  imperial dyes were produced from the secretions of several species of sea snails one of which was the murex trunculus throughout the ancient near east northern africa and beyond kingdoms and empires in places such as carthage egypt israel greece and rome all held purple-blue garments in high regard as luxury items sometimes valued higher than gold.  the notable association of purple and blue with royalty has remained over thousands of years.  even to-day it remains symbolic often worn by the queen of england and also used as the marquee color of various sports organizations whose names are associated with royalty the sacramento kings the kansas city royals and the manchester monarchs.  the kings royals and monarchs all utilize some variation of purple or blue in the graphic representation of their respective sports organizations.  the purple dashiki is also a symbol of royalty.  historically there are several cultural connections that exist between the ancient hebrews and the canaanite tribes that originally manufactured the purple dye one connection being their language and script and another being their declaration of el elyon as the supreme creator or most high god.  as it relates to their language and script many historians consider the palaeo-hebrew alphabet to be a variant of the canaanite alphabet.  the canaanite script is more precisely referred to as dabarim kananim which means words of the canaanites or canaanite words.  One of the many places the Canaanite script can be found is on the sarcophagus of Sidonian King Eshmunazar II.  These two scripts also bear a striking resemblance to the Moabite script as can be seen on the Mesha steel.  Due to the proximity of these nations to one another, the Moabites were among those who revered the royal color.  Another highly significant cultural connection between these ancient civilizations is that the most high god El Elyon reigned over Canaan and was known among other civilizations throughout the ancient Near East before Abraham left Ur and journeyed to the land of Canaan.  el elyon was recognized as the supreme deity creator of heaven and earth and ruler of lesser gods in the same manner that el elyon was recognized within canaan and beyond.  the purple-blue color that originated in canaan was universally known throughout late bronze age civilizations as being synonymous with royalty.  wearing this color was traditionally reserved for only high priests or rulers.  never before had an entire nation been instructed to wear this distinguished color.  the instructions given to the nation of israel were different than any other and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a set-apart nation.  These are the words which you shall speak unto the children of Israel.  For the children of Israel, wearing and looking at this color is to be a constant reminder that they are to be a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a set-apart nation, and a peculiar people.  wearing tekelit is symbolic of the covenant relationship the most high has with his people.  in modern societies individuals now wear wedding bands as a symbol of a marital relationship.  in contrast during the establishment of the nation of israel the most high adorned his bride with the ultimate symbol of royalty.  You shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of Yah, and a royal diadem in the hand of your Elohim.  This information provides insight to the answers of the earlier questions.  Why is bluish purple selected as the color to be worn?  This color is a long-standing symbol of royalty.  And why would looking at these fringes cause them to remember the commandments of Yah?  For the Israelites, seeing the fringe is to remind them of their vows and their covenant relationship with the Most High. ",
