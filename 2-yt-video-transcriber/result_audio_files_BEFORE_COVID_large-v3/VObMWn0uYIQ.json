            "text": "What's going on guys?  It's Josh with Accountability for All and today we're conducting a First Amendment audit at the Chelsea Police Headquarters located here in Chelsea, Mass.  We're going to see if they uphold the oath they swore to defend when they became police officers.  And we're gonna go inside and take a look.  We're here with Hashtag Hot Tow Truck Girl.  Please click, share, like, and subscribe to her channel, and we'll find out what happens.  Let's take a look.  What's going on?  How you doing?  Can I have your name and badge number, please?  Thank you very much.  All right.  Thanks.  Appreciate it.  We're all set.  Thank you.  There's no unauthorized access.  So this is the Chelsea Police Department community room.  This is probably where they hold their meetings and stuff.  Oh, you know who she is?  Do you, uh, are you guys a fan of her?  She's pretty nice.  You guys are really nice here.  We appreciate it.  Yep.  So have you guys, you've obviously seen our videos on YouTube.  The Winthrop one.  Yeah, they did.  They did.  The police did really great there.  They were awesome there.  So do you, um, do you like what we do?  Do you think it's, I mean, it's your opinion.  Do you think it's, I don't mind it.  I mean, It's the same as a vlogger going outside and just walking around somewhere.  Yeah, because people say like, oh, you know, you hate the cops.  Like, you know, if that was true, we would only put out bad videos, right?  Like we like we put out the videos and they do really well.  And I think that's important so that we can, you know, get rid of the stigma out there.  And we can kind of bridge the gap a little bit to show that, you know, it's important to show the cops that are doing the wrong thing.  But it's even more important to show the cops that are doing the right thing.  I can't believe that's awesome.  That's the first time she was recognized by a police officer.  How long have you been an officer?  Three and a half years.  Wow, you look young.  I'm having babies through braces.  We appreciate it.  Thank you so much.  You too.  Top toe check, girl.  They noticed me.  They noticed you.  It's hard not to notice you.  You're absolutely beautiful.  Aw.  She's beautiful.  Let's go upstairs.  All right, so, I mean... Coming upstairs?  Yeah, like, they were super, super nice.  Well, that's because they knew a hot tow truck girl right off Jump Street.  Let's check out the second floor.  Wow, there's four floors.  I don't think it's going to go.  Oh, I think it's just going to shut.  I think you need the key.  You need the key.  I need a key?  Yeah, that thing right here.  Nope, we're not moving without that.  We're going to stick in the elevator.  Yeah.  I guess this is authorized access.  Let's check the stairs.  No, you need to keep up with the stairs.  You need to keep up with the stairs.  Well, they've created privacy here at Chelsea PD.  They've definitely created privacy.  What's up man?  Officer, can I have your name and badge number please?  Sorry, I didn't see you on the phone.  Could I just have both yours and the other gentleman's name and badge number please?  No, you can just say it.  That's fine.  Thank you very much.  Could I have his as well, please?  What's up, man?  Can I just get your name and badge number, bro?  You're going to write it.  Awesome, brother.  Thanks, Daniel.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate that, man.  You guys are very nice here.  We appreciate your service to the community.  So when I see police stations that don't have sex offenders posted I usually see this sign.  They're part of the Mass Police Accreditation Commission.  So this accreditation commission will accredit certain police stations.  It happens in cities that are really large, where it makes it legal for them to not post sex offenders, but they will give them to you on a request.  But here's the thing.  Say you're moving into 102 Main Street, for example.  and you want a sex offender list for who lives in that neighborhood.  They don't have it.  You have to know the actual name of each offender, request those specifically.  So it makes it super hard to figure out who's in your neighborhood.  I don't like that.  Yeah, that's not, I don't like that either.  Mass State Police Boxing Team presents Battle at the Beach.  Uh oh guys, the fire department is gonna go up against the PD, and you know who I think's gonna win?  Those guys.  In fact, I'd like to ask them who they think is going to win.  That's pretty cool.  That is pretty cool.  Officer Daniel, who do you think is going to win at the boxing match with the fire department versus the police?  Who do you think I'm going to say is going to win?  I'm thinking you're going to tell the fire department that they can get those hands.  They put out calendars, but you guys put out KOs, am I right?  I like the way you think, man.  All right, man.  Hey, listen, we appreciate you honoring your oath, doing the right thing for the community, and allowing us to come in here and film.  You guys are doing some great work, and we appreciate you putting your life on the line to uphold those freedoms for us, man.  Thank you, I appreciate it.  You be safe out there, okay?  So Chelsea PD gets a big pass, big pass.  And this is a city police station.  They have a lot of tough crime here, and they are doing the right thing.  So everyone, please call the Chelsea PD.  Glad Officer Daniel know and the other officers there that we appreciate the work they're doing in the community because those are the good cops.  Those are the cops doing the right thing.  What's going on, guys?  And we appreciate them doing the right thing because it isn't easy.  This job isn't easy.  And we come across some really bad cops.  And I think it is imperative and it's fundamental to our freedom and to our safety that we bring awareness to the community of who these bad cops are.  But I think it is even more important and even more fundamental that we bring recognition to the good cops.  Because it's bad cops like tyrants that get good cops like these guys in trouble.  The word officer safety is brought about because I think more so than citizen action, it's bad police action that gets these guys in these situations.  So let's let the, you know, we'll complain about the bad cops.  Let's compliment the good cops.  and let them know that we appreciate the work they're doing in their community, especially a community like Chelsea, guys, because they're starting to have some change in the sense that the housing development's getting nicer.  Like, everywhere has a lot of bad neighborhoods, but Chelsea has a lot of bad neighborhoods.  And these guys have a really tough job, and sometimes they need to be a little bit tough.  But to know that they're... protecting our rights, and doing the right thing here in Chelsea, you know, we appreciate that.  And it was a surprise because I got a lot of requests to come check out the Chelsea PD.  And I'm glad they did so well today.  What's going on, officer?  How you doing?  Can I just have your name and badge number, please?  I know you're on the phone.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, what do you need my name?  Yeah, just your name.  I'm Officer Mirza.  Yeah, we just met Officer Daniel.  You guys are really nice, man.  We appreciate what you're doing out there in the community.  Anytime, sir.  All right, man.  Be safe, please.  No problem, sir.  So again, guys, let the Chelsea PD know they're doing a great job.  I'm sure I'm going to be letting you guys know that you're going to have to call whatever police department comes up in the future to let them know that they're, or please do not call them and tell them you're doing a bad job.  But these guys are doing a good job.  You guys are doing a great job.  How's it going, man?  How are you today, sir?  Can I have your name and badge number, please?  1-1-1.  Is that a lucky number?  You hit it.  I've never hit on it.  If I hit, I probably honestly wouldn't tell you that I hit, but I might make a donation to the boxing tournament.  you guys got coming up.  I'll keep the money.  So if it's police against fire, who do you think is going to win that?  Have you seen them guys?  Yeah, I haven't.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, those guys can carry big ladders with zero oxygen.  Yeah, okay.  Because Officer Daniel, we were just talking to him, and he... I was thinking that he might give them a... No, listen.  Age is just a number.  Hey, listen, I want to, you know, we do First Amendment audits, and we bring awareness to what's going on, and a lot of people have this stigma thinking that we, you know, we hate all cops.  I love exposing bad cops, but even more so, I think it's fundamental to bring awareness to the good cops.  I had a lot of requests to do this station, and some people I don't think understand that Chelsea's a really tough city.  And if you have officers in Chelsea, they would have to be more aware of their safety than, say, some of the smaller towns.  And you guys are doing the right thing.  And I appreciate you risking your safety and risking your life to go out there and fight for our freedoms.  So we really appreciate that, officer.  All right.  Be safe out there, okay?  You are on the best side.  All right.  Thanks, officer.  All right, guys, so again, I'm just kind of blown away because with all the stories I was hearing about Chelsea, I thought I was going to get nothing but bad things.  And every single officer has been nice.  They haven't had a problem with my camera.  They're upholding their oath.  You know, I got lots of views exposing bad cops, and I like to find myself some good cops out there doing the right thing.  So we appreciate you staying tuned.  And that's the reason I stopped you today.  Click, share, like, and subscribe to Hashtag Hot Toe Truck Girl. ",
