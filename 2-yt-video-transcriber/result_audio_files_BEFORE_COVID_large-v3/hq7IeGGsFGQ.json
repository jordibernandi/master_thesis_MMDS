            "text": "What's going on, guys?  It's Josh with Accountability for All, and today we're at the Boston City Hall, and we're doing a celebratory audit because Auditing America's Anselmo is in Massachusetts.  He's just hit 90,000 subs.  I just hit five, and we want to make some big things happen, so let's go in there, see if they can respect our First Amendment right and our constitutionally protected activity with Auditing America and Hashtag Hot Tow Truck Girl.  Please click, share, like, and subscribe to both.  Let's take a look.  So, uh, let's take a look.  Let's see.  Let's see if he went back down the right.  I see the metal detector.  Good, man.  Thanks.  I don't know if you can bring me a drink.  Can you bring drinks inside here?  Probably, right?  Alcoholic.  You got some I could borrow?  So, Anselmo, what does that sign say right there?  Well, I don't know, but it says auditing right there.  Auditing?  So, I mean, maybe that's where we need to go.  I think that's, like, our office.  So, I think it's saying auditing, taxpayer, that way.  I need a sticker that says America after that.  Let's go.  Oh, and there's someone over there we can visit.  Auditing America.  Please click share, like, and subscribe.  Let me tell you something.  If you don't, that's disorderly, and it's punishable back to one year in the ACI.  One year.  Don't get loud.  It's disorderly, garlic.  Let's see the compo.  He's on his phone.  Oh, the city auditor, the auditing department.  Hi, how are you today?  Could you please tell me your name and your position?  No.  What is this for?  Who are you with?  Myself.  Him?  No.  We don't allow cameras in here.  No?  We don't allow cameras?  Is that a rule or a law?  Okay, so that's the first stop.  Oh, and there's private information.  Maybe they should create some privacy for that.  Hi, do you work at Homewood?  Um, no.  What do you guys do here?  We're the auditing department.  What's your name?  Am I being recorded?  Uh, yeah.  Okay, I prefer not to be able to talk to him.  Why not?  Hold on a second, okay?  Are you guys public servants?  Do you guys work for the city of Boston?  Okay, so you guys work for us, right?  And what does that mean?  Well, that means, well, I don't want to be rude, but, you know, that means we tell you guys what to do.  You don't tell us what to do.  We're just filming.  Yeah, you're telling us where you're from.  Where you're from.  We don't answer questions.  Okay, well, we're not going to answer questions.  Well, you do because you're a public servant, sir.  Can I please have your name?  What's going on, man?  How can I help you?  What's your name?  What's your name?  I don't answer questions.  What's your name?  We have to call security.  Security?  Why?  Why call security?  Thank you.  We just went into the auditing department and we're just asking them their names and their position and what services do they offer.  He's being extremely triggered over my camera.  Could you please explain to him that we're in a public area and this is the people's building?  Is there no filming allowed in here?  That's what he told me.  It should be okay because this is a public building.  It's publicly funded.  So you guys are public employees.  Let me ask this guy.  Excuse me, officer.  Sir, how you doing today?  Is this a public building?  Yeah.  This is public, so it's not privatized at all?  No.  Okay, because I'm not from this area.  So if this is a public building, then that covers that we're allowed to film here.  There should be no problem with that, right?  Yeah.  Okay, just wanted to make sure, because the auditing department told us that we weren't allowed to film in this building.  Maybe they have their own rules.  I'm not sure.  Right.  What's your name?  Cody.  Cody.  I appreciate it, man.  Thank you very much.  Hey, so that's okay.  Officer Cody just provided a very valuable lesson for you today that this is a public building and we can record what we see in public.  We'll meet you back in the auditing department.  Oh.  Did you just swear, miss?  But that's not professional.  Oh, we're over at the security desk again.  We just asked the police officer and he let us know that it's okay to film here because it's a public place and there's no expectation of privacy in public.  Yes, you can, actually.  Right, but you're in public.  There's no expectation of privacy in public.  This is a public building.  Okay, does he want to come down and talk to us?  Because the Boston police just told us we can film here.  I mean, if he comes down here and he gives me a lawful command and tells me that, you know, we're going to make sure, though, I'm going to double check and make sure the information he's telling me is right.  Here's the thing, though.  That's a request, right?  So if I came up to you and I'm, for example... Yeah, I understand.  I have to take his orders.  That's my boss.  Right, but policy doesn't trump law.  So if he wants to come down here and explain to me what law he's talking about, we can go from there.  Because right now you're just telling me that my rights don't matter.  No, I'm not saying that.  I mean, I'm going by my side.  That's my boss.  Yeah, if you can get him down here, that'd be great.  We'll talk to him.  All right.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, please.  We have to stop filming.  We're going to be exploited.  I hope they did the guy the other day and they're calling your sergeant.  Our rights don't matter here.  Who said they did?  Yeah, we do not allow to film here.  Sir, can I ask you a question?  I don't want to be rude to you, but you do know this is a city hall, right?  You got to talk to my sergeant.  He'll ask me all your questions.  Okay, no problem.  He's coming up.  Are you the sergeant?  No, he's not.  Oh, okay, he's coming up.  He's coming up.  Okay, okay, no problem.  So I guess the lady behind there was saying that we need a release to film her, and this isn't public, even though it's public, but they escorted somebody out by force the other day because they were filming.  That's not cool.  Let me stand over here.  Okay, we'll gladly wait for your sergeant.  I hope he's right about the information he gives us.  This is the people's building, and we have the First Amendment right that protects us against the pressure from the government.  So, filming is a constitutionally protected activity.  Ay-yi-yi.  Ay-yi-yi.  Wait a minute, Blake.  Yeah.  I'm just confused because that's like the Inter-Perimeter Security Management.  The Boston PD told us, Officer Cody told us that this is a public building.  We can film here.  And I actually said to him on film, oh, you know, they said we weren't allowed to film.  He goes, they can have their own policies, but that doesn't change the law.  So even the cop was aware that policy does not trump law.  That's right.  So at least the Boston PD we've seen so far is doing a good job.  Are you privately contracted or paid by the government?  Okay, so you would have to identify yourself.  It should be part of your job.  Well, it's good.  He doesn't want to say the wrong thing because he's not aware of what's going on.  So we'd rather not say anything than say the wrong thing.  That's right.  That's right.  We appreciate you.  All right.  I'm sorry?  Sergeant.  How's it going, sir?  How you doing, sir?  Yeah, so we just came here walking around.  You need to put the cameras down.  You need people's permission to film them.  You do not have my permission.  We already spoke.  First of all, we spoke to the Boston police.  That's not how it works.  You're a private officer.  I'm not a private officer, sir.  I work for the city of Boston.  Okay, well, you should be well aware about our First Amendment rights.  I understand the First Amendment rights, sir.  So we're in public right now.  Okay.  You know something?  You guys want to beat pains in the neck?  Go ahead.  Enjoy yourselves.  You walk into somebody's private office, that is trespassing.  Are they clearly marked?  Does it say no trespassing?  Everybody's office, you can have the public areas, but if you can't walk into an office.  Okay, so why are you lying to us then?  I'm not lying to you.  So why don't you change the story?  Lower your voice, please.  You're being dishonest.  You're being disruptive.  I'm not lying to you.  I'm just telling you.  So my question is this.  If we go into the taxpayer's office, we can go in, but we can't go into their private offices where their desk computers are.  But we can go into the public areas.  As far as I know, yes.  What would you approach us and tell us?  Because people are calling down and complaining that they're being filmed up here without their permission.  Other people have called down to us.  Have you ever heard of freedom of the press?  Are you the press?  Yeah, you are too, man, as soon as you start speaking and using your rights.  I understand freedom of the press, sir.  I've been doing this longer than you've been alive.  No, well, apparently not, because you came over here and gave us wrong information.  I'm done.  Walk of shame.  That's the walk of shame.  Walk of shame.  Well, at least they got educated today, so let's go back to what we're doing.  We're nicer than you.  Yeah.  Hey, listen, man, I appreciate you being nice.  We appreciate you a lot.  We appreciate that you waited for him to come over.  He definitely just did the walk of shame.  Oh, yeah.  See you next time.  That's why we stopped you today.  Oh, he stole my tagline.  Hey, thanks for being so nice, man.  He cleared that up for us.  We're going to keep being American.  And that's the reason I stopped you today.  Walk of shame.  There's a First Amendment rap that talks all about that.  I wish I knew the guy that wrote it.  So do we go back and visit them?  Okay.  So that was the tax assessor's office and the auditing office, and the auditors just got audited.  We had a tyrant.  We had a walk of shame.  We had a bunch of public employees swearing, and we let them know that.  that's the reason we stopped you today.  Stay tuned for the next one. ",
